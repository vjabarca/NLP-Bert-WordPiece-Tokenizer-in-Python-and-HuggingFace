Two other things are critical: colleagues and research. Good teaching can only happen in a supportive academic environment and at both UTS and UOW I have been lucky to become part of passionate academic communities.
I’ve made quite a few career changes in my life: from youth worker, to adult educator, to artist, to journalist, to editor, to manager, to teacher and academic. Through all of that I have in one way or another also been an activist. I believe in helping to bring about change both at the macro and the micro level. I believe both journalism and education matter profoundly in this larger process of change. In the end I hope that my teaching facilitates students becoming more aware of their role in that change process.
Philosophy of Teaching I usually say I became a journalist by accident. I needed money to get me through art school so I started writing art reviews for a friend on a local paper.
Scaffolding Scaffolding has proven a rich metaphor for eductaional theory. Its everyday roots in the building industry immediately communicate images of assisted climbing and a temporary measure that leads to a more solid construction.
Space Space is a verb. It is actively created, not just the static background repository we commonly imagine.
Story Nothing happens without a story. We are the stories that we tell ourselves. If education is anything it is storytelling.
Writing For me writing is both a practical and creative tool: a personal and professional project. I feel driven to write as a means of exploration, experimentation and communication.
Conversation Many of the metaphors of progressive journalism are also apt metaphors of progressive teaching. One of the buzz phrases being used in the new civic/citizen journalism movement is “journalism as conversation”
Resillience We will argue resilience can be taught and that experiential and practice-based learning projects are consistent with both the research findings on good teaching practice and activities and interventions which are likely to promote resilient professional practice
Synopsis: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz and Rupert Everett star in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, a high-spirited romantic comedy that serves up something wild, something new, something touching and something truly hilarious. Roberts dazzles as commitment-shy Jules Potter, who reluctantly realizes she is in love with her best friend Michael (Mulroney). There is just one catch: he's about to marry someone else. Comically crazed and full of devious plans, Jules will do anything to steal him back... except tell him the simple truth.
Please bring these two gorgeous things into my life. Please excuse my materialism, but this bedspread and folding screen door are too beautiful not to mention in prayer.

Now is the time of the first challenges involving new DT blog Scrap-Lifting. Among the works for the first time is also my card.
Admittedly, not much has been happening in the pink bathroom lately. My pretty vanity has been under a tarp and covered in dust for several weeks now. It kind of stalled out with random stuff going on over the weekends eating away our time. It’s so much fun to be doing all the things we have been up to, but it also hurts this homebody’s soul who just wants to finish this project already!!!
Three weekends ago, we were away the whole weekend. I had planned that we would get up the sheet rock over the hole in the wall that Sunday night when we were back. Then I could spend the work week evenings tapping and mudding and sanding to patch the wall. Well… that didn’t happen. Needless to say we were a bit burnt out and just wanted to chill and unpack our bags.
So the following weekend, while I was stuck getting my car worked on, Jordan finally covered the hole with sheet rock. That Sunday I was able to start patching, and doing coats during the work week. However, we of course had to stop to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary during the week, so there was another day nothing happened in the bathroom. Bringing us to last weekend when I still had at least one coat left to smooth things out, and we were super social and barely home the whole weekend… ugh…
Next weekend won’t be much help either since we’ve had it scheduled for two months to go away for the weekend to enjoy a food festival. I’m super excited about out little getaway though! We are gonna have a blast getting away all by ourselves for a change. But at this point, our family is trying to determine who is hosting Thanksgiving and we may have some guests stay at our house and I’m going into panic mode (even though I know Thanksgiving is still more than 20 days away). So this girl needs a break to stay home and feel refreshed in my everyday habitat! You feel me?!
So how have we gotten to where we are now in the bathroom? Last time you saw it, it was looking something like this. We had gotten the new wiring done for the lights.
After that one Saturday, Jordan had it looking like this! Under that piece of sheet rock, he added some 2x4s to secure the sheet rock to. He also added some new “studs” under the area where we will be installing the new mirror eventually so that additional support to screw into. He was able to cut the sheet rock just the right size and slide that bad boy into place, nice and flush with the existing plaster walls.
To patch the area around the one new light fixture we had to hack open, he had to get crafty. He took the original square plaster chunk that was cut out from the wall when the wiring was installed, and used the Dremel to route out the circle of the shallow box. It took some patience, but look how proud he was when he was done!
Next, it was my turn. Outside of patching nail holes and the occasional small hole that I can cover with mesh like I did in this post, I have never had to mud over fresh drywall or sheet rock. So this is all new to me and I have a new appreciation for the pros. There is definitely a little artistry to it! I watched a video before hand on how to tape and mud drywall and found this one to be really helpful. The main take away I had is the importance of feathering out the edges on each coat a little further each time so you aren’t just building up joint compound in the same spot, ultimately raising the surface noticeably.
So I broke out the tape and cut each piece to cover the seams without overlapping another piece of tape. Then I broke out my wider knife for the first coat of joint compound so I could do fewer swipes and try to keep it smoother from the start. My first coat was not that smooth unfortunately. It ended up being more of a “getting the feel for this” coat. You can see on the corner I got a little messy. Let’s just say, I’m super thankful electric sanders are a thing.
After sanding that first coat, I repeated the process for the next coat with the wider knife. But this time I feathered out the edges about two inches passed the first coat. This second coat did go on smoother for me as well. So the second time I sanded, I didn’t need to go as nuts with it to get everything smooth. For my third coat, I repeated the process again, doing long smooth strokes and feathering out the edges passed the previous coat.
This was my last coat of joint compound just before sanding. Look how buttery smooth that looks! The more you work on getting the joint compound to lay smooth when you slather it on, the less work you have to do afterwards sanding… and sanding is my least favorite thing to do.
This whole area above the original hole in the wall had to be re-skimmed as well due to old paint lines and some dents in the wall. I did this very similar to mudding the seams, being generous with the joint compound in the middle and feathering out the edges.
As you can see from the photo above, my mud lines are much wider than the seams I was covering. You can also see how I re-skimmed above the new sheet rock as well, all the way up to the old light fixture hole.
So this hole… we can’t patch it at this time since, low and behold, there is a main junction box in the wall there. In our area, you can’t permanently patch over a live junction box. So for now, we have a removable plate we are going to cover it with that I will paint to match the wall color. But the plan is to remove this junction box and rewire everything when we work on our master bathroom renovation over the winter, which is just on the other side of this wall. Then we can come back in here and patch that hole for good. So it’s not going to look absolutely perfect to start out, but those are the little compromises you have to make from time to time.
So after a work week of mudding and sanding I’m finally done that step! Can you guess what is next? PAINT!
I got two samples of paint and I’m actually surprised with them on the wall. From just the card swatch, I would have gone with Valspar’s Perfection. But on the wall… I actually prefer Valspar’s Adobe Blush. Just goes to show… always get those swatches! Paint them on different surfaces in the space that get different light and see what they look like in sun light and at night with lights turned on.
So I’m gonna be able to start painting now. To try and get this thing wrapped up without an open weekend soon, I’m gonna paint in chunks on the week nights. Still a bit of work to go, but I think I’ve got the motivation of being so close to the finish line at this point! I can’t wait to share this finished space and the new rug I got for this space as well! Thanks for your help on Instagram picking one out! I’m also toying with the idea of getting a short shelf, maybe 4 – 4.5 feet tall in this corner. It’s pretty narrow though, and I don’t want to visually clutter up the entrance of the bathroom, so we will see what I can find. Stay tuned folks! SO CLOSE!!!
Just a girl, her husband, dogs, a home in the making, life and everything else in between. Thanks for tagging along!

[20] —, Norwegian police involved in just fourth fatal shooting in 14 years, The Local, 28 nov. 2016, 14:08 CET+01:00.
Gather ye round, children, for a holiday story of a college football coach, whose public reputation crested with his team's unlikely appearance in one of the more eagerly-anticipated Rose Bowls of our time . . . and whose subsequent decline and fall encapsulated so much of what's currently out of proper alignment in today's college football universe . . .
A friend slipped me the embargoed AP wire version of a story, a couple of days prior to release date. Read it . . . rolled my eyes . . . and eagerly awaited some daily with a voracious appetite for proffering lengthy wire features to run with the ball, Christmas weekend.
The New York Daily News didn't fail me, and dedicated an entire tabloid page to the present state of ex-Northwestern/Colorado head football coach Gary Barnett's career, complete with a charming photo of Barnett and wife Mary, at home.
This wasn't simply a holiday-weekend tale with a murky moral story. . . it was a valentine, love letter and resume, rolled into one, with enough selective fact-disclosure to coax many a guffaw out of any hardened, realistic college football aficionado. What was included - and what wasn't - provided a prototypical snapshot of much of today's big-time-football landscape.
Upon reading this piece, the uninitiated might presume that Herr Barnett is an unparalled football coach, stalwart role model and great American, unfairly railroaded out of the Colorado job due to the crashing end of the Buffs' 2005 season - and the subsequent drawn-out, wholly-distasteful denouement of the case of a Rick Neuheisel legacy, CU placekicker Katie Hnida (no typo - we're talking female, here). Barnett's a helluva coach - but his experience at Colorado is not one of unstinting, reflected glory.
There's much good to be said for Barnett - and as a Northwestern grad, I'll be happy to say it. A former Colorado staffer under Bill McCartney, NU hired Barnett to run the football commencing with the 1992 season. Outside the legitimate national title picture (barring a half-season run atop the polls in the early '60s) for more than a half-century, the 'Cats had been a national punchline for two decades, establishing the NCAA Div. 1-A record for consecutive losses (34). . . which held up until Columbia breezed to 44 straight in 1988.
Like many a worthwhile construction project, this took time . . . but Barnett's a superior recruiter, given a quality product to sell, and laid his style of groundwork during his first two seasons, broadly altering the mindset of a top academic institution inured to gridiron defeat (for a current parallel, think Duke). The observant saw some signs of life in the second half of the '04 campaign, but no others than relatives and close personal friends were quite prepared for what happened next.
We take you to 1995, when the 'Cats opened the season with a straight-up win over Lou Holtz and Notre Dame as four-TD 'dogs in South Bend, in what has turned out to be the final game (at least for now) in that long-sustained series. For any team to follow that up would have been tough, and sure enough, NU proceeded to drop a straight-up decision to MAC stalwart and coaching cradle Miami of Ohio. That loss provided the needed edge and focus, and the Purple didn't lose another -- then they needed Michigan's help in knocking off Ohio State to open the door to their first Rose Bowl experience since 1949.
That Rose Bowl was a helluva game, by any account - an ESPN Classic favorite, even now. Despite their (obviously) infrequent appearances on such a big stage, NU was pounded in the betting market, from +7 point underdog status to a +3 1/2 dog. The moneyline took a parallel beating, as the 'Cats were the darlings of the day. And, oh, the swings. USC ran off to a substantial lead . . . then the 'Cats came back, even assuming a brief, slim, advantage early in the fourth quarter. NU stuffed the Trojan RBs and drove USC QB Brad Otten to distraction. . . but they couldn't stifle USC receiver Keyshawn Johnson, whose every reception was good for either a first down or a touchdown . . . and Southern Cal edged away in the late stages for a 41-32 win.
Take my word for it. . . the '96 team was even better, but in their extreme fat-and-happy state, they somehow lost their opener to an inferior Wake Forest team. . . fell victim to Joe Paterno revenge in Happy Valley. . . and were finally exiled to the Florida Citrus Bowl, where they had the bad fortune to have to face Peyton Manning's Volunteers with a nicked-up secondary. Good night, and drive home safely.
By this time, Barnett - no dummy - likely had gotten the idea that he'd gone about as far as he could go in Evanston, where those pesky academic standards were going to keep him from assembling the kind of defense (especially in the backfield) necessary for a legitimate national-title run in this day and age. And while repeatedly assuring the local troops he wasn't leaving, he eventually spurned a lengthy dalliance with the Georgia Bulldogs, was broadly rumored to have relayed the Fighting Irish (who've long been looking to recapture that Ara Parseghian lighting in the bottle) his regrets . . . and then two consecutive losing seasons just North of Chicago amplified the sense of urgency . . . and, then . . . while Barnett continued to express eternal fealty to the 'Cats . . . Colorado came calling. And the rest, as they say, is history - not to mention a broad object lesson for NCAA football connoisseurs to ponder.

I’m happy to find that you keep writing about walking and inspiring people to be more fit. People usually take their fitness for granted not realizing that by not giving importance their activity level, they might have to settle for inactive life in later years. Keep inspiring, Nihar; you are doing a great job!

On the contrary Somali, I have been bit off track as I was tied up on various work front, I must say mere excuse which I hate to give to myself, and I am desperately looking to get back on track and onto routine, I can see the difference when I am on the regime of walking and when I am breaking that routine…all these findings just converge on the significance of walking as a work out and easy to do and to get great benefits on multiple fronts…good to hear that you are back on your walking routine.
You too have a great week ahead, and this is the budget week, and we have so much stuff to discuss and debate.

Good to know our daily walks or there abouts gives us these bonus’s :-D. Keeping active is important, especially if you have a sit down job during the day.. And the older we get the less we use our muscles, the more they lose their strength..
I was watching a programme on TV only the other evening about exercise, losing weight and what exercise is most beneficial to both body and brain.. And it turned out that after several test experiments.. Dancing proved to be the best that kept both body and mind fit the most.
Also unfit people were given hand weights to lift to test muscle strength improvement.. They were asked to life weights one heavy with one arm and one light with the other.. But to keep lifting each ( seperately ) until they could not lift any longer. Obviously the lighter weight took longer before the muscle tired..
The results, you would think the heavy weight would have improved the muscle the most.. In fact there was no difference in either.. But the people preferred lifting the heavier hand weight because they did not have to lift as long before tiring.
Another experiment as walking for miles,, or doing short bursts of two minutes high energy exercise, like riding an exercise bike for two minutes at full power.. Doing this just three times a week. ( they installed the bike in an office ) And this too proved to have improved heart, weight loss and muscle strength compared to walking miles.. The Ten thousand steps were mentioned..
So while we enjoy our walks, we may also find alternatives that suits our life styles out their to stay fit..

Thank so much Dear Sue for so many new insights and each of the experiments you have mentioned have something very interesting to show to us contrary to our general beliefs and assumptions that many times we have been carrying with us without fully cognizant of the outcomes.
I always thought swimming is one such form of exercise which is holistic in nature, and provides all encompassing aspect of a good mind and body; as you have highlighted that experiment where dancing stands out and why not, it has so much to offer and it has the mind at work while the body is in rhythmic formation.
The other experiment on light and heavy weight also says that how we think and work on certain thing without knowing what impact it actually have on us and on how body structure and why we are doing that exercise, is it really serving the purpose for which we have embarked on an engaged.
I agree we should be choosing one or two out of the array of activities that we have at our disposal and choose a certain that form suits our body and mind than others, and we should get going with the one that gives the best possible result that we have set in to achieve…fitment to our lifestyle is vital and everybody may not have the same frame or the opportunity to do the way that best of two worlds.
Yes it is brain activity that is so important and creative engagement through different brushes and stroked with painting to poetry which you do with such panache…a little doze of walking and form of body movement that can make the mind keep working with ease and grace.
Sue Dreamwalker - February 4th, 2018 at 12:47 pm none Comment author #5553 on Wealth of Health with Wisdom of Walking by Makeup & Breakup
Yes I choose to walk, and I do have those arm weights which I lift now and again.. LOL and I dance doing exercise in my home to music once a week doing Zumba exercise.. Plenty of You tube videos to that 🙂
But since watching the documentary.. I see how making the heart pump in short bursts is beneficial And since my own retirement, I am not as active as I was.. So this suits me better..
You are right, we all have to find that which suits our life styles.. And while I keep my mind active with painting and writing.. My muscles need to be toned too..

So many health benefits of walking…thank you Nihar for making a list! I am sure it is going to inspire a lot of readers who complain about the lack of time.
I don’t know how I knew this but walking has been my closest pal, it seems, for ages. Besides keeping me fit, it has inspired a lot of poems and some of the ideas germinate when I am walking but for creative ideas, you have to walk alone, be in tune with yourself and listen to the subtle sounds of nature. You may walk briskly but let the stream of consciousness flow at its own pace, let the mind wander and introspect…you would be amazed at the soothing effect that both the mind and the body feel through out the day. 🙂

I must admit Balroop that the general experiment that I have been doing on establishing the hidden correlation that exist between walking and enhancing the creative outcomes, and here in our case it has been writing and many of us who are engaged in writing and does so walking with a regime have seen significant benefit and there is growth in the way we are constructively creative.
I can see why you have so much juice in your creativity that comes out profusely in every post of yours, as you have now shared the secret of yours where you have been walking and doing so with passion and there is purpose while we do such brisk walking the bounty of nature and we get our sense beautifully nurtured.

I love how you keep on inspiring your readers about the benefits of walking. This time, you’ve mentioned the useful links to research and studies which successfully prove the point that walking is one of the safest and easiest ways to stay fit and to keep a lot many diseases at bay. Another thing is while going to gym demands a slice of time and money from our regular life, walking does not. That is, we can easily walk a considerable distance while going to our workplaces. If it’s too far away, we can walk half the distance and then, can avail some other means of conveyance. It also saves a few bucks 😀 😀
Jokes apart, most of the doctors now advise walking. My mom’s doc has given it in written on the prescription. I’m fond of walking. The only thing I need while walking is my earphone connected to my mobile. the songs provide me extra energy.

Doctor writing in prescription that’s wonderful, walking is such brilliant way to get the medicine and doctor away from us and doctor doing is s good sign…he must be a family doctor.
These research reports just strengthens the immense benefits one can derive out of walking which we can do and should do, not a bad idea if the office is close by to walk to the office, in fact many are doing and it is changing the way people are adding new perspective to work and not mention of the health benefits.

Indeed nothing can beat the rhythm of walking and when we are in sync we are in symphony with self and the nature around appears in perfect harmony with us. It costs nothing but gives back a whole world of benefits to us. The magic of walking…just that it is so simple and ease to do we take it for granted or don’t attach the required important. Interestingly, all great invention or innovation are the exponent of simplicity and simplifies the complexity, then devolving it as a tool or a technology to automate a simple repeatable thing makes all the difference…walking is one such simple act of our life and can infuse rhythm and harmony in our life.

Gregorian Unfortunately the sixteenth century was a time of severe religious division right across Europe.
In his time it was realised that the calendar had got out of step with the seasons because the actual length of time taken for the earth to orbit the sun was nearer to 365.25 days. So that the same problem would not recur, the rule for leap years was changed slightly.One is the starting day of the year; the other is the rule for working out leap years.In England and her colonies both of these changed to our modern usage in 1752.This showed where the Historical Year 1734 started even though the Civil Year 1733 continued until 24th March.An individual date would be shown as, for example, 3rd March 1733/4 so we are left in no doubt that the date intended was in March of the Civil Year 1733 and the Historical Year 1734, that is, the month before April 1734.As England had taken the year 1700 to be a leap year, the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calendars now amounted to eleven days.

How many email newsletters are you bombarded with every single day? There’s a reason for that. Marketing to an actively interested group of email subscribers is one of the best ways to make money online. There have even been million-dollar businesses built from simple email newsletters like TheSkimm, or Mister Spoils. Each newsletter targets a specific type of user with interesting, daily content, while also partnering with relevant companies and affiliates to bring in extra money. If this seems daunting, it’s not. Tools like MailChimp, Seva (formerly ConvertKit), AWeber, and ActiveCampaign, make it easier than ever to get started with email marketing.
"give unto Caesar what is Caesar's, & give unto God what is God's" Matthew 12:17 Ever read that one? Seriously, you should reevaluate your priorities. You seem to be pushing, (with misguided force I might add) the idea that money is somehow holy. Your faith is the currency of God, & that's what you should be concerned about losing, not your little gold coins. Seriously ok.

Without doubt that was by far the best summary of “Greatest Tips” I have read to date. It is so confusing out there…I want to help my son who struggles with cranky bossy managers to empowering him and havening him live life on his terms. I know affiliate marketing is the way out but where to start?? Do we set up on Shopify and offer other people’s products? Do we set up a blog with a few good links? Do you go to clickbank and peddle the China trinkets etc? Its a tough one to sort but this tutorial was an easy to understand read and you have my word that any of the hosting or other services offered I will use your affiliate link to thank you for sharing your knowledge and your mistakes. Sincerest thanks Tom!

We all know that one must have a good blog or website to start as an affiliate. Starting a website or blog alone can be expensive as you may have to invest money in them (truth be told) but what if you don’t have that? Does this mean you can’t be an affiliate? Of course not, in fact, you can be as good as any blogger even if you don’t have the money. All you need is the opportunity so you can make money online as an affiliate marketer. But the question is, how?
Hi TOM, I have really enjoyed your shared nice piece of content with us. ..Actually, I am thinking to design and develop a mobile comparison website but you know, it’s not an easy job to collect mobiles data. A lot of time and cost is required to build such a website and I don’t want to spend a lot of money as I am new in this field. My colleague has recommended me RevGlue for this purpose as this a UK based registered company and are providing mobiles and its deals data for the UK only with the name of RevEmbed technology as I have read its blog revglue.com/blog-detail/13-setup-free-uk-mobile-comparison-website but I am the little bit confused as its a newborn company. Anyone, have experience with RevGlue. Guide me in this respect. Waiting for your kind response. Thanks in advance.
Its obvious his first language isn’t English but the guy has made an effort to help other people out of his experience. Nunya what you did is bad and you should apologize really. There is power in the words you speak. Putting someone down like that is wrong, like all his effort to put something together was a disaster. I myself found his grammar appropriate and very understandable, I think the person with the problem here isn’t Jafar. Next time if you dont have something better to say, dont comment. If it were to be you in his shoes, am sure you won’t like it either…. Stop the negativity!!
It is a very good idea to use different product promotion strategies so you can figure out what is working and what is not. Try to do split testing and measure the performance of each campaign then take actions accordingly. Changing a few things here and there can increase your profit dramatically. Make sure to place the banner ads on different areas of your site’s pages. Some positions will make the ads more noticeable than others.
Don't sacrifice morals for a quick buck — At the outset, you'll want to do all sorts of things to make money online, but don't sacrifice your morals for a quick buck. Not only will you put people off, but you'll lose Google's trust. You also shouldn't concern yourself with things like Adsense or other ads on a blog before you have around 100,000 visitors per day. Yes, per day.

Consider selling in lots. A lot is a collection of similar items that is sold in a group. For example, if you have a collection of books, magazines or similar pieces of jewelry, consider selling them all at once in a lot. You many not make as much money as you would have if you sold each item separately. However, the items will likely sell more quickly in a lot than they would individually.[29]

HECKLE the movie is about a stand-up comedian who gets stalked by a fiendish Heckler, and ends with a sinister twist. Writer Airell Anthony Hayles says that Dani Dyer is very excited about becoming a true scream queen!
The film is directed by Emmy nominated Martyn Pick and shooting is close to completion, prior to its Halloween release. HECKLE producers wanted to invoke an eighties retro aesthetic, but thread it within a chilling, yet bold narrative that we’ve not heard before.
Dani Dyer is an actress known for Doghouse (2009), We Still Kill the Old Way (2014) and Bonded by Blood 2 (2017). Actor James de’Val, who co-stars along-side Dani as her boyfriend Luke in the movie says – ‘Dani really is a dream to work with. We shared great chemistry on screen which is only possible when you have someone as talented as Dani to act alongside’. Dani is a much loved member of the HECKLE family, the cast and crew will be voting for her to win ‘Love Island’.
HECKLE is produced by UK based company Voodoo Productions, who already have a plethora of feature film and TV work under their belt and a slate of upcoming releases including ‘The Alpha Rules’, a documentary about the The Game, a New York Times best seller by Neil Strauss.

I am working on a pop-up window for the calibration so that the user can input their measured values after they click for their pixel values but I can't get my pop-ups to work. Any advice/insight?
I don't really know what the problem was, but I think the useful solution would be the Text Input Dialog in April's advice. However, don't forget to parseDouble the input, because it will return a String anyway.
Here is another last minute easy Halloween costume idea that you could create with products you probably have on hand. My husband is a big deer hunter, so he was my inspiration for this one.
Using a dark contour stick or bronzer, start building the perimeter by bronzing the outer portions of your face, sides of nose up into the brow bone then blend.
Set the areas that you applied the concealer with a light matte brightening powder to brighten the center of the face even more.
Using a contour or powder brush, heavily (and I mean heavily) apply bronzer around the outer portions of your face again to deepen the color. (You can use brown eyeshadow too if you don’t have a deep enough bronzer)
Fill in your eyebrows with the brown shadow and blend down the sides of the nose. Apply the brown shadow into the crease of the eye and blend. Then apply a white or light eyeshadow to the lid. Blend any edges you may have.
Using black eyeliner create a wing liner and using white eyeliner create an exaggerated white line along your lower lash line ending at a point facing towards the bottom of your nose. Using a fine-pointed brush, draw a new faux lower lash line below the white line you just made stopping before the downward point with the black liner and make little eyelashes on the lower part of the line.
Using black eyeliner, fill in around your nasal tip and down the center line to your lips. Outline the upper lip line and extend the corners outward and fill in the top lip only.
To finish up, take white eyeliner and trace out the circle deer spots and fill them in. Then apply your false lashes (I recommend going bold to create those big doe eyes). If using antlers anchor them to your head.
In need of a last minute Halloween costume idea? Here is a quick and super easy way to create nasty scars to your face (or body).
Rigid Collodion– Is a clear liquid that puckers the skin as it dries, to create the appearance of a scar.
Apply a thin layer of Rigid Collodion on top of the scars. For deeper scars, apply several coats after each previous one has dried.
To remove simply peel off like a sticker and remove any residue with spirit gum remover or soap and water.
How many Walking Dead fans are out there? I’m definitely one!!! When Mack and I first moved up to the D.C. area we binged watched the first several seasons of TWD on Netflix. You talk about having some wild nightmares….So in celebration of season 8 starting back, I’m bringing you a two part “how to” zombie post.
But first you have to start with the dreaded zombie bite and here is a simple way on how to create one.
Start by ripping a paper towel in half. Then line the edges of your upper teeth with lipstick and bite onto the paper towel and create a bite mark. Repeat with lower teeth. (This doesn’t taste the best but it creates a realistic bite mark.) Rip the bite marked paper towel into two small pieces.
Apply a thin layer of adhesive to the area you want your bite to be and press the paper towel onto it.
Allow to dry and apply another layer of adhesive. Rip up more small pieces of paper towel and apply over the bite. Allow to dry again. (You may have to go in with the lipstick or red paint in between layers to keep the teeth marks prominent.)
Repeat the process a few times to build up the bite. Use a hairdryer on the cool setting to speed up the drying process.
Once you get the desired thickness of your bite, take a spatula knife or something that you can hole out the teeth marks with (very carefully, please don’t stab yourself).
Apply foundation or concealer the same color as your skin tone over the bite mark to blend into the skin. Then fill in the teeth marks once again with red lipstick or paint.
Now the fun part…time to add the bruising and infection. You can go in any order, just start stippling brown, purple, and red shadows all over the bite for the bruising. Once you finish that, alternate between yellow and green and add the infection portion.
I wanted to do a different take off of the pop-art comic character I did last year, but make her into someone who was a childhood hero of mine. Wonder Woman has been done to death this year, so I chose to do She-ra. Nothing against Wonder Woman (I loved her too), I just wanted to do something different and I haven’t seen She-Ra anywhere.
Growing up, I had a She-ra doll and her winged unicorn, Swift Wind. I played with those items ALL the time and couldn’t wait to have long blonde hair, which is probably subconsciously why have long blonde hair today.
She-ra’s headpiece (can hand make or buy one off Amazon or Spirit Halloween stores). I handmade mine with thick watercolor craft paper.
For the headpiece, I stenciled it onto a watercolor paper (a rough, thick & sturdy paper) by looking at a reference photo on Google. Then I cut out the shapes and painted it with my yellow face paint and ran a black eyeliner pencil over the markings (I’d recommend a sharpie or black paint. The pencil didn’t work all that great. It smeared and was choppy).
Apply a taupe eyeshadow color to the eye lid. For outlining, you can go in any order you prefer but I like to start at the top and work my way down all the major features with black liner or paint. (Eyebrows, eyes, lash line, lashes, nose, cheek contour, around the jawline and collar bone.)
Use either white eyeliner or white paint to create a white line along your lower lash line. Using a fine-pointed brush draw a new faux lower lash line below the white line you just made with the black liner or paint and make little eyelashes on the lower part of the line.
Apply red lipstick as a lip base, then use white to give a highlight to the lip. To finish the lip, outline in black liner.
For the sides of the headpiece, I applied lash glue to the sides and held to my temples until it dried. Then I taped the back of them with scotch tape to my face for extra support.
I outlined the shape to the forehead piece with a white eyeliner pencil and filled it in with yellow paint then filled the circle on the piece with red paint. Then outlined it with black paint.
Same for the neck choker. Outline it with white eyeliner and fill it in with yellow paint. Afterwards, outline it in black paint.
For the bodice I traced out the heart shape neck line with the white eyeliner and drew the wings on the corners. Filled in the bodice with white paint and the wings with yellow. Then outlined everything with black. This part is technically optional bc if you’re wearing this to a party, you’ll more than likely be in a costume and not strictly in body paint.
I ended up changing the shape of my chin outline last minute. I had a line across it but decided I didn’t like it so made it into a small vertical line.
AAAAHHHHH! Do you ever have nightmares? Well this post won’t help! This is probably the scariest Halloween look I’ve done so far, and I had a $h*t ton of fun doing it! Keep reading to see how I transformed myself into a flesh eating monster.
Using an eyeliner or whatever you have on hand, draw the shape of your mouth, extending down the neck onto the chest.
Rip up strips of a paper towel and roll into cylinder shapes and working in sections adhere around your mouth using liquid latex or glue. To do this, lay a thin layer of the adhesive around the perimeter of the mouth and press the paper towel into the latex. Be sure outside edges are smoothed out but they don’t have to be perfect for this look, since you’ll be adding blood. Once the area is dry repeat the process but don’t roll the paper towels. Allow jagged edges of paper towel to hang towards the inside of the mouth area. Apply latex on top of paper towel and allow to dry. This gives it that skin like feel and texture.
While the latex is drying, you can add black shadow around the face to dirty it up or contour it however you want.
Once the mouth area is dry you can go in and rip off any excess paper towel pieces if you wish. I tore some of mine off because I didn’t want too much skin flap around the sides.
Fill the inside of the mouth with black face paint and heavily set with black eyeshadow, as face paint creases easily.
To apply the nails to the face, dip the ends in liquid latex and apply a small amount of cotton from a cotton ball to the end. (This gives it something to hang onto when you apply it to the face). Allow to dry slightly and apply more latex to the cotton then apply to paper towel. Hold in place for a few seconds until secure. Add more liquid latex around the teeth to create the gums. Rip off more small pieces from the cotton ball and apply to latex and add more as needed to cover the cotton. Not only does it give the mouth gross textured gums, it adds extra hold to the teeth. Allow to dry completely. [Sidenote: If you’re using Elmer’s this may not work as the glue may not be strong enough to hold. You’d have to hold down twice as long to allow it to try. I’d recommend lash glue as an alternative]
Apply green and yellow face paint to the teeth to give them a rotten effect. You could also leave them white.
Stipple fake blood around the mouth and any areas on the face you’d like. I wanted to use coagulated blood to give it more of a clotted deeper feel. As if the monster had been chewing on flesh. I applied it around the torn paper towels, around the gums and made tears and blood drips out of it.
You could do this whole look with paints only to give it a more cartoony look. Draw the mouth out, then the teeth and paint in the teeth before filling in the mouth with black paint. Then add your fake blood if you choose. Red lipstick would work too.
Here is an easy tutorial on how to give the illusion of missing or gouged out eyes. Perfect for Halloween or to freak your friends and family out with.
I love doing these type of special effect makeup looks. It’s really a fun way to be creative and pushes me outside the box.
Apply a layer of glue from the glue stick on the brows and brush upward. Allow to dry. This will help protect the hair from the adhesive in case you get any on the brows. (I’ll just say ouch).
Rip up tissue in several small jagged pieces and be sure there are no straight-edged pieces. This will become the damaged skin around the eyes.
Cover eye area with black face paint or gel eyeliner. You could do this after applying the tissue but I found it easier to do first. (Be sure to not bring it too high up or down so the adhesive will be able to stick to your clean skin.)
Apply a layer of Elmer’s glue or latex around the eye area. If you are using latex, be extremely careful because it does contain a bit of ammonia and can cause your eyes to burn and water. And watch those eyelashes!!!
Stick down ripped tissue pieces, one at a time around the eye area. Once it dries down a little apply another layer of adhesive on top of the tissue and smooth it around the outer edges with a spatula, popsicle stick or sponge. (DO NOT GLUE IT TO YOUR ACTUAL EYE/LID/LASH AREA!) Add another layer of tissue and allow to dry down. Repeat 2-5 times, depending how thick you want your wounds to be. I applied about 5 layers.
Once adhesive is completely dry, lightly tug on the “skin” around the inside of the eye socket area to give it that loose hanging damaged look. Go back in with the black face paint or liner and cover up any blank spaces around the eye and set with shadow.
Apply foundation or concealer over eye area to blend into the skin and can apply to the rest of the face if you wish.
[Sidenote: If you’re doing both eyes and are going to a party, you can glue a black mesh across the eye before you apply the tissue, so you’ll be able to see somewhat. Might be hard to walk around with both eyes shut]
I am all about the scare and gore at Halloween time. Would you wear this gory eye look? Or do you prefer more glam type looks?
“I met him, fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding; and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes… the devil’s eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy’s eyes was purely and simply… evil.”- Dr. Sam Loomis
I couldn’t do a Jason tutorial without doing a Michael Myers one! He’s the BEST scary movie slasher villan that’s ever been. I don’t care what you say. I have seen Halloween so many times I’ve lost count. Every year my sister, best friend and I used to have a Halloween movie marathon and we’d watch them all in a row. Michael is the one that always has scared me. My dad used to torture my sister and I with a Michael mask when we were younger. Now my husband does, go figure. Here is my tribute to Michael!
Cover eyebrows with a glue to stick to block them out. (Optional-it hides the hair but gives the skin a nice “mask” texture.) To see how click here.
Shape out circles around the eyes for the eye holes and neck line for the “mask”. You can use any eyeliner you have on hand.
Generously set with powder. I set my face with baby powder first, then applied a white eyeshadow over that to make the mask as opaque as I could.
Fill in eye holes with black paint or eyeliner. Set with black shadow. Face paints crease really easily so be sure you set it with a heavy coating of shadow. Lightly shade bottom of the neck by tracing a thin line around perimeter.
Now for the shading….Start with the basic contour steps, using a contour or powder brush, lightly blend gray eyeshadow around the hairline, hollows of cheeks, jawline and down the side of the neck. Then shade in the eyebrows, down the sides of the nose, nostrils, down to the upper lip, chin. Be sure to start with a light hand and then build up the color.
Using a tapered eyeshadow brush, lightly with a mix of gray and black shadow shade in the U’s of his cheeks and blend into the contour. Go back over all the shading with the darker shade and blend out. Crinkle your forehead and blend gray shadow into your own wrinkles and shade the outer rim of your lower lip. This is helping create the lines and texture of the mask.
For extra details, take a small eyeliner brush and outline the bottom of the brows, under the eyes and outline the upper lip line with black eyeshadow. Michael has a very straight upper lip so try to keep the outline as straight as you can till you get to the corners then slightly flick up. Fill in with black paint or liner.
For extra measure go through and shade all areas one more time. If you prefer that is, I am a fan of the dirtier Michael mask vs the stark white one.
Dr. Sam Loomis, was named after a character from Psycho, who played the boyfriend of Jamie Lee Curtis’ mother, Janet Leigh. (That was killed in the film’s famous shower scene).
What is Friday the 13th without a little bit of Jason Voorhees? Which means, how could I not celebrate this day without recreating the mask?! Right!? Any Friday the 13th fans out there?
If using a bald cap, slick hair back with gel and tightly braid or pin as close to the nape of the neck as possible. Be sure skin is clean and fit cap to head. Trace around your ears and cut away the excess. Roll back the edge of the cap and apply spirit gum or adhesive to skin in the shape of the cap. Allow gum to become tacky and press the cap down into place. Smooth out the edges of the cap, and allow it to dry for a couple of minutes. Apply more spirit gum around the seam to help strengthen and hide the seams of the bald cap. Allow to dry.
Apply white face paint over entire face (except eyes) and up onto bald cap in the shape of a hockey mask. Set with powder.
Draw the mask’s straps by outlining them out with eyeliner or black face paint on either side of the face right above the ears, and another in the middle of the forehead straight back across bald cap. If you’re not using a cap, just draw it up into the hair-line. Fill in straps with black paint, shadow or eyeliner.
Very carefully draw in the black circles of the mask as symmetrical as possible. The easiest way I found to this, was by dipping the cap of my eyeliner pencil in the black face paint and making a stamp out of it. I then stamped it all over my face and filled in the circles with black face paint.
Fill in the eye circles with black face paint or eyeliner and set with black eyeshadow to keep from creasing.
You could stop there, but I stippled black, red and brown face paint onto the scalp, down my neck and chest to give him that dirty look.
Had to throw in a little dark humor here. Michael Myers is actually my favorite slasher character and I just so happen to have a head lying around…. Who do you think would win in a fight?
My sister came to visit me a few weeks ago and we decided to turn ourselves into Pennywise (click here for that tutorial) and Jigsaw. We were trying to decide what other vilan we could do, besides Pennywise, when we discovered a new Saw movie was being released this month. It made perfect sense to add Jigsaw in the mix. We had a blast doing this together, we were freaking each other out while laughing our heads off at the same time. The dogs were even freaked out, they were barking and growling. It was definitely one of my favorite sister nights.
Cover eyebrows with a glue to stick to block them out. (Optional-it does hide the hair and helps the face paint blend in better.) To see how click here.
You could skip these next two steps and just paint eyebrows/cheeks straight onto the face but we wanted to give it more of a 3D look. Lay down a layer of glue/latex above the eyebrows and shape a cotton ball into fluffy shaped brows and place on top of the adhesive. Apply a layer of glue or latex over the brows to seal cotton and hold in place. Allow to dry. Set with powder.
Repeat steps for the cheeks. Lay down a layer of glue on the apples of your cheek and shape cotton balls into a circular ball and place on top of the glue. Apply a layer of glue or latex over the cheeks to seal cotton and hold in place. Allow to dry. Set with powder. [Sidenote: Start by shaping the cotton balls into the shape you prefer. I couldn’t shape them after I stuck them down so they ended up being more marshmallow shaped than I wanted].
Paint entire face and neck with white face paint (leaving eyes blank) and generously set with powder.
Using the red paint, draw and fill in circles on the center of your eyelid for Jigsaw’s eyes and set with red eyeshadow. If you don’t set it, it will crease quickly.
Fill in rest of eye area with black face paint and a small pupil in the center of red eye. Set with black shadow.
Slick hair back with gel and tightly braid or pin as close to the nape of the neck as possible and put on the black wig.
I love Stephen King and have a general love for horror movies. The original It movie made me terrified of clowns when I was a kiddo (still not a fan), so it made sense to dress up like one, right?
Cover eyebrows with a glue to stick to block them out. (Optional-it hides the hair and helps the face paint blend in better.) To see how click here.
Apply white face paint over entire face and up onto bald cap. Generously set with the colorless powder.
Stipple gray and black shadow around forehead, temples and lightly around face to dirty up his skin. He has crackle like skin so I added a few squiggles around the forehead and smudged them out with gray shadow.
Since the new Pennywise doesn’t have the typical circular nose, I flared my nose out and applied the red paint to the sides of my nostrils and and across the tip.
With that same red paint, slowly draw on those iconic smile lines being careful to make them as even as possible.
Pop in your scary teeth and hair spray his hair out and up. Pennywise does have a widow’s peak but I didn’t want to cut the wig in case I use it for something else. You could cut a chunk off the back and glue the hair in the center of the forehead against the wig line to form the peak.
Halie came early, took her time and my hair and makeup turned out PERFECT!! Its lasted all through the next day looking just as good as when she did it!

During the first week of August 2011 I drove the truck to the Oklahoma panhandle to visit the highest spot in the state, a place called Black Mesa. It is near Black Mesa State Park, where I camped for three days. It was hot and windy but pleasant---at least most of the time. My tent held up to the winds just fine, but the crazy heat---107 at one time---sapped my energy and my appetite. Mostly I simply sat in the camp chair and read a few History books. This was not a bad way to prepare for the coming school year, all things considered. I hiked a bit, but one can see all there is to see in two hours or so of walking. The park was full of deer and other critters, and coyotes yapped at night. Drinking water there was a plenty, as well as showers and shade. Next year I will visit again, as the park is only a few miles from the New Mexico border. The scenery as you drive into New Mexico is marvelous, and some 4 hours later you will be in the Carson National Forest.
...well, on extended cable. The Science Channel - known for their hard-science programing, narrated by Morgan Freeman, and some middle-aged Japanese professor - has picked-up the long canceled sci-fi western. I could still watch it on Hulu.com, but my vid-quality sucks, and I can't play all the episodes there (one or two of their episodes are damaged or something).
If you can't tell, I really like that show. It was like Joss Whedon read Han Solo at Star's End ten times, with some white-knuckled westerns in between (or something like that). Even if you don't like his other shows - like Buffy or Dollhouse - he is good for dishing out interesting characters, as well as good character developments and interaction. The local environments are colorful, the ship has a nice lived-in feel, lots of moral ambiguity, and it has the sort of western-styled pioneer environment that I like in a good sci-fi.
The FOX network where fools for crushing this show. It was the first meaningful sci-fi program in a long time. They hated it, sabotaged it, and did their damndest to kill it before it could even develop even a small following! It was the sort of "space western" that got me into classic Star Trek and hoped for in Enterprise, and the sort of roguish cast that made Blake's 7 interesting. Star Trek: The Next Generation had a lot of fans - even fans who go as far as to make the show's overarching ideology their personal philosophy - but they can keep their happy-go-lucky future world! It is a universe divorced of our human nature. A culture that enjoys Shakespeare, but could never truly appreciate his works. That is the cheerfully optimistic world I wash my hands of! The FOX network pride themselves for being the "edgy network", but that was a long time ago, and they no longer have the vision or foresight to see 1 inch from them, nor 1 second ahead. Their executives maybe the poster-boys for German-styled eugenics, that ruins anything they touch, but those bastards can't take the sky from me!

...The day started with the pouring rain, "not good" I thought, while I was loading the car preparing to go to the fair. I have been looking forward to exhibiting at this fair at Battersea Arts Centre in London for a long time. I knew the interior of the building very well as a few years ago I did a photo shoot there. What I particularly like in this type of event is the feeling of comradeship amongst the exhibitors. For a few hours you're part of a very big family.
Amelia, the mastermind behind the event, is particularly organised and her marketing strategies are very effective. I'm very pleased to say that despite the dreadful weather (wet, wet, wet!) the Sunday was a happy buzzing experience. I truly admire the effort that everybody puts in, to create an eye-catching stand. Yes, very inspiring indeed. Difficult to remember everybody's name or company, but visually the fair was a real feast.
A big "Thank you" to my dear friend Louise from Gingham Hearts for lending me her flamingo. The real star of my stand. I also need to thank Jo from Josy-Posy for her fabulous flower composition particularly the garland. Last but not least, Lauren from French Made for her beautiful cake, and for driving two hours to deliver it.

Paola De Paola is an alternative and same sex wedding photographer in London, specialising in warm, intimate and evocative wedding photography. All images on this website are property of Paola De Paola Photography.
In me, you’ll gain an experienced wedding go-er, someone brilliantly connected to the wedding industry and an expert who knows exactly how to navigate a wedding day. Beyond this, you’ll gain a friend who really, truly and genuinely cares about making your experience the very best that it can be.
I’ll delve into your personalities to find something unique to the two of you, and plan your engagement around a meaningful element. Maybe the park you love to hang out in together? Perhaps your favourite hobby? It’s time to think creatively! We’ll plan the shoot together, sharing ideas and inspirations to get the very best from your session. On the day we’ll meet for a rich coffee (and perhaps some cake?) before we head off to spend some quality time together and take a set of stunning portraits. A beautiful opportunity to relax, get to know each other better and get you comfortable in front of the camera, leaving you relaxed and perfectly prepared for being photographed on your wedding day.
After about 30 seconds of speaking to Paola, we knew she was the wedding photographer for us. She is such a warm person and has such a passion for her work and for making sure that the whole wedding day is a beautiful, amazing experience. We immediately felt that we had found a friend and we knew that she would be just perfect for our wedding. Her personality, passion, flair and skill just make her the perfect wedding photographer and she is so dedicated and meticulous
I aim to spoil my clients and make them feel completely cared for from the get-go. I want to be remembered for big hugs that come from the heart, irrepressible energy and a genuine excitement for your wedding. An adventure that’s informal and relaxed yet with proper through behind every last detail, elevating your experience and photography to something extraordinary.
Together we’re going on a beautiful adventure. There’ll be hugs, lots of them, and tears probably, too. Come with me! We’re going to have so much fun together.
Paola is not just any wedding photographer. When you hire her you’re getting a photo journalist who’ll document everything you don’t expect or think about until after the wedding day. She’s endlessly up beat, helps keep you calm on the big day while not getting in the way. Best decision I made for my wedding (other than actually marrying my husband!)
Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the new federal estate tax system “exempts” from federal estate tax, all estates under $11.2 million for each decedent, meaning that a married couple could have an estate of $22.4 million and not incur any federal estate taxes. This higher amount means that most estates will not be subject to federal estate tax. These amounts will be subject to increase, based upon increases in the Consumer Price Index; however, the amount “sunsets” after 2026, and the amounts will be reduced by half. The good news is that many estate plans can be drafted with little regard to federal estate taxes in some states. The bad news is that residents of Illinois are subject to a much lower threshold and may need to examine their estate plans in light of the Illinois thresholds.
Illinois taxes all estates in excess of $4 million AND, if not structured properly, both spouses may not be able to take advantage of the full amount. While federal law generally permits a surviving spouse to “use” any unused exemption amount of their deceased spouse, Illinois does not permit this. For federal tax purposes, if one spouse dies with a $6 million dollar taxable estate, then under some circumstances, the surviving spouse may use his or her own exemption of $11.2 million, plus the “unused” $5.2 million of the deceased spouse.
“Typical” estate planning has often maximized the federal exemption amount on the first spouse to die by putting that into a segregated trust while leaving everything else to the surviving spouse. If you have not looked at your estate planning documents, you should do so immediately. Under the “typical” plan, the surviving spouse is often only entitled to receive income from that segregated trust which holds the maximum federal exemption amount; principal distributions are based upon need. Thus, the surviving spouse may not be able to access principal of the decedent’s estate without establishing a need. And to make matters worse, if that trust holds more than $4 million dollars, then there will be liability for Illinois estate taxes upon the death of the first spouse.
If you have any questions about your estate plan or how federal and Illinois estate taxes affect your estate planning, please call or contact:

So now that I have finished with my all Gold Coast Show entries I had some time this weekend to work on some of the many outstanding projects I have in my craft room. The main project is to actually re-organised the craft room but that isn't anywhere near as fun as creating new projects. Back in June I signed up for an Collage Layering online class at PaperStories, which is owned by the lovely and talented Georgia Heald. The kit comes with materials and instructions to create two LO's, I have only made the first one so far.
I really liked playing with the paper strips, then gessoing, stamping, misting and washi taping the background. Isn't that sunflower coloured mist just divine? I like the effect of the gesso over the paper to blend it all together so I might try that again on another LO.
This is the last LO I created for the Gold Coast Show. This year there was a special category of 'Teddy Bears' so I've chosen to do a LO about The Freedom Trail in Boston which Ben and I spent a day exploring earlier in the year. I took photos of out teddy, Boofle, at a number of the stops, so this LO features those photos. One of the judging criteria is originality so I'm not sure if this will score highly or if the judges will think it not appropriate for the category.
You can see I have used a photo copied map of The Freedom Trail as one of the background papers. I have marked the photo stops on the map which correspond to each of the photos. I have also popped removable journalling cards behind each photo. I was initially going to put information about each site on the cards but figured I could look that up any time I wanted so I have recorded my thoughts and memories about each site.
I have used the word 'explore' in my journaling, so I will also enter this LO into the current Bird is the Word challenge.
I started this LO with a pretty solid idea of what I wanted it to look like, but the LO itself had a totally different idea. I ended up modifying the design so many different times but I really like the end effect. The pearls on this LO are actually all from a single flourish by Flourish with a Bling. Again, I really love their product and am so happy to have won a prize pack a while ago so I have a fair number of their products in my stash.
Lastly, you know how I was complaining about the craziness of deciding to have so many fussy cut elements on a double LO which had to be completed in 1.5 days? Here is a close up to show that I fussy cut each flower in the embellishment cluster in each corner! I created a wonderful depth to the finished product though so I think it was worth it.
If it wasn't for the last minute I would never get anything done! The Gold Coast Show is starting on the 31st and all entries had to be submitted on Saturday 24 August. My deadline was even closer, as I traveled to Melbourne over the weekend so had to finish all my entries by Wednesday 21st so I could give them to my friend to hand in on my behalf.
I got this one finished on the Monday night. It's another LO about the Color Run I took part in earlier this year. The photos were so colourful and fun I just had to do another LO about it. I've used the Kaisercraft Hopscotch range with a bit of fussy cutting because when you have to make two double page layouts in three days who doesn't decide to go with fussy cutting? :P
I have used a couple of different mists over the background the create a bit of a messy look to mimic the powder we had thrown at us during the run. 'The Runbows' was our team name, hence the title of the LO.
Scrapmatts news chipboard arrows were perfect to create some extra movement in this LO. I was feeling like the previous doubles I had created for the Show this year were just too linear so I went for something a bit more fun and organic with this one. It's probably still a bit simple to place in the competition but I really like it and that's what matters.
This layout is another one created for the Gold Coast Show, this time for the Wedding category. I actually completed this one back in late July, early August but wasn't 100% happy with it.It's been sitting around my craft room since that time but I can't figure out what else I want to do it with it, so I'm just going to call it done.
I think this main photo is one of my favourites from the whole wedding, we just seemed nicely relaxed. I have used some stunning new flourishes from Scrapmatts as embellishments on this LO. Looking forward to a chance to use them again soon.
It's never too early to get started on making Christmas cards and they are so easy to make using the great Christmas chipboard designs by Scrapmatts.I was able to whip up this set of three using some kraft cardstock and Kaisercraft mini paperpad.
With Father's Day coming up in Australia on the first Sunday in September, one of the DT challenges this month over at Scrapmatts was to create a Father's Day themed project. I chose to combine this with one of my Gold Coast Show entries for the Heritage category so this LO features a number of different photos of my dad as he grew up.
Scrapmatts have a number of lovely clock pieces of chipboard so it was easy to use a couple of these to show time progressing. I have covered the flag banners with patterned paper and buttons, plus used a scalloped piece to form my bottom border.
Lastly, I couldn't go past using some of the Scrap Words as a finishing touch. They really do suit every project!
I have been going through a massive creative slump lately with no motivation to create any layouts, despite a pressing need to get to work on my entries for the Gold Coast Show. Last weekend I also needed to create a project for the August challenge over at UnstampaBelles which is 'Paper Dress'. At first I was confused by what I could create and then thought 'I have the perfect stamp for this' before remembering that the whole point of UnstampaBelles was that no stamps were used! :P I eventually settled on attempting to create my first ever piece of She Art.
I had a 7" x 9" canvas sitting around so decided to use that as my base. I couldn't find a tutorial so just looked at a couple of samples I liked and went from there. It was so much fun to have no right or wrong way of going about it and no real idea of what the end product would end up looking like.
You can see in the detail show above the raised effect of the texture paste. The whole background has a lovely shimmer to it from the Glimmer Mist, and I've popped rhinestones in the centres of all the rub on flowers. The quote is by Ralph Waldo Emerson, most of my favourite quotes are from him.
Anyway, I would love to see what you create for the Paper Dress theme. Up for grabs this month is a wonderful prize from the Sticker Store.
I finally got my mojo back and managed to create two projects today. The first one is a DT piece so it will be revealed on Monday. This is the second project and is a tribute to my husband's dog who passed away earlier this year. I have created a number of pet themed layouts over the years for the Gold Coast show and most of them have used pet themed papers and/or embellishments. Today I decided I wanted to go in a different direction so I have actually created a very girly LO to celebrate her memory.
I started with pieces from a kit I purchased from Paper Stories and then added bits and pieces from my stash as I went. The detail shots show some of the layering which was again a focus for me. I liked playing with the sequins and also got to use some shell pieces I have had in my stash for years.
This LO was inspired by two challenges. The first is Once Upon A... Sketch. Their theme for August is 'I'll never forget'. I have my journaling in the top left corner of the page which talks about how I didn't like dogs when I started dating Ben but I fell in love with Bonnie and how much we miss her now she is gone. This was the sketch:
I also used the current colour challenge over at ScrapFriends. I was doing so well at playing every fortnight over at that site but then life got in the way and it's been a while since the last time I got to play. They always have fantastic sketch challenges and beautiful colour combinations so go check them out (after you leave me a comment, of course). :)

The whole borough will be free of parking enforcement on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day.
Additionally, on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve there will be no enforcement of the usual parking regulations in council-run car parks, no enforcement of the usual parking regulations in on-street parking bays within the central zone and no enforcement in all other zones after 5pm. However, yellow-line restrictions will remain in place on these two days.
I've sent versions of the below letter to the CEO of both Govia Thameslink Railway and Network Rail after learning that there is apparently to be a network-wide rollout of pay-to-use cash machines at stations across Croydon. I've also sent on to the MD for Cardtronics UK. I'll update with a reply as soon as I received one.
Over the last few weeks cash machines in stations across the borough have started to charge residents for the withdrawal of funds - £1.99 per withdrawal. These include those at East Croydon station and South Croydon station.
Govia Thameslink Railway have reportedly told commuters that the decision was taken by an organisation called Cardtronics, and that all cash machines on all stations will be pay-to-use by the end of October 2018. Croydon Council has informed me that these machines are on land owned by Network Rail.
It is reported that Croydon has more pay-to-use cash machines than any other London borough. These machines particularly affect those on low-incomes as they are likely to have a relatively small amount of money in their account. The news that this is to become standardised across the network is therefore deeply concerning.
Those on low incomes rely heavily on cash to manage their finances. The Citizens Advice Bureau revealed that despite a third of all cash machines in 2011 being pay-to-use, ‘almost 97 per cent of UK cash withdrawals at UK cash machines were made free of charge, demonstrating our understandable reluctance as a society to pay to access our own money.’
In January this year the Government introduced rules which say that all surcharges for using credit and debit cards should be halted.
Was Network Rail consulted by Cardtronics about the change to charge for cash machine use on your property?
If you were, could you please outline what has changed recently to warrant now charging for this service? If you were not, what is your position on the fee change?
Given the well-documented detrimental impact of pay-to-use machines on those on low-incomes, could you please outline why Network Rail felt this change was necessary?
Govia Thameslink Railway have reportedly told commuters that the decision was taken by your organisation, and that all cash machines on all stations will be pay-to-use by the end of October 2018. Croydon Council has informed me that these machines are on land owned by Network Rail. Statements from Cardtronics say that this hike is due to rental increases, but LINK claim this only accounts for 1.5p per transaction, significantly lower than the £1.99 being charged.
Do you believe the information supplied by LINK is correct? If it is, how can you justify to customers the blanket fee increase?
Given the well-documented detrimental impact of pay-to-use machines on those on low-incomes, what is your message to those on low incomes who rely on cash machines like yours?
Councillors from just across the borough border in Chipstead recently put up a banner advertising a nearby charity fireworks display on the fence leading up to the Cane Hill estate in Coulsdon.
If you have any idea where the banner is, or who might have removed it, then please do let me know by emailing mario.creatura@croydon.gov.uk!
I've taken up the case of a resident who noticed that a number of drivers waiting to pick up passengers at Coulsdon South station appear to be leaving their engines running.
There's no real need for this, particularly if the wait for for a decent length of time, and the resident is concerned about the air pollution in the local area.
I've written to Network Rail who manage the site to ask if they'd consider a sign similar to that used in Kensington and Chelsea to advise drivers that it is not permitted to have the car stationary and still running.
Today is the deadline to respond to the Council's 'Evolution of the Suburbs' planning document, a piece of work that will provide the framework for a significant number of buildings and developments across Croydon.
Residents have until tomorrow to feed their views into the process - my submission is below. You can find the full document here and email your views to ldf@croydon.gov.uk.
I am writing as one of the elected representatives for Coulsdon Town ward, please accept this as a submission on the SPD2 Document that is currently out for consultation.
I have a number of concerns about the language used in the paper, not least that it appears to be a subjective document that raises significantly more questions than it is supposed to clarify. The report should be more of a definitive piece of work, instead it appears to allow a substantial amount of interpretation which could have detrimental effects on the character of Croydon.
There appears to be scant suggestion about developing the infrastructure needed to support significant population growth – was this not considered to be something merited in the document? Will there be a supplementary paper outlining the plans for increasing capacity on roads and services to cope with the residential increase? My fear is that the impartiality of the Planning Committee necessitates that each application is considered on its own merits, but that this does not factor in the wider implications of many applications sequentially being considered for the same area over a period of months. Put simply – if 10 applications are considered and approved in the same area over the period of 12 months, what guarantee is there in SPD2 that commensurate infrastructure improvements will be developed and progressed to aid in the increase in parking, sewage and other vital requirements for a good standard of living?
A good example of this is contained in paragraph 2.30 on car parking – an issue that is plaguing my ward in Coulsdon. Multiple blocks of flats are being erected, without commensurate car parking spaces. Residents moving into the properties, knowing that parking space on the street is limited, still bring their vechiles. They feel it will be the job of others to abandon their cars. Coulsdon is on the edge of the North Downs and is quite hilly. Whilst public transport is well-connected, the train service quality is intermittent and most modes do not reach out into Reigate, Banstead and wider Surrey in way that means cars lose their value. The increase in population due to the density of the new developments means there is a huge volume of vehicles needing parking space, causing traffic gridlock most mornings and evenings. Parking is not a luxury, it is a basic necessity to support the sustainability of development and communities.
Has the recently rolled out amended waste service programme being accounted for in paragraph 2.31? If not, then this will have implications on the ability for officers and councillors to interpret the report.
Whilst I am fully supportive of the need to develop new housing opportunities, these can and must be done in line with the reasonable support of the local residents already habiting in the area. Paragraph 4.2 details the papers support for ‘character’ but then details the three residential extension approaches of subservient, innovative and seamless. Can a development policy simultaneously respect the existing ‘character’ whilst being ‘subservient/innovative’? I am fearful that good quality affordable housing that fits into the local community aesthetic will not be a red-line in the document, meaning anything can and will happen to my residents.
In paragraph 2.7 and 2.8 the three types of approaches to character is described as ‘sympathetic and faithful’, ‘innovative and original’, ‘contemporary reinterpretation’. Surely any application, development or scheme can apply to any of these? Isn’t the scope for interpretation so large that this set of descriptions is legally meaningless? How can it be measured and enforced on each application? What happens if it can be easily justified (due to its lack of definitiveness) that a scheme has breached this criterion?
This fear for the respect of the local residents and existing character is not eased when I read paragraph 2.2 which details the overarching principles for development: to provide the right mix of homes in the right location, improve or positively contribute to local character and minimise impact on neighbouring amenity. How is this monitored and maintained? Is this rhetoric or are there tangible figures and targets that can be applied to what is a laudable aim? What is to stop someone ignoring this piece of guidance? To what extent are the views of the local people and their representatives taken into account on inappropriate developments that do not fit this nebulous aspiration?
This subjectivity and lack of clarity also exists in figures 1.3a, 1.3b and 1.3c which detail the evolution of the different types of suburbs, but are open to interpretation.
I believe that SPD2 requires a substantial reworking to address the concerns I’ve outlined above. These are very real, practical fears that I know many of my residents feel. Each time they attend a Planning Committee meeting to comment on a scheme they leave disheartened. I hope that by engaging with some of my concerns that this may be limited in the future.
Croydon badly needs good quality, affordable family homes. I know my residents would support them if they are proposed, and this plan is vital in making that happen.
Documents setting out planning guidance for the borough and how the Council will engage with stakeholders are available for comment. Below are some of the points from my response to the consultation on Suburban Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD2).
Figures 1.3a, 1.3b and 1.3c are used to justify expected development patterns including ‘backland development’ in the suburbs over a period of 10 – 15 years, “so that change is gradual and can be managed to ensure that the benefits of such growth are optimised.” But the examples given of the types of development expected are not defined in sufficient granularity and are too scattergun to give an objective sense of whether what is being proposed would be acceptable.
In terms of how acceptable a development might be to existing residents, the bullet points provided in paragraph 2.2 will be key, in particular emphasis on two of them: whether a proposal improves or positively contributes to local character; and how the impact on neighbouring amenity can be minimised as far as possible. Much will depend on how sympathetically these policies are applied.
Para 2.3.2: “Smaller suburban proposals providing up to 9 dwellings should also seek to maximise the number of dwellings with 3 or more bedrooms.” It would be helpful if this could be expressed more accurately, perhaps setting a target or requirement for three bedroom family units in developments of 9 dwellings or less.
Para 2.3.6: “A development proposal that seeks to deliver a scheme that could form part of a larger potential development on the same or adjoining land will be assessed as an application for the larger development potential.” Whilst the intention of this policy might be laudable, I have concerns that in borderline cases this could result in developments being tipped over the threshold because more studios, one- and two-bedroom units are built at the expense of larger three bedroom properties which would be suitable for families.
Paras 2.3 & 2.4: “Optimising sites building across boundaries.” Whilst in economic terms this makes sense, in reality the developments that result from such consolidation may not be sympathetic to an area if they create ‘mega’ blocks. The schema in Figure 2.4a is an alarming example of the type of over-development that could result.
Paras 2.6.3 and 2.6.4: ‘Minimal necessary car parking will be the starting point for all development proposals and the borough will encourage lower parking provision in areas of PTAL 4 and above.’ I can see why the Council may want to do this. The Croydon Local Plan currently seeks to reduce the need to travel by concentrating development in areas with a higher PTAL rating. As such, from 2011 to 2014 the majority of new homes (58%) were in areas with a PTAL rating of at least 3 - typically areas that have already undergone a degree of intensification. Only 10% of homes were built in areas with a PTAL of 4. The proposals therefore seek to increase density in less urban areas. But this ignores the fact that areas with PTAL ratings of 4 can have quite patchy access to public transport. Also, that residents in those areas will still aspire to owning a car. Any policy should seek to balance these challenges in part by ensuring sufficient provision of more public transport and other sustainable methods of transport, as is encouraged in 2.6.8.
Para 2.7.2 refers encouragingly to some areas within Croydon “being defined by the predominance of certain types of homes”. This aspiration may give hope to residents that the Council will extend protection to what is perceived to be the character of their areas on those grounds. But the three approaches to how to respond to local character in the design of new developments that the Council goes on to endorse in Para 2.8 would appear to allow a very broad interpretation of what is acceptable in any area, if interpreted loosely. A braver and more specific interpretation of what is acceptable would be welcomed in the SPD.
Para 2.9.9: “Where there is a concern that a development would appear overbearing to a neighbouring property and/or create a poorly designed streetscene, they will not be supported.” This is to be welcomed.
Para 2.15.2: “Proposals which span plot boundaries may seek to achieve this through stepping form to create a link element between two main building forms located on each of the original plots.” I am not convinced that such designs necessarily reduce sufficiently the sense of massing created by developments that incorporate links.
Para 2.23: A prohibition on materials that are proven not to weather well or provide longevity is to be supported.
Last week at a meeting of Croydon Council’s Streets and Environment Scrutiny Sub-Committee, I challenged the Cabinet Member, Cllr Stuart Collins, when he said that Labour is looking to renege on a manifesto pledge to run a free bulky waste collection service.
Labour only made the pledge after the Conservatives had come up with the idea earlier this year. We put the policy to tackle the fly-tipping plaguing Croydon’s streets in our manifesto ahead of May’s local elections. We were pleased when Labour later also recognised the soundness of the idea by copying it.
The free bulky waste collection service is extremely popular, but Labour now says it is expensive to run and creates a too much of a financial pressure on the Council's budget.
At the meeting, Cllr Collins claimed the free bulky waste service was always intended as a “trial” to see what effect it would have on fly-tipping. But when he was challenged to demonstrate it was only intended as a trial - and not introduced to residents as a more permanent measure - he could not do so.
Even Cllr Collins’ Labour colleagues on the Committee then went on to express their concerns that a review of one of their manifesto pledges was taking place so soon after this year's election.
The Conservatives will continue to hold Labour to account over the withdrawal of a key policy to tackle fly-tipping in the borough.
Last week at a meeting of the Full Council in Croydon I presented a petition to residents objecting to the new wheelie bins in Ashdown Park in Coulsdon.
Residents in Ashdown Park felt that as their houses all have small frontages they did not have the facilities for storing two large bins, one medium sized bin and a food caddy in a discreet way.
In 2005, the estate was granted an exemption from the Council’s requirement for landfill collections to be from medium sized wheelie bins, as these would not fit inside the bin cupboards.
Shortly after the petition was sent in, the Council granted a continuation of the concession for retaining the smaller cupboard-size landfill bins.
Residents do support aspirations in the borough to increase recycling rates but say they already separate their rubbish by type and think it unlikely that they are withholding materials that could be recycled if bigger bins are provided.
Looking around the estate, residents say the majority of houses are struggling to hide the new bins away. All the houses on the estate have covenants that the associated grounds be maintained in a good and tidy condition, and the front gardens be open plan - the latter making it difficult to store the bins.
Each year every council ward in Croydon is given a £24,000 ward budget to spend on local activities and resources that benefit community groups.
The budget is actually £8,000 per councillor, but in Coulsdon Town your three representatives elect to jointly pool the funds and spend the money as one lump sum.
For a number of years now we have therefore contributed to the costs of the Yulefest lights in the town centre - although as a recurring item of expenditure this is rare. In fact, the vast majority of projects sponsored by our Community Ward Budget are one-offs.
That means if you have a good idea for a project that would benefit the community, but lack the funds to make it a reality, we may be able to help. The type of projects that we can support include those that require revenue or capital expenditure, but cannot create an ongoing maintenance cost for the Council.
An example of a project that gained our support in this financial year, for example, is buying some kitchen equipment for Purley & Coulsdon Clubs for the Elderly, while in the past we have bought defibrillators and hearing loops that benefit local people as well as funded youth activities including the Scouts.
But there are still some funds left to be bid for this year. So if you have any suggestions as to how we should spend that money please don’t hesitate to get in touch:
A resident has got in touch to let me know that while they were litter-picking on the A23 between Coulsdon South station and Woodplace Lane, that they noticed a significant amount of the litter in the area had been shredded.
On investigating it appears that TfL, who maintain the grass levels, had cut the grass but not removed the litter in advance, thereby shredding it and making it that much harder for the Council or conscientious residents to pick it up.
I'm pleased that TfL have said they are going to get a copy of the Council's clean-up schedule so that they can co-ordinate better in future. A victory for common sense!
Delighted to have been invited along with ecumenical and other representatives to hear His Eminence Archbishop Angaelos speak on the integration of the Coptic Church in society.
The Coptic Church, St Mary & St Shenouda on Rickman Hill, Coulsdon provided the perfect setting for an inspirational address by the Archbishop.
Congratulations to my ward colleague Cllr Yvette Hopley upon her election to the role of Mayor of Croydon on Monday. Congratulations also to Purley councillor Badsha Quadir on his appointment as Deputy Mayor.
For the benefit of Sanderstead residents not conversant with the traditions of the council, the Mayor is traditionally aloof from political matters during their mayoral year, although they remain a councillor and can assist residents with non-political case work. The Mayor's only involvement in the political side of council is the unenviable task they have of chairing the meetings of the full council, seven times per year. Given that this is election year, this could be quite a taxing task!

As an undergraduate, I did a senior thesis that involved developing a program for directing a chess tournament.
As a master's student, I wrote an analytical paper (short of a thesis) on the use of temporal logics in automated hardware design verification.
As a doctoral student, I wrote a dissertation on how to model arguments based on their functions and how to use such models for content-based information retrieval.
I have supervised undergraduate research projects in the areas of patterns, artificial intelligence, software design, project management, and virtual reality.
I have supervised M.S. research projects in the areas of patterns and refactoring, machine learning, intelligent tutoring, and software design and engineering. I am co-advisor on an Ed.D. project involving ethics in computer science. I have served on numerous masters and doctoral committees in CS, industrial technology, education, and math.
Even so, I am still learning about the process and still learning to be a better advisor. These guidelines represent what I think I have learned thus far. Many of these ideas have been gathered from other computer scientists, too, as I learned from them. As I learn more, I will modify them. If you have any questions or comments about what you see here, be sure to discuss them with me!
Contact me promptly at the beginning of each term to set up a weekly meeting for your project. Meetings are expected to last at least one-half hour each week. If you can schedule an hour-long block, all the better; you can use the second half hour to follow up on ideas from our discussion.
If you cannot make a meeting, notify me before the scheduled meeting time. Ordinarily, I expect 24 hours notice except in case of an emergency. I will try to meet the same standard if I am unable to make a meeting.
At the beginning of each meeting, you should report on activities since our last meeting, including obstacles encountered and work to be done. To aid in delivering this report, prepare a written progress report on your project. Either e-mail your report prior to our meeting, or -- preferably -- post it to your project web page. In either case, keep on-line copies for yourself; they will be useful in writing your final project report.
For a 1-credit undergraduate project, I expect that you will spend 4-6 hours per week on project work. For a 2-credit undergraduate project, that range grows to 6-10 hours per week. For a typical graduate project, which consists of two semesters at 3 credits each, I expect that you will average 15-20 hours per week on your project.
These estimates reflect my belief that your research project should be important to you. It is not just an add-on to end of your program, done in order to satisfy arbitrary degree requirements. It is a capstone to your study and a door to your future intellectual life.
As your advisor, I will commit a commensurate amount of time and interest to ensure that you gain as much as you can from your project. I also hope to learn from your project!
A well-written final report is required for all projects. It should conform to professional standards of presentation. Check out my Writing Tips page for some guidance.
Document all software thoroughly. Your work will have more value to you, to me, and to other students if others can read, use, and modify it. Write a user's manual for your system and include it as an appendix in your final report.
A well-organized public presentation is required for all projects. You will schedule your presentation for some time at the end of the term in which you complete your project. If your project is strong enough, we will try to find other otlets for your work, such as UNI's Sigma Xi Student Research Conference or Argonne Labs' Student Research Conference.
Upon completion of the project, you will receive a grade for the entirety of your project. By this, I mean that your grade will reflect both your final products of the project (results, report, and presentation) and the process by which they were attained. No amount of last-minute effort will turn a mediocre project effort into an A.
For projects that span multiple terms, only one grade is given, in the semester during which the project is completed. I will try to give you enough feedback as you work on your project that you can have some idea of how well you are doing. If you would like more information, please ask. I won't generally pre-grade your results, but I can at least tell you my current assessment of the consistency and quality of your work.
Please do not become overly concerned with the grade you will or won't receive. Concentrate on doing the project work to the best of your ability. Rather than thinking about your grade, think about the impression that your work on the project will make on me and on others as you seek future employment, admission to graduate school, and so on. My experience is that students who focus on doing as well as they can end up with grades that satisfy them.
Academic integrity is essential to all phases of your project. This is more than a necessary professional standard; it is the personal standard that I set for myself and for the people with whom I wish to work.

If you're wondering what in the world a desktop theme is, no problem. In the rush to release Windows 95, they didn't finish one feature they were planning on including. So a couple months after 95 was released, the "Plus!" addition came out, which included support for desktop themes. A desktop theme basically coordinates everything on your desktop using a unified theme, from the background wallpaper to the screen saver to the colors of the windows to the sounds that play when you start and end Windows and when you mess up. "Calling Out Your Name" now offers a unique Rich Mullins theme, which features the Rich's "arrow pose" as seen in the Homeless Man video and the "Home" tribute, snippets of Rich's music, and a nifty animated dulcimer playing icon while you wait.
1. If when you run Windows 95, you see "Plus!" appear during startup, simply choose "Start", "Settings", and "Control Panel" from the menu, then choose the "Desktop Themes" icon from the control panel.
2. If you don't have Plus! installed, download this shareware desktop themes program and then run the program once it is saved on your hard drive.
8. Run the desktop themes program (either the one you just downloaded from COYN or from the control panel).
Note: If you happen to be a huge fan of Rich and your spouse doesn't quite share your passion, I will not be held liable for any martial discord, okay? ;->

The Phoenix Art Museum has a lovely Charles James, go figure! Click on the image to read more about this astounding dress (including its heavily-engineered underpinnings).
I had no plans to go to Phoenix, but I think now, if it ever comes up, the the Phoenix Art Museum is going to be the first stop … from their site: "The Collection emphasizes major American designers of the 20th century including Adrian, Norell, Galanos, and Claire McCardell; and European Designers such as Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent." Like, whoa. (Although, as a point of pure, unadulterated quibbling, I think I would have put a comma after 'century' and done something different with that semicolon.)
There’s some website (myfabric.com)? where you can do this but it’s always down. So I suppose you can’t do it, yet. And it’s quite a bit of money (>$50) so I’ve not even started my design yet. I guess I’ll have to wait for desktop fabbing.
Sorry, content browsing has some technical issues. If you want to switch main category (on the right), choose -Any- and then choose the category you want to see next. I'm trying to fix the issue soon.

This ride is a randonneur style event sanctioned by RUSA and ACP. Choose between an ACP sanctioned 300k or 200k course.
First time riding with PA Randonneurs? Read an overview of what to expect on your first PA brevet. All participants are obliged to follow the rules for riders as well as PA and NJ vehicle laws. Unlike organized century rides, the course will not be marked -- riders will need to navigate with a cue sheet.
Traveling far? Friday night accommodations are available at the hostel. Make reservations on the registration form. Several chain hotels are also available in nearby Quakertown.
Park car in large lot on right, halfway between the hostel and driveway entrance. The parking spots near the hostel porch are reserved. Be sure to stay on the gravel areas.
Showers available at the hostel -- bring your own towel. Join us for pizza/pasta and share your epic stories, tales, and goals for the coming year. Relax in the hostel's comfortable great room or porch. A dormatory in the hostel is available to rest before traveling home.
Taking advantage of the light traffic in the early morning hours, we head directly through Bethlehem towards the first controle stop in Cherryville. We then make our first crossing over the Applachian Trail at Little Gap. After an exhilarating descent past the Blue Mountain Ski resort, we follow the valley road which offers spectacular views of the mountain ridge off to our right. The next stop is the "Apple Pie" bakery in Water Gap. The 200k riders will split off and start their return trip through Portland while the 300k riders will continue north into the PA side of the Delaware Water Gap Recreation Area. After a controle stop at the Hainesville Deli - the omelets and tuna subs have both been highly recommended in the past, riders head back south on the NJ side of the park, into Water Gap and joining the 200k route.
The return trip home continues along the Delaware River through Belvidere, Stewartsville, and with a penultimate controle in Bloomsbury. The route then follows the Musconetcong River on to Riegelsville. We return to PA at Riegelsville. But instead of the Rt 611 & Rt412 routing on previous events, the return trip follows quieter backroads through Nockamixon and Haycock.
As I type this, my dear son is crouched in his closet. Why you ask? Because I decided I didn't want to baby him. He's been there all day. Yep, all …
Bleh. Yeah, that's how I feel lately. Seems everywhere I turn there are opinions about my parenting. It sucks. A lot. And after awhile it wears me …
It's funny to me how the little things just don't even cross my mind as odd anymore. I suppose that means I'm coming to accept these little …
When I was a child I did this thing called masking, aka faking it and what this means is that I learnt the behaviour of others. The problem being is that if something changes that I can mess up badly because I can’t be flexible with my thinking. That is the one of the characteristics of autism is we manage change and see things black or white especially when it comes to learn.
I think it’s really hard being an autistic girl growing up because there is so much more pressure to be sociable then a boy. That all the boys got away with not getting noticed there for less social pressure. I used to absolutely hate being a girl because of this reason and I thought boys had it a lot easier or more relaxed attitude with regards to social and communication which suited me perfectly.
Now that I’m an adult I find it a bit more easier because I have more experience and knowledge but I still frequently mess up. If I am feeling anxious or if there is too much going on in my head can’t seem to focus on the rules. There are times when stressful factors cause me more brain power than normal and it is like I regress in my behaviour. That is why it’s so hard to measure autism, as it is not something that you can say x y and z it’s constantly shifting depending on the environment and mindset of that individual.
Since being a parent I have learnt that there are so many other social rules involved when bringing up a child.
I first it’s lovely when my children where new born as there is less pressure on me to be sociable but since my child has started school last year I noticed that there’s a hell of a lot more interaction going on.
Me being an autistic parent does affects my self esteem. A lot of the time I feel inadequate, especially as my husband is very good at communicating and engaging with others. It leaves me feeling really angry and frustrated. I know comparing is the worst thing to do but it coincides with me learning of other people.
I think one of the hardest and upsetting things is when people don’t see you as an individual but some sort of invalid because you’re autistic. They don’t look past the label or they do but then they just talk down to you in a condescending way. The thing is I am aware exactly what is happening, I just I don’t have the skills to communicate and express myself as clearly as other people do.
It has really made me feel quite low at times because I feel like I can’t give my child everything that a typical parent has to offer. I suppose that is why I enjoy the school holidays more because I don’t have to worry about the social things. The only downside is that when I return I have to deal with the social side of education and what not.I feel rubbish and I have felt very very low causing me to struggle to get up in the mornings. I have also learnt to avoid situations and tend to get my husband to do them tasks because it’s too upsetting at times to have to face the discrimination against me. I think that’s one of the saddest things about being an autistic parent is the fact that you deal with a lot of rejection or misunderstanding. I like my voice isn’t heard and again that familiar Outcast feeling appears.

Hawaii sues for info on Airbnb owners who aren't paying taxes - KFVE, K5-Hawaii News Now, Local Programming
One in 24 homes in the islands is a vacation rental, according to arecent report. (Image: Hawaii News Now)
As state and county leaders continue to look for ways to better monitor and regulate vacation rentals in Hawaii, a new report details just how out of control the industry is.
The attorney general is going to court to force popular vacation rental site Airbnb to turn over documents dating back to 2008 about who is renting out property and what money they've made.
The state says it believes that many vacation rental owners are failing to report and pay general excise tax and transient accommodation taxes, and they're asking the court to order Airbnb to turn over the names, addresses, Social Security numbers and bank information for potentially thousands of owners.
The state says it needs to use a subpoena against Airbnb because it hasn't been able to get the information in other ways.
"I am very proud of the state Department of Taxation for stepping forward and saying we want to get this information we want to assess whether there's up to $2 million in taxes due to this state," said state Rep. Cynthia Thielen, who district includes Kailua and Kaneohe. "That’s serious money. But more serious than that, we need to crack down on these illegal whole house rentals that are taking the rental stock away from local people."
If the judge rules in the state's favor, its goal is to find out who's been paying — and who hasn't.
"If they haven't been paying taxes it's unlikely they would facing criminal penalties depending on how they have avoided paying taxes," said state Director of Taxation Linda Takayama. "But certainly our first attempt is to get the taxes paid. There will be penalties and interest applied if they have not been paying."
In a statement, Airbnb said it "has received the request from the state's Department of Taxation and is currently reviewing it."
Last month, Airbnb filed a lawsuit against New York City over a new law that requires all home sharing companies to hand over the names and addresses of hosts to the city. The suit claims the law is unconstitutional and violates its users' privacy.
There are other larger vacation rental companies operating in Hawaii, but the state confirms Airbnb is currently the only one its taking to court.
"We are attempting this with AirBnb because they have a local representative here," said Takayama. "The other two do not, so it would require us to go to the mainland to their place of business to request or to file a subpoena. So for the time being, this is our first step."
The issue of vacation rentals in the islands, where the dearth of affordable housing remains a key issue, has prompted growing tension in recent years.
A report earlier this year from the Hawaii Appleseed Center estimated that 1 in 24 homes in the islands is a vacation rental. And of the state's 23,000 vacation rentals, more than half are owned by non-residents.
Honolulu police are asking the public's assistance in locating these individuals with outstanding warrants.

Life has a way of wrapping its best gifts in the most difficult parcels. Good things don’t come easy it is said. Fate is a merchant and will give you nothing for free. You have to pay for it. In the athletics of life, from the gun blast of birth we run and jump across hurdles in our respective lanes as we stride towards the finishing line. Every big success is a medal won after climbing over our individual Mt. Everests. Every achievement a military decoration for the gallantry with which we combated odds which had superior firepower.
Success in life has a lot to do with overcoming odds. This requires a great deal of mental muscularity wrestling our way through those bullying odds. So let us drink some nourishing cups of motivation from the story of two childhood sweethearts, who still wed despite fiery criticism from skeptics after the bride was left a quadriplegic following a gruesome car accident.
Just some few weeks after her engagement to her childhood heartthrob, Anna Claire Waldrop was driving home after a party in the company of her fiancé,”Jimbo” (formally known as James). Without forewarning, a drunken driver accelerated fiercely from behind and violently rammed into their car. The force of the impact threw the car somersaulting where it eventually landed into a ditch.
The extent of injuries sentenced Anna to her hospital bed as she clawed desperately for life, while her fiancé Jimbo was only afflicted with mild injuries. The shocking reality set in that Anna’s neck had been broken, which would leave her a quadriplegic.
In face of this tragic accident, when the scorch of Anna’s sorrow should have been sufficient enough to evaporate all optimism, she and Jimbo continued, as planned, with their wedding date.
Talk about love without condition or limitations, it appears as though this relationship is entrenched in time. After all, these two have known each other since they both started kindergarten. It took Jimbo until they were both in the sixth grade before he worked up the courage to ask her out formally.
The accident greatly jolted Anna’s life and it took her over a month for the reality of the accident to really sink in.
“I was about to get my bachelor’s degree, get married, start my adult life. Everything was on the edge,” she said.
Yet through all the hassle and torment, Jimbo never deserted her. He faithfully traveled to visit Anna every week between her rehabilitation center in Atlanta and from where he was studying for his biology degree at Delta State University in Cleveland, Missouri.
The troubles only seemed to solidify more after the accident. “He had to take care of me physically, as well as emotionally, and he did a phenomenal job,” Anna explained. “I don’t know if I would have done so well if the roles had been reversed.”
This story would seem to depict Jimbo as superhuman, right? Well, he indeed faced criticism for continuing with his wedding to Anna. Some told him that he may be making a mistake is staying with Anna due to the obvious challenges.
“They were all over us. Telling her, ‘Not all marriages work out, especially under these circumstances.’ And, ‘You don’t know if he’s going to stay with you through this,’” Jimbo explained. “They didn’t understand our relationship at all. They didn’t understand anything about us.”
Yet Jimbo strode on against the odds. Eight months after their accident, Anna and Jimbo married in New Albany, Mississippi, in front of their dearest friends, family and supporters.
“Anna Claire is somebody who wears her emotions on her sleeve. You can always tell if something is wrong,” Jimbo said. “But she looked so happy. She looked incredible.”
“When I saw her in the wedding dress, it was a million times more than I expected. I couldn’t believe it. It was such a blessing,” he said. “Everything went smooth and she looked beautiful and happy.”
So this is the story of Anna and Jimbo, which contains fantastic life lessons for us all to keep in mind as we continue our own personal trajectories through life. What are your thoughts? Any pearls of wisdom that you may want to share as well? We’d welcome your comments below!
Web advertising and marketing has actually ended up being an efficient means to market your organisation online. I did not understand this up until I was having coffee with my buddy, Lisa in our favored coffeehouse. Because we both have on-line services as well as job from residence our discussions have the tendency to wind up on the subject of working online.
Her organisation constantly appears to be doing so well, and also she did do a little much better compared to me in some of our company training courses in university, so I do look up to her. She smirked, gradually mixing her coffee.
She began to include some even more lotion to her cappucino, providing me that mom like squint while asking me just what I was doing while we remained in our company promo, advertising and marketing as well as advertising and marketing training courses. Well, I did find out a whole lot from my organisation training courses, yet a lot has actually altered in so little time. While I remained in university I was preparing to open a traditional coffee bar, not offering specialized coffees online!
She stated that all I had to do was take exactly what I found out from business advertising and marketing to Internet advertising and marketing. Both industrial marketing for a coffee store and also Internet advertising and marketing for my online store had countless resemblances.
She informed me in order to reach them I would certainly require to make certain that my Internet advertisements would certainly get to those individuals such as on various other sites connected to coffee, e-newsletters for coffee fans, and so on
. Lisa claimed she had actually discovered a number of advertising and marketing projects that functioned incredibly well for her however she did have to do some job to discover the most effective ones. She advised me regarding this marketing course we had where our teacher had us do a project on taping the results of advertising and marketing projects to obtain rid of those that had little or no result as well as maintain the ones that were functioning.
She grinned, touching my hand, saying loudly that I lastly obtained it! She elevated a finger towards my face and also in a mother-like tone advised me to check various marketing campaign and also I would certainly discover the most effective Internet advertising and marketing for my service. I grinned, remembered and also we appreciated the remainder of our coffee break.
Net marketing has actually come to be an efficient means to market your organisation online. I informed her I bore in mind exactly how crucial marketing was, however at the time I was concentrating on a block as well as mortar store– not an on the internet company coffee shop. She stated that all I had to do was take exactly what I discovered from business marketing to Internet advertising and marketing. Both business advertising and marketing for a coffee store as well as Internet marketing for my online store had many resemblances.
She advised me concerning this advertising and marketing course we had where our teacher had us do a job on taping the results of marketing projects to obtain rid of those that had little or no impact and also maintain the ones that were functioning.

I highly recommend Milltek exhausts, an Audi technician told me that it's the nicest sounding exhaust for these cars.
If you think you know what a diesel sounds like think again! Milltek Sport has just completed development of their exhaust system for the new Audi A5 3.0 TDi Coupe. The system replaces the standard centre section, left and right-hand rear silencers and adjoining brace bar. The tips are slightly larger too but are still very much in keeping with the gorgeous looks of the A5.
As you can hear from the video (right), the exhaust not only gives the car more power and a new level of responsiveness, it also gives it an aggressive V6 petrol-like sound.
Here's a paper model of a chemical container train car I've used as a prop in my Savage Cyberworld -campaign. Print it on two A4/Letter sheets, on cardstock, 120g paper or something else strudier than standard paper. I haven't added instructions as the model is quite simple, and I didn't see it necessary to add the parts that attach train cars to each other (whatever they are called in English), model worked quite well without them.
My Beasts & Barbarians campaign starts soon, and I wanted to take a few inspirational photos while waiting for the game. These diorama-like photos have only few pieces of terrain, but represent situations that might well be epic moments in a Sword & Sorcery game.
This small diorama -photo was made for a small maxminis -competition. Some terrain props I've made before were used in the diorama, and potato flour to make the ground look more authentic. Sky was taken from a photo and added to it using Gimp.

After trying a couple of Adobe Reader Speedup tools and tricks, I realized the handiest and most-guaranteed-to-work way to stop Firefox from freezing whenever I clicked on a .pdf was to simply disable the PDF plugin (via Tools -> Options -> Downloads -> Plug-Ins ), causing each .pdf to be opened outside of the browser. No more slowdowns, yay!
Of these, Undo Close Tab is the one I miss the most after every fresh new Firefox install. Always a shock if I find out too late I've forgotten to install it... :)

A student was disciplined following an incident involving a Confederate flag that happened in a classroom on Wednesday, June 1st.
We’re told the student pulled the flag out of his pocket when he walked into the classroom, and the student then made references to “white pride day.”
The student was disciplined, and an email was sent to parents of Nicolet students regarding this situation.
Dr. Robert Kobylski, Superintendent for the Nicolet School District, issued the following statement:
“On Wednesday, a student made a derogatory and offensive demonstration during an English class. This action disrupted the class and is in violation of district policy. We conducted an investigation that resulted in disciplinary action. Fostering an educational community based on tolerance and respect is of the utmost importance to the administration, faculty and staff at Nicolet. Appropriate personnel are available to assist students who wish to talk about the incident.”
The final preseason match of 2018 started off with a beautiful aerial display of lightning, a delay to kickoff and a fun locker room game by the Torrent caught on video. Once on the field, the Torrent jumped out early, and held on for a 3:2 victory over Elmbrook United U19.
As the two teams took to the field for warm-ups, a line of thunderstorms quickly pushed into the area, forcing both teams to return to the locker rooms. During the delay the Torrent men put their heads together and figured out a way to bond as a squad. After a roughly 30-minute delay, the teams were cleared to return to the field.
It didn’t take the Torrent long to find their stride. Roughly 3 minutes in, Michael Da-Silva found his scoring touch for the first time this preseason, and was followed up by a goal by Abe Kanneh.
After Elmbrook found themselves on the score sheet midway through the first half, it was a ball in by Drew Ruggles that found Mark Hutchinson off a rebound to make the score 3:1 at halftime.
Elmbrook United came out swinging in the second half. After the Torrent substituted out many of the roster players, Elmbrook scored their second goal of the match, and had two golden opportunities to tie the match, but just missed converting them both.
“Overall, I think we are starting to find ourselves,” said Andrew Wiedabach after the match. “It’s been a tough preseason, but we have shown that the talent level is high in this locker room. The more we can work together the better we will get. Right now, it’s all about taking what we have learned from Coach Davi on how to run our offense and physically applying it on the field.”
Great music begins with great songs, and great songs are what the Honey Island Swamp Band is all about. The band came together after Aaron Wilkinson (acoustic guitar, mandolin, vocals) and Chris Mule’ (electric guitar, vocals) were marooned in San Francisco after the levee breaches following Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, and had a chance encounter with fellow New Orleans evacuees Sam Price (bass, vocals) and Garland Paul(drums, vocals) at John Lee Hooker’s Boom Boom Room on Fillmore Street. They knew each other from having all played together in some form or another in various New Orleans bands, and with the great unknown regarding their return to their underwater hometown looming in the distance, they decided to put together a band and get some gigs going. Fortunately, the Boom Boom Room’s owner Alex Andreas offered the band a weekly gig on the spot.
Sunday nights at the Boom Boom Room soon became a favorite of Bay Area roots music lovers, who have a long-standing affinity for New Orleans music and musicians. Two months into the residency, sound engineer Robert Gatley approached the band with a rare opportunity — he wanted to record a Honey Island Swamp Band album at the legendary Record Plant studios in Sausalito, where he worked. The 7-song eponymous debut “Honey Island Swamp Band”came together beautifully, with Wilkinson and Mulé both contributing favorite originals, and was received so well that they all decided to continue the band upon moving back to New Orleans in 2007.
Honey Island Swamp Band‘s music has been described as “Bayou Americana”with timeless songs from Wilkinson & Mulé, highlighted by Mulé’s searing guitar, Wilkinson’s sure-handed mandolin, and 4-part vocal harmonies, all anchored by the powerful groove of Price & Paul’s Louisiana stomp rhythm section. The addition of Trevor Brooks on Hammond B-3 organ to the HISB family in 2010 has rounded out the band’s sound, which draws from a variety of influences in the world of roots music, including artists such as Lowell George & Little Feat, The Band, Taj Mahal, Gram Parsons, Jerry Garcia, Johnny Cash, Jimmy Reed, Clarence “Gatemouth” Brown, and New Orleans’ own Earl King and Dr. John.
In April 2009, the band released its first full-length album entitled Wishing Well. The album was well-received and based on the strength of such songs as “Natural Born Fool”, “Till the Money’s Gone”, and the title track, Wishing Wellwas awarded 2009′s “Best Blues Album” by OffBeat Magazine, which also named HISB as 2009’s “Best Emerging Artist” and 2010’s “Best Roots Rock Artist”. Most recently HISB won the award for “Best Roots Rock Artist” of 2011 at the Big Easy Awards, New Orleans’ most prestigious arts and entertainment honors.
2010’s Good To You was named to several “Top Ten CDs of 2010″ lists, and has quickly become a staple on the Crescent City’s legendary radio station WWOZas well as on Sirius/XM Bluesville. It features the southern strut of songs such as “Be Good”, “300 Pounds” and the album’s first single “Chocolate Cake.”
Now the band is gearing up for their first nationally-distributed studio recording, Cane Sugar, on Louisiana Red Hot Records in late July 2013. Produced by Grammy-winning producer John Porter, the 12 new songs illuminate the mix of country-inflected rock, New Orleans funky blues and infectious songwriting that makes Honey Island Swamp Band‘s music so familiar yet unique at the same time. Cane Sugar is by far their most fully-realized recording to date and reflects the finely tuned unit the band has become after incessant touring.
“The Honey Island Swamp is a real place. It resides near the border of Louisiana and Mississippi. It’s therefore a fitting name for this band that draws inspiration from the music of those two states. With the Honey Island Swamp Band, soul, country, R&B and blues are all on equal footing. The two man songwriting/guitarist team of Chris Mulé and Aaron Wilkinson produce expressive, hook-laden tunes that honor songcraft while respecting the groove.” – Jambase.com
“What a fine band this is – an utterly refreshing, unpretentious group of first-rate instrumentalists who also sing engagingly. Their music is as delicious as their name.” – Susan Peña, The Reading Eagle
We are Disciples of Christ, a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world. As part of the one body of Christ, we welcome all to the Lord’s Table as God has welcomed us.
The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) denomination was born in the 1800s, and continues to be influenced by its founding ideals of our unity in Christ with openness and diversity in practice and belief.
To be a faithful, growing church, that demonstrates true community, deep Christian spirituality and a passion for justice. (Micah 6:8)
To be and to share the Good News of Jesus Christ, witnessing, loving and serving from our doorsteps “to the ends of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)
The church is identified with the Protestant mainstream and is widely involved in social and other concerns. Disciples have supported vigorously world and national programs of education, agricultural assistance, racial reconciliation, care of the developmentally disabled and aid to victims of war and calamity.
The chalice symbolizes the central place of communion in worship for the Christian Church. The X-shaped cross of the disciple Andrew is a reminder of the ministry of each person and the importance of evangelism.
At Lee’s Summit Christian Church, we are Disciples of Christ, a movement for wholeness in a fragmented world, called to welcome others as we have been welcomed by God. As Disciples, we find identity at the Lord’s Table, practicing open communion for all and embracing our mission of Building Bridges of Grace from the Welcome Table to Every Table. Our welcome knows no boundaries of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or any other designation of individuals who have known the pain of exclusion and discrimination by the church and society.
We declare ourselves to be an Open and Affirming congregation, professing that all people are God’s children and deserve full inclusion in the life, leadership, ministry, fellowship, worship, sacraments of marriage, communion, baptism, and ordination, responsibilities, and blessing of participation in our congregation. With open hearts, open minds, and open doors, we invite anyone who seeks God’s amazing grace to join our church family.
Discussion specifically regarding the "Dragon Ball Super" TV series premiering July 2015 in Japan, including individual threads for each episode.
Either Super 2 or new db series, just to use all the characters and concepts that have been introduced via tournaments and tell different stories involving them. I mean, not doing that would be modern dragon ball's biggest sin.
Seriously, i can understand the sentiment behind wanting the show to be ended, but that could only work in case there was no more potential or any way to write new interesting
With all these universe being introduced, new characters and even relationships between them (Vegeta being Cabba's mentor, Goku and Hit.....etc) suddenly throwing everything away and not using it would be downright awful. It would pretty much shit on the whole db revival thing that BoG introduced with the concept of other universes.
I suppose Toei should be commended for showing a progression in Roshi's predilection for molesting women, he starts out just being your typical old pervert, who gets incredibly embarrassed just requesting to see panties, boobs, puff-puffs, you name it, before daring to attempt feeling up unconscious women.
3 years later and kinda going hand in hand with his increase in power, he has no problem with foregoing the requests and just grabbing women's butts, whether that be Bulma or flight attendants and nurses even later on. He keeps at that level all throughout Z, where we even get further scenes of him grabbing Maron's boob, but she's a bitch and I hear she was out to get Krillin for insurance fraud?, so that's A-OK!
And then he grabs #18's boobs, but she killed millions of people in the alternate timeline, so that's the least she could give up for her alternate self's atrocities!
Finally in Super, Roshi has stepped up his game even further and as we find out he has also acquired unfathomable power, so it makes sense he would be so incredibly aggressive now to the point, where he doesn't even hide it anymore and just takes whatever girl he wants, despite their protests.
However knowing full well he's about to jump off a slippery slope, he decides to train away his perversions, so he doesn't get to the point, where he crosses that unforgivable line.
Even at Toei they realized he was just about on the verge of going too far, so they give him one last despicable act to make his training that more meaningful or something
I'd love to see a series that has the middle ground of focusing on the new generation of fighters (Oob, Pan, Bra, Goten and Trunks), while also keeping Goku and Vegeta in the spotlight.
Akira Toriyama wrote: My policy is to try and forget things once they’re over. Since if I don’t discard the old and focus on what’s new, I’ll overload my brain capacity. I still haven’t lived down going, “Who the heck is Tao Pai-pai?” that one time I was talking with Ei’ichiro Oda-kun. But the fact that there are still people reading the series after all this time… All I can say is; “thank you.” Really, that’s all.

And that you also have IMMENSELY skewed and comically backwards priorities in what you think is most important and needed to make a good Dragon Ball story.

Kamiccolo9 wrote: Fair enough, I concede. Sean Schemmel probably has some kind of hidden talent. Maybe he is an expert at Minesweeper. You're right; calling him "talentless" wasn't fair.
Mind elaborating on that comment,i always see comment yet they don't go on detail on why the fanbase is terrible.
- Very good pre-production and planning, to ensure the schedule is as good as it can be, so that art and animation can be consistently good.
- A new character designer. I would like either more animation-friendly designs (they could completely adapt Toriyama's modern designs) or DBZ-like designs by Takahashi or Nakatsuru, with no skin and hair highlights.
- More blood. I know we will never get as much blood as we had in older shows but having BoG-RoF levels of blood consistently would already be enough. Goku hasn't bled once in Super, that's ridiculous.
My wildest hope is that the show starts from Dragon Ball Z episode 292. Hyping up DBZ's return could be huge for Toei, and the brand is undeniably stronger and more popular than Super.
But if that happens, i won't have my og GTxSuper crossover (assuming this edition erases the original one)
Doctor. wrote: Kill him off. Make him go on a trip. Have two different plotlines with Goku & Vegeta dealing with a larger threat outside of Earth and Pan & co dealing with a lesser threat on Earth; we could be more invested in Pan's and Oob's fight if their villain gets more screentime and is more charismatic to watch. Have Goku injure himself so badly he loses most of his powers either permanently or temporarily. The villain gets to him first and makes it so they can't reach Goku somehow.
Yo! Son Goku and Friends did that. Goku had Goten and Trunks fight Avo and Cado because he thought they'd be a good challenge for the kids.
Some didnt like it because back then the was the complain of the kids being shoved down the fans throats like the Saiyans Girls in the ToP.
Honestly it's Goku's story. I'm fine with them bringing in more characters but don't forget that when you get into that "next generation" motif it can be handled pretty bad. Super used Vegeta, Bulma, Kuriren, Roshi, Yamcha, Tenshinhan, Gohan, Chi Chi, 18 and 17 far more effectively than GT who focused on Goku, Pan, and a bit of Trunks. I don't need a young pan too be more central to the plot than Goten or Gohan ever were. The show is still Goku and honestly I think Vegeta should be the next major figure as he's a natural foil to Goku.
I prefer they end this with some status quo that is U7 won but there is some massive threat of either Freeza or one of the stronger universes on the horizon and that is the impetus for the start of the next series.
Lord Beerus wrote: I'd love to see a series that has the middle ground of focusing on the new generation of fighters (Oob, Pan, Bra, Goten and Trunks), while also keeping Goku and Vegeta in the spotlight.
Honestly this is the best way to do it. Completely removing Goku and some of the others out of the spotlight would annoy some people (Though its no big deal because people constantly cry and whine in this fan base anyway).
It's best to focus on the potential new gen characters (Uub, Pan, Bra, Goten, Trunks, Marron, possibly 17 three kids, Cabba, Kale, Caulifla, and others) while keeping Goku and co in the spotlight as well. Maybe incorporate teamwork more consistently in the series.
I can't think of anything worse than a Dragonball Next Generation style story. Frankly I'm only here for the antics of the cast we've grown up with throughout the series, I was just about okay with Gohan, then Goten and Trunks got rammed down our throats endlessly in the Buu saga and that nearly killed my interest dead.
If Uub manages to feel different to Kid Gohan, or Pan to a Kid Goku I'll be impressed, but I honestly can't see either of them feeling like their own characters, rather recycling older, more established and better loved characters personalities and tacking them on to a new body. As it is Goten barely feels like his own character.
For my money, a Super continuation is fine, I find it very hard to care about trying to make EoZ fit; if it got altered in some way so Uub isn't met until a few years later than planned I don't think I'd lose any sleep over it. The only thing that matters in the end is Goku going off to train Uub, not sure it matters if Pan is exactly four or Uub is exactly ten at this point, especially after the confusion with Bulla's birth comparitively to Pan's.
Vice wrote: "Look at all these characters getting some shine in the buildup for the tournament of power, maybe we'll get to see some other characters do some stuff instead of the same old shit."
Pretty much what Boruto is doing, focusing on the new generation(Sarada,Boruto, Mitsuki) while keeping Sasuke and Naruto in the spotlight.
Yep, I don't really love GT, in fact, I pretty much hate a lot of things about it, but I would love a remake of Dragon Ball GT, with all the new stuff we got thanks to Super, there is so much potential to make a much better GT than what we got two decades ago, for example:
"Goku never turns into a kid, the pilaf gang are adults now again from aging, the Black Star Dragon Balls, doesn't exist, yet the Grand Tour still happens, but to search for the Super Dragon Balls, which are now scattered across all 12 (or 18 universes), Baby still happens, but with a different backstory, and from U2, being at least SSJG tier, he would not take over Vegetas body either, SSJ4 would not happen Super 17 arc would be changed in a way so that only the villains re appear, except Frieza, who got revived by Goku, Super 17 won't happen either, instead a whole new android created by Dr Gero and Muu, the Shadow Dragons would still happen, but much stronger of course, Goku would not dissapear with Shenlong at the end, because it wouldn't really be the end yet."
I'm fine just bringing SSJ4 design into a new post-EOZ show, Kale-Broly way. Give the form to Trunks/Goten or some U6 Saiyans and that's it.
As long as we go away from the 'Goku and Vegeta' hsow i will take anything excluding a new generation story because the kids are uniteresting and bland characters.
But, I think Dragon Ball can do it better if given the chance to develop those characters first. I don't want to force the characters into main character roles unless they deserve it. That can only happen if those characters are developed and fandom growing to like them. Then, they could start moving Goku and Vegeta out of the spotlight.

Theoretically, sure there's a lot of neato ideas surrounding DBS. The problem is that the writing has consistently dropped the ball in that regard, instead just focusing on blatant fan service or just giving whatever character a power up because "Fuck it."
Z at least had some level of restraint, and the first half of that series is the strongest because there's a focus in developing its central characters (i.e. Remember when Kuririn wasn't completely useless?)., Super is a one-trick poney.

Episode #0457! Mike and Jake fire up the podcast cannons to take a look at the biggest examples of writers, producers, and marketers maybe perhaps thinking about possibly making some kind of relatively concrete statement about A True Canon™ for the Dragon Ball series. What are some of the trends in the phrasing we have seen over the years, and what does the most recent example tell us about what to expect in the future?
After the original serialization of the Dragon Ball manga, the animation team moved onward to Dragon Ball GT. Since then, various other stories have been told as comics and animated features, while other “stories” have been “told” as little more than anecdotes via interviews and guide book inclusions.
The purpose of this tidbit-filled mini-guide is to break down some of these fascinating details as they relate to the ultimate fates of certain Dragon Ball characters. Many of these come from original author Akira Toriyama himself, while others are simply thoughts and ponderings from other producers and staff members.
Detailed explanations of character fates that tell a complete story, such as manga-based or animated features like Episode of Bardock, will not be included.
In one of the earliest guide books for the franchise — the Adventure Special from 1987 — Akira Toriyama is asked what happened to the nefarious Rabbit Gang once the moon is destroyed by Jackie Chun (during the 21st Tenka’ichi Budōkai). Toriyama simply responded:
In the same Q&A from the Adventure Special, Toriyama is asked what happened to Tsuru-Sen’nin, the crane hermit, after he was sent flying by Kame-Sen’nin’s Kamehameha. Toriyama responded:
Much later on, the question of what happened to Tsuru-Sen’nin — this time alongside his brother Tao Pai-pai — is brought up again in 2004’s second kanzenban-based guide book, Dragon Ball Forever. Toriyama responded:
Ye~ah… they got mixed up in something or other and died, but they were bad people, so perhaps they weren’t restored to life…
Somewhat famously “forgotten” about (but not necessarily by who you think may have forgotten about her), poor Lunch never really seems to catch a break. Toriyama is asked about her in the same Q&A from Dragon Ball Forever, and specifically if she ever got to meet up with Tenshinhan again. Toriyama, in a rather noncommittal fashion, responded:
I wonder… Tenshinhan gave Lunch the cold shoulder, but she tenaciously persisted, and ultimately they were together! Couldn’t that be it? (laughs)
Continuing onward in the same Q&A from Dragon Ball Forever, Toriyama is asked if Yamcha was able to become happy. Toriyama responded, implying that Yamcha had perpetual bad luck with women:
Years later, as part of the hype-train build-up to the new film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, Fuji TV’s Mandō Kobayashi provided a series of questions to Akira Toriyama who responded in text for the 24 March 2013 episode. Kendō Kobayashi specifically asked for epilogue information about Yamcha, Tenshinhan, and Chiaotzu. For Yamcha, Toriyama responded:
Like you, KenKoba, he has the dilemma of loving women but not being good around them, so he is still wandering blindly in search of the ideal partner he won’t be nervous around. He’s even worked in a host club, but because of his nervousness, it didn’t go well and he was fired. His livelihood is mainly working together with Pu’er as a freelance bodyguard, but he occasionally goes to Tenshinhan’s to help with the farm, as well.
In the same response for Mandō Kobayashi, Toriyama provided the following story for Tenshinhan (and by extension Lunch), which pretty much keeps in line with what he hinted at — or at least seemed to hope for! — many years earlier in the Dragon Ball Forever Q&A:
Stoic Tenshinhan mainly does farming in addition to his training. He can split into multiple bodies and grow extra arms, so harvesting the crops goes quickly. He was found by Lunch, who fell in love with him at first sight and had been constantly pursuing his whereabouts, and even reluctantly lived together with her; but she wasn’t cut out for farming, and Tenshinhan has no interest in romance, so she left after just a few days. After that, it seems Lunch apparently stops in from time to time.
Wrapping up the trio of characters in his response for Mandō Kobayashi, Toriyama noted for Chiaotzu:
Naturally, he helps out with farming together with Tenshinhan, but his work utilizing his telekinetic powers has a reputation for its efficiency, and he is hired at an expensive rate by farmers nearby, so he apparently has a surprisingly large amount of money saved away.
Poor Lunch was further tossed aside in the manga when Toriyama erased her out of a cameo and instead replaced her with Artificial Human #17. In this scene, #17 is shown out and about with a shotgun. This scene is expanded upon in the TV adaptation with #17 “holding up” a couple guys, effectively making them raise their hands in the air to donate their energy to Son Goku’s Genki-Dama.
This “fate” was expanded upon many years later in a Q&A as a part of the “Full Color” release of the Cell arc manga in 2014. In the sixth Cell arc volume specifically, in addition to revealing the “real names” for both #17 and #18, Toriyama notes about #17:
He works in the wildlife preserve area of a gigantic royal nature park, as an outstanding guard who doesn’t hold back against poachers.
It’s an ideal job for #17, who loves to be on his own and isn’t big on cooperating with others; since he’s so good at his job, he takes in a high salary. He’s married to a zoologist; they have one child and two adopted children, and live happily in an isolated house inside the nature park.
He went and met #18 and Kuririn one time, but didn’t talk about what he’d been up to, maybe because he considers such a wholesome lifestyle embarrassing.
The first of Jump’s “Gold Selection” Dragon Ball Z Anime Special magazines was released in 1989, right as the Freeza arc was beginning its serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump. The magazine featured a comic drawn by Akira Toriyama that detailed his involvement with the TV adaptation as well as the way in which he created the manga.
Because of this, even I really don’t know just when the heck Dragon Ball will end, or what’s going to happen up ahead. Maybe I’ll even turn Goku into a geezer like this…
As Dragon Ball GT came to a close, a second and final volume of the Perfect File guide book series was released. In it, voice actress Masako Nozawa noted, regarding the recording of the final episode:
The scene where, after Goku finishes fighting, he rides on Shenlong, and says, “Shenlong’s back sure is warm…”. That’s because riding on Shenlong means that Goku’s going to leave this world, and go to the world of the gods…. I was glad that they didn’t write it plainly that he died, though…. I feel that Goku probably went to Shenlong’s place, and is training again.
The matter of what exactly happens to Goku — or, more appropriately — where he goes, in the subject of a larger discussion which is outlined on its own page here in our “Tidbits” section.
As a part of the official timeline for the now-defunct Korean MMO Dragon Ball Online, the story noted that in AGE 801 (which would place it 17 years after AGE 784 where the original manga ends with the 28th Tenka’ichi Budōkai and Goku’s departure with Oob):
Realizing his death is imminent, Goku, who wanted to settle their rivalry, left the Earth with Vegeta. Years later, a supernova explosion was detected; perhaps caused by Son Goku and Vegeta’s battle.

Summary: This is a solution to the Free Code Camp (FCC) advanced front-end development project task to create a computer game.
Notes: This is one of the advanced challenges included in the FCC Front-End Web Developer certification course. The requirement was to build a web version of the Simon electronic game. The current version only displays accurately on large screens, so I'll be revisiting it when I have the time to create a responsive version.
YOGA is just one of many ways to stay healthy. It has intimidating moments and sometimes a little help is needed.
Our skilled yoga practitioners can guide those of us with mild-moderate physical challenges to find our EDGE–the point that doesn’t hurt but still brings our bodies’ posture into optimal range for therapeutic benefit.
Experience mental clarity and deep relaxation. Learn safe and easy practices for vibrant living and empowered aging.
As a yoga therapist, I adapt the classical methods of yoga to foster holistic well-being. My role is to be an advocate for your health and for the highest vision that you have of your life (and sometimes to help you articulate and find that vision).
Private sessions include poses and breathing, and may incorporate meditation, visualizations, affirmations, dietary recommendations, and other lifestyle changes for your own personal wellness plan.
Limited to 4 or 5 students per class, I will be working with you to build a sequence that addresses physical issues, stress reduction, relaxation, and other concerns you would like to work on in your yoga practice.
Join me for Hula class and add a unique movement activity to your wellness plan. If you’ve never tried it, the experience just may surprise you!
Hula movements are especially helpful in moving the creative energy throughout the body. Many hula movements are meant to remind us to flow like the ocean. From our erect spines to our swaying hips, we move energy throughout all the chakras.
The music often focuses on the beauty of nature as it serves as a metaphor for birth, love, growth, loss, and death. The music can help to bypass the brain so that we can allow our hearts to open.
Class is for dancers and non-dancers. The focus is on creativity within the hula without an overemphasis on technique, as well as increasing the awareness of hidden emotions and their effect on our health.

This September, we were happy to organize the second edition of the Ladies Only BJJ Camp. We were thrilled to host a total of 35 girls, coming from all over Europe: Italy, Portugal, Ireland, United Kingdom, Croatia, Norway, Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands. Our guest trainer was no one less than Frontline’s black belt Eirin Nygren, a previous double gold brown belt European Champion, Copa Podio winner and most recently the runner-up World Champion at black belt Master’s this year.
Outside autumn had started with stormy weather and heavy rainfall, but we were ready to kick off the Friday evening session at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy Amsterdam! At 20:00 sharp, Eirin started off with a light warming-up, and then went straight on to the techniques. Since the training was with gi, she showed us some excellent guard passes, followed up by a choke from mount. Once everyone had practiced and Eirin helped everyone with the details, we rounded the session off with specific sparring.
Starting fresh on Saturday morning, it was time for the first no-gi class. Beginning from bottom this time, Eirin showed us a very basic though extremely useful way to handle an opponent who “pushes you down” in the closed guard, preventing you from moving. After this, it was time for one of her (and our) favourite submissions: the omo-plata. We learned a nice set-up for the regular omoplata, but also how to use it as a transition movement to a sweep. As a bonus, Eirin also showed us how to attack the other arm, making us feel like Michelle Nicolini at the Worlds 2014. Once techniques were done, it was time for some specific sparring from guard.
Before the break started, we had a little surprise for everyone. With help of Rainha Fightwear and BJJ Fightgear, two of our lovely sponsors, we had a goodiebag for everyone who attended the camp. They were filled with discount coupons, stickers, wristbands, soap and more. Double surprise: Rainha Fightwear put a little extra in some of the “lucky” goodiebags; such as a cool beanie, bright yellow tape and 1 girl was very lucky to receive a coupon for a free rashguard by Rainha! Happy with all the treats, everyone went for lunch and returned back for the gi session in the afternoon.
During the afternoon session, Eirin showed us her signature pass: the over-under pass. Being a featherweight herself, and the over-under pass being a “heavyweight type of pass”, it was very interesting to see how she was able to use this technique to work for her. We had a lot of practice with this pass and were able to use it when we finished the training with regular sparring. Eirin made sure to stay on the mat all the time and get in rolls with as many girls as possible.
Another surprise came after this session: Laurent Martroye from Ataste Açai came all the way from Belgium to bring us the most delicious treat after training! Delighted with this sweet and healthy açai smoothie, everyone had a seat and took a moment to enjoy.
In the evening, we explored a bit of Amsterdam and then took a boat across the water to the restaurant THT in the north of the city. Most of the girls joined us for dinner, and we had lovely food, some drinks and enjoyed the evening and each other’s company. Before we knew it, it was late and time to get some sleep for the last day of the camp.
We were a little bit sleepy-eyed in the morning, so Eirin decided to show some passing during this no-gi session as well. This way, we were able to fine-tune what we learned on Saturday, and got the chance to use these techniques in a no-gi setting as well. We did X-passes, windshieldwipers and of course the over-under pass. The class was finished with some specific sparring, before we headed for food after training.
The last gi session Eirin gave us 30 minutes to rehearse everything we learned that weekend. We could pick whatever we wanted to drill, whether it was one technique or everything we did. After the timer went off, she called everybody to the centre of the mat and gave us time to ask questions. Questions about the passes, sweeps and submissions we had learned, but also questions about other techniques we had. How to kill the lasso guard? How to pull guard? And also: did she have tips to prepare for a competition? How does she get her focus before and match and how does she keep it during the entire competition?
It was quiet as everyone listened to her stories and experiences, and it was great to hear and learn these experiences from her. When all was asked and done, we all got up and got ready for one last session of free sparring. The music was turned up, RibeiroPhoto – our cameraman – was walking around taking some last cool action shots, and we gave our all for one last time.
Then it was time to say goodbye. Hugs were given, selfies were taken and bags were packed. We had an amazing weekend and would like to thank everyone who attended the camp for helping it be so great. Also, we’d like to thank our sponsors for supporting this event: BJJ Academy Amsterdam, Rainha Fightwear, BJJ Fightgear, Ataste Acai and RibeiroPhoto; without your help this camp wouldn’t have been half as great. A massive thank you and a big round of applause: see you all back next year!
Lincoln County, its football program, its townfolk, and its legendary coach are featured in the new book "Backroads and Backfields" by GPB's Jon Nelson.
You may have seen Jon, often with a small camcorder, at many of our games during the past several years. Jon hosts Georgia Public Broadcasting's award-winning PrepSportsPlus show. He's been working on what became a 434-page book for several years, conducting many interviews during our Devils' unforgettable 2005 Championship Season.

I don’t know if it’s the relentless cold weather or what but I’ve not been feeling 100%. I really crave my time outside, preferably in the warm sun and that’s just not happening at the moment. The colder weather has also left me craving some heavier, starchier foods and felt like I was getting a little “puffy” and needed a little something to set me right again.
I decided to make a variation of my favorite Ginger Turmeric Detox Tea. The ingredients pack a powerful punch and act as an anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, antioxidant, lymph system cleanser and more! In this variation I’ve omitted the cayenne and substituted goji berries instead. The goji berries turn it the most vibrant color of orange and also make it taste DIVINE! You could keep the cayenne if you want, but I prefer this recipe without it. This detox tea works like a charm every time to get my body back on track and feeling great! It’s wonderful for water weight and puffiness that comes from overindulging too!
I’ve already talked about how amazing Lemon Water is on it’s own but just look at the added benefits you get when adding ginger, turmeric, and goji berries!
Ovarian Cancer Treatment: Ginger may be powerful weapon in the treatment of ovarian cancer. A study conducted at the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center found that ginger powder induces cell death in all ovarian cancer cells to which it was applied.
Colon Cancer Prevention: A study at the University of Minnesota found that ginger may slow the growth of colorectal cancer cells.
Morning Sickness: A review of several studies has concluded that ginger is just as effective as vitamin B6 in the treatment of morning sickness.
Motion Sickness Remedy: Ginger has been shown to be an effective remedy for the nausea associated with motion sickness.
Reduces Pain and Inflammation: One study showed that ginger has anti-inflammatory properties and is a powerful natural painkiller.
Heartburn Relief: Ginger has long been used as a natural heartburn remedy. It is most often taken in the form of tea for this purpose.
Cold and Flu Prevention and Treatment: Ginger has long been used as a natural treatment for colds and the flu. Many people also find ginger to be helpful in the case of stomach flus or food poisoning, which is not surprising given the positive effects ginger has upon the digestive tract.
Migraine Relief: Research has shown that ginger may provide migraine relief due to its ability to stop prostaglandins from causing pain and inflammation in blood vessels.
When combined with cauliflower, it has shown to prevent prostate cancer and stop the growth of existing prostate cancer.
May prevent and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease by removing amyloyd plaque buildup in the brain.
It is a potent natural anti-inflammatory that works as well as many anti-inflammatory drugs but without the side effects.
Because of its anti-inflammatory properties, it is a natural treatment for arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Cancer Prevention: One of the best benefits of brightly colored berries, like goji berries, is that they contain high levels of antioxidants which are extremely effective in fighting cancer. When you eat goji berries, the antioxidants seek out and remove cancer causing free radicals in the blood.
Heart Disease and Cholesterol: Another benefit that the antioxidants they provide is that they lower bad cholesterol levels and protect the heart from disease. Goji berries also contain fiber and higher fiber consumption has been linked with a lower risk of high cholesterol and heart attack.
Anti-Aging: Slowing the aging process can be achieved by eating certain types of foods and the antioxidants contained within goji berries have been linked with wrinkle reduction and slower aging. Also, longevity may be increased because of the disease and illness prevention that naturally occurs when antioxidants are consumed.
Eye Health: Goji berries contain vitamin A, zeaxanthin, and beta-carotene, all of which have been associated with healthier eyes. These compounds protect your eyesight, and they also prevent certain eye conditions such as macular degeneration.
Better Sleep: Regular consumption of goji berries can help to improve sleep. If you are suffering from insomnia, try eating goji berries on a daily basis and your sleep patterns will likely improve.
Stress Relief: Research has found that goji berries may relieve stress and promote a sense of calm, happiness, and well-being by reducing the amount of cortisol released in the body during periods of stress. (source)
In a large blender add about a quart (32 ounces) of water and your goji berries. Let sit for several hours until the goji berries are plump and hydrated. I usually do this the night before. Just fill the blender with water and add the goji berries. I’ll let it sit on the counter or in the fridge overnight. The exact amount of water is not important. Just that the goji berries have time to absorb the water and become soft. Then blend the mixture well and then pour through a nut milk bag or a paint straining bag into a large 80 ounce pitcher. You can get 1 gallon paint straining bags, 2 for $2 at your local Lowe’s or Home Depot. Squeeze the remaining liquid through the bag and voilà, you are left with gorgeous goji juice!! Alternately, you could use a mesh strainer but I’ve found the nut milk/paint straining bags to be much more effective. My directions make it sound a lot more complicated than it is, but believe me, it takes just minutes!
Then, in a juicer, juice your ginger root, turmeric, and lemons. I recommend using Breville brand juicers. I love Breville because they are easy to use, easy to clean, and great quality!
In your large pitcher add the ginger+turmeric+lemon juice, goji juice, and enough water to fill. Then add stevia to taste. Mix well with a wooden spoon and adjust flavors as needed. Let sit for about 10 mins before serving to let the flavors blend. Will last about 5 days in the fridge.
**If you are using powder ingredients only, you’ll want to prepare the herbs as you would loose leaf tea. Boil hot water and add to the powders and let sit until room temp. Then add your lemon, goji juice, and stevia to taste.
You can enjoy your Goji Detox Tea at room temperature or over ice. This tea is sweet, tangy and slightly spicy! It always helps me “get back to normal” after travelling or going off my diet. I tend to get puffy and retain water and this tea helps flush out my lymphatic system and reduce swelling. I absolutely love it and I hope you do too!
If you can’t find fresh turmeric root or ginger root at your local health food store or Asian Market, you can purchase them in powder form through iherb.com – use my discount code WAG472 to get $5 OFF your first order + free shipping on orders of $20 or more!!

I’m so excited about today’s giveaway! As many of you know, I’ve taken a little break from blogging this summer and what better way to come back then to be featuring a delicious, healthy snack and offering an absolutely AMAZING GIVEAWAY!!! I think this might be the best giveaway I’ve ever done!!
The kind folks over at SkinnyPop were generous enough to reach out and send me some of their delicious ready-to-eat popcorn to help me prep for the Austin City Limits Music Festival! I have to admit that I’ve never been a huge popcorn fan. I remember all my friends would love to order popcorn at the movies and my mom would made it regularly as a snack, but I was never a huge fan…
I saw SkinnyPop for the first time earlier this year at Costco and after looking at the clean ingredient list: popcorn, sunflower oil, salt, decided to try it. I figured I probably wouldn’t like it, but I actually really enjoyed it! It’s nothing like the artificial stuff I remember growing up. I think what I didn’t like about movie popcorn and microwave popcorn were the weird artificial flavors (remember that bright yellow “butter” sauce?!) and the hard texture. SkinnyPop is genuinely light and fluffy and yummy!
I always tell my clients to pay attention to how they feel after they eat. You should feel good and light and energized by your food and not heavy, tired or weighed down because that’s an indication that your body is having a hard time digesting! My body still feels great after eating SkinnyPop and that’s how I know it’s a good fit for me!
The first weekend of Austin City Limits is this weekend and I always try to get festival-ready by eating clean and getting lots of nutrients because I know that I’m not going to have access to clean, nutritious food at the festival!! The perfect snack for me right now is a green juice (the one pictured is kale, pineapple, cucumber, green apple, spinach, and lemon – so good) and some SkinnyPop popcorn!
During Austin City Limits, SkinnyPop will be offering free pedicab rides around the festival grounds every day from noon – 9PM, so festival-goers can get a lift from one end of the festival to the next (a life saver after all that walking!) and receive a complimentary bag of SkinnyPop!
SkinnyPop is also giving away TWO 3-Day Passes to Weekend 2 of Austin City Limits Music Festival, Oct 9-11th!!!
To enter, simply follow the instructions below. One lucky winner will be announced on Monday, October 5th! Good Luck!!

One of my favorite ways to clean out the fridge and use up any extra produce is to juice it! You just need fruit, veg, and lemon/lime to make a delicious combo!
This juice isn’t fancy but it’s delicious, nutritious and loaded with antioxidants! It is super refreshing and will give you a nice little burst of energy after drinking it!
Feel free to throw in or substitute whatever you have. Grapes, baby carrots, strawberries, even green beans! And, if you have backyard chickens like we do, be sure to give them the leftover pulp. They love it!
You can see all of my juice recipes here. If you are interested in getting started with a juice cleanse start here!

HAPPY NATIONAL ICED TEA DAY!! In honor of one of my favorite beverages, I wanted to share this article, originally posted March 2011. This recipe is BURSTING with antioxidants, is sugar-free, and tastes amazing!! Enjoy!!
Nothing says summer in the South like Sweet Tea. The sun is shining, kids are swimming, birds are chirping, and it’s time to play! Here in Austin, the weather is heating up and spring is officially in full force.
With weather in the upper 80’s today, I was in the mood for something clean, cool, & crisp. The answer, Iced Sweet Tea!! But you know me, always health minded, I decided to forgo the heaps of sugar for a healthier, sugar-free version. I got a little creative and gave my tea a twist by using Harney & Sons Chinese Flower (Green Tea with flowers and lemon). Let me tell you, it is AWESOME as an iced tea!!!
I actually don’t care for the taste of the Chinese Flower Blend as a hot tea but it’s a definite keeper as ICED Tea! I love this brand, they have the cutest tea sachets and come in a really lovely tin. An excellent gift idea…hint, hint! 😉
So what’s so great about green tea anyway? Green tea is bursting with antioxidants. Antioxidants help protect your cells from damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals. Free radicals are by-products of our normal body functions. They are constantly formed and then destroyed by antioxidants throughout our lifetime.
The problem is, through exposure to things like cigarette smoke, radiation, pesticides, environmental pollution, food additives and even regular household chemicals (like cleaning products, perfumes, paint, out-gassing from carpets, dry cleaning, etc.) free radicals begin to accumulate excessively in the body. Eventually these free radicals will exceed our body’s ability to fight them off. If we don’t have enough antioxidant supply, the extra free radicals will invade the healthy tissues around them and attack healthy cells. As a result, our health will suffer from cancers, cardiovascular diseases, immune deficiencies and other health problems.
So, be a good girl/boy and load up on antioxidants!! The best way is through the diet. Green Tea is a great source as well as all berries (blueberries, cranberries, strawberries, blackberries, cherries etc.), apples (an apple a day keeps the doctor away!), pecans, artichokes, broccoli, & kale just to name a few. Load up with plenty of fruits and vegetables at each meal and you should be covered 🙂
To make this fabulous, antioxidant rich Sweet Tea, simply add 4-5 Chinese Flower Tea sachets to about 2 quarts of boiling water. Let steep for 3 mins. Serve chilled over ice with a squeeze of liquid stevia and garnish with sliced lemon.
I always order my stevia through iherb.com they have the absolute best prices!! I like NuNaturals brand alcohol free liquid stevia, it’s the best tasting. Be sure to use my discount code WAG472 to get $5 off your first order!

I have liked designing since I was a child, and since I learned how to create a beautiful design. I started to design 5 years ago. My designs are usually inspired by American apparel, brands, and unique outfits that touched my heart!!
You know that feeling you get? That one where you finally have had enough of your summer break, take yourself into school, and look at the blank walls of your new year’s classroom, just itching to fill it with colour and decorations and a reading corner and intriguing objects and all sorts of learning? Isn’t there the slightest chance that your students might walk in on day one and feel the same way?
I wrote a blog post about the need for students to be given the opportunity to set up their own learning space, not to walk in on the first day and see that their new classroom belongs to someone else. It is imperative that students know that you, their teacher, view the room as ‘our space’, not ‘my space’.
At the beginning of this school year, I left my Grade 5’s classroom alone. This was a challenge for me because usually I enjoy preparing the space and setting it up ready for learning, but it turns out that my students can do that better than me. Here are my tips for enabling students to be part of setting up their learning space at the beginning of the year.
Leave the room as bare are you can possibly manage before students arrive. Make it neat and clean but not set up. Have resources such as books and furniture organised but not placed. You might have welcoming items such as rugs or canopies available to be set up.
Sort out your own important things, like your assessment folders or filing system. I challenge you to take up half as much room as last year with your own ‘area’. (Next year halve it again. Keep going every year until you don’t have an area).
In the initial days of school, discuss together with your class what both the teacher and the individual students think a learning environment needs. Have students consider all the things they think they might do in the room, all the things they need out of the room and the ways it might be used. You’ll notice not many kids say “amazing wall display with the theme of *insert recent Disney movie here*”. Have students record the look, sound and feel of this room, using a simple Y-chart.
If you frame this conversation and your questions carefully, you will steer the conversation to a deep level. “What do you think helps you learn best in a classroom?” rather than “What do you want in your classroom?” will avoid the popular yet unrealistic dream of classroom rollercoaster or jumping castle.
Having this discussion will be essential in setting the tone for what the class believes is important in a space for learning – owned by the students, not the teacher. This is where the quiet kid gets to say “I need a space to be on my own sometimes” and the kid with difficulty hearing gets to say “I like when we sit in a circle because I can see people when they talk”. It’s when a group of students articulate for themselves that “We write better when it’s quiet” and “Table groups of six are too distracting”. It’s when the teacher explains “We need some space and materials to build and create and get messy” so that students know that this is part of learning, too.
As students discuss and explain these ideas, list the physical materials and objects, the spaces or zones, and the arrangements mentioned.
When I did this with my class both they and I were surprised to find that lots of them had very similar ideas of what they wanted out of the ‘vibe’ of the space… there was lots of discussion about sound and atmosphere that continues to drive the way they interact in the room now.
Have your students work in small groups to consider all the ideas that have been presented, then draw what they think would be the optimal way to arrange the physical space. If you have engaged students in effective and realistic discussion, this should be the easy part. They simply transfer what they (and others) consider to be the important elements of a learning environment
You might like to put some parameters on this depending on your students (or your own confidence). You might start next term by just having your students decide how they could rearrange their tables or floor space.
An example of a group’s classroom design. Their book cave idea made it into the design created later that day.
Find a way of having students vote on the options. I find that hot-dotting works perfectly for this. Each student takes 2 or 3 dot stickers and sticks them on the options they like best. The one with the most dots becomes… NOT the winner. It becomes the first arrangement, the trial, the practise.
Make sure students understand that this is not the last way the room will look, nor will it be perfect in every way. Explain that the class will review it and make changes often, according to how the space is working for current needs and how people are working within in.
Then let them set it up. Yes, it will be loud. Yes, it will get worse before it gets better. But they will get there. I promise they will. There’s nothing like 25 kids moving furniture on the first day of school for a teamwork exercise.
Last year I had my students decorate their book corner. Somehow, some flying hotdogs were suggested and the idea was greeted with a cheer. They were made and even though it is honestly the strangest decoration I’ve ever seen, the kids would always have a giggle looking up at those hotdogs as they sat in the book corner. If one little decoration brings a few extra laughs a day, perfect. They probably wouldn’t have been giggling at my perfectly laminated cartoon books and Dr Seuss quote.
This year’s reading cave is very popular. It drives me crazy because it’s not how I would have made it, but the grade loves it and they use the space really well, so it stays! The shelves now display the books we are focusing on currently, and one of the kids brought in a succulent to put on top to make the book area ‘feel more relaxing’.
When I met my class this year for the first time (on day 2 of school as I unfortunately was not there on their first day in the classroom) they talked about how they felt when they walked in to their classroom the previous day (day 1 of school) for the first time. Remember, I had left it as bare as I possible could. They described it as dull, boring, plain. When I asked them how they felt about the room after they had spent time setting it up, they used words like exciting, helpful, fun. I asked whether they were happy or not that I had left it to them, and the consensus was that “every teacher should let their kids set up the room so they can get it how they like it”. So there you have it.

At the beginning of each school year, my Pinterest feed fills up with tons of pictures that fall under the heading of “Classroom Inspiration”. Teacher friends will send pictures of their freshly decorated rooms to each other with questions about where to put the book corner. Ikea experiences a massive spike in sales of those giant canopy leaves and Officeworks sell out of laminating pockets.
Thousands of teachers begin creating themes for their rooms. Jungle theme. Space theme. Harry Potter theme. Garden theme. The list goes on. Sometimes I wonder if some teachers might have been better suited to being window dressers.
Similar to classroom themes, many teachers will spend days and days before the students arrive setting up every aspect of the classroom, plastering their walls, floors and ceiling with posters and decorations. I’ve been there, and I’ve dragged my mum with me.
There was a time when I thought this was a cute idea, a nice thing to do for students by teachers who were willing to spend their time, money and energy creating an amazing-looking space ready for day one. I myself must have spent hundreds of dollars and hours on my classroom in my first year, spending my nights laminating and my weekends at Ikea or scouring Pinterest for ways to make it look more “enchanting” (I remember this being the word I wanted to describe my first ever classroom for my preps).
But every year I chuck out a bit more stuff. Every year I find more things I made or bought that were never looked at or used. Every year I notice the way the kids don’t notice it all. Every year I’ve learned more about how kids learn best, and surprise, surprise, hand-painted Hogwarts Express mural across an entire wall, little owls hanging from the ceiling above every table, with pencils carved into wand shapes aren’t on the list, no matter how magical or enchanting they may be.
So what does the classroom need in it? After listening to Will Richardson’s presentation ‘Old School to Bold School’, I was challenged to list the things I believe contribute most powerfully to student learning. He shared a list of responses he’d heard over and over again from teachers. You can read this below. Most likely if you were asked to write a list yours would look similar to this because we know these are the things that matter.
As I started to consider how I might set up my new room this year, I was reminded of this presentation and the things that matter most in learning environment.
Einstein famously said “I never teach my pupils. I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn.” Obviously, this is not only about the physical environment, but we cannot deny that the physical environment has a huge impact on the way students act and interact in their school day. So, if we believe the role of the teacher to be to create the conditions for learning, or to model how to learn best, we must ask ourselves…
Teachers should curate their space and resources extremely carefully so that the room works in harmony with how we know students learn best. This should be our only focus.
Would you decorate your kitchen with mermaids, shells, blue crepe paper hanging from the ceiling and deck chairs and expect to cook better? No? Then it is unlikely that decorating your classroom with an ‘Under the Sea’ theme will make your students learn better.
ensure an attractive, easy-to-access, visible display of a variety of texts for students to browse and choose from
put resources and equipment (like stationery or games) within reach of the students that use it, rather than locking it away in a cupboard (to only be bestowed with the teacher’s permission).
Some teachers will argue that decorating the space makes it more fun or inviting. That might be so, but is there the risk that the purpose of the classroom space is lost in amongst all the shells and vines? When a student walks into a room that is themed or extremely decorated for the first time, they might be wowed and feel like they are in a fun classroom, and that’s great. But what happens when the fun wears off and there’s just a lot of clutter, a lot of teacher-owned items and not a lot of items or space where students feel true connection and control? How can they take ownership in a space so clearly owned by another?
Kath Murdoch, in The Power of Inquiry (2015), say that ‘setting the room up before the students arrive actually deprives them of an important opportunity to develop a sense of shared ownership of, and commitment to, their environment’.
I remember how one of my university tutors, Narelle Lemon, was talking to my uni class about setting up classroom communities. As we listened, horrified, she explained how at the start of each year, she would welcome her new class into an empty classroom with bare walls, the chairs stacked in the corner and the tables all pushed up against the wall.
I really believe that an important part of classrooms is student ownership in the space and culture. This requires the (oftentimes challenging) feat of teachers loosening their grip and giving some measure of control to students over the space they work in. So another question comes to mind…
This question has been on my mind for a few years now and I’ve been dipping my toes in, slowly relinquishing more and more control to my students over their learning space. Unsurprisingly, the ground hasn’t yet fallen out from under me.
At the beginning of the 2017 school year, I will be diving in and experimenting with setting up (almost) nothing at all in my classroom and working with the grade to collectively and carefully make decisions about our space. Watch this space for a follow-up post to see how this goes, both pedagogically and logistically.
‘Creating an inviting classroom means reflecting comfort and productivity throughout the daily routine’ (Fountas and Pinnell, 2001. p89). Considering that, I think some of the keys to creating an inviting and practical space will be:
Guiding students to create areas that are important to how the class will work, e.g. a classroom library or meeting space on the floor.
Having good quality furnishings and items (throw away the dirty old floor rugs and the sad looking cushions) that students can choose from to set up and furbish.
Making sure that students have the resources and freedom to own the space aesthetically, to add their personal touch (for example, last year one of my students brought in some little cupcake cushions that adorned our book corner and made it cheery, another time a lamp was brought in for a dark corner).
Creating zones or different areas for different purposes. Read more about ways you can do this here.
This post is not to discourage teachers from the effort they put in or discredit that work. I think most people agree that teachers give their heart and souls to their job, and sometimes this looks like dreaming up and creating a beautiful classroom space for their students to walk into on the first day. But is this the best way to expend our effort? Think back to that earlier list. These are the things that truly make a difference to student learning, so it’s time to re-direct that effort towards the things that make the most difference, the things that really matter.

Having moved this year from a modern open plan, flexible learning area school, to a classroom in an old red brick building built in 1922, I have had some new challenges with learning spaces.
I have been considering and implementing the notion of ‘Campfires in Cyberspace’, a term coined by David D. Thornburg The Campfires in Cyberspace theory considers the ways humans have interacted and learned since the dawn of time and applies them to classrooms to suggests ways teachers can create learning spaces that cater to a range of needs – mainly the campfire, the watering hole and the cave. The original paper discusses how we can use these learning spaces on a digital level, but often classrooms don’t even cater to these spaces at the physical level.
Kath Murdoch, in The Power of Inquiry (2015), says that “We send clear messages to students, parents and the wider community about what we value through how we choose to use our learning spaces… The agreements we make about the use of physical environments also impact on student learning.” She goes on to provide the example that if we force students to sit at their own table and that they must do so for all tasks, we remove many opportunities for flexible groupings, collaboration and choice… the message being that we need to be thoughtful and purposeful about the way we arrange our classrooms and allow students a large degree of input into these decisions.
The campfire is about storytelling – a place for a community of learners to sit together and listen to each other and learn from experts and storytellers. This may or may not be the teacher. The campfire encourages whole group discussion.
I believe this idea of a campfire as a place for storytelling puts a lot of onus on the teacher to provide engaging and thought-provoking stories, questions and teaching. It means teachers are not there to dispense information like a vending machine but to create a narrative for learning both old and new ideas.
In a classroom, a campfire will often be the place everyone usually meets, in front of a board or screen. However, it is important to challenge this; a campfire should be regarded as a meeting of the whole group in which to listen and share, so in my classroom this often looks like a fishbowl around a table or a circle on the floor. Classes might also have online spaces that act as a campfire where the whole class views ideas and responds in a shared space, like a Padlet wall or on Edmodo.
The watering hole is a place for learning from peers. It is less formal than a campfire and in it people gather in smaller groups to share ideas at their point of need.
In the classroom this might physically look like a group of tables where students work together, a nook filled with cushions or simply the spare bit of carpet no other group has taken yet. A watering hole might also occur in digital contexts such as shared Google Docs where teams of students work in the same space.
The cave is simply an area to be alone and to reflect or work independently, without interruption or distraction from others. It provides isolation, something that can often be difficult to obtain in a classroom. I have seen one teacher who draped a brown piece of fabric over a couple of chairs, added a couple of plants out the front and made a beautiful dark little cave for students to retreat into. Sometimes caves are this elaborate, sometimes they are simply a comfy chair or a corner where a student sits alone. What is important is that students have, and know they have, the option to be alone to think, work or reflect.
A student working in a ‘cave’ which is really out bag area, but is a perfect space for working alone and tucking away.
When I started discussing Campfires in Cyberspace with my students they had ideas about other ways we physically organise ourselves in the classroom. They thought we needed some more names for these spaces. It is so important to allow students to take ownership over the way we run and organise the classroom, so I encouraged them to develop their own ideas and the results were the following additions to the spaces.
Students talked about how sometimes we need a group with the teacher when we get stuck on a task or concept. From here they decided that you can get stuck in a swamp and you need someone to help you out of it. The swamp is now the official name for a teacher group of students who want some more guidance and don’t feel ready to work independently on a task. They “get in the swamp” and we “squelch around with some learning” until they are ready to get out and get going on their own.
Since this started it has evolved to include small groups of students supporting each other when they need help. It’s not uncommon to hear phrases like “I just swamped with Dave and now I get the maths” or “Can anyone make a swamp with me about using rhetorical questions?”.
We talked about needing a name for when everyone is working independently, spread out wherever they need to be, not bothering anyone else and working on their own thing. This was dubbed “The Plains”. Students thought that this is like a Savannah where you might see a zebra here, a lion there, a giraffe over yonder, but all the animals are just doing their thing, relaxing in the sun or munching on some grass and sticking to themselves. This is such a calm and lovely metaphor. It takes away the teacher-controlled notion of ‘silent work’ and replaces it with independent purpose.
It is important to both provide these spaces and have your students know where they are, what they are for and how they can use them most effectively. In my classroom we have discussed learning spaces at length and negotiated different ways we can use the spaces and respect peers in these spaces. Student ownership of the concept is key.

I wrote this for a 12 Days of Christmas celebration on Rita and Dani's blogs. My theme was Five Gold Rings ... Stolen by a Highwayman. In case you missed it, here it is again.
Insanity must run in the family. How else to explain her father’s obsession with Mesopotamian antiquities and her own current escapade? Disguising herself as a highwayman and holding up a coach in the December 23rd twilight was hardly a rational act, but Harriet had a good reason: to save herself from a forced marriage to a much older man, a collector even dottier and more ancient than her sire. He probably drooled.
If she had any sense, she’d go home now. Though a little hazy about the laws of marriage, she was pretty sure the bride had to consent. But she wanted her beloved, exasperating father to have the Christmas gift he was expecting, the Assyrian warrior’s ring Lord Ashburn had offered in exchange for a wife forty years his junior. And since Lord Ashburn had proposed this despicable arrangement, she felt little compunction about robbing him.
The sound of hooves told her the visitor to Holton Hall had turned off the main road. A pair of horses, she thought. She cocked her pistol and hoped Ashburn hadn’t bothered with an armed escort for the short drive out of London.
“Let’s go, Argent,” she whispered, and propelled her horse round the laurels into the road. “Stop!” she shouted, in the deepest voice she could manage. It came out a bit croaky, as though she had a sore throat.
The vehicle was a curricle, not what she expected an elderly earl to drive. On the other hand, the fact that the driver was alone, without even a groom, must be an advantage when it came to daylight robbery. She’d have the treasure off him in no time, and gallop home with plenty of time to change into her oldest, plainest evening gown to greet their guest for dinner. Since Ashburn wouldn’t have the ring, her father wouldn’t insist on the marriage. Still, it was safer to make herself as unalluring as possible.
“Stand and deliver!” she cried, which she understood was the correct greeting for a highwayman. “Don’t move or I’ll blow your head off,” she added for good measure, in case the poor man didn’t understand. He might well be weak in the brainbox to have agreed to such a ridiculous marriage contract.
The chestnut pair drew to a halt, snorting breath into the frigid air. “Are you sure you can hit me?” the driver asked. “I’ve never yet encountered a woman who could shoot worth a damn.” Disobeying her order, he leapt down from the bench and Harriet got a good look at him: a tall, powerful figure with windswept black hair, a penetrating pair of dark eyes, and a faint smile on very nicely shaped lips. His face was not much below hers, even when she was mounted on Argent, and he didn’t appear frightened, or even mildly alarmed.
A couple of things became clear. Lord Ashburn, if this was he, was unlikely to suffer any symptoms of senility. He wasn’t old – twenty-five or thirty at a guess. Neither was he weak-minded. He’d penetrated her disguise with insulting ease.
Being held up, in daylight, on the approach to a private manor house in a quiet part of Surrey, seemed delightfully improbable. The fact that his assailant was female greatly improved a dreary journey to a dull visit duty. The highwaywoman (if that was a word) has a good seat on a horse and long graceful legs, revealed by well-fitting breeches. Though she wore a back mask over her eyes, he could tell she was young and pretty.
“I’m an excellent shot,” she said, no longer troubling to disguise her voice. A lady of quality and, if he judged correctly, slightly peeved.
“In that case,” he replied, “I’d better do whatever you ask.” He let his gaze slide down to her bosom, hidden, alas, beneath a heavy riding coat. “I can think of a number of ways I’d be happy to accommodate you.”
Well-shaped red lips pursed in shock at his deliberate leer and suggestive words. She recovered gamely and brandished her weapon. “What you can do is empty your pockets.”
“Don’t wave your gun that like that. Keep it pointed at me. That way, if it goes off by accident you’re bound to miss.”
Not really wishing to test the truth of her assertion and curious to see where this adventure would lead, Ashburn fished his purse from his pocket and held it out, but she shook her head. “What else do you have?”
The reason for his visit, the curious antique ring, five strands of gold intricately braided and topped with a lion’s head, lay on his open palm. The girl would have snatched it, but he closed his gloved fist. “No. I must deliver it to Sir John Holton as my uncle commanded. They were friends and rival collectors and he wanted Sir John to have it. Even a desperate villain like yourself must respect a deathbed promise.”
How typical of her father! No doubt the death of an earl had been reported in the newspapers, but Sir John lived in an extremely distant past. Harriet doubted if the new Lord Ashburn was aware of the agreement his predecessor had made.
She looked at Ashburn again and, with a pang of regret, lowered the pistol. “Take it to him, then. I wouldn’t wish to thwart a man’s last wish.”
“A rogue with a conscience.” He smiled as he replaced the ring in his pocket and she felt an odd tightness in her chest.
Neither did he make any move to return to the curricle and complete his journey. His smile widened. “I had an odd letter from Sir John,” he said. “He offered me his daughter’s hand in marriage in exchange for the ring.”
“Have. I have no desire for a bride. Especially not Miss Harriet Holton who must be an elderly spinster with a face like a cod if she has to get a husband this way.” The blackguard stood with his hands on his hips, laughing at her, and looking impossibly handsome. “Touched in the head, as well, “he continued. “Mad as a march hare. One knife short of a canteen.”
“I’m glad to see you amuse yourself.” She gathered her reins, anxious to get home and change into the new gown she’d been saving for the Twelfth Night assembly. “I must leave.”
“Places to go, people to rob?” he asked, seizing the cheek strap of Argent’s bridle to prevent her escape.
“I doubt I will.” Ashburn unclasped her right hand from the reins and tugged off her riding glove. His lips were warm and his breath hot against her wrist, and then her palm. “I have a sudden desire to spend the feast at Holton Hall.”

Read more about The mathematic model of the microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) method for waterflooded formations
In this investigation we analyzed MEOR method by means of mathematic modeling. In particular, the mechanism of microbial effect on formation is analyzed, various groups of activity products are separated, and their effects on formation hydrodynamic characteristics are defined experimentally. For this purpose, the mathematic model was built for description of the formation bacteria growth during water flooding. The time-dependence for bacteria (biomass), molasses and metabolites concentrations was founded, and the time of microbial effects was defined.

Each Wednesday, we’ll try to post a word or phrase in one of our new languages (Slovak and Romani) that will give you a glimpse into the place we’re going.
MEANING: “Thank you” – a very helpful word to know, especially when you remember that when you’re just beginning a language, this might be the only word out of a conversation that someone actually recognizes.
Prosím is one of those words that pulls double duty in lots of languages – it means both “please” (like the magic word, “Can I please have that ice cream??”) and an informal way to say “you’re welcome.”
In 1971 a Washington pair started doing very well. One of the two, Henry Itkin, was an early partner of Steve Robinson and was supposedly pretty good. The other, Kenny Rhodes, was not as strong a player. Their results were consistently fantastic. People were sure they were cheating. Steve and Peggy Parker played with them in some teams. Peggy started keeping a record of their results with their bidding. As she was a friend of theirs Peggy was able to kibitz them and record some amazing sequences.
When this was happening friend of mine, Greg Roberts, talked me into driving with him to Cincinnati to play with him for the last few days. I heard Itkin and Rhodes were going to be there for the last two days. I went to the chief tournament director, John Hamilton, and told him a pair was going to show up who have a 450 (on a 325 average) on Saturday. He had people watching them, but they couldn’t see anything. Sure enough, they won the event. As Henry and Kenny didn’t know anybody else there, they asked Greg and me to play with them in the Swiss team. I accepted thinking I might see something in their results. We didn’t win or come in second, but the only mistake they had committed I could see was they had played two hearts in a five-two fit which went down instead of playing one no trump which made. Even that shouldn’t be classified as an error. They were playing forcing no trump and looking at the two hands it was difficult to judge which was the better contract.
The next weekend was a Washington sectional. During the tournament Steve Robinson figured out what they were doing. I could explain it, but that doesn’t seem wise. I’ll just mention that usually Kenny signaled because Henry was much better and quicker at receiving. Kenny could ask about specific holdings in certain suits. We told the chief director, Jerry Machlin, what they were doing. From what I remember once they knew the system some of the directors could tell what Kenny’s hand had.
Jerry had a committee meet on Sunday night to decide what the penalty should be. Given we knew their system and had many hand records, Henry and Kenny confessed. We decided on a lifetime ban with a review after five years. Henry did appeal and play afterward when he could, but he was not that good anymore and eventually dropped out of bridge. I don’t think Kenny even tried to return. .
I can never understand why people cheat in a situation like you describe. Perhaps if your living depends on it you might be driven to it. But what is the point of cheating when you are just playing to enjoy yourself. It seems to defeat the whole purpose of the challenge of the game. Well I suppose there might be a challenge in trying to invent a foolproof method like devising the perfect crime.
You missed the “kicker” which you probably did not know about. Under interrogation, one (or both) stated they were doing an undercover story on cheating for The Bridge World Magazine. I recall Edgar laughing as he related the story — as it was news to him!
Linda – Supposedly Henry did it because he felt he was a better bridge player than those doing well, yet he wasn’t winning. By showing he could win he raised his sense of self esteem. I think Kenny didn’t give a damn how he won.
Judy – I was very involved and am still in contact with Steve Parker. I was a member of the committee and don’t remember their claiming that. When we showed our evidence I don’t remember their offering any defense. Somehow that myth must have originated well after the fact.
I remember the night well, particularly how many of the “insiders” were focused more on the drama that was unfolding than on playing bridge — which helps to explain how Mark and I rolled up a 240 or so and won the event going away.
Small consolation, however, for the black mark on bridge, the self-inflicted damage suffered by Henry and Kenny, and the disappointment of their friends, myself included. BTW, Kenny has played occasionally since his reinstatement.

"The Mystical Positivist," is dedicated to the application of reason in the pursuit of spiritual practice and development. I look to this format to be challenging and a bit controversial in that the New Age community tends to have an overly romantic picture of the gritty pursuit of spiritual transformation. My thesis is that rationality is in no way the antithesis of deep mystical experience, in fact, I assert that it is a necessary ally - hence the blog name "Mystical Positivist."
The Mystical Positivist is now a weekly radio show on KOWS-LP 107.3 FM, Occidental, CA. Listen live on Saturday evenings from 4:00 - 6:00pm, PST, via the web at KOWS Live Stream.
A discussion with Timothy Conway, Ph.D. Timothy Conway, Ph.D., spiritual teacher, author and educator, living with his wife in Santa Barbara, California, has for over 30 years facilitated radical spiritual awakening. He has studied and practiced the non-dual essence of our sacred traditions for nearly 40 years, meeting enlightened masters in many traditions along the way. His books include Women of Power and Grace: Nine Astonishing, Inspiring Luminaries of Our Time, the forthcoming 2-volume India's Sages on nondual devotion and wisdom, and a trilogy of books on Spirituality in the New Millennium.
The Mystical Positivist is a weekly radio show on KOWS-LP FM 107.3 Occidental, CA, and on the web at KOWS-LP Live Feed, Saturdays from 4 - 6pm PST. Coming up on The Mystical Positivist:
November 17th: a telephone conversation with spiritual teacher J. Jaye Gold, author of Justin Time: Autobiographical Stories from an American Spiritual Master, Another Heart in His Hand: A Spiritual Anomaly, and Highway of Diamonds. In his younger years, J. Jaye Gold studied at a 500-year-old experimental Naqshbandi Sufi school in northeastern Afghanistan. He believed that the methods he learned in this school needed to be modified for people in affluent Western cultures. He took on this challenge, developing tools, dynamics, and explorations of consciousness to help lead Westerners toward “intimacy with the ultimate reality, in order to become true servants.” J. Jaye Gold has been assisting people in their search for inner meaning for 35 years.
He is currently living in the Sierra foothills of Northern California where he works with several dozen seekers of truth. Over the years he has deliberately resisted the trend to become a “traveling guru” with thousands of followers around the world in favor of preserving an element that he considers precious — that of maintaining opportunities for developing an actual teacher/student relationship. He is available to anyone who seeks his guidance.

Online marketing can also be crowded and competitive. Although the opportunities to provide goods and services in both local and far-reaching markets is empowering, the competition can be significant. Companies investing in online marketing may find visitors’ attention is difficult to capture due to the number of business also marketing their products and services online. Marketers must develop a balance of building a unique value proposition and brand voice as they test and build marketing campaigns on various channels.
Using an omni-channel strategy is becoming increasingly important for enterprises who must adapt to the changing expectations of consumers who want ever-more sophisticated offerings throughout the purchasing journey. Retailers are increasingly focusing on their online presence, including online shops that operate alongside existing store-based outlets. The "endless aisle" within the retail space can lead consumers to purchase products online that fit their needs while retailers do not have to carry the inventory within the physical location of the store. Solely Internet-based retailers are also entering the market; some are establishing corresponding store-based outlets to provide personal services, professional help, and tangible experiences with their products.[24]
A mailing list archive is a collection of past messages from one or more electronic mailing lists. Such archives often include searching and indexing functionality. Many archives are directly associated with the mailing list, but some organizations, such as Gmane, collect archives from multiple mailing lists hosted at different organizations; thus, one message sent to one popular mailing list may end up in many different archives. Gmane had over 9,000 mailing list archives as of 16 January 2007. Some popular free software programs for collecting mailing list archives are Hypermail, MHonArc, and FUDforum.
Four months later, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, partners in a law firm, broadly promoted their legal services in a USENET posting titled "Green Card Lottery – Final One?"[15] Canter and Siegel's Green Card USENET spam raised the profile of online advertising, stimulating widespread interest in advertising via both Usenet and traditional email.[12] More recently, spam has evolved into a more industrial operation, where spammers use armies of virus-infected computers (botnets) to send spam remotely.[10]
If you are able to consult with customers one-on-one, ask any new clients how they heard about you. This will be trickier if you own a restaurant or clothing store since you won’t be able to track down every customer to ask how they heard about you. In these instances, consider asking customers to take a survey on every receipt. Offer an incentive (coupon, discount, etc.) to increase the chances that people will actually fill it out.
The fact is, a significant percentage of millennials like mail. It has a built-in emotional response factor. Gallup reported that 36% of people under the age of 30 look forward to checking their mailboxes every day. What’s more, 95% of 18-to-29-year-olds have a positive response to receiving personal cards and letters. Notably this generation will wield a combined $1.4 trillion in spending power by 2020, as reported by Accenture.
Let our professional designers create the perfect postcard marketing campaign. They’ll even help you select a list of prospective customers using search selections like area codes, city, county, state, years in come, household income, presence of children, lifestyle interests, and ZIP Code. Plus, don’t miss our handy mapping tool to assist you in your search!
Ever since the dawn of time, entrepreneurs have been giving away stuff for free. From the “lite” versions of apps, to samples in the grocery story, or straight up assaulting you with perfume every time you walk past the makeup department. Entrepreneurs of all sorts will fall over themselves trying to give you their stuff for free, all in the hopes that you’ll want to come back for more.
You work with a list provider to find and purchase a list of names and email addresses based on demographic and/or psychographic information. For example, you might purchase a list of 50,000 names and email addresses of people who live in Minnesota and don't have children. There are several sustainable ways to use email marketing to grow your business. This isn't one of them.
Thanks for the warning re ESPs, spam traps & spam treatments Crystal. That’s a shame. Who puts the Spam trap in there & I wonder what they’re trying to achieve? The clients I have already picked up with this purchased list may save our business. As mentioned, at $250-$500 per lead through our SEO campaign, this lead acquisition rate was unsustainable. In brief, this would not be a business. But at $13.75 per lead through the purchased cold email list, those are metrics which make a profitable business. I wonder why anyone would try to block this efficiency with Spam traps? Thanks for your time to help.
“I am a big believer in the intersection of online and offline marketing and this can be a big win with direct mail marketing. If you can provide users with a strong enough incentive to visit your website then you can then integrate follow up strategies like remarketing and email nurturing. As marketers we have to try and break down the wall between traditional advertising and digital as often that intersection is where the best results are.”
The new digital era has enabled brands to selectively target their customers that may potentially be interested in their brand or based on previous browsing interests. Businesses can now use social media to select the age range, location, gender and interests of whom they would like their targeted post to be seen by. Furthermore, based on a customer's recent search history they can be ‘followed’ on the internet so they see advertisements from similar brands, products and services,[38] This allows businesses to target the specific customers that they know and feel will most benefit from their product or service, something that had limited capabilities up until the digital era.
Email Newsletters are some of the most common and popular forms of email marketing. Use email newsletters to provide your subscribers with timely, expected, and helpful updates from your brand. Include thought leadership or how-tos, announcements about your product or service, insider-peeks into your business, or any other engaging content that adds value to your subscribers’ inboxes.
“We’re always giving people the option to join our email list when they come into the spa, but we just recently added the option for people to sign up when they visit our website,” explains Christine Copertino, spa director for Allegria Spa. “The response has been great. We’re seeing a ton of people signing up, and we know that these are really engaged people who will be excited to receive our emails.”
Affiliate marketing occurs when advertisers organize third parties to generate potential customers for them. Third-party affiliates receive payment based on sales generated through their promotion.[24]:22 Affiliate marketers generate traffic to offers from affiliate networks, and when the desired action is taken by the visitor, the affiliate earns a commission. These desired actions can be an email submission, a phone call, filling out an online form, or an online order being completed.
It also emphasises how digital marketing does not occur in isolation, but is most effective when it is integrated with other communications channels such as phone, direct mail or face-to-face. As we have said, the role of the Internet in supporting multi-channel marketing is another recurring theme in this book and chapters 5 and 6 in particular explain its role in supporting different customer communications channels and distribution channels.
Ad blocking, or ad filtering, means the ads do not appear to the user because the user uses technology to screen out ads. Many browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads by default.[87] Other software programs or browser add-ons may also block the loading of ads, or block elements on a page with behaviors characteristic of ads (e.g. HTML autoplay of both audio and video). Approximately 9% of all online page views come from browsers with ad-blocking software installed,[88] and some publishers have 40%+ of their visitors using ad-blockers.[3]
Scammers can take advantage of consumers' difficulties verifying an online persona's identity,[98]:1 leading to artifices like phishing (where scam emails look identical to those from a well-known brand owner)[99] and confidence schemes like the Nigerian "419" scam.[100][101][102] The Internet Crime Complaint Center received 289,874 complaints in 2012, totaling over half a billion dollars in losses, most of which originated with scam ads.[103][104]
SXSW, Inc. – This lean organization organizes some of the most well-known events in the world, including the SXSW film, music and interactive festivals held every year in Austin, Texas. The goal of their marketing team is to increase ticket sales and attendees at these events, so they use email marketing to keep subscribers up to date as new artists and speakers join the lineup.
Brand awareness has been proven to work with more effectiveness in countries that are high in uncertainty avoidance, also these countries that have uncertainty avoidance; social media marketing works effectively. Yet brands must be careful not to be excessive on the use of this type of marketing, as well as solely relying on it as it may have implications that could negatively harness their image. Brands that represent themselves in an anthropomorphizing manner are more likely to succeed in situations where a brand is marketing to this demographic. "Since social media use can enhance the knowledge of the brand and thus decrease the uncertainty, it is possible that people with high uncertainty avoidance, such as the French, will particularly appreciate the high social media interaction with an anthropomorphized brand." Moreover, digital platform provides an ease to the brand and its customers to interact directly and exchange their motives virtually.[33]
While this is obviously more of a guideline than a hard-fast rule, if nothing else it should show you where your efforts need to be placed when undertaking a direct mail marketing campaign. Too often, business owners will spend an inordinate amount of time on coming up with the flashiest, snazziest, most eye-catching design that they are sure will blow everyone away, and then rush to put together the offer and/or the list of folks to send it to. It’s one of the most common mistakes of a mail marketing campaign.
Before online marketing channels emerged, the cost to market products or services was often prohibitively expensive, and traditionally difficult to measure. Think of national television ad campaigns, which are measured through consumer focus groups to determine levels of brand awareness. These methods are also not well-suited to controlled experimentation. Today, anyone with an online business (as well as most offline businesses) can participate in online marketing by creating a website and building customer acquisition campaigns at little to no cost. Those marketing products and services also have the ability to experiment with optimization to fine-tune their campaigns’ efficiency and ROI.

A key objective is engaging digital marketing customers and allowing them to interact with the brand through servicing and delivery of digital media. Information is easy to access at a fast rate through the use of digital communications. Users with access to the Internet can use many digital mediums, such as Facebook, YouTube, Forums, and Email etc. Through Digital communications it creates a Multi-communication channel where information can be quickly exchanged around the world by anyone without any regard to whom they are.[28] Social segregation plays no part through social mediums due to lack of face to face communication and information being wide spread instead to a selective audience. This interactive nature allows consumers create conversation in which the targeted audience is able to ask questions about the brand and get familiar with it which traditional forms of Marketing may not offer.[29]
First, you will need a computer with internet connection. Then, you can choose from a variety of email servers such as Hotmail, Yahoo, Gmail etc. I recommend Gmail because it's free and has and excellent spam blocker. If you go to gmail.com, and click a link that will say something like "create an account". Fill out the information and use your new login and password to enter your new account.
This guide is designed for you to read cover-to-cover. Each new chapter builds upon the previous one. A core idea that we want to reinforce is that marketing should be evaluated holistically. What you need to do is this in terms of growth frameworks and systems as opposed to campaigns. Reading this guide from start to finish will help you connect the many moving parts of marketing to your big-picture goal, which is ROI.
I recently had my MailChimp account suspended. One of my sites is in the ‘make money online’ space. It’s a completely legitimate website, but apparently if your emails contain keywords they don’t like, they will suspend you. I would not recommend using them. Contacting support I just get form responses that are completely unhelpful. There’s no phone support- just account termination. Really bad experience. Luckily, this is a very new site- but imagine if you have thousands of emails and they just shut you down without ANY recourse.
Paid channel marketing is something you’ve probably come across in some form or another. Other names for this topic include Search Engine Marketing (SEM), online advertising, or pay-per-click (PPC) marketing. Very often, marketers use these terms interchangeably to describe the same concept — traffic purchased through online ads. Marketers frequently shy away from this technique because it costs money. This perspective will put you at a significant disadvantage. It’s not uncommon for companies to run PPC campaigns with uncapped budgets. Why? Because you should be generating an ROI anyway. This chapter walks through the basics of how.
A text ad displays text-based hyperlinks. Text-based ads may display separately from a web page's primary content, or they can be embedded by hyperlinking individual words or phrases to advertiser's websites. Text ads may also be delivered through email marketing or text message marketing. Text-based ads often render faster than graphical ads and can be harder for ad-blocking software to block.[50] https://getcrm.com/uploads/email-marketing-2.jpg
A/B testing is trying two different techniques that communicate the same message on a small percentage of your list, seeing whether A or B performed the best, then using the better performing option when you email the rest of the list. It sounds complicated, but there are plenty of email marketing solutions out there that take all the math and guesswork out of it. (All you have to do is come up with the option A and option B you want to try.)
Dimensional mail: Grab your potential customers' attention with mail pieces that are not the envelopes or postcards that people are used to getting but ones that have dimension, such as bulky items, boxes or tubes. These have a much higher response rate than the mail pieces you are sending now. Switching from your current format to a dimensional piece is very costly, so before considering doing this you need to know your budget. However, you can expect a lift in response. One of my favorite examples is sending a "message in a bottle" in the mail. This direct mail campaign featured a little plastic bottle with a label on it. Inside was a note on how to buy the company's product. Something like that stands out and gets opened.
Email blasts are a great way to send bulk correspondence with businesses or consumers. Eblasts can contain special promotional information to customers or critical updates to other businesses. Sending ineffective or irrelevant emails to people will cause them to ignore future emails and can tarnish your company's reputation. Luckily, there are ways that you can optimize writing your e-blasts so that they captivate the largest audience possible. By using best practices to write and send your email and by evaluating the progress and effectiveness of them, you'll be able to reach a much wider customer base.
The DMA’s 2017 Response Rate Report finds that the response rate for mail sent to people on house lists (subscribers who opted in to mail) was 5.1% for the year, and the response rate for prospect lists (potential clients) was 2.9%. These numbers are up from 2003, when house lists drew a response of 4.4% and prospect lists a response of 2.1%. And even though online shopping has surpassed purchases from direct mail pieces, the DMA reports that 100.7 million U.S. adults​ made a purchase from a catalog in 2016, compared with 209.6 million people who made purchases online the same year, per Statista.
Be aware from January the popup opt in is going to decimate your Google search rankings, so the evergreen welcome mat and overlay (which you’re using on this page on exit intent) are going to be things of the past (unless you want to lose your position in the SERPS…). Time to get rid of the popups now and move to content upgrades inline in your articles (which you do really well in this post!).
Ideally, email marketing should go hand-in-hand with social media. Adding social media "Like" or "Share" buttons to your marketing emails gives an additional way for customers to connect with your brand. Snippets of positive reviews from social media fans can be included in emails, and conversely, social media postings can be used to encourage fans to subscribe to your email newsletters.
If someone didn't ask to hear from you yet, it doesn't mean they won't want to hear from you later. It's your job to prove to them -- through helpful content and valuable offers -- that they should stay up to date with your company via email. If you force your email content on anyone too early, even if you know in your bones they're a great fit for your products or services, you risk preemptively losing their trust and their future business.
Many consumers have reservations about online behavioral targeting. By tracking users' online activities, advertisers are able to understand consumers quite well. Advertisers often use technology, such as web bugs and respawning cookies, to maximizing their abilities to track consumers.[60]:60[95] According to a 2011 survey conducted by Harris Interactive, over half of Internet users had a negative impression of online behavioral advertising, and forty percent feared that their personally-identifiable information had been shared with advertisers without their consent.[96][97] Consumers can be especially troubled by advertisers targeting them based on sensitive information, such as financial or health status.[95] Furthermore, some advertisers attach the MAC address of users' devices to their 'demographic profiles' so they can be retargeted (regardless of the accuracy of the profile) even if the user clears their cookies and browsing history.[citation needed]
I’m a bride myself and I can’t tell you how many emails I’ve marked as spam from venders I’ve never requested any information from. They received my email address from the shop I bought my wedding dress from and tried to sell me services I never asked for. I marked every single one of those emails as spam because I never gave them permission to email me. I also had no idea that my dress shop had shared my email address with other vendors.
One hundred years ago, companies such as Sears, Roebuck & Co. and J.C. Penny Co. used customer data to send out catalogs and mailers. Back then, the companies possessed small sets of data, mainly names and addresses of customers. Now, marketers have mountains of complex data and are faced with a modern conundrum: How much personal data is too much to incorporate into the content?
When planning a direct mail campaign, don’t forget that you still need to follow the basic direct mail rules. A good list, a good design and a strong call-to-action are a must in order for your direct mail to be a success. Provide information on how people can use the technology you are including and strong content for them to view. If the content is not well designed, then your effort will have been a waste of time.
Using the word blast says a lot about how you view email marketing. And because so many of us are so very touchy about being characterized as spammers (or just feel bad about “bothering” our subscribers) even using a word that leans toward sounding like spam bothers us. Remember that there are always two definitions of spam. There’s the email marketers’ definition (the CAN-SPAM Act of 2013 definition), and then there’s the consumer definition. The consumer definition of spam is simple and complete: It’s email they don’t want.
Discussion lists often require every message to be approved by a moderator before being sent to the rest of the subscribers (moderated lists), although higher-traffic lists typically only moderate messages from new subscribers. Companies sending out promotional newsletters have the option of working with whitelist mail distributors, which agree to standards and high fines from ISPs should any of the opt-in subscribers complain. In exchange for their compliance and agreement to prohibitive fines, the emails sent by whitelisted companies are not blocked by spam filters, which often can reroute these legitimate, non-spam emails.[3]

A wide variety of organizations and companies employ some form of direct mail marketing. For example, you might already receive an envelope from ValPak, a direct mail company that sells space in its envelopes to a variety of local businesses offering coupons and discounts. Additionally, they entice consumers to look through these coupons by promising that $100 has been inserted into 10 random envelopes. https://www.designhill.com/design-blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Email-Marketing-Campaign-768x439.jpg
As opposed to static messaging, chat advertising refers to real time messages dropped to users on certain sites. This is done by the usage of live chat software or tracking applications installed within certain websites with the operating personnel behind the site often dropping adverts on the traffic surfing around the sites. In reality this is a subset of the email advertising but different because of its time window.
Most of the article really talks about how to successfully get an email of a person who has already landed on your landing page/podcast page/affiliate/blog etc. but how to get those people there in the first place is a bigger challenge. Also, one of the ways you can include in your list is by offering free tools/widgets. For example, OpenSiteExplorer by Moz is a great example. Evergreen and very useful for the target audience.
An electronic mailing list or email list is a special use of email that allows for widespread distribution of information to many Internet users. It is similar to a traditional mailing list – a list of names and addresses – as might be kept by an organization for sending publications to its members or customers, but typically refers to four things:
Answer . Go to one of the providers, such as Yahoo.com, Hotmail.com, Gmail.com, etc. and register for a free account. That is the easiest way. Then you give the address you signed up for to someone else, who uses their e-mail account to write you a message and send it to that address. You get it by logging into your account and reading new messages.. You can also sign up for a paid account at one of the same services, and your account is then stable (won't disappear if you don't sign in often enough) and you get other privileges and choices.. There are many e-mail providers. Use a search tool such as Google to look for e-mail services. You could ask your friends if they like their e-mail providers, and take their recommendations.
In the 1990s, the term Digital Marketing was first coined,[10]. With the debut of server/client architecture and the popularity of personal computers, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications became a significant part of marketing technology.[citation needed] Fierce competition forced vendors to include more service into their softwares, for example, marketing, sales and service applications. Marketers were also able to own huge online customer data by eCRM softwares after the Internet was born. Companies could update the data of customer needs and obtain the priorities of their experience. This led to the first clickable banner ad being going live in 1994, which was the "You Will" campaign by AT&T and over the first four months of it going live, 44% of all people who saw it clicked on the ad [11].
Project conversion metrics. The general rule of thumb is that the smaller and more targeted your list, the more you can spend per piece. It’s better to make a strong impression to a few than to make a weak impression to many. Know your cost per unit, and project a conversion rate, so you can estimate whether your campaign will have a positive ROI before running it. https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/email-marketing-roi-2.jpg
As advertisers collect data across multiple external websites about a user's online activity, they can create a detailed profile of the user's interests to deliver even more targeted advertising. This aggregation of data is called behavioral targeting.[26] Advertisers can also target their audience by using contextual to deliver display ads related to the content of the web page where the ads appear.[19]:118 Retargeting, behavioral targeting, and contextual advertising all are designed to increase an advertiser's return on investment, or ROI, over untargeted ads.[27]
Although online marketing creates many opportunities for businesses to grow their presence via the Internet and build their audiences, there are also inherent challenges with these methods of marketing. First, the marketing can become impersonal, due to the virtual nature of message and content delivery to a desired audience. Marketers must inform their strategy for online marketing with a strong understanding of their customer’s needs and preferences. Techniques like surveys, user testing, and in-person conversations can be used for this purpose.
Say you’re launching a beta test soon or collaborating with someone on a side project outside your typical newsletter scope. In an installment of the newsletter you usually send, briefly mention the project and provide a link where interested parties can go to sign up for updates about it. This way, those who aren’t interested only had to hear about it once and in a non-invasive way. A user experience win and a win for you, the guy who has two thumbs and a super-engaged email list sub-segment.
Keep the email short. If you write an email that's too long, there's a chance that recipients will skim over it or stop reading it at a certain point.[7] This could mean that they miss your call to action, or what you're trying to get across. Try to edit out pieces of information that aren't critical to the overall message. Make messages as short and concise as possible. Avoid over-elaboration or background that can clutter your blast.
Have a few different buttons on your email template: separate social media buttons that produce pre-written social posts linking to a webpage version of your email, and an "Email to a Friend" button that transfers the email into a compose window so your contacts can instantly forward the message. Just make sure your email has an opt-in button so each new viewer can subscribe to more emails from you if they like what they see.
The collection of user information by publishers and advertisers has raised consumer concerns about their privacy.[28][60] Sixty percent of Internet users would use Do Not Track technology to block all collection of information if given an opportunity.[92][93] Over half of all Google and Facebook users are concerned about their privacy when using Google and Facebook, according to Gallup.[94]
Hi Louise – it depends how you’re running your website. With an integrated platform like Thrivehive you can update your website and send emails seamlessly. Most website platforms do not have this capability and you would have to use a third party email campaign system like MailChimp or Constant Contact. For more information about our integrated platform, you can go to https://thrivehive.com/request-a-demo and fill out a form for someone to give you a call! http://www.benchmarkemail.com/images/blog/targeted-email-campaign-archives.png
Basic text-based email editors to fully designed HTML or JavaScript templates are just some of the features these packages can provide businesses. You can manage your contacts by simply keeping a list of names and email addresses or you can create a complex database full of subscribers segmented by demographic slices and engagement levels. Which method you choose really just depends on how much of your budget you're willing to allocate towards the email marketing software that can give your company the features it needs.
While getting the word out to many people at once can seem appealing, it also lacks the personalization that today’s online consumers crave. And with today’s email marketing services that make it simple to segment and personalize your messages, there’s no reason not to dip your toe into the email customization waters, right? Plus, as laws change around the world to make unsolicited electronic messages illegal, one wrong email could land your business squarely in the red.
Online advertising, also called online marketing or Internet advertising or web advertising, is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers. Consumers view online advertising as an unwanted distraction with few benefits and have increasingly turned to ad blocking for a variety of reasons. When software is used to do the purchasing, it is known as programmatic advertising.
If you’re serious about growing your business, building a healthy email list should be one of your top priorities. When it comes down to it, your list is one of the only online assets that you have 100% control over. Having a solid social media presence is absolutely essential (here’s why), but you’ll always be at the mercy of new and changing algorithms (think Facebook’s Edgerank). And achieving high search engine rankings is great too, but again, you’re at the mercy of changing algorithms and updates.
Just because something is true, it doesn’t mean it should be sent to the customer. Good personalization is relevant and valuable, but it shouldn’t be too specific, O’Keefe says, citing Netflix and Amazon as good examples for direct marketers. These companies know what their customers want, but they don’t go over the top in telling them things about themselves they may not yet know.
Marketers don’t always automatically receive notifications when they’ve been blacklisted, so it’s up to the marketer to monitor their brand’s email sending reputation. There are a number of free online resources that marketers should utilize to check their blacklist status before sending an email blast, such as Barracuda Reputation Block List or MultiRBL.
Many laws specifically regulate the ways online ads are delivered. For example, online advertising delivered via email is more regulated than the same ad content delivered via banner ads. Among other restrictions, the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 requires that any commercial email provide an opt-out mechanism.[108] Similarly, mobile advertising is governed by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA), which (among other restrictions) requires user opt-in before sending advertising via text messaging.
I won’t lie to you, it does take a fair amount of preparation and time to build your authority up to this point. But I guarantee you that if you start implementing the exact same tactics that I’ve listed here, you’ll immediately be able to increase your conversion rate and start building one of the most important resources you’ll need as an entrepreneur.
I would wager that most business owners under the age of 35 probably have never even considered running a direct mail marketing campaign for their business. Having grown up in an increasingly paperless world, the mere concept of spending precious marketing dollars on printing up thousands of pieces of paper to stuff into mailboxes across a large swath of people seems pretty crazy to the younger generation of entrepreneurs – and it’s not a baseless feeling. There’s no denying that the business world (and our world in general) has been dramatically swinging toward the quicker, more efficient, much cheaper, and much more environmentally friendly realm of electronic communication. But does direct mail marketing actually work?
The huge advantage of email over social media is that prospects and customers are more likely to see an email than social media. Just posting something doesn't mean that everyone you want to see your message will see it. Your post might not even show up in your targets' social media streams. However, an email will sit in the inbox until it's read (or deleted). https://www.websolutions.com/Customer-Content/www/CMS/files/blog/email-must-haves.png
Direct Mail Printing and Addressing: Depending on which printer -- online or local -- that you work with, costs will vary. There are also other variables that will impact cost, including size of your direct mail piece, as will your use of color vs. black & white, type of paper used, whether your marketing list will need to be cleaned up, and other caveats.
If you haven’t yet started building an email list (but know you need to), this article is for you. You may have heard that a strong email list is one of the most valuable assets you can have, but when you’re starting from scratch, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. This is partly because many business owners have a hard time envisioning the long-term payoff for the hard work they need to do now.
So far I have refrained from telling her all the reasons I hate the term eblast or email blast. She clearly doesn’t like sending the email and doesn’t think too highly of it, so correcting her email marketing terminology is not likely to be a fun conversation. But I do think "eblast" is worth talking about with you. If you’re an email marketer, you’re probably annoyed by the term “eblast” or “email blast” too.
Even though this article is focused entirely on mail marketing, let’s be honest – it won’t be long until direct mail is pretty much a relic of a bygone era. And that’s perfectly okay – changing times call for changing tactics. While some business owners have opted to chuck mail marketing into the trash bin altogether, a more transitional option would be to reduce the amount spent on mail marketing but direct the recipients of the mail toward your business’s online front.
Send yourself a test email. Before sending an email to a list of people, send one to yourself. Read over the email carefully and keep an eye out for poor formatting or incorrectly sized pictures. Check the email in multiple browsers and use different devices to see if it works across different platforms. Click all the links within the email and make sure they are working as intended.[13]
These metrics give you a high-level overview of how your subscribers are interacting with your campaigns and allow you to compare the success of one campaign to another. If you want to go deeper and see the exact people who opened and clicked your campaign, what links they clicked, etc. you can do so by choosing some of the other reports from the right hand side menu.
Mobile advertising is growing rapidly for several reasons. There are more mobile devices in the field, connectivity speeds have improved (which, among other things, allows for richer media ads to be served quickly), screen resolutions have advanced, mobile publishers are becoming more sophisticated about incorporating ads, and consumers are using mobile devices more extensively.[24]:14 The Interactive Advertising Bureau predicts continued growth in mobile advertising with the adoption of location-based targeting and other technological features not available or relevant on personal computers.[24]:14 In July 2014 Facebook reported advertising revenue for the June 2014 quarter of $2.68 billion, an increase of 67 percent over the second quarter of 2013. Of that, mobile advertising revenue accounted for around 62 percent, an increase of 41 percent on the previous year.
Internet service providers (GMail, Yahoo, etc.) and anti-spam organizations create the spam traps to prevent spam from reaching people’s inboxes. The important thing for everyone to remember is if you use a purchased list, you are technically spamming the people on that list. Spam is unsolicited email and those people did not request your information.
Display advertising conveys its advertising message visually using text, logos, animations, videos, photographs, or other graphics. Display advertisers frequently target users with particular traits to increase the ads' effect. Online advertisers (typically through their ad servers) often use cookies, which are unique identifiers of specific computers, to decide which ads to serve to a particular consumer. Cookies can track whether a user left a page without buying anything, so the advertiser can later retarget the user with ads from the site the user visited.[25]
Just like with any other form of advertising, you will need to hit people with your message more than once in order to maximize effectiveness. Your first send might pique their interest, but people are receiving mail at the same time they are getting home, and are facing many distractions. By consistently sending marketing messages, you increase the chance that they will convert.
This email list growth was a major component of a massive product launch we undertook this past winter. In the lead-up to the launch of our Instagram Domination 2.0 course, we doubled down on our goal to rapidly grow our email list. In this article I’m going to reveal to you the exact tactics we used and how we employed them in order to explode our mailing list.
Even better was the fact that we had built the Foundr brand up to the point where we had people actually ask to become an affiliate of ours. Our very brand became an important leveraging point for us because we had developed it to the point where people would want to become associated with our brand. Obviously this didn’t happen overnight and it took many years of work to get us to that point, but it was a great side-benefit to all the success we had achieved so far.
Pop-up forms provide visitors with a quick, convenient way to share contact information and subscribe to your list while they’re browsing your site, making them a powerful tool for audience growth. They’re easy to add to your site, and they’re proven to work—our research shows that Mailchimp users have seen their list growth rate increase by an average of 50.8% after adding a pop-up form to their site. https://reallygoodemails.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Have-You-Seen-Our-Top-100-Email-Marketing-Campaigns.png
Project conversion metrics. The general rule of thumb is that the smaller and more targeted your list, the more you can spend per piece. It’s better to make a strong impression to a few than to make a weak impression to many. Know your cost per unit, and project a conversion rate, so you can estimate whether your campaign will have a positive ROI before running it.

With so many of the us depending on the internet to stay tuned into what's going on in our lives and in the world, it's no wonder that direct mail, or "direct classic" as the industry sometimes refers to it, has become an afterthought for small business marketing strategies. Postage is getting more and more expensive. Plus, email delivery and online communications are near immediate compared to the time it takes to go through the production, proofing, printing, and mailing process.
Think targeted marketing when determining the demographic selects for your mailing list. Who are your best customers? A direct mailing list performs better when you target your prospects based on the demographics of your current customers. Our online mailing list service allows you to define your mailing list by age, income, gender, length of residence and more. Each list contains different demographic selects.
One of Raquel’s suggestions is to make sure the email contains a clear call to action. The recipient should be able to tell right away what you’re asking them to do, and when they click through, they should be taken to the exact page they need, not just your homepage. If you ask them to click on a video thumbnail to watch a video, you need to link them directly to the video. If you’re asking them to read your latest blog post, link them right to it. https://echogravity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/What-to-Expect-When-You-First-Launch.png
Online advertisers can collect data on their ads' effectiveness, such as the size of the potential audience or actual audience response,[19]:119 how a visitor reached their advertisement, whether the advertisement resulted in a sale, and whether an ad actually loaded within a visitor's view.[59][60]:59 This helps online advertisers improve their ad campaigns over time.
After all is said and done, you’ll be left with a handful of people that have come in and transacted business with you based purely on your piece of mail. You can track this in any number of ways (coupon codes, requiring them to bring the mail in, comparing sales numbers from highlighted items on sale versus when they’re not, etc.), but be sure to track it in an easily manageable fashion. This will allow you to re-engage with those customers with whom your mail marketing was successful.
In order to engage customers, retailers must shift from a linear marketing approach of one-way communication to a value exchange model of mutual dialogue and benefit-sharing between provider and consumer.[21] Exchanges are more non-linear, free flowing, and both one-to-many or one-on-one.[5] The spread of information and awareness can occur across numerous channels, such as the blogosphere, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, and a variety of other platforms. Online communities and social networks allow individuals to easily create content and publicly publish their opinions, experiences, and thoughts and feelings about many topics and products, hyper-accelerating the diffusion of information.[22]
Word of mouth communications and peer-to-peer dialogue often have a greater effect on customers, since they are not sent directly from the company and are therefore not planned. Customers are more likely to trust other customers’ experiences.[22] Examples can be that social media users share food products and meal experiences highlighting certain brands and franchises. This was noted in a study on Instagram, where researchers observed that adolescent Instagram users' posted images of food-related experiences within their social networks, providing free advertising for the products.[26]
As businesses offer e-marketing and online shopping, customers can get market information from their computers or cell phones and buy goods or find services without leaving home twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week (24/7). They can read ads on the Web or from e-mail, get e-coupons, view pictures of goods, compare prices, and make purchases with a few clicks of their mouse, saving the time and money it would take to shop in person at a brick-and-mortar store. At the same time, ebusinesses can reduce costs in distribution channels and physical store space and thus pass the savings on to customers.
Presentation is everything, or so they say. With this old adage in mind, we’ve compiled our best tips for anyone who wants to send emails that subscribers click into a handy email design guide. We cover each facet of design: content, templates, identity, color, images, layout, fonts, and calls to action. Design is as much science as it is art, and we take the guesswork out of what can seem like the most challenging part of sending good emails.
People read and subscribe to newsletters because they feel like there is something that they are getting from the content. If you overload an eblast with pitches to sell products and links to affiliate sites, the reader is going to tune out. Inform the reader and get them to your site by engaging them with a topic that relates to the product or service. Check out these golden rules for email blasts for more information on how to keep your readers happy.
The old formula for direct marketing success was mass marketing: "Mail to as many people as you can; someone has to be interested." However, paper and postage costs are always increasing, and with so much mail ending up in the trash, businesses have changed their way of thinking. Why waste money mailing to everyone when everyone is not a potential customer? You need to target the leads who will buy. That is the difference between mass marketing and target marketing. Targeted mailing lists pinpoint your best leads. There is less waste and a higher percentage of prospects responding to your mailing.

As with conventional marketing, e-marketing is creating a strategy that helps businesses deliver the right messages and product/services to the right audience. It consists of all activities and processes with the purpose of finding, attracting, winning and retaining customers. What has changed is its wider scope and options compared to conventional marketing methods.

You can send people to a landing page on your website that has a URL that is specific to your direct mail campaign. You will then need your vanity URL to redirect to a tracking URL. Unfortunately, this will only be a useful measure of success if you are trying to drive traffic to your site. To learn how to do this, view this white paper by Brian Clifton explaining ways to track offline marketing. You can purchase your vanity URL here.
Shifting the focus to the time span, we may need to measure some "Interim Metrics", which give us some insight during the journey itself, as well as we need to measure some "Final Metrics" at the end of the journey to inform use if the overall initiative was successful or not. As an example, most of social media metrics and indicators such as likes, shares and engagement comments may be classified as interim metrics while the final increase/decrease in sales volume is clearly from the final category.
The Nielsen Global Connected Commerce Survey conducted interviews in 26 countries to observe how consumers are using the Internet to make shopping decisions in stores and online. Online shoppers are increasingly looking to purchase internationally, with over 50% in the study who purchased online in the last six months stating they bought from an overseas retailer.[23]
Email marketing has been around for decades, but it is still one of the most effective digital marketing channels available when it’s done well. Email today needs to feel like one-on-one conversations with each audience member, but it also needs to scale. Make sure your strategies are up-to-date so your emails are getting delivered and cutting through the noise.
Appear on top in Google search results. The title of your web page is used by Google as the suggested title of its search results. In addition, describe your company in an informative but precise manner. Domain names are also a significant portion of the search results of Google. Hence, pick an easy-to-read and descriptive domain name for your website. Moreover, subpages must also be easy to read. Moreover, meta descriptions are defined as page summaries usually made use of by Google on their results page. Write meta descriptions that are unique for every page using 160 characters or less.
A pop-up ad is displayed in a new web browser window that opens above a website visitor's initial browser window.[31] A pop-under ad opens a new browser window under a website visitor's initial browser window.[24]:22 Pop-under ads and similar technologies are now advised against by online authorities such as Google, who state that they "do not condone this practice".[32]
Different jurisdictions have taken different approaches to privacy issues with advertising. The United States has specific restrictions on online tracking of children in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),[109]:16–17 and the FTC has recently expanded its interpretation of COPPA to include requiring ad networks to obtain parental consent before knowingly tracking kids.[112] Otherwise, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission frequently supports industry self-regulation, although increasingly it has been undertaking enforcement actions related to online privacy and security.[113] The FTC has also been pushing for industry consensus about possible Do Not Track legislation.
Another collection method happens when list vendors buy emails lists from industry trade shows (or other events) where people give their info during the registration process. This is not the same thing as folks who signed up with you, directly, at your trade show booth! This is where list vendors purchase the entire registration list, from the trade show, itself.
Digital marketing became more sophisticated in the 2000s and the 2010s, when[13][14] the proliferation of devices' capable of accessing digital media led to sudden growth.[15] Statistics produced in 2012 and 2013 showed that digital marketing was still growing.[16][17] With the development of social media in the 2000s, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, consumers became highly dependent on digital electronics in daily lives. Therefore, they expected a seamless user experience across different channels for searching product's information. The change of customer behavior improved the diversification of marketing technology.[18]
This list buying is a very tricky subject and I agree that there must be something to it (demand and utility) or there would not be pages on google advertising . I am really tempted but not with a purchased list . I have 24000 emails from my customers from my website listed above that has been up about 10 years. These are people who have requested automatic rate quotes from our db. About 1/3 of them we had email correspondence with . This are years 2012/13. Now I am into internet marketing and would like to have some good advice about mailing to this list without hurting my present web traffic Thanks Walter Menuet
The huge advantage of email over social media is that prospects and customers are more likely to see an email than social media. Just posting something doesn't mean that everyone you want to see your message will see it. Your post might not even show up in your targets' social media streams. However, an email will sit in the inbox until it's read (or deleted).
Before people hand over their email address, you’re going to have to offer them something enticing in exchange. This could be a free eBook, access to a Webinar, or the promise of discounts or deals exclusively for your subscribers. You could even repurpose some of your existing blog content and turn it into a guide or resource list. Whatever you decide to offer, just make sure it’s something people will recognize as holding true value!
A text ad displays text-based hyperlinks. Text-based ads may display separately from a web page's primary content, or they can be embedded by hyperlinking individual words or phrases to advertiser's websites. Text ads may also be delivered through email marketing or text message marketing. Text-based ads often render faster than graphical ads and can be harder for ad-blocking software to block.[50]
Digital marketing activity is still growing across the world according to the headline global marketing index. A study published in September 2018, found that global outlays on digital marketing tactics are approaching $100 billion.[40] Digital media continues to rapidly grow; while the marketing budgets are expanding, traditional media is declining (World Economics, 2015).[41] Digital media helps brands reach consumers to engage with their product or service in a personalised way. Five areas, which are outlined as current industry practices that are often ineffective are prioritizing clicks, balancing search and display, understanding mobiles, targeting, viewability, brand safety and invalid traffic, and cross-platform measurement (Whiteside, 2016).[42] Why these practices are ineffective and some ways around making these aspects effective are discussed surrounding the following points.
Today we’re all about social media marketing, search engine optimization, and whatever other buzzword you can think of. But the truth is, there is no other channel that will give you a better return on investment than email. According to Adobe, for every $1 spent on email, the average ROI is $40. That’s almost double the return of SEO, the second-highest channel.
While it’s tempting to say that we were able to create such a massive email list all by ourselves the reality is that it impossible to get that far without the help of some friends. As an entrepreneur one of our most valuable resources is our community of peers. While it may be easy to view others in your niche as your competitors, you’ll actually get a lot of more out of your entrepreneur community if you actually view them as potential partners who can help you out. http://fredericgonzalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/email_2.jpg
Today, perhaps the bigger question is whether digital marketing is a necessary term concept since some commentators have stated that we're now in a post-digital era with 'almost all' marketing now being digital now digital media and technology have become so pervasive. My view on this, explained in the post above is that we do very much need digital marketing, since many businesses still undergoing digital transformation and recruiting the digital marketing jobs and roles needed to compete. The trend in search volume also suggests there are more people searching for digital marketing than ever before, albeit with a drop before Christmas. https://sampi.co/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Choosing-Email-Marketing-Service-for-Chinese-Marketing-Campaign.jpg
CPA (Cost Per Action or Cost Per Acquisition) or PPP (Pay Per Performance) advertising means the advertiser pays for the number of users who perform a desired activity, such as completing a purchase or filling out a registration form. Performance-based compensation can also incorporate revenue sharing, where publishers earn a percentage of the advertiser's profits made as a result of the ad. Performance-based compensation shifts the risk of failed advertising onto publishers.[62]:4, 16
Marketers continue to use direct mail in 2016 because it still leads in ROI. However, traditional direct mail marketing has changed dramatically. InfoTrends did a study on direct mail that found the following statistics: 66% of direct mail is opened, 82% of direct mail is read for a minute or more, 56% of consumers who responded to direct mail went online or visited the physical store, 62% of consumers who responded to direct mail in the past three months made a purchase, and over 84% reported that personalization made them more likely to open a direct mail piece.
By focusing on market research, the psychology of attraction, creativity and ingenuity, students learn the best ways of implementing a direct mail campaign. A marketing education informs a future marketer about what motivates people to purchase, donate, or vote; and gives them the practical and creative skills to produce media to achieve the desired results. (See also Consumer Psychology)
Marketers need to authenticate their email to prove to ISPs that their messages are legitimate, helping to ensure delivery to their subscribers. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) verifies a brand’s identity; DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) verifies the message wasn’t tampered with in transmission; and Domain Based Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) requires both SPF and DKIM approval in order to authenticate.
Due to the massive growth of the Internet, most countries have passed legislation to prevent companies from sending unsolicited emails. These laws determine what is and what is not considered acceptable email correspondence, and enforce restrictions on email communications. In the United States and Europe, for example, bulk email must contain an accurate from field and subject line, and the email content must include the sender’s physical address. In addition, a blast email must also offer its recipients the opportunity to unsubscribe from the email list — and such requests must be met within a specified period of time. As a result of these laws, it is very important for companies to maintain an updated list of subscriptions and cancellations at all times, and avoid sending out email that appears to be spam.
Now that you’re all set up to starting collecting emails, the fun part begins (when I say ‘fun’, I actually mean ‘hard’). If your site receives a good amount of traffic and you have a truly compelling offer, this shouldn’t be too difficult. However, if you’re like most business owners, you’ll need to look outside your own audience to start building your list.
In order to engage customers, retailers must shift from a linear marketing approach of one-way communication to a value exchange model of mutual dialogue and benefit-sharing between provider and consumer.[21] Exchanges are more non-linear, free flowing, and both one-to-many or one-on-one.[5] The spread of information and awareness can occur across numerous channels, such as the blogosphere, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, and a variety of other platforms. Online communities and social networks allow individuals to easily create content and publicly publish their opinions, experiences, and thoughts and feelings about many topics and products, hyper-accelerating the diffusion of information.[22] https://1xqdqy285sk7212bfiejcprr-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/email-marketing-process.png
Short for e lectronic mail , the transmission of messages over communications networks . The messages can be notes entered from the keyboard or electronic files stored on disk . Most mainframes , minicomputers , and computer networks have an e-mail system . Some electronic-mail systems are confined to a single computer system or network, but others have gateways to other computer systems, enabling users to send electronic mail anywhere in the world. Companies that are fully computerized make extensive use of e-mail because it is fast, flexible, and reliable.. Most e-mail systems include a rudimentary text editor for composing messages, but many allow you to edit your messages using any editor you want. You then send the message to the recipient by specifying the recipient's address. You can also send the same message to several users at once. This is called broadcasting .. Sent messages are stored in electronic mailboxes until the recipient fetches them. To see if you have any mail, you may have to check your electronic mailbox periodically, although many systems alert you when mail is received. After reading your mail, you can store it in a text file , forward it to other users, or delete it. Copies of memos can be printed out on a printer if you want a paper copy .. All online services and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) offer e-mail, and most also support gateways so that you can exchange mail with users of other systems. Usually, it takes only a few seconds or minutes for mail to arrive at its destination. This is a particularly effective way to communicate with a group because you can broadcast a message or document to everyone in the group at once.. Although different e-mail systems use different formats , there are some emerging standards that are making it possible for users on all systems to exchange messages. In the PC world, an important e-mail standard is MAPI . The CCITT standards organization has developed the X.400 standard, which attempts to provide a universal way of addressing messages. To date, though, the de facto addressing standard is the one used by the Internet system because almost all e-mail systems have an Internet gateway.. Another common spelling for e-mail is email ..

Thanks for the warning re ESPs, spam traps & spam treatments Crystal. That’s a shame. Who puts the Spam trap in there & I wonder what they’re trying to achieve? The clients I have already picked up with this purchased list may save our business. As mentioned, at $250-$500 per lead through our SEO campaign, this lead acquisition rate was unsustainable. In brief, this would not be a business. But at $13.75 per lead through the purchased cold email list, those are metrics which make a profitable business. I wonder why anyone would try to block this efficiency with Spam traps? Thanks for your time to help.
This is a process described by Seth Godin known as permission marketing. The core concept of this idea is that you never market to someone that doesn’t want it, you first have to ask them for their permission. When someone signs up to your email not only do they become a warm lead but they give you their permission to send them offers and to market to them.

In the lead-up to the Instagram Domination 2.0 launch, our goal was to populate our mailing list with warm leads and to gradually start turning up the heat. We did that by always making sure we never abused our mailing list by sending them spam, and building up a solid foundation of trust with our subscribers by constantly providing them with valuable content we knew they wanted.
Tip: Align the timing of your pop-up form with the average amount of time a visitor spends on your website. Set the form to appear immediately (or with a 5-second delay) if people aren’t inclined to spend much time on your site. If visitors have a tendency to browse, consider a 20-second delay or a scroll-based trigger when someone reaches the middle or bottom of your page.
Consider sharing the focus of the email between the call to action you want from your user and offering them something like a discount, early access to a new product, or a free trial period for subscription-based services. Get creative here. Give serious thought to what your customers will find valuable. No one knows their needs better than you and don’t be scared to do some research into what they’d want.
I typically create my email artwork in photoshop and then just drop in the jpeg using html and image mapping. Is there a “best practices” when it comes to actually putting the email together? Perhaps speaking from an editing perspective? Basically I make one big image and then use coding: img name, src, alt, a href and so forth. And for every different block, I simply create a new jpg image to use. Is there a better way I should be doing this?
Push marketing is a proactive technique that enables e-marketers to "push" their product/service information to Web visitors or shoppers without their requesting it. Banner advertising, pop-up advertising, e-mail promotion, and spamming belong to push marketing. For instance, e-marketers can rent designated space from Internet service providers such as America Online or MSN for their banner or pop-up ads. Using animated graphics, appealing messages, and links, e-marketers try to lure visitors to their sites to buy their products or services. Many Internet users, however, find such ads annoying and employ software that blocks pop-ups and banner ads. <

It doesn’t need to be overly complex or convoluted. In fact, the best lead magnets are simple and can be easily digested within five minutes. All you’re aiming to do with a lead magnet is to offer as much value as possible in its simplest form. The only difficult bit is making sure that you know your audience well enough to be offering something that you know they will like.
It is increasingly advantageous for companies to use social media platforms to connect with their customers and create these dialogues and discussions. The potential reach of social media is indicated by the fact that in 2015, each month the Facebook app had more than 126 million average unique users and YouTube had over 97 million average unique users.[27]
This one really ruffles our feathers because it implies that you are shoving a bunch of spammy emails down your unsuspecting audiences throats. Blast away! In reality, we want email to be strategic, targeted, personalized, and properly segmented. Additionally, we want the content to be simple, direct, to the point, and useful. With this in mind, the word "blast" seems a bit too intense.
Using Dr Dave Chaffey's approach, the digital marketing planning (DMP) has three main stages: Opportunity, Strategy and Action. He suggests that any business looking to implement a successful digital marketing strategy must structure their plan by looking at opportunity, strategy and action. This generic strategic approach often has phases of situation review, goal setting, strategy formulation, resource allocation and monitoring.[60]
E-customers' most serious concern is security and privacy, followed by price, delivery cost, return policy, customer service, site design, navigation, one-click shopping, and personalization. E-marketers must assure customers that their sites use cybercrime-proof systems to protect ecustomer information and clearly display the security/privacy statement on their sites. Competitive prices, discounts, e-coupons, free delivery, and standard return policies motivate initial online purchases and repeat purchases. Nevertheless, requiring too many mouse clicks for navigating on a site, a lack of easily accessible help, technical difficulties, and requesting too much customer information for purchasing goods often causes shoppers to abandon their online shopping carts before reaching the checkout.
One of a small business’s best marketing assets is a healthy email list. While proper management and use of your email file will drive revenue immensely, it is often a challenge to create the email list itself. With inbox clutter on the rise and customers becoming more sensitive toward any unwanted communication, marketers should develop their subscriber lists with relevance and care.
Save any new documentation as a PDF for download, and require that individuals enter their names and email addresses in order to access it. The value of the information you are offering is directly proportional to the amount of personal data your customers are willing to provide, so make sure the tradeoff is fair. A highly anticipated white paper or report can garner a high number of new email subscribers who are openly expressing interest in your brand, so don’t leave this opportunity unaddressed. https://www.sageworld.com/img/dist-emailcampaigns-top.png
Most direct mail marketing managers have at least a bachelor’s degree in marketing, advertising, or business management. That education will have included classes in marketing strategy, interpreting buying statistics, watching market trends, and sociological purchasing patterns. Direct mail marketing managers will also have had at least a few years of prior marketing experience before attaining the position of manager.
A web-based interface is often available to allow people to subscribe, unsubscribe, and change their preferences. However, mailing list servers existed long before the World Wide Web,[1] so most also accept commands over email to a special email address. This allows subscribers (or those who want to be subscribers) to perform such tasks as subscribing and unsubscribing, temporarily halting the sending of messages to them, or changing available preferences - all via email. The common format for sending these commands is to send an email that contains simply the command followed by the name of the electronic mailing list the command pertains to. Examples: subscribe anylist or subscribe anylist John Doe.
It also emphasises how digital marketing does not occur in isolation, but is most effective when it is integrated with other communications channels such as phone, direct mail or face-to-face. As we have said, the role of the Internet in supporting multi-channel marketing is another recurring theme in this book and chapters 5 and 6 in particular explain its role in supporting different customer communications channels and distribution channels.
Two other practical limitations can be seen in the case of digital marketing. One,digital marketing is useful for specific categories of products,meaning only consumer goods can be propagated through digital channels.Industrial goods and pharmaceutical products can not be marketed through digital channels. Secondly, digital marketing disseminates only the information to the prospects most of whom do not have the purchasing authority/power. And hence the reflection of digital marketing into real sales volume is skeptical.[citation needed]
The post is very informative and the list you have shared with is great, but the Constant Contact is good I think to start the company as the live chat features are powerful in it can solve the one query on time. But it’s chargeable that to $20 at least it should be $10, I don’t know much about its but I’ll try for that free package and check it. Thank You.
Failures and successes in e-marketing have shown that when marketing goods online results in distribution, storing, or shipping and handling costs higher than the value of the goods, an exclusively online enterprise may be headed for a short life. In addition, e-marketers need to be aware of cultural pitfalls when designing e-commerce sites for foreign markets.
Particular groups of customers can be targeted or even individuals. Offering individual customers special deals on merchandise and/or services on the customer's birthday, for instance, is one example of email marketing personalization. (A restaurant might send an email to customers on their birthday offering 50% off an entree,) Email marketing helps a business develop and maintain a relationship with a customer over time that hopefully results in increased sales and increased customer loyalty.
Even though this falls into just one of the myriad of elements in the 20 portion of the 40/40/20 rule, it is arguably the most important. Nothing will get your piece of direct mail marketing throw into the trash bin more quickly than a glaring typo, a noticeable formatting issue, or an overall poor print quality. If you’re writing the copy, be sure to not only proof it yourself but also have some of your more linguistically-inclined friends and colleagues give it a once over, not only for grammatical and punctuation mistakes but for overall ease of reading and flow. Don’t be afraid to seek as many trusted opinions as possible, and be sure to have thick skin to prepare for any constructive criticisms.
Online marketing platform (OMP) is an integrated web-based platform that combines the benefits of a business directory, local search engine, search engine optimisation (SEO) tool, customer relationship management (CRM) package and content management system (CMS). Ebay and Amazon are used as online marketing and logistics management platforms. On Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and other Social Media, retail online marketing is also used. Online business marketing platforms such as Marketo, Aprimo, MarketBright and Pardot have been bought by major IT companies (Eloqua-Oracle, Neolane-Adobe and Unica-IBM).
Note: If you want to attach additional files, such as a .pdf, we recommend that you store these files on a cloud storage service, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, and linking to these files within your blast. We do not support file attachments to an email blast as these file types tend to be larger, increasing your chances of triggering spam filters and preventing your blast from reaching your recipients.
Augmented reality: Creating a direct mail piece that comes to life and can be manipulated by your prospects and customers is very powerful. You can create a fun user experience without going over your budget when you take the time to plan it out. Look at your idea from your client’s perspective: Is the experience fun and easy to use? (Pokémon Go is a widely recognized and fun example of augmented reality.) How can you create an experience with your direct mail? Our agency crafted an experience by creating an animated cartoon that was launched by scanning the mailer. The cartoon showed people how to use a service and the pitfalls of doing it incorrectly. This campaign was funny and informative at the same time. Whatever you do, don't be boring.
Hey Jonathan , enjoyed the article but it’s far fetched for startups and beginners like me who came here to see how in the first place we bring people to our website and not how we engage them or get email out of people who are already there.. getting people on your website is a bigger challenge, love your knowledge about the field is there an article which will help solve this?
About Color:The precise color of the bag items may vary depending on the specific monitor, the settings and the lighting conditions. The items colors depicted should only be used as an approximate guide.
A kilometer (abbreviation km), a unit of length, is a common measure of distance equal to 1000 meters and is equivalent to 0.621371192 mile or 3280.8398950131 feet.
A mile is a unit of length in a number of systems of measurement, including in the US Customary Units and British Imperial Units. The international mile is precisely equal to 1.609344 km (which is 25146⁄15625 km or 1 9521⁄15625 km in fraction).
I never completed my review of the 3-part PBS series The Human Spark. Truth is, the last episode was so unfocused that it was nearly incoherent. But the overall problem with the series was that they started with an incorrect idea (that humans are different, separate from, and superior to every other life form on the planet) and concocted seriously flawed "experiments" to "prove" this idea. (See Looking vs. Understanding)
(What strikes me as strange, given PBS's ban on religious programming on their member stations, is that idea behind their series seems to me to be rooted in religion. But that's another matter for another time.)
But while Alan Alda was trying to prove how stupid chimpanzees are, on another channel (Animal Planet) there was a show (Extraordinary Animals) that showed that chimpanzees can out-perform humans in a key area of intelligence: memory.
At the Primate Research Institute in Japan, it started with teaching a chimpanzee named Ai to use a touch-screen computer, then to count, and to read. (Videos here and here.)
Then Ai had a baby (named Ayumu), and she taught him to do the same things. (BTW, that is the definition of culture [a person's learned, accumulated experience which is socially transmitted]).
As the tests progressed, they went on to memory games and discovered that the chimpanzees possessed photographic memory. They could remember a sequence of numbers that was flashed on the screen for less than a quarter of a second--too fast for a human to even scan all the numbers.
In various tests, the chimpanzees vastly outperformed a world memory champion (yes, there are world championship memory games) at the institute's memory games.
The finding challenges human assumptions about our uniqueness, and should make us think harder about ourselves in relation to other animals, says anthropologist Jill Pruetz of Iowa State University, Ames, US.
"Observing that other species can outperform us on tasks that we assume we excel at is a bit humbling," she says. "Rather than taking such findings as a rare example or a fluke, we should incorporate this knowledge into a mindset that acknowledges that chimpanzees - and probably other species - share aspects of what we think of as uniquely human intelligence."
The results are "absolutely incredible" says Frans de Waal, at the Yerkes Primate Center at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, US. He says that chimp intelligence is chronically underestimated, and one reason is that experiments stack the deck against the chimps.
In the wild, this memory skill might be useful for memorising fruit locations at a glance, or making a quick map of all the branches and routes in a tree, he says.
Matsuzawa emphasises that the chimps in the study are by no means special - all chimps can perform like this, he says. "We underestimate chimpanzee intelligence," he says.
So, why the totally different perspectives from two supposedly reliable sources (PBS and PRI)? Well, for one thing, the PRI perspective derived from observation rather than preconceived notions.
And, in my opinion, the real "human spark" that tends to separate us from all other life is not only the ability to distort reality to suit our purposes (yes, I'm talking about the PBS series) but the desire to do so.
Why not resurrect old posts? You can bet your readers, especially new subscribers, haven’t read everything you’ve published. Consider scouring your blog for posts that remain valuable. You might batch together several that cover a single category to make it easy to create a topical and thematic series. Or, you might have written a series of posts in the past that could be ideal for an autoresponder series.
InfusionSoft is the tool of choice for serious marketers. If you run a six figure online business or have a list larger 50,000 subscribers, this may be the tool for you. InfusionSoft combines your shopping cart with email marketing, so you can do complex things like segregate your buyers from your subscribers or mail specific sequences to specific people. You can also send physical postcards from InfusionSoft. InfusionSoft isn’t cheap. The monthly subscription is in the hundreds, and there’s a four figure setup fee. It’s geared towards companies that are already successful and need powerful solutions, rather than startups.
Whether you’re dealing with consumer or business leads, successful lead scoring depends on a number of factors, such as high-quality content, well-defined buyer personas, relevant interactions, and involvement of the sales team. Lead generation software can be a useful tool, as often includes automated lead scoring.

When thinking about the five types of email marketing described previously, auto responders are almost exclusively used for customer acquisition email marketing. Your existing customers may respond well to an auto-responder campaign, but chances are high that the best place in your marketing mix for auto-responders is when trying to acquire new customers.
First of all, BuzzFeed has awesome subject lines and preview text. They are always short and punchy -- which fits in perfectly with the rest of BuzzFeed's content. I especially love how the preview text will accompany the subject line. For example, if the subject line is a question, the preview text is the answer. Or if the subject line is a command (like the one below), the preview text seems like the next logical thought right after it:
Content is a great way to guide users to a landing page. Typically, you create content to provide visitors with useful, free information. You can include CTAs anywhere in your content — inline, bottom-of-post, in the hero, or even on the side panel. The more delighted a visitor is with your content, the more likely they are to click your call-to-action and move onto your landing page.
Lead scoring is a shared sales and marketing methodology for ranking leads in order to determine their sales-readiness. You score leads based on the interest they show in your business, their current in the buying cycle, and their fit in regards to your business. Lead scoring helps companies know whether prospects need to be fast-tracked to sales or developed with lead nurturing. Lead scoring is essential to strengthening your revenue cycle, effectively drive more ROI, and align sales and marketing.
The aspects of your lead gen campaign should mirror everything else on your website, on your blog, and within the product that you will eventually try to sell. If not, you’ll have a difficult time getting your lead to the next lifecycle stage. Your campaign should be about more than just obtaining an email address — it should be about developing a new customer.
When a subscriber is sorted into a segment, it can trigger an automation to send to them. Each person’s interactions with your email campaigns or your website can trigger a sequence of follow-up emails based on their interests, allowing you to hone your message to your targeted audience. For example, if someone visits your pricing page, you know they’re probably further down your sales funnel and will want to follow-up appropriately. Or if they went to a specific product page or clicked on a link for that product, you can send additional information about the product, testimonials and more.
Lead generation often uses digital channels, and has been undergoing substantial changes in recent years from the rise of new online and social techniques. In particular, the abundance of information readily available online has led to the rise of the “self-directed buyer” and the emergence of new techniques to develop and qualify potential leads before passing them to sales.
Our email editor provides the most flexibility in design with a content block approach rather than a drag-and-drop methodology. With content blocks you can easily add rows of new content elements, move them up and down, and swap content from left to right. With content blocks you can also set the padding or amount of white space between elements, giving your content the room it needs. In addition, free graphics are available in our image library. Neither MailChimp nor Constant Contact offers any of these features.

“I started performing as a dancer at age 3, later on I ventured towards acting and that is when I discovered my passion"
Mumbai, January 27, 2016: Avantha Group Company CG and CEA (LITEN) have agreed to cooperate for a period of 12 months to investigate market potential and opportunities for Solar Photo Voltaic (PV) system with storage function for Indian Airports. The agreement was formally announced during the recently held India-France Business Summit in Chandigarh. There is no capital investment in the first phase of this collaboration, however following investigation if found suitable, the companies intend to set up manufacturing facilities using CG’s infrastructure and expertise in India and technology knowhow of CEA for commercialising the business opportunity. Being a critical infrastructure, Airports need significant energy backup. Use of Solar PV with battery backup is an innovative solution that will enable Indian airports to reduce carbon emissions by moving over the traditional diesel generator (DG) sets, at the same time make it an economical option given the considerable Time of Day (TOD) charges levied.
LITEN is a major European research institute and a driving force behind the development of the sustainable energy technologies of the future. The institute is spearheading the EU’s efforts to limit dependency on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is a part of CEA Tech, the R&D wing of the innovation giant, the CEA - a French government-funded technological research organisation in the areas of energy, defence and security, information technologies and health technologies. A prominent player in the European Research Area, it is involved in setting up collaborative projects with many partners around the world. CEA’s LITEN Institute is a centre for technological research in new energy (fuel-cell, hydrogen-production, photovoltaic and biomass) and storage technologies, fields in which CEA holds considerable know-how.
The collaboration synergises the strategic strengths and complementary competencies of both establishments - CEA with its significant expertise in Photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage technologies and CG an established player in AC substations in solar plants with significant market reach with large customers.
The Indian government has announced to achieve 100 GW of power generation through Solar PV systems by 2022, current installed solar generation capacity is less than 6 GW. The expected new PV solar systems market is nearly 13 GW per year. Airports with large stretches of free land offer good opportunity for solar generation. It is estimated that there is a potential of over 500 MW of solar PV generation plants for Airports alone. This makes the collaboration a significant step towards realising the Indian Government’s renewable energy goals.
Mr. Laurent Demortier said: “We are thrilled to collaborate with CEA. The CEA technology is the most advanced in the renewable sector, combined with the CG capacity to fully industrialise and localise this technology in India, I do believe that we will both build competitive solutions meeting the needs of our customers in India. This agreement is in line with the synergies that the two countries – India & France, are exploring and combines CG’s infrastructure with CEA’s knowhow in the field. This collaboration will help to leverage the huge potential for solar power generation in the country and we look forward to the opportunities this puts forward”.

The problem that xhtml 2.0 faced (and any xhtml adoption for that matter) is that you're still dealing with the Coding Granny Argument, something that is used extensively by the HTML purist crowd who frankly do NOT want to see XML adopted as a lingua franca, especially
Most of you have seen the argument, of course. It runs along the lines of "HTML has to be accessible to non-programmers. My grandmother should be able to write HTML code, even if its ill-formed, and have the browser magically "know" what was the intent of such code, otherwise there will be no adoption of HTML.
In practice, this argument is specious in the extreme.� The eponymous coding granny is far more likely� to be writing in a blog engine or wiki in which the input of content is almost certainly going to be filtered into a final form for storage, they will likely end up using perhaps two tags, <i> and <b>, and may even by using a WYSIWYG editor that will let her incorporate code programatically. It is not, in fact, this user that the argument is intended to protect, but rather the coder with bad programming habits.
Most framework libraries are unfortunately written by people who may be good Java or Python or JavaScript of PHP programmers but who have either been seduced by the notion that HTML can be lazy or are in fact just sloppy. The irony, of course, is that in nearly all computer languages, if you violate syntactical rules, the program won't compile. Why HTML has to be the one language that violates this has never been clear. What's even worse, I can see it for HTML 4.1, because that language was approved at a time when HTML was still coded largely by hand, and as such there is a large block of legacy code that needs to be supported. However, why HTML 5 needs to conform to this absurdity is still beyond me, and I've yet to see a truly valid reason for not mandating just an XML format.
There is a second facet to these arguments. The HTML crowd hates, fears and despises namespaces. Again namespaces mess too much with the Coding Granny argument, and they add to the complexity of writing inline HTML content for all of those AJAX programmers who tend to think that the only relevant angle bracket language is HTML. If Ian Hixie acknowledges the XML argument, then he also has to acknowledge the validity of namespaces, and I suspect this is a non-starter for him. By keeping the two languages "separate but equal" he gets his namespace free language and can then work towards eliminating namespaces from the spec down the road.
There's supposed to be an extensibility workshop in September at one of the F2Fs where namespaces in general will be hashed out - I plan to be monitoring that one carefully, as I suspect that there will be a move to "fix" namespaces in a way that will have long term negative repercussions for the XML community.

For the past several days, I've been on my annual Ignatian Retreat. Today was the first day without rain, so I was looking forward to seeing the sunrise. If you are an early riser like me, you know that some sunrises are better than others. Looking toward the East from the room where I was sitting, today's was kind of a dud. The windows were still glazed with last night's rain, and the clouds hanging low on the horizon blocked some of the beauty slowly unfolding behind them. A little disappointed, I decided to take a walk around the grounds outside, and set off with my coffee in hand, iPhone in my pocket.
As I began walking, I realized that, given the location of the retreat center, a heavy mist was moving through. It seemed beautiful and a little mystical. As I rounded a corner, I saw sunlight coming through the woods, and the bright light was filtering through the trees and the mist. This photo shows you how it looked, rather like a starburst.
I hope I never get used to the experience of God's surprises. This little glimpse into His glory this morning was gone just as quickly as it came. No one else was around. No one else saw it. It was just for me, an unexpected gift.
As I'm writing these words, I'm reminded once again of the importance of gratitude. God is constantly offering us little gifts to be experienced by those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. My prayer for you today is that you would slow down enough to catch a glimpse of God's gifts, which are all around you. Don't miss them. They may be meant just for you, and they can be gone in an instant.

Shay Charka once again displays his visual genius, portraying the onerous demand on Israelis to switch from the memorial candles of Yom HaZikaron to the celebrations of Yom Ha’atzmaut. (Originally appeared in Makor Rishon, and on Shay’s facebook page.
Over Yom Ha’atzmaut, I decided to dive in to the best of Israeli popular culture. For each new song of HaDag Nachash I managed to translate, I rewarded myself with a Goldstar Unfiltered Beer.
Both were tasty, but while the songs didn’t affect the quality of the beer, as the afternoon wore on the beer certainly began to affect the quality of the translations.
And then there was the back-and-forth with Shaanan Streett, over all the brilliant Hebrew word-play that is untranslatable. Three key examples from their latest single:
1. First of all, the title itself. On their youtube channel, עוד יהיה טוב yihiye tov b’eretz yisrael is given as “Things will get better”. In the end for the translation we agreed on “All will yet be well”. It has more of a classical ring to it, which the strangely-dated chorus sound hints at.
2. Early on in the song, the rapper asks: “From what do I draw cheer?” And then throws down a translation challenge. “Not from the Labor (party) and certainly not from the Likud (party) – well maybe a little from the labor.” My slight of hand in putting a small “l” instead of a capital “L” for labor hints very poorly at the neat ambiguity in the Hebrew. Does he mean that he tends to the left of the political spectrum, or is he already sliding into a conversation about his own job? In Hebrew he could be saying both or neither. The English? Meh.
3. בנינו פיס בהתנחלויות Baninu Payis behitnachluyot refers to the standard-design cultural centers, sports and arts halls, that are built throughout the country by the National Lottery (Mif’al haPayis). A more literal translation would be something like “We built Payis buildings in the settlements”. However since the non-Israeli is unlikely to recognize such a reference, we went for the double-meaning of “lottery” – not just that the institution builds structures in the West Bank, but that this is something of a gamble…
Here are the three songs in their agreed versions. Just click on the “cc” button to choose English subtitles. And crack open a beer…

Dorit Rabinyan was born in Israel to an Iranian-Jewish family. She is the recipient of the Itzhak Vinner Prize, the ACUM Award, The Prime Minister’s Prize and the Jewish Wingate Quarterly Award (London). Her first two novels PERSIAN BRIDES and A STRAND OF A THOUSAND PEARLS were both best sellers and translated into fifteen languages. In 2014 Rabinyan published her third novel, BORDERLIFE, an immediate best seller in Israel. In January 2016 BORDERLIFE became the center of a political scandal in Israel when the book was removed from high schools’ curriculum.
A chance New York encounter brings two strangers together: Liat, an Israeli from Tel Aviv, and Hilmi, a Palestinian born in Hebron. For one frozen winter away from home, on snowy streets, filled with longing for a Middle East sun, Liat and Hilmi demarcate the place reserved only for them, an intimate short-term place, a universe for two. At the fissures and margins of things, in corners and in gaps, the reality lurking in Israel peers at them and snarls. The story, with its passions and twists, follows them even when they each go their own way – Liat returning to Tel Aviv and Hilmi to the village of Jifna, north of Ramallah – refusing to end.
Chayuta Deutsch was born and bred in Tel Aviv. She has taught at Ulpana Kfar Pines, at Bayit VeGan College, Maaleh Film School, Hebrew University, at Bar Ilan University, and at Bet Morasha Academy for Jewish Zionist Leadership. She began her writing career with the children’s magazine “Otiot” in 1983. Between 1997-99 she edited “Otiot” and “Sukariot”. She was the literary editor of “HaTzofeh”, and the deputy editor of “Nekuda”. She has written op-eds for “HaTzofeh”, Ynet, Maariv online, and currently writes her own column “L’pnai ulifnim” in the Shabbat supplement of “Makor Rishon”. “Were I to hear another voice” is her first novel, after having published a collection of short stories “This is what redemption looks like”, and a biography of Nechama Leibovitz. She was among those who established Kolech, Israel’s first Orthodox Jewish feminist organization, and was on the Board of Directors for several years. She is currently the head of publishing for Bet Morasha, and the editor of “Akademot”.
After having tried again and again to realize her dream of having a family, Uzia decides to leave her home town of Tel Aviv, and build herself a new life in a small village in the North of Israel. She leaves everything behind: Her memories of her life in Tel Aviv as an only daughter of National-Orthodox parents; the man she had loved all her life; her close childhood friends; and her work as a respected journalist.
A friendly little café in the village becomes her refuge and source of income. She opens up a writing workshop at the cafe for local characters both charming and mysterious, but the demons of her past do not leave her. As the writing workshops become an arena for secrets and confessions, it turns out that Uzia’s refuge is no safe space at all, and that those around her are not who they seem to be.
And all this while, threatening graffiti that appear throughout the country lead a team of secret police to set off in search of the members of a messianic sect who threaten to sow violence and destruction. At the head of the sect stands a charismatic man called “Levi”, who sweeps up youth into acts of rebellion not just against the State of Israel, but also against the world of Jewish religious law. When his dangerous teachings lead the State to the brink of civil war, his pursuers realize they must hurry and uncover the identity of this “Levi” before it is too late.
In collaboration with the Rabin Center, top Israeli band HaDag Nachash have just released a brand new song for Rabin Memorial Day.
I’ll admit that there has been little leading up to Rosh Hashana that leaves me looking forward to the New Year. The extremities of Climate Change, the extremities of Middle Eastern conflicts, the extremities of poverty, refugees, and public discourse.
And then, galloping in on its White Horse, Israeli popular culture comes to lift me up once more. I have been translating Israeli popular music for over a decade now, but today I celebrate the fact that Israel’s Song of the Year is untranslatable.
The song “Sweet when I am Bitter” is such a delightful reggae swing through the cutest of Hebrew word play, that it is no wonder it won the listeners’ award on top radio station Galgalatz.
Throughout the song, Eliad Nachum strings together a hidden list of top music stars, like a musical word puzzle of Israeli popular culture. The chorus in particular is a delight.
A direct English translation would have you understand that Eliad is praising his girlfriend while referring to a friend of theirs called Bob: “You create sweetness like Bob, when I am bitter.” But the word “bitter” in Hebrew is “Mar”, and “Li” indicates the bitterness is mine. In this way we can hear that the Hebrew is hiding the iconic reggae star: “BOB, ksheMARLEY”
As well as playing with pop stars, Eliad touches on the bible, too. “Just tell me, and I’ll run into the (lions’) den” he proclaims. But while referencing the Book of Daniel, he also gently plants a tribute to beloved performer Gidi Gov: “Rak taGIDI ve’arutz el toch haGOV”
I could have done one of Makom’s standard video translations, but more would have been lost than captured.
Hebrew culture has now reached such a thickness that even the hit parade is too dense to be easily translated.

On Saturday, The Netherlands pulled off a medals sweep in the women's 3,000-meter speed skating event, making them the first country to collect gold, silver, and bronze medals for this round of games. And how did they celebrate? By throwing some shade at President Trump, of course!

At the beginning before meeting Master Tham, my business was running very badly and it brought a lot of problems to me. My relationship with others was extremely bad. There are a lot of backstabbers that turn my relationship with everyone even sour. Luckily one day I have the fate to meet Master Tham. He remedied the Feng Shui of my house and everything instantly turned to the better. My children are more filial and they had the chance to futher their studies overseas. Now I even have the chance to travel overseas for holidays too. At the same time, I bought Buddha Statues and the best amulets from him. After wearing them, my relationship with others had turned better and my luck had also improved. I couldn’t express how thankful I am to have found him. Thank you so much Master Tham! You’re truly the genuine master!

Even though you have a college degree it does not mean that you are qualified for every position available. But let's be realistic about things. There are many jobs that you can probably do well, but are not qualified for. There are ways to increase your chances of landing these types of jobs. Jobs for the under qualified individual are everywhere. One of these jobs could be yours. Follow these tips below to help secure one of those jobs for the under qualified worker.
Show the employer that even though you may not have all of the job skills necessary, that you do have some of the skills. If you have never worked in customer service, but have worked in sales, show this on your resume. The two go hand and hand.
Be sure to put on your resume all of your education and work experience. Jobs for the under qualified can sometimes be had if you show that your educational experience matches up with the job description. Do not forget to add all relative job experience as well. Internships, co-ops, and volunteer work can all be included on a resume.
Be reasonable when applying for positions. Yes, you may be able to land a position that you are not fully qualified for; but do not waste your time applying for a job that is completely out of your league. You cannot be a lawyer if you did not attend law school!
Express your interest in learning, as well as your ability to learn new job functions. Often to find jobs for the under qualified employee you will need to learn some new skills. Show on your resume that you are a quick learner, and that you have had to do this in past positions.
Look deeper into what the employer is looking for. The more you know about the available position, the better chance you have. This will give you the opportunity to customize your resume according to what the employer is looking for. Check the company website for a detailed job description.
Show examples of past work, or put together a portfolio. This will show that the quality of your work is far above average. Sometimes it will not even matter if the work samples are not closely related to the job description. A well put together portfolio will display your talents nicely.
If you have time, offer to volunteer. This is a great way to get your foot in the door. You can meet people this way, and eventually jump on board as a paid employee. Never overlook this option!
Following these tips will help to improve your chances of landing your dream job, even if you are slightly under qualified.

Pello Bilbao (Astana) claimed stage 1 of the Tour of the Alps and the first leader’s jersey of the race, after a well-timed attack little under five kilometres from the finish. The Astana rider jumped away from the leaders after the final climb and held off the chasers, with Luis Leon Sanchez (Astana) finishing second and Ivan Ramiro Sosa (Androni Giocattoli-Sidermec) taking third on the stage.
Giro d’Italia rivals Chris Froome (Team Sky), Thibaut Pinot (Groupama FDJ) and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates), all locked horns on the final 19-kilometre ascent of Rovereto, with the Italian briefly distanced after Froome had launched a stinging attack before the summit. There was a re-grouping on the run-in to the line, and Astana showed their strength with five riders present. It was Bilbao who seized the opportunity, powering clear before the short rise to the finish.
The race was defined by the long 19-kilometre ascent before a six-kilometre descent to the line in Folgaria.
It was Pinot's Groupama team that sat on the front of the main field before the climb, and the French under set a steady pace on the lower slopes as they reduced the lead of the early break.
Solid tempo work from Pinot's men on the lower slopes saw the lead group splintered the leaders, and with 20km to go the gap was down to 2:23.
Six kilometres later, and with the break caught, Pinot fired Sebastien Reichenbach up the road with just over 12 kilometres remaining. Team Sky duly moved to the front in a bid to keep the Swiss rider under control but Giulio Ciccone attacked and soon after and moved to the front of the race as Reichenbach was reeled in. Just before the capture Pinot attacked but his move was quickly brought back as Froome's team set about shredding the peloton.
With just one teammate left to support Froome, and the summit of the climb fast approaching, Aru attacked. The Italian's move was nullified, with Froome responding in kind with a surging attack that drew out Pinot, George Bennett and Domenico Pozzovivo. The quartet caught on the descent, before a group containing Aru and Bilbao made contact.
When Bilbao eventually went clear, his Astana team disrupted the chase but the 28-year-old continued to extend his lead before taking a well-deserved victory.

The Opportune Moment, 1855 is another uproarious and unsettling attack on convention by one of literature’s great provocateurs. The nineteenth-century founding of “free settlements” in the Americas serves as a starting point for the new novel by popular Czech author Patrik Ourednik. At once satirical and philosophical, the book opens with an Italian anarchist’s letter to his noble former mistress, an impassioned rejection of all of Europe’s latest and greatest advancements, from the Enlightenment to social reform to communist revolution. We then leap back in time half a century to the alternately somber and hilarious shipboard diary of a common Italian everyman sailing to Brazil with a motley, multina­tional band of idealists to build a new society, a pitiless portrait of the often unbridgeable gap between theory and practice.
Patrik Ourednik was born 1957 in Prague, but moved to France in 1984, where he still lives. He is the author of twelve books, including fiction, essays, and poems. He is also the Czech translator of novels, short stories, and plays from such writers as Francois Rabelais, Alfred Jarry, Raymond Queneau, Samuel Beckett, and Boris Vian. He has received a number of prizes for his writing, including the Czech Literary Fund Award. The Opportune Moment, 1855 is his third book translated into English and published by Dalkey Archive.
Alex Zucker’s translation of Petra Hůlová’s first novel, All This Belongs to Me, received the National Translation Award from the American Literary Translators Association. His translation of Jáchym Topol’s novel The Devil’s Workshop will be published by Portobello Books in 2013. He is currently translating Markéta Lazarová, by Vladislav Vančura, on a Literary Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.
Anderson Tepper has been on the editorial staff of Vanity Fair since 1998 and has written on books for a variety of publications, including the New York Times Book Review, the Nation, Words Without Borders, Tin House, and the Paris Review. He is on the advisory committee for the PEN World Voices Festival and the international stage of the Brooklyn Book festival.

I like the cinematic flexibility of it too. For myself, I don't like game where I have to do a lot of stat prep before hand, writing up detailed sheets for NPCs and such. D6 lets me do this, and on the fly too. If I need an NPC of a particular power level then I can just give him the stats necessary and I'm good to go. The mechanics are simple enough that balance between PCs and NPCs is fairly easy to judge. The fact that the mechanics are pretty simple and straightforward also let me spend more time on describing what is happening, and less time calling out numbers than a lot of games. I still remember one combat I ran in a Stormtrooper game, where the PCs got into a running gunfight with a couple of rebels trying to escape. The combat was fast and dynamic, and by the type the rebels were captured and the combat was over, the players both told me it felt like only 5 minutes had passed, when in fact we spent about half an hour on it. But that feeling of quickness and action is something that I haven't been able to find in other games, and why I keep coming back to D6. As far as specifics, I really like the way D6 handles multiple actions. One guy I game with regularly always tries to do lots of things during his turn, and while it's all in character and cinematic, in other systems I have to tell him something like "sorry, you only get one move action, and one attack action, and you can't all out attack if you jump on that table", or something similar. Usually there's more game-specific terminology involved. He often feels a little disappointed, and frustrated that what he wants to do has to fall within certain boxes of action-type. Or we have to house rule it, but that can cause balance problems with those games. In D6 though, I can say "sure! but the more actions you try the harder everything is to do" and he's excited because he can try what he's picturing in his head, and he doesn't have to learn a whole bunch of game-specific terminoloty to do it. I really appreciate D6's simplicity and flexibility in that regard. Also, I really like that you can spend character points to get extra dice. I know there are problems with this (some have just come up in one of my games, actually), but overall I think it's a fun idea. The problem that's come up in my game is going to have to be house-ruled, though... but that's another great thing about D6! It's robust enough that you can tweak it to hell and back without breaking it. Another aspect of the system that I like is the Wild Die. Again, I know this is something a lot of folks have had issues with, but I've finally come up with a way to play it that works for me. When a '1' shows up on the wild die, first of all I never penalize the rolled total. I've found that doing the math slows things down, and is disappointing. Sometimes it affects the success of the action, sometimes it doesn't, but it's always a bummer for the players. I do keep the idea of a '1' triggering a complication, but I try not to be a jerk about it. First, I never have a '1' cancel out an otherwise successful roll. None of this, "you made your stealth check but stepped on a twig so the guard still notices you" sort of thing. Second, I only use the complication if I can think of something interesting to do with it. For example, in my Star Wars game I've had players accidentally shoot control panels causing ionization or overloads, once I had a lightsaber miss and cut through the control system of the repulsorlift truck they were fighting on the back of sending in careening out of control, and another time a '1' on an otherwise successful dodge roll caused the PC to just barely get out of the way but have his chest armour cut in half by the vibroaxe instead. Actually, those were all in one session. But the PCs loved it! One of them mentioned to me after the game that he was more interested in rolling '1's on the Wild Die instead of '6's, just to see what would happen, so now I'm thinking of a similar way to interpret a '6', but we'll see. In a more mundane sense, I just like that D6 is a skill-based system, instead of being all about classes and levels. It makes it really easy for me to create the sort of character I want to, instead of having to figure out how to interpret what I'm imagining into a class/level based game. In those situations, half the time I just get frustrated and either play a bland stereotype just don't play at all because I can't figure out how to make my character concept fit. Plus, I've found that character generation takes far less time in D6. I had an unexpected player show up to a game a couple months ago, and instead of taking the entire evening to roll up a character, he was able to put together something in under 30 mins, and still play. And this was a guy who had only played D6 once before, about 5 years ago. So 'easy to learn' is definitely another reason why I love D6. I guess what it all comes down to, is that I have more fun playing D6 than any other system. It's easy to play, and it's easy to run as a GM. Instead of worrying about skill modifiers and combat action types and all the other small particularities of other systems, I can just sit back, shout some things, roll some dice, and have fun. Oh, and I like the fact that it only uses D6s. They're my favorite dice, and they're easy to find.
Hey, looks nifty! Time will tell, but so far seems pretty good. Thanks for taking the time to keep this up Magman
I'd probably go with the D6 Adventure spread. Though I go back and forth on whether or not Reflexes and Coordination really need to be separate Attributes. And that Attribute spread also has a lot of 'P' stats... Physique, Presence, Perception... I like 'Presence', but I'd be inclined to rename Physique to Strength, and Perception to Awareness, to create more name distinction. Maybe. Thoughts?
I took a quick glance at it just now and it looks pretty good! Clean and easy to read formatting too. I can see it being pretty handy to have an easy-to-edit rtf like that. Thanks for putting the work in!
The templates are actually 2 pages. The first page is the template description, with a general overview, a short section (about a paragraph) giving possible connections with other PCs, and a quote for each (titled "Famous Last Words"). The second page is the template's attributes, skills, and other stat miscellany. Pictures are sparse, and supplied for less than half (I counted 7, but was clicking through pretty quickly). The few pictures that are presented are pretty generic (except for the Zealot, whose pictures is just bizarre).
Personally, I like the simplicity of being able to spend CPs for either advancement or an in-game advantage, but the Star Wars game I'm running has hit a problem with this. One of the characters has been saving up his CP just fine, only using 1 or 2 now and again to pull of some critical rolls, but the other PC has had problems. Due to both his terrible dice luck, as well as a desire to pull of wild in-game moves (I think he's been playing too much Force Unleashed), he ends up spending most if not all of his CP by the end of a session, and I'm pretty generous with CP at that. As a consequence, while the other PC has developed normally, his is starting to become a bit stunted, motivating him to spend even more CP in game to try and keep up. Basically, he can't handle the resource management of it. But he did make a good point when he said to me, "it just doesn't make sense that I can keep adventuring, but not improve one bit as a consequence, even if I spent all my CP". And I have to admit he has a point (seems like there are other folks out there who feel this way too). I'll admit, my personal inclination is to say, "too bad dude, suck it up and learn how to play the game right, instead of short changing yourself over and over," but upon reflection, this isn't very constructive. Plus, as the GM I feel it's my job to try to make things fun, and he's getting understandable frustrated. The guy tends to have trouble with mechanics in general, but in all other ways his a great player, and I hate to see him bummed out, so I've been looking at alternatives. The answer I've found that seems the best is to use a variation of the D6 Powers "Ka" system. Similar to what Hanzo what thinking, it's basically a recharging pool of points that can be used to get extra dice, or do other things like extra actions, though different benefits have different point costs - it's not a 1 to 1 relationship like CP. Your Ka pool is attached to one of your stats (can't remember which at the moment), and you can buy advantages to increase the Ka pool. By default, this is used along side of Fate points and Character points. What I'm thinking of changing, is disallowing the expenditure of CP to gain extra dice in game, making it purely XP. I'd tweak the Ka system slightly so you only ever have to spend one point to get a benefit (which would probably also entail retuning the starting amount). I'd rename Ka points to Force points, and rename what were originally Force points to Destiny points (stealing shamelessly from SW Saga ). I would be able to throw out free Force points in play for neat ideas or stylish moves (similar to bennies in other systems), and Destiny points would only come from doing things dramatically powerful and significant. The ability for Ka points to automatically regenerate over time would play nicely with the "freeform" Force rules I'm trying to develop right now (based on the Psychic rules from D6 Metabarons). Anyway, what do you guys think? The reason I'm thinking of tweaking Ka, and disallowing CP to be spent for extra dice in-game, instead of running them side-by-side like in D6 Powers is because that feels like just too many sub systems and resource management to me. Admittedly, having a pool of recharging points that can be spent to gain extra dice (wild dice?) is going to up the cinematic feel of the game a bit, especially with me throwing out extra points in play. But I think having a cap on the pool based on a stat will keep it from getting out of hand. I'm sure there will be complications that I'll have to work out, but it seems like a pretty good way of allowing players to get extra dice in-game, while keeping them from shooting their character advancement in the foot
Hello Matthew, and welcome! Things seem kinda quiet around here right now, but hopefully it'll pick up after the holidays. What's your experience with WEG settings/systems?
This game sounds very cool so far! I must admit to being pretty intrigued by the idea of throwing supers into the Cthulhu-verse. How is the game progressing?
Let's see... there was my buddy's Rodian Smuggler and his copilot, my Equay Starship Mechanic. The Equay is an alien race I made up, based off of 30-30 from the old Bravestar cartoon. When describing the race somebody responded with, "so... you're playing a horse-monster?", and I was constantly referred to as such OCC for the rest of the game. :rolleyes: Those two characters were great together though. That game also saw a battered 3P0 unit doing it's best to be helpful and not get blasted, and a handful of Human Jedi, most of whom died when we were ambushed by Aliens (that's right, Giger style Xenomorphs :eek:) while exploring an abandoned Imperial science outpost on some backwater Rim planet. That was an awesome game. Later games saw a loudmouthed Devaronian Swoop Racer getting into trouble with a Human Gambler and a Mon Calamari Jedi Diplomat; a Human Jedi Swordsman in a contentious business arrangement with a Weequay Mercenary; and finally, the current PCs: a Force Sensitive Stormtrooper 2nd Lieutenant, and his one time squad mate, an Ex-Storm Trooper turned Darkside Apprentice, currently under the command of an Imperial Inquisitor (NPC). They are joined from time to time by a (very early) Prototype Dark Trooper Droid, and once, by a grizzled Veteran Imperial Technician. It'll be interesting to see who else comes and goes in that campaign.
Aye, so it goes. I think Eric would do good if he could pass off all this public relations and sales coordination stuff to someone else, who has the time to stay abreast of the community, and at least respond regularly, if not proactively release regular announcements. Not a pretty situation. Still, I have hope that D6 can rise from the ashes and find itself a more mainstream niche in the gaming community someday. *crosses fingers* But yeah, in regards to the OP, that's why I finally just gave up and bought the PDF from DriveThruRPG. And it's pretty cool. I should get some good use out of it. I do wish we could get at least semi-regular status updates, though... Ah well. Anyone know what Bill Coffin is up to these days?
*bump* So what's the latest? Anybody hear any word on the hardbacks? My impatience finally hit critical mass a couple weeks ago, and I bought the pdf from DriveThruRPG to see if I should bother staying intersted or not. It's a little rougher than I had hoped (mostly typos and such), but I like what I see! Still skimming through it, but it looks like it has a lot of potential. It'd be great to know there's a hardback out there somewhere that I could get my hands on eventually...
Huh. I hit Google up, and it appears to be something to do with RC Helicopters. *shrug* So as to Septimus, anyone else have any issues with character gen? Anyone else getting a chance to run a character yet? I finally broke down and decided to buy the Septimus pdf a couple days ago. Only had a chance to skim it so far. The core rules look a bit 'odd' (I'll probably just drop in SW R&E as a base), but all the boons and banes and nano/gen mods look pretty awesome! Definitely curious to hear other folks' experiences.

Wisconsin first lady Jessica Doyle shows students in Litza Janowski’s second grade classroom at Blessed Sacrament School, a photo album chronicling her adventures with the paper cutout Flat Stanley that the students sent her. Doyle returned the paper boy to the Blessed Sacrament students on Friday, May 1 in a visit to the Milwaukee school. (Catholic Herald photo by Juan C. Medina)
MILWAUKEE – Flat Stanley is one popular guy. The cutout paper boy seems to be popping up everywhere, going home with friends from school, doing homework, helping with chores, eating dinner, going shopping and playing video games. And his social calendar rocks. Every day is an adventure, whether practicing with the Milwaukee Wave, the Milwaukee Bucks, going to the dentist or visiting foreign countries, Flat Stanley has a blast.
Blessed Sacrament students from Litza Janowski’s second grade class could hardly believe their eyes Friday morning, May 1 when Wisconsin’s first lady, Jessica Doyle, entered their classroom toting a bright red album chronicling her adventures with Flat Stanley.
Stanley is a character author Jeff Brown created over a series of six books based on bedtime stories he created for his two young sons. Published in 1964, the book “Flat Stanley” describes how the average boy woke up one morning to discover that during the night he had been flattened by a bulletin board that once hung at the head of his bed. Unscathed but changed; Stanley quickly learned the advantages of being pancake-flat.
Mr. and Mrs. George Lambchop, Stanley’s parents, are sensible about their older son’s new shape. When Stanley wants to visit friends in California, the parents fold him into an envelope and send him – all for the cost of a postage stamp.
“This is my eighth or ninth year doing the Flat Stanley project with my students, and each year they seem to get more excited about doing it and try to outdo the grade before them,” she said. “They each make their own Flat Stanley and we generally send him to relatives and friends, but this year decided to also send them to celebrities such as the Bucks, the Wave, Archbishop Dolan, President Obama and Jessica Doyle.”
A cover letter asks the recipient to care for Flat Stanley and goes on to request a little information on the location he is visiting.
“I sent him to my Grandpa in Mexico and hope he is having fun,” he said. “I am still waiting for him to send him back. I think he probably will; it just takes a long, long time to get here.”
Deciding to send Flat Stanley to the governor’s mansion was Janowski’s idea as Blessed Sacrament students participate in the Sharp Literacy Program each year and a couple of years ago donated their rendition of a Georgia O’Keefe Oriental Poppy painting to Doyle. They were surprised to receive a thank you letter from her with the message that the painting would be displayed in the mansion.
“I figured I would remind her of that when we sent her a Flat Stanley and hoped it would help her to respond,” said Janowski. “I sent it in March and figured it must have gotten lost. That is, until this week when her office called and said she wanted to make a personal visit to the school children. Apparently, she wanted to bring Stanley back in person because she had such a wonderful time with him.”
The students were nearly speechless as Doyle explained the political role of a governor caring for the people in the state, and compared his duties to that of the mayor who watches over the city, and a school principal who watches over students.
Doyle explained her extensive responsibilities and noted how much Flat Stanley helped her at her home in Madison, on the road, and prayed with her during Mass at her parish, Queen of Peace.
The first lady’s album was packed with a variety of personal anecdotes, as well as photographs of Flat Stanley with school children, dignitaries and in the dining room.
“He helped me visit elementary students in Tomahawk where I gave a prize for a geography contest, he dined with state legislators at the executive residence with the governor and the first lady, and helped set the beautiful table,” said Doyle, reading from her album, titled, “Flat Stanley and Mrs. Doyle’s Adventures in the State of Wisconsin.”
“Flat Stanley was a great host when we opened the executive residence on Thursdays for tours to students,” she said, “But his favorite place was helping Chef Kevin in the kitchen. They became good buddies and his favorite thing to eat was chicken. It was really something, the whole time Flat Stanley stayed with us, chicken kept disappearing from the kitchen.”
Eight-year-old Isabella Charles was mesmerized by Doyle and let her see the bulletin board filled with Flat Stanley characters that had returned.
While most of the characters eventually return via the U.S. Postal Service, Janowski admitted that this was the first time he was hand delivered to the classroom.
“This has just made my whole week,” said Janowski. “It is so cool and touching that she would do this for us.”
Doyle seemed genuinely moved by the experience, even making sure to include a photo of Flat Stanley posing in front of the O’Keefe Poppy Painting.
“Do you notice your painting in the background?” she questioned the students. “Flat Stanley loved it, as the governor and I do. It has been so wonderful to be here with all of you students in this wonderful school.”

California congressman Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that the panel is negotiating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation about narrowly redacting sensitive information contained in a memo meant to counter a Republican document alleging surveillance abuses.
In addition to the FBI and DOJ omitted "relevant and material" facts from their FISA application targeting Page, the Nunes memo also says former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said in his testimony a year ago that the Page warrant would not have been sought without information contained in the Steele dossier, an explosive and unverified collection of memos alleging collusion between Trump and Russian Federation.
Trump blocked the release of the Democratic memo on Friday, claiming that it was too "political", despite the Republican memo being a blatantly partisan attack on the intelligence community.
Mr. Trump has accused Democrats of a setup, saying they knew Mr. Schiff's memo contained classified information that couldn't be released, making it look like the White House was stonewalling.
For his part, Republican Devin Nunes, who heads the intelligence committee, asked the Democrats to accept the Justice Department's recommendations and "make the appropriate technical changes and redactions" so that their memo can be declassified as soon as possible.
Having refused to release the Democratic memo, Trump directed the Justice Department to provide "technical assistance" to the House Intelligence Committee.
Democrats have countered that the GOP memo was inaccurate and a misleading collection of "cherry-picked" details.
"If a member or staff employee of the House Intelligence Committee engaged with the White House to stifle the special counsel inquiry, it would be hard to see how such collaboration would be considered "essential to the deliberations" of the committee or the House", the trio noted.
"The hypocrisy of President Trump's decision to block release of the Democratic memo reaches out and grabs you by the throat", the California Democrat tweeted Sunday.
"We need to go through that and identify that which remains classified and would implicate sources and methods or investigative interests", he said at a newsmaker's breakfast meeting on Wednesday sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. McGahn told Nunes that President Trump was "inclined" but "unable" to declassify the 10-page memo because it "contains numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages". Rep. Matt Gaetz told Infowars host and notorious conspiracy theorist Alex Jones that he was unjustly being labeled a conspiracy theorist for pushing for the release of the Nunes memo.
Trump allowed the release of the memo, made public on February 2, which was written by the committee's Republicans.
President Donald Trump shouts to reporters while departing the White House June 7, 2017 in Washington, DC. In July 2016, Trump openly invited Russian Federation to interfere with the election and to commit a crime by hacking into a private email server.

Today was the first meeting of the Teachers as Writers Poetry Workshop that I'm attending this summer at Inprint. I've done several of these since 2004, including a short story one last summer which I really enjoyed. The class was full--15 participants, three of whom were also in the short story with me. Some of them are kind of scary. One has an MFA in poetry and has published a chapbook. One just graduated from undergrad with an emphasis in creative writing before teaching this past school year. One is using the class as a way to get back into writing before applying to an MFA program. Even some of the others who are "just" teachers seemed especially talented when they read their bad poems, which we wrote as a writing exercise. I'm not sure that I ever felt this intimidated on day 1 of a workshop.
As part of a writing exercise, we had to brainstorm some first lines of poems, and then we had to share the most interesting one and tell why we selected that one to share. Once we had our say, others could say where they would go with that first line, and then we had to give the first line to one of the others to write the poem. I was first to give, but I ended up getting the last person's poem, and not for lack of trying either. So here's the first line of my poem:
What the hell am I supposed to do with that line? The person who created this line said that he was thinking about the two conflicting approaches (not sure if that's the right word or not) to poetry, one that poetry should be rather academic and not easy to understand by just anyone and the other that poetry should be written so that anyone can enjoy it and find meaning in it (Billy Collins is often cited as taking this approach to poetry). Even knowing what he was thinking, I still don't have a clue where this line will take me. At least I don't have to have the poem that comes from this line workshopped. I can choose to submit another poem for that next week, but I am expected to write this poem.
I should probably get to work on one of those poems now, but first, I need to do some work-ish type things. Later.
I am a reader, a school librarian, and a wannabe poet/writer. I read as much as I can and write about what I read. I also write about my life and politics.
“The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars... ” -- Jack Kerouac

This week’s topic is Top Ten Books I Wish Could Have Had Sequels. I’ve listed 5 books or series that I could keep reading and 5 that should have ended.
The last book was Deadly Vows and I waited a little over 7 years for this book. Joyce mentioned if it sold well, her publisher would commission one or two books, but leading up to publication date there was no promotion on her part or her publishers. I really wanted another book because it leaves so many characters in limbo. Did Maggie marry Fran’s brother? What of Bragg and his wife? Did they make up and how’s married life treating Calder? I haven’t had the heart to pick up another Joyce book since she so callously announced the end of the series.
To be truthful, I’m quite happy with how it ended, but we’re missing Frederick’s viewpoint on several key scenes. If Willig should decide to revisit, I’d be happy to read it! Plus I want to know about that final scene where (I can’t mention it because of spoilers) and what happened afterwards.
I know this book isn’t released yet and um I just want to know what happens after the whole story takes place! I’ll keep my mouth shut now since I’ll just spoil things.
Having just finished the last book in the series, The Dark Enquiry, I was sad because I wanted to know more about Julia and Brisbane. I could read their adventures and never get tired. There’s one thing I never want Raybourn to do is and that’s write a novella or a story via Brisbane’s POV. I like him mysterious and in the shadows and getting to know him via Julia.
Now I know a lot of people enjoy the books and there’s talk of Christian’s point of view. For the love of all things holy, no. No more Fifty.
Oh dear, one book was enough with Thoughtless and Kiera being too stupid to live. Okay she’s not, but she just annoyed me. Book 2, Effortless, should have been the end, but did we need a third with Reckless and the whole fan drama, etc? Nope. I can’t summon the energy to read this.
Ah, I loved Bared to You! Reflected in You had me on the fence, but shortly after Entwined With You was released it was announced there would be 2 or 3 more books. No! I think Day could have ended it with Entwined instead of extending it.
I really liked Gabriel’s Inferno and was quite happy with the way Gabriel’s Rapture ended with Julia and Gabriel married. So I was disappointed there was going to be a book 3 even though I think there’s no need for it.
A lot of people have been asking for Lucas’ story and Webber has sort of ignored the issue, but I really hope she doesn’t write. I don’t need his story and his closure. At this point I think all authors that write a POV in another main character’s point of view are out for the money because it’s the SAME story as the other POV. Utilize third person or write a book in dual POV in that case.
Yes to more Gone Girl! It would probably be too much to handle- psychologically speaking- but wow, what would a follow-up to it read like?!?
Maybe a novella? I just want to know what happens after they have the _____. Poor ____. Maybe a quick visit to see how things stand 5 or 10 years later?
I’m dying to read Gone Girl! Everyone has been praising for it, and I feel like I’m the only one who hasn’t read it yet. 😀 Great list!
I read it this past Feb and wow! It’s one of those books that isn’t for everyone. Some hate it and others love it. I love it because Amy speaks the truth about how we conform to some situations, etc.
Great list! I’ve heard great things about Gone Girl, but haven’t gotten around to it. I would be okay with NOT having sequels to 50 Shades either thought. 😀
Ah it’s going to be crazy when they announce the actors for the film. I don’t want anything else with Fifty. No film either. LOL
I agree with every point on your should not have been a sequel list – especially the Christian POV (shudders).
I admit I am curious about the third Gabriel book, only because I where they are going to go with it. It was nicely wrapped up. I only picked up this series because of you and I really liked it.
I think GR ended at a great place and I don’t need closure. If he had opted to revisit via a novella, I’d be okay with that. I just worry how cliché he’ll get with this story. I mean how much more damage could Christa do? I’ve skimmed the original fan fiction and in it Christa would be (whatever Twilight character she is) gets her due and they have a baby in the end.
Great list! I like the way you split it into yes and no. I would like a sequel to Easy but I don’t know that I really need Lucas’ POV of the first book. I could definitely see a sequel for Gone Girl, especially the way it ended.
I don’t think I’d mind if Webber revisited them at a later date. A novella might work, but a whole book dedicated to what Lucas thinks in his POV which is essentially Easy all over, I wouldn’t buy it. I like the mystery of getting to know him via another POV.
Well, I haven’t read any of these (in some cases, add the word “yet”), but I mostly agree with you on authors rewriting the same story from another character’s POV. Once in a while, that could be really effective, but it seems to be a growing trend, rather than something all those authors really felt moved to do.
I know readers want to know what x was thinking during a book and that’s a limitation of first person POV. I think authors could do better if they used third person or in some cases dual POV. I’m really hating this trend. I wouldn’t mind a novella via x’s POV as a sequel to see where things stand in the future, but what ends up a mirror copy of the original book? No.
I’m reading Night Film right now (65% finished), so I looked at your comment with one eye closed to make sure it didn’t spoil anything. 🙂
I’m loving it so far, and I’m glad to see you want more. That gives me hope the ending is not going to fall apart.
Ahhhhh, you’ll have to tell me your thoughts on the ending! I’m already dreading the film because I know it won’t hold up to the brilliance of the book.

BOSTON — Lightning coach Jon Cooper came to Boston with a plan to steal back the home-ice advantage that the Bruins took away with their Game 1 win in Tampa.
"We can't exhale," Cooper said on Thursday, a day after the Lightning beat Boston 4-1 to open a 2-1 lead in the Eastern Conference semifinals. "Just because we picked one up on them, we want to make it where we have three chances to knock them out. When you have that chance, you can't let it slide."
Since winning the opener, the Bruins have lost two in a row. On Wednesday night, Ondrej Palat scored twice in the first 3:19 of the game to give the Lightning a lead it never relinquished.
Vegas and San Jose each have a home shutout and a road overtime win through four games of their second-round series. Now it has become a best-of-three for a spot in the Western Conference Final starting with Game 5. The Sharks have turned things around completely from Game 1, when they were constantly a step behind the speedier Golden Knights in a 7-0 loss.
"That 7-0 game was not really us out there," forward Eric Fehr said. "We changed a lot of things. We came out flat in that game. I think we've done a good job of reeling it in and playing the way we can play. That was a game we just threw in the garbage and turned the page."
Now the Golden Knights will try to do the same after getting thoroughly outplayed in a 4-0 loss in Game 4.
"It's a good series, there's no easy night," goalie Marc-Andre Fleury said. "Nobody thought it was going to be an easy series either. We're in good shape, 2-2, going home."
Cassidy fiddled with his lines in practice on Thursday as he tried to find more offense for a team that seemed to have plenty of it in the first-round series against the Maple Leafs. With Brad Marchand and Jake DeBrusk sitting out of practice — Cassidy said he expects them to play on Friday night — Danton Heinen skated with Patrice Bergeron and David Pastrnak on the first line and Ryan Donato got time with David Krejci on the second.
After scoring 28 goals in seven games against Toronto and six in the Round 2 opener, Boston was held to a single goal each in back-to-back games.
"We'll probably tinker," Cassidy said. "I'm not going to tell you who's going in or who's going out, because we've got to get the healthy guys sorted out first."
Lightning forward Anthony Cirelli was the 23rd different rookie to score at least one goal in 56 NHL playoff games this year. That's already more than in all of last year's postseason. The NHL record is 38 in 1981, but over the past 30 years the most was 28, in 1990 and again in '92.
Boston's Jake DeBrusk has six this year, leading all rookies. Minnesota North Stars forward Dino Ciccarelli scored 14 goals in '81, the rookie record for a postseason. Penguins forward Jake Guentzel scored 13 last year and matched Ciccarelli's point total.

I am really proud of myself. I have consistently worked on the RGT’s project (a huge deal because I get bored easily) and have made some real progress. There is still so much more to do. I am cutting cork board for the stones and planning the interior (idea overload). I made some changes to the kit’s size. Yeah, so the original kit just didn’t have enough room for the ideas I have, so I made it bigger. And with it now bigger, this means more stones…more work. I also have to make some modifications for windows. Did I mention that I am making furniture too? Well, I am…Overall I am happy, excited, and having fun creating. All the variables needed to stay on task. Here are pictures of my progress:
I haven't made a firm decision on the layout yet. Hopefully soon because I need to get moving...and cutting with my new saw. I have a real love for power tools.

MONDAY, Oct. 24 (HealthDay News) -- For the millions of Americans on blood pressure-lowering drugs, a new study suggests that taking the pills at bedtime may be best.
It was known that taking blood pressure medications at different times of the day can affect patients' blood pressure patterns, but the impact on health wasn't known.
The new Spanish study included 661 patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Half of them took their prescribed blood pressure-lowering drugs at bedtime and half took their medications first thing in the morning.
After an average follow-up of 5.4 years, the researchers found that patients who took at least one blood pressure-lowering drug at bedtime had better control of their blood pressure and were about one-third as likely to suffer a heart-related event such as heart attack, heart failure or stroke.
The team at the University of Vigo also found that sleep-time blood pressure provided a much more accurate measure of heart health than wake-time blood pressure.
"Our results indicate that cardiovascular event rates in patients with hypertension can be reduced by more than 50 percent with a zero-cost strategy of administering blood pressure-lowering medications at bedtime rather than in the morning," study author Ramon Hermida wrote in a journal news release.
One U.S. doctor said taking advantage of "chronotherapy" -- timing drug delivery to a patient's biorhythms -- might have real value.
"Physicians don't commonly specify which time of day patients should take their medications; however, most patients with hypertension take their antihypertensive drugs in the morning. Upon taking these medications, patients oftentimes complain of side effects, most commonly, fatigue and drowsiness," noted Dr. Robert Graham, an internist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.
He believes the study reveals a "low-cost, win-win scenario" of better adherence to blood pressure medications and higher effectiveness when they're taken in the evening versus the morning. "As a result, chronotherapy may help minimize the side effects, and maximize the beneficial effects of antihypertensive medications," Graham said.
"The notion of nocturnal medication use is not new," said Dr. Howard S. Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Medical Center, New York City. "This strategy may be especially effective with the use of [blood pressure drugs such as] ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or direct renin inhibitors."
Weintraub added that, "while taking a diuretic at bedtime may have a disruptive effect on sleep, in general, I think many of us have been doing this for some time with the intent to best control nocturnal blood pressure and to also mitigate some of the usual spike in blood pressure that occurs early in the morning (starting around 5 am)."

Day One, Term 3 School Holidays - This has traditionally been my "stay in my PJ's to lunchtime day" However, last year and this year, a change in jobs has meant I am not on holiday at this time.
I came across this great TED talk by Eric Sheninger from TEDxBurnsvilleED. I was able to hear him speak at Edutech15 in Brisbane this year and I am currently reading his book "Digital Leadership - changing paradigms for Changing Times" One of his innovative practices is how he has used Twitter as a way to engage the community and to promote his school.
This video looks at how we can make changes to how schools operate to create better learni opportunities for our students.
we are all amazing people. More then what we can imagine. There is so much more to us then we know. We need to break down the the grouping and labeling of people. we are all one.

Mafkharat Nuru and her twin brother Koh-i-Nuru are the 2013 progeny of our AraboTeke mare Aburaya, who was exceptionally leased to the Netherlands to be bred to the exotic black tobiano Arabian-Marwari cross stallion Nuru (*1997) - a son of the Marwari stallion Alamguman ® and from the Egyptian Arabian mare Enayat Allah ®.
Nuru's story & background and mostly his exotic beauty have conquered us and led to this exceptional lease to a breeding with a foreign stallion not owned by MirrorManor.
The beautiful Nuru is owned by the Private Studfarm H. in the Netherlands, whom we want to thank for the mating :)
The result of this breeding was a big surprise, since our Aburaya gave birth to twins ! They are both solid colored and carry the beauty of all 3 breeds involved in the cross : Arabian, Akhal-Teke and Marwari... what a truly exotic oriental mix !
While the filly is a stunning seal bay with the typical reddish baby-coat areas, the colt inherited the creme gene from his palomino mother and is a stunning baby buckskin color. As adult the filly will become a striking dark coppery seal bay, while the colt will be that delicate buttermilk buckskin shade so typical of many Tekes and Marwari specimens...
Mafkharat Nuru is Arabic for Nuru's Pride and if you are a language fanatic like me, you will notice that the suffix "kharat" in the word "mafkharat" for "pride" is reminiscent of the word "carat", used to indicate the weight in gems and precious stones such as diamonds. This directly links to the name of the colt, which will be explained on his own page...
The filly is the OF Breyer Stablemate Scrambling Foal mold that was sculpted by Sarah Rose for Breyer.

Just recently, we bump into Master Tham in One Utama coincidentally. My family and I engaged Grand Master Tham for his Feng Shui services more than ten (10) years ago. Before we consult Master Tham, my son’s health is always weak and he was warded several times in the hospital for sickness. My wife has too much to worry about and she suffered bad health as well. My eldest daughter on the other hand, was confirmed by a western specialist doctor and a Chinese Medicine Practitioner that she had a severe sickness and there are always disputes between my children. We could hardly find peace and harmony in the house. We were so disappointed with fake Feng Shui masters until we decide to engage Master Tham due to recommendations by a very close friend. After studying his profile of genuine testimonials, we immediately engaged him as our Feng Shui Master. And in so many years, my wife and I had to say that engaging Master Tham is one of the best decisions we had ever made. After consulting him, business started to go smoothly and it became highly successful. My son who is about at six years old suddenly became strong and very healthy. My daughter’s serious illness was fully recovered. All my children’s studies improved tremendously. There were no more quarrelling among my children. They became more loving and understanding with each other and there is peace and laughter in the house. Since everything is going well in my business and there is peace in the family, my wife is able to have a peace of mind and she is enjoying good health as well. My eldest child is now a child specialist doctor while my second daughter is now studying Pharmacy. My youngest son managed to secure a scholarship in Singapore to pursue his studies and he managed to rank first among his peers there. More importantly, my children are filial and I had a very happy and successful family. We are so happy to make the right choice by engaging Master Tham for his blessings as well as to remedy the Killing Qi in our house! As advised by Master Tham we should constantly contribute to society.
We purposely go all the way down to Ipoh to visit and express our gratitude to Grand Master Tham by presenting him an appreciation board. In that visit, we purchase again some Buddhist Amulets and takruts for our children and ourselves as well as for our friends. A few months ago, Master Tham helped us to pray and bless our family. After his blessings and Feng Shui services, our family enjoy good health, happiness and peace. My children’s studies improved tremendously. My career also improved beyond our expectation. We wanted to grab this opportunity to thank Master Tham for his wonderful services. Being blessed by him and wearing his amulets, we realised that what distinguishes Master Tham from other masters is that he is an effective Feng Shui Master who gave us great happiness, confidence, success, wealth, peace and protection.
“Since knowing you for being able in performing fantastic feng shui and so accurately in the predictions of Life Astrology for several CEO’s and staffs and also wonderful feng shui done to so many, your predictions for my predetermined days of accident really did happen. However, with your powerful amulet and blessing my life was really safe without any injury without which I understand that I would definitely lose my life. I thank you from the bottom of my heart!”

Hey folks! Today I wanted to show you four more multichrome metallic flakie toppers that GlitterDaze has added to their Mythical collection! I've shown you five of the originals in a previous post, HERE. These are the same type of flakies, maybe a little smaller than the others? I might be imagining that though. I've show them all over black instead of by themselves this time because I think realistically that is how the majority of people will wear them.
On my index finger I have Ultraviolet Gypsy, a mix of bright purples, bright pinks, reds, oranges, and golds. On my middle finger is Celestial Genie, which shifts through shades of deep purple, midnight blue, and bright blue. My ringer finger has on Iridescent Pixie, a cooler version of Forbidden Fairy Dust, a mix of multicolored flakies and tons of chunky holographic shimmer. And last, on my pinky is A Siren's Lullaby, with flakies that range from aquas and teals to blues and purples, to pinks and greens. I used two coats of each over black crème Cult Nails Nevermore.
You can purchase these from shopglitterdaze.com for $12.50 each. What do you think of these mystical mythicals? I have to say, as someone who layers pretty infrequently, I'm a little bit over the multichrome metallic flakie trend, but I'm really happy to have the ones that I do and these are great. Ultraviolet Gypsy is my favorite of these four. Are you drooling over any of these?
The 47-year-old Hansratna, a thin figure, will soon achieve what few in the community have. He will be one of 12 people in Jain history to have fasted for 180 days. A fast that is observed by surviving only on boiled water that can be consumed between 9am and 6pm.

We are proud to announce the upcoming “signing” for Megan Ghrist, Wildcat softball senior first-baseman: Wednesday, November 14 @ 6 pm in the MVHS Athletic Foyer. All family and friends are invited to attend! Please enter at the Circle Drive Entrance, Door #2.
Megan has been playing softball since she was 6 years old, and she has played for several Mt. Vernon teams and several travel teams. These travel teams include the Rural Girls All-Stars (8U), South Gibson Swing, Indiana Matrix, Southern Indiana Eagles, and she now plays for the Indiana Shockwaves. While at Mt. Vernon, Megan owns the single-season RBI and home run records while also holding the all-time home run record with one season yet to play. Megan has been on the Big 8 All-Conference team twice, and was an All-State runner up this past season. Last year, Megan was on the All-Southwestern Indiana team as well.
When asked why she chose OCU, Megan replied: “I absolutely loved the small class sizes and the campus is beautiful. I like that it is Christian-oriented, and I think they have a great softball program and athletic department. Everyone I met while I was there was so kind and welcoming. I also like that it is only an hour away from home. I plan to study to become a physical therapist while I am there.”

At present 'The Ultimate Thailand Contact Database' is exclusively devoted to Companies and individuals with their administrative or manufacturing bases in Bangkok or in the nearby provinces. The reason for this is simple logistics. Traffic jams here in Bangkok can make it difficult to visit clients and add hours to a busy business day, visits to provincial contacts can add days!
More and more companies are choosing to re-locate and we feel it is time for a more specialized and regionally orientated company contact directory.
As well as working to update 'The Ultimate Thailand Contact Database' we are working on new projects which we feel you may be interested in.

Due to bad Feng Shui, we have suffered in the past years. I had consulted some Feng Shui masters before who claimed to be professionals. Despite their services, I was struggling hard to survive. Two of my business met with great failure. In other words, I lost all my businesses. The exclusive distributor rights in Malaysia of a foreign product owned by a multi million company which I had been holding in the past has been called for termination. It was one of the greatest set back for me. My children are also facing problems and my wife suffered because of my failures. I remembered that at one time the Feng Shui master who installed a Buddha for me at my house even quarreled with my mum! I find it hard to differentiate which Feng Shui master is genuine. I have been thinking of selling my house and to a new house far away from the city until one of my friend recommended Grand Master Tham of Worldwide Truth Feng Shui to me. My friend proved to me where his friends, relatives and business associates who suffered from various problems and failures became very successful and prospered after they have engaged Grand Master Tham. My friend and his wife also proved to me that Master Tham who is a full time professional Feng Shui Master has a lot of genuine testimonials with full transparency. He produces fantastic result by doing rather than talking. Without any delay, my family and I immediately engaged our Master Tham to remedy the Feng Shui of our house. I was worried due to my bad astrological charts and ill Feng Shui, but Master Tham advised me not to worry. Master Tham immediately wrote me a takrut and blessed me to enhance my luck and encouraged me to discuss with the foreign company again although it is confirmed that they are going to terminate the exclusive right. Surprisingly, I had not only obtained back the exclusive dealership rights in selling the foreign corporation’s products in Malaysia nationwide but also found some really good partners. My business with the partners progressed tremendously. I garnered full support from my partners and my staff who are extremely loyal to me. My children also achieved great leaps in their studies and our family is happy with peace in the atmosphere. My wife who used to suffer from poor health transformed into a strong and healthy person. Friends and relatives comment that she look prettier and with better skin textures. They also said that our facial expressions had turned more graceful and lively. We sincerely thank our friend and his wife for recommending Master Tham to us. We also wanted to express our most grateful thanks to our Master Stanley Tham for genuinely practices only the TRUTH in Feng Shui in not only helping some one like us but many other people as well. He is truly a fantastic Master. For those who have consulted him, you are very lucky indeed! Thank you so much Master Tham.

Mary Jane was our guest of honor at our Loving Lucy '98 Convention. The article that appears below is reprinted from our We Love Lucy club's newsletter that was published a few months later...
Mary Jane Croft, Lucille Ball’s longtime friend and co-star, was center of attention at the Opening Night ceremonies of Loving Lucy ‘98, the third annual Convention of Lucy Fans. Croft, the only performer to appear on a regular-basis on I Love Lucy, The Lucy Show and Here’s Lucy, received the convention’s first "Lifetime of Excellence" Award.
The ceremonies were held at the Leonard H. Goldenson Theatre at the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in North Hollywood. On hand to honor and applaud Mary Jane were such Desilu buddies as actors Robert Rockwell (who co-starred with Croft in Our Miss Brooks); Elliot Reid; Roz and Marilyn Borden; writers Bob Carroll and Madelyn Davis; producer Tommy Thompson; film editor Dann Cahn; director Maury Thompson; studio executives Bernie Weitzman and Ed Perlstein; I Love Lucy’s original stage manager, Herb Browar; and such friends as Wanda Clark (Lucy’s longtime personal secretary); actress Betsy Palmer; and 500+ Lucy and Mary Jane fans from around the globe.
Lucie Arnaz, unable to attend, sent a special recorded message, paying tribute to her friend and former co-star.
Croft’s long and illustrious career in radio and television was recalled in a special 45-minute retrospective that included audio, film and video-tape clips of various performances. We Love Lucy president, Tom Watson, presented Mary Jane with the "Lifetime of Excellence" Award -- and a special pink director’s chair with her name embroidered on the chair-back.
Croft (known as "MJ" by her friends) was born in Muncie, Indiana, on February 15, 1916, and started her career as a teenager on the stage of the Muncie Civic Theatre. She quickly joined the Guild Theatre company in nearby Cincinnati, which led to a full-time position on the staff of WLW, then one of the most prolific producers of radio programs in the mid-west. While at the station, she met and married a young actor named Jack Zoller, and in 1939 the couple relocated to Los Angeles.
Hollywood, in those days, was not only the movie capital of the world, but also the hub of network radio. With stations located up and down Sunset and Hollywood Boulevards, a cadre of young actors and actresses made up an informal "stock company" that appeared in radio show after radio show. Many -- like Mary Jane -- were considered "voice artists" (capable of doing different voices, different accents, etc.) and were called upon to do a wide variety of programs in a given week. The Zollers fit into this "stock company" beautifully -- where they soon became friends with such actors as Bea Benederet (who became MJ’s best girl-friend), Jeanette Nolan and John McIntire, Lurene Tuttle ("I was so envious of Lurene’s voice!" admits Mary Jane today), Howard Duff, Joe Kearns, and the husband-and-wife team of Cathy and Elliot Lewis.
During this period Croft appeared in such radio favorites as Jane Endicott, Girl Reporter; The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; Those We Love; Open House and Blondie. In 1944, she took time out from this active schedule to give birth to a son, Eric Ward Zoller, born August 4 of that year.
For the next few seasons, Mary Jane juggled the responsibilities of motherhood and career, returning to the microphone to appear in Twelve Players, The Mel Blanc Show, The Adventures of Sam Spade, The Beulah Show, Ozzie & Harriet, Joan Davis Time, and the radio incarnation of Our Miss Brooks, starring Eve Arden and Gale Gordon.
By the early 1950s, Mary Jane’s marriage to Jack Zoller had ended, and network radio’s future also was in doubt. MJ need not have worried. CBS wanted Our Miss Brooks to make the transition to television, and Croft continued with the show as Daisy Enright, Miss Brooks’ outspoken rival. (Daisy was something of a precursor to Betty White’s later Sue Ann Nivens character on The Mary Tyler Moore Show.) The television program was produced by a fledgling company called Desilu -- whose first project, I Love Lucy, had already become the nation’s most popular show.
"This was a whole new ball game," remembers Mary Jane today. "In radio we could do many programs in any given week. We did not memorize the scripts -- we read them in front of the microphone. For television, we had to really work! We now devoted a whole week to a single show. Miss Brooks was done like Lucy in front of a studio audience, so we really had to be sharp."
MJ stayed with the Eve Arden comedy for two seasons, then started to free-lance. She appeared in I Love Lucy for the first time in March, 1954, in "Lucy is Envious," in which she played Lucy’s old school chum, Cynthia Harcourt. The role was that of a high-society dame, a character Croft had perfected on many shows over the years.
In 1955, she joined the cast of Jackie Cooper’s new comedy The People’s Choice -- Cooper played a young city-councilman, and MJ was ... his basset hound, Cleo. That is, Mary Jane provided the voice of the dog -- who was often given the best lines in the show!
The following year, she started a ten year association with the TV version of The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet, playing the Nelson’s friend Clara Randolph. But Ozzie & Harriet was a one-camera film show, shot without an audience, and an actor could often complete his weekly role in one day, leaving him time to do other things. Mary Jane used her time doing guest appearances on other shows -- including a return visit to I Love Lucy as airline passenger Evelyn Bigsby in "Return Home from Europe." (That’s the show in which Lucy disguises a 25-pound cheese as a baby!)
Lucy enjoyed working with Mary Jane very much, and a few months later, when writers Bob Carroll and Madelyn Pugh suggested the Ricardos and Mertzes move to Connecticut, Mary Jane was added to the cast as new neighbor Betty Ramsey.
By the late 1950s, Mary Jane’s old radio buddies, Cathy and Elliot Lewis had divorced, and Mary Jane and Elliot found themselves to be kindred spirits. They knew the same people, went to the same parties, and laughed at the same jokes. They began dating and quickly realized they were very much in love. They were married in 1960, and until Elliot’s death 31 years later, were one of the happiest couples in show business.
In 1962, Lucy (by then herself divorced and remarried) agreed to do a new television series, The Lucy Show. Desi Arnaz, still Lucy’s business partner and the head of Desilu Studios, reassembled much of the old I Love Lucy company for the new project. Elliot was brought in as the new producer, and MJ joined the cast as Audrey Simmons, Lucy and Viv’s acerbic girl friend. When Viv left the show in 1965, a new format was adopted, with Lucy moving to the west coast. Mary Jane now appeared as "Mary Jane Lewis," Lucy’s somewhat daffy next-door neighbor.
In 1968, The Lucy Show became Here’s Lucy, with Lucy Carmichael becoming Lucy Carter, and Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. joining the cast as her offspring, Kim and Craig. Mary Jane, however, was still Mary Jane, a role she continued until the program ceased production in 1974.
Lucy, Viv, Mary Jane, Gale Gordon, writers Bob Carroll and Madelyn Davis were reunited one last time in 1977 for a one-hour special, "Lucy Phones the President," in which Mary Jane portrayed the wife of the local mayor.
"It's been over 40 years since my first Lucy show and 21 years since the last," says Mary Jane today, "and still we get viewer mail. It's gratifying to know that people are still enjoying the shows. We had no idea when we were doing them they would turn out to be ‘classics.’ We were just having fun every week."

Before we get to know Master Tham, we are in such a bad state where we are facing high financial difficulties. We has earlier engaged other Feng Shui masters but there isn’t any effectiveness or changes that we could notice. One day, while reading about Master Tham we realised that he had many genuine and successful testimonials in having helping a lot of people similar to our situation. We then invited Grand Master Tham to investigate and remedy our house’s Feng Shui. We would not forget Master Tham’s great kindness for what he had done for us. Before Master Tham left our house, he reminded us many times not to forget in ensuring my son carries his takruts all the time to protect himself because he is may be prone to serious accidents. One evening, my son met an accident. He came back home and show us the broken takruts. However, my son was safe and alive! Our business had also expanded tremendously. From only one lorry in the transportation company, we are now having 6 lorries with a good partner helping us to run the company. Therefore, instead of facing great financial difficulties, we are enjoying good business profits with financial and time freedom. I even strike a lottery just 2 weeks later after having Master Tham to remedy the Feng Shui of our house. After Master Tham remedied the Sha Qi in our house, our children does not only overcome serious mishaps, but enjoyed good health, wealth, relationship and studies too! My children who used to be in the bottom class soared to the top ranked class in school! We realised that we are now enjoying all these amazing changes with great joy and we are so lucky to have Master Tham to be our Feng Shui Master. While expressing our sincere thanks to Master Tham for his Feng Shui remedies and blessings, we also recommended our friends and relatives to engage Master Tham for his genuine and true Feng Shui consultations.
A very interesting topic that I have considered. I am very happy to read your post. Thanks for sharing! happy wheels

While organic field-effect transistors allow the investigation of interfacial charge transport at the semiconductor-dielectric interface, an electrochemical transistor truly modifies the oxidation level and conductivity throughout the bulk of an organic semiconductor. In this work, the thermoelectric properties of the bulk of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) -poly(styrene sulfonate) were controlled electrically by varying the gate voltage. In light of the growing interest in conducting polymers as thermoelectric generators, this method provides an easy tool to study the physics behind the thermoelectric properties and to optimize polymer thermoelectrics.
According to different sources, from forty to sixty percent of the overall energy generated in the world today is squandered in waste heat. The existing energy conversion technologies are either close to their efficiency limits or too costly to justify their implementation. Therefore, the development of new technological approaches for waste heat recovery is highly demanded. The field of thermoelectrics can potentially provide an inexpensive, clean and efficient solution to waste heat underutilization, given that a new type of thermoelectric materials capable of meeting those requirements are available.
This thesis reports on strategies to optimize a thermoelectric efficiency (ZT) of conducting polymers, more specifically poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (Pedot). Conducting polymers constitute a special class of semiconductors characterized by low thermal conductivity as well as electrical conductivity and thermopower that can be readily modified by doping in order to achieve the best combination of thermoelectric parameters. Conducting polymers that have never previously been regarded as hypothetically compatible for thermoelectric energy conversion, can exhibit promising thermoelectric performance at moderate temperatures, which is a sought-after quality for waste heat recovery. A rather substandard thermoelectric efficiency of Pedot-Pss can be markedly improved by various secondary dopants whose addition usually improves polymer’s morphology accompanied by a drastic increase in electrical conductivity and, consequently, in ZT. In order to enable further enhancement in thermoelectric properties, the optimization of the charge carrier concentration is commonly used. The oxidation level of Pedot-Pss can be precisely controlled by electrochemical doping resulting in a tenfold increase of ZT. In contrast to Pedot-Pss, another conducting polymer Pedot-Tos exhibits superior thermoelectric performance even without secondary doping owning to its partially crystalline nature that allows for an improved electronic conduction. With the aid of a strong electron donor, positively doped Pedot-Tos gets partially reduced reaching the optimum oxidation state at which its thermoelectric efficiency is just four times smaller than that of Be2Te3 and the highest among all stable conducting polymers. The downsides associated with chemical doping of Pedot-Tos such as doping inhomogeneity or chemical dopants air sensitivity can be surmounted if the doping level of Pedot-Tos is controlled by acidity/basicity of the polymer. This approach yields similar maximum thermoelectric efficiency but does not necessitate inert conditions for sample preparation. Optimized Pedot-Tos/Pedot-Pss can be functionalized as a p-type material in organic thermogenerators (OTEG) to power low energy electronic devices. If printed on large areas, OTEGs could be used as an alternative technique for capturing heat discarded by industrial processes, households, transportation sector or any natural heat sources for electricity production.

I just saw the other day that 35% of the people who use personal ads for dating are currently married. Man, that makes you wonder.
I would have given this choice serious thought if my husband did not come through for me last year. This all happened as his fault, but he fixed it all. He has not gone hunting before but a friend of his at work did, so he got all ready about deer season. He told me how if he got his two buck or doe maximum, we’d have more than enough meat to eat all winter. Well, after he went out and bought a gun, went to a practice for shooting, then they got tickets for the trip downstate, he was so confident in himself he went out and bought a large freezer used, from his sister.
He did not get anything. His friend told me he hit some trees and made a lot of birds fly.I flew too. Off the handle. He spent almost $700 on the whole thing and I did not even get a postcard to eat. So I told him we have four children to feed and no money. What are ya gonna do about that, big shot hunter??? He said no problem, that he’d already knew what to do. He’s going to Dallas Car Title Loans, which he found on the Internet. He got a $700 loan on that rusty truck and no one went hungry. He is paying it off gradually

With great respect and shown appreciation to Master Tham, once my first record was out for the market, the first person I think of is my Feng Shui master who was very understanding and helpful. He has also specially made a takrut for me and blessed me as well. Before my first album was released in the market, I am presenting my special copy to him to show my deepest sincere appreciation and thanks. Thank you Master Tham for your help in various ways in realizing my dreams!
News: In June 1557 Edmund Allin, his wife and five others were burnt at the stake, where Drakes pub now stands in Fairmeadow, Maidstone, for refusing to accept Catholicism.
Sad to report that Ditton Laboratory has now been completely demolished! Just a pile of rubble now. The site is due to be re-developed for ............ yes you guessed - housing!! Good luck with the de-contamination of the site first is all I can say!!
Sad to see it like that, I used to service the staff bar there in the 1970s, had to get the keyholdr from the Pomology labs, he was a Pomologoist- always thought he should have a hat with corks on the brim.
Thanks Paul. Think that redevelopment's unlikely in the short term. Due to the chemical pollution there's a serious and expensive site decontamination operation to be considered even if the building was demolished.
Some of the land behind the main building is now in commercial use as a fish farm and a fruit distribution depot. It's always fun to meet a 40ft articulated lorry being driven by some mad Spaniard along the narrow lane on my way to work!!
I've been driving past this place twice a day for the last ten years and at last yesterday stopped a took a few pics.
Constructed in 1929 on a site adjacent to the East Malling Horticultural Research Station; this laboratory was created to work on problems encountered in the transportation of fruit from the southern hemisphere and other aspects of post-harvest research. By 1933 scientists from all over the world began to study there returning home to adapt the ideas and techniques developed there particularly with temperature controlled storage and distribution.
No sure exactly when it closed but I first noticed it being boarded up about 5 or 6 years ago. Apparantly the building is a bit of a bio hazard due to chemical residues built up over the years polluting the fabric of the building!

"In cartography, symbols are everything. The very nature of a map as an abstract representation of the Earth requires symbols to perform the abstraction. To not have symbols is to not have maps."
The Digital Wisdom cartographic symbol library provide graphic artists and mapmakers with a complete, well-designed contemporary set of map symbols packaged into an Illustrator vector library covering most of the features that need symbolizing on a map. Each library contains point, line and area symbols (including colors and patterns) which are fully editable and scalable.
The symbols EPS vector collection is highly adaptable and editable. Load the collection into Illustrator, select individual symbol or a group of symbols and edit those objects using the full array of Illustrator tools and effects to derive your own symbol variations.
The design of each and every symbol has been very carefully thought through to allow intuitive recognition of the main features of a map and use a minimal footprint to cut down on map clutter. These beautifully designed point, line and area symbols and color sets for both llustrator and Vector / EPS aplications, are compatible with their earlier versions wherever possible, but also recognizing that a higher level of cartographic presentation, quality and efficiency possible with Illustrator 10 should be a key feature. This allows the definition of points and symbols to a higher level, depicting the purpose and function of a wide range of activities, specifically geared towards tourism, travel, orientation, navigation and entertainment.
In the Illustrator series, there is a real difference between versions 5-8 and 9. Also, there is a smaller (but significant) divide between 9 and 10 (the latter introduces the "Symbols palette" which is a natural format for a library of cartographic symbols).
Map Symbols was designed by Steven Gordon who is President of Cartagram, a custom cartography company specializing in tourism, terrain, city and world maps for use in all media. In addition to designing maps, Gordon creates logos and custom type. He is also coauthor of the Illustrator Wow! Book series published by Adobe Press.

“When Feng Shui Master Tham predicted that I would meet a serious accident on a certain date, he make a takrut for me. On that fateful day, I was avoiding going anywhere. However, just I would like to go out for a nearby breakfast yet I really have to met a bad accident. However, the Takrut which make by Master Tham save my life and avoid serious injury. Now my wife and I only believed in Master Tham”.
“Feng Shui Master Tham is not only an expert in Feng Shui which he helped me and my family enjoying blissful life. He also helped me to be recognized as being the top dealers in Malaysia , especially his truth expertise have helped me to build a large factory for the further development of my business. I have full trust In Master Tham’s feng shui and talismans. He is the Truth Master.”
“My family and I have never been enjoying any success from our orchard before until we met Feng Shui Master Tham. My orchard used to suffer from yearly losses and borrowings. We even faced with various disappointments. However, since we consulted him for his feng shui advice, he had been giving reliable and fantastic feng shui advices together with his takrut and expertise in fixing a proper direction for my Pra Prom God, the life of our whole family have transformed into a prosperous and happy family. With his invaluable guidance, our orchard has been very profitable and never run out of cash. We could afford to buy a new and larger vehicle and another new house. With good feng shui, my children are very helpful in the family and my eldest daughter is reading law in a university. My family thanks Master Tham heartily for his true efficiency and shall never forget the moment when he came into our lives to help.”
“With Feng Shui Master Tham’s expertise in doing good Feng shui, my parents and all of us are in good health, family more and more peaceful and blissful. With business opportunities which earlier before I know the master is just none and children scored good results. My neighbors all been burglarized, robbed and motor-cycles parked outside been stolen. My whole family thanks the Truth Master Tham’s takrut, which I hang it outside. Today I am the only one is yet so far without facing such bad incident. Thank-you always to our Master Tham.
“My life is always filled with jealousy from my friends. They would always backstab me. I am suffering from bad luck, I’ve meet with an accident and I have even lost my low paying job. I also have been wearing numerous Thai amulets but yet seem so many problems arose. However, after meeting with Feng Shui Master Tham and believing in his advises by wearing his genuine amulets and takrut, my life suddenly changed for the better. I have found a good job which the pay was double of the amount of my previous job. There are no longer backstabbers and everything is going smoothly and peacefully for me. Thank you very much, Master Tham!”

Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics. It works when other activities fail. This is our twelfth suggestion: Carry this message to other alcoholics!
You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any passion for crusade or reform. Never talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit of spiritual tools for his inspection. Show him how they worked with you. Tell him that if he wants to get well you will do anything to help.

These days the average young adult spends more time engaged with social media than any other social or economic activity, including work, sleep, and interaction with family.
It is estimated that individuals aged 18 to 36 years spend as much as 18 hours per day on social media, several hours of which are typically spent taking, editing and uploading videos and photos of themselves on Instagram and Snapchat.
Unfortunately, for many, social media ‘likes’ and followings are key measures of success, relevance and self-worth, despite the lack of tangible or bankable return on such incredible investment of time.
If the trend of excessive social media usage continues, it begs the question, what impact will this have on productivity at the micro and macro levels? This is particularly worrisome for Jamaica which is already lagging behind its major trading partners and contemporaries in productive output, yet also relies almost exclusively on untapped human capital to deliver sustained and substantial economic growth.
Simply put, Jamaica cannot afford a generation of youth investing most of their productive capacity in idle social media use.
However, there are several ways to turn online passions into profits, according to Digital Strategist and founder of technology company SiliconCaribe Media, Ingrid Riley, but doing so requires a dramatic change in how social medial platforms are viewed and used.
One of the most practical ways for people to earn from a large social media following is to position and brand themselves as digital influencers within a particular niche.
Product Placement — where companies, products, events or brands pay the influencer to wear, use, consumer or otherwise endorse and promote their product or service or event.
Paid Appearances — where influencers are invited to attend or cover events or experience facilities, etc and in some cases offer unique commentary or storylines based on personal experience.
Build Your Own Business — leveraging your online communities to grow an email database and build relationships that can be used to sell their own products, services and events.
Learning from others who have successfully leveraged their social media following in some of the ways listed above is critical to ascending the learning curve to monetisation of varied platforms, insisted Riley.
Instagram sensations @Chelan876, @QuitePerry, @DuttyBerry @oblessa, @mrkingstonbelle, @MajaHype, and @princemarni are some accounts she believes are worthy of review, as well as international blogger and consultant neilpatel (quicksprout).
One thing all the examples mentioned have in common is they are diligent producers of content. To the casual onlooker they may seem to be having fun doing what they love, be it comedy, fashion or business, but these individuals put incredible effort into building their brands and creating distinct, valuable and competitive content for their audience.
Interestingly, even the most diligent individual influencer may struggle financially because of underdeveloped or flawed business models and digital strategy. These are problems which Riley believes can easily be solved with professional advice and coaching. However relatively few people avail themselves of these resources.
As with most endeavours, earning money from social media follows and likes is neither easy nor suited for everyone, and failure after investing considerable time and energy in developing content is highly probable.
Overnight successes are rare, despite commonly held views to the contrary. Some of the major mistakes to avoid according to the digital strategist are not treating the activity as a business, not doing adequate research, lack of consistency and patience, an inability to value one’s worth and poor negotiations skills.
In terms of the skills and characteristics needed to successful cash in on social media, at the top of Ingrid’s list is strong digital media and communication skills — specifically, the ability to write well, communicate clearly, generate captivating ideas, connect with the audience, photography, phoneography and videography.
Technical knowledge of how social platforms and social mobile apps work is also important. Finally, to earn from social media will require a strong spirit of innovation, experimentation and a willingness to quickly learn from likely failures.
The dynamic nature of social media also makes each platform unique, fickle and unpredictable, thereby requiring specialised and targeted content, constant listening and engagement, evaluation of feedback and results, and eagerness to change to better connect with the target audience.

Candice Clarke-Andell describes the Creola dance style which she has developed as "an exhilarating blend of techniques and styles".
In an interview with the Newsday publication in Trinidad and Tobago, published in April, Clarke-Andell described it as "a fusion of the Graham and Horton Techniques and styles such as ballet, modern, jazz, hip hop, tap, African and East Indian folk dance which is all currently being taught at the school".
Later this month Creola comes to Jamaica, as a 35-person strong contingent from the Candice Clarke Academy of Dance visits from August 17 to 25. They will present 'This is Me ... And I Quote' at the Little Theatre, but Clarke-Andell points out that there will be other performances, one at the Bustamante Hospital for Children and another for residents of three children's homes.
There is also a link between Jamaica and the dancers, as one is a Jamaican, and Clarke-Andell refers to Jamaica and Trinidad's shared colonial history and Jamaica's love for the performing arts.
The academy goes by the slogan 'Dance With a Cause' and Clarke-Andell describes the upcoming trip as "giving back in the sense that we believe that dance is from Almighty God. I think I use it to give back to country, to make a contribution to the youth using dance to bring hope, to inspire, to bring awareness of social issues".
Appropriately then, part proceeds from the Little Theatre feature presentation go towards HIV/AIDS initiatives in the Caribbean, and the piece 'Red Ribbon' is directly related to HIV/AIDS.
Clarke-Andell points out that last year the academy contributed to the Haiti cause and the year before that a contribution was made to the fight against domestic violence.
There are seven dances in the first segment of 'This is Me ... And I Quote' and nine in the second, with dances based on quotations.
"I often live by a lot of philosophy. I am impressed by a lot of quotations by great men ad women who I think have brought positive change to the world," Clarke-Andell said.
A quote from Marcus Garvey is used for the dance 'Who Am I' and another piece is built around the Jamaican motto, 'Out of Many One People'.
Clarke-Andell said for the Bustamante Hospital for Children performance, the dancers are being encouraged to carry gifts for the children, in keeping with the academy's thrust to foster caring. The dancers are also being encouraged to keep in touch with children they meet at the hospital after they have left Jamaica.
"You don't want a society where nobody cares and everybody is fighting each other," Clarke-Andell said.
The purpose of our lives is to glorify God. We need to turn our eyes away from the world and our circumstances and turn them to the LORD. He is great and worthy of praise!
On our custom home on Post Road, we have finished foundation work including the basement slab. We will finish back filling the walls and begin framing next week!
We are setting forms for our poured foundation walls on a new home in Belle Park. On most all of our homes, we pour solid walls as opposed to block walls. These walls are superior to block walls and increase the quality of our conditioned crawl spaces.

Dick Vermeil became head coach of the St. Louis Rams in 1997 after a fifteen year absence from all of coaching. He was infamous for 3 to 4 hour practices in full pads every day of the week.
He worked his players so hard that before one game in 1998 against the Bears, the entire team had a meeting about whether they should even play! They had 9 wins in 2 years. So Coach Vermeil decided to change. He had the courage to change even though he had always done it the same every year. Obviously it wasn’t working.
His new practice plan was to cut down the practices to 1.5 hours no matter the situation and made sure his players were fresh heading into Sunday.
How many times have we fallen into a rut and have done the same thing over and over again, only to find ourselves struggling with the same things. Why not make a change?
“See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.”
Starting this Sunday, I will begin a new series called, “On Point: Living in Missional Rhythm.” We will be looking at all aspects of our life and seeing if we are in rhythm with what God is doing. It will be a series you will want to be a part of as you evaluate your life compared to where you have been and where God is leading you.
We have experienced a wonderful Christmas Advent and New Year. Many new faces, new friends, and new opportunities before us as a church. Let us embrace the moment and live life full of divine moments.
On this day in 2000, the Mendota Lighthouse was the photo of the day. The stories we could tell... My son Jonathan and I helped out during those days, in keeping the weather monitoring equipment connected. One dark winter night the equipment was down, and Jonathan ventured by himself across the channel - pushing a rowboat across the ice, just in case the surface broke through.
There are so many places around the Keweenaw where we have had similar adventures, and I hope to be sharing some of them during this 21st year of our "daily glimpse of life in the U.P.". Thanks to my new bride Debbie Hopper for snapping this picture as we toured the peninsula over the weekend.
Nice pic and video! Charlie, Jonathan's got sisu!! No way I would have done that, especially at night!!

An eyeglass assembly includes a primary frame having two side rim locks. Each of the rim locks includes an upper member and a lower member having an opening. Each of two magnets has an upper portion secured within a corresponding upper member and each magnet has a lower portion receivable, with clearance, in the opening of the lower member for allowing the lower portion to be disengaged from the lower member. An auxiliary frame includes two side extensions for overlying the rim locks, each extension having a magnet therein for securing the auxiliary frame to the primary frame.,
1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a pair of eyeglasses, and more particularly to a pair of eyeglasses having an auxiliary frame for supporting auxiliary lenses.
2. Description of the Prior Art The closest prior art of which applicant is aware is US Patent 5,568,207 to Chao and has been assigned to the present assignee. The extensions of the primary frame are not provided in the rim lock portions.
The present invention has arisen to provide a primary frame having the magnets provided in the rim lock portions.
The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an eyeglass assembly in which the extensions of the primary frame may be provided in the rim lock portions and may be engaged with magnets for allowing the lenses to be easily inserted into the primary frame.
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided an eyeglass assembly comprising a primary frame including two sides each having a rim lock, each of the rim locks including an upper member and a lower member, each of the lower members including an opening, two first magnets, each including an upper portion secured within the upper member and each including a lower portion receivable with clearance in the opening of the lower member for allowing the lower portion to be disengaged from the lower member, an auxiliary frame for disposing in front of the primary frame, the auxiliary frame including two sides, each having an extension extended rearward for overlying a corresponding rim lock, and two second magnets secured in the extensions for engaging with the first magnets and for securing the auxiliary frame to the primary frame.
Further objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a careful reading of a detailed description provided hereinbelow, with appropriate reference to accompanying drawings.
FIG. 1 is an exploded view of an eyeglass assembly having an auxiliary frame in accordance with the present invention;
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the eyeglass assembly; and FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along lines 3-3 of FIG. 2.
Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, an eyeglass assembly in accordance with the present invention comprises a primary frame 10 for supporting primary lenses 90, which frame includes two rim locks 11 formed in the side portions. Two magnets 19 are secured within the rim locks 11 respectively. An auxiliary frame 20 for supporting auxiliary lenses 91 and for disposing in front of the primary frame includes two extensions 21 disposed at the side portions and extended rearward for overlying the respective rim locks 11 of the primary frame 10. Each of the extensions 21 mounts a magnet 22 for engaging with the magnet 19 of the adjacent rim lock 11 and for securing the auxiliary frame 20 to the primary frame 10.
Referring again to FIG. l, each of the rim locks 11 includes an upper member 12 and a lower member 14 for allowing the primary frame to be opened and for allowing lenses to be easily inserted into the primary frame. The upper and lower members 12, 14 include holes 15 engageable by fasteners 16 for securing the upper and lower members 12, 14 together, and include an orifice 17 for engagement by another fastener 18 which may be used for securing the legs 92 to the primary frame 10.
Referring next to FIG. 3, the magnet 19 includes an upper portion secured within the upper member 12 and a lower portion receivable with clearance in an opening 141 formed in the lower member 14. The opening 141 is of a diameter greater than that of the lower portion of the magnet 19 such that the lower portion of the magnet 19 may be disengaged from the lower member 14 when the upper member 12 is disengaged from the lower member 14 for inserting lenses into the primary frame 10. The magnets 19 thus will not affect the engagement of the lenses into the primary frame.
Alternatively, each of the upper and lower members 12, 14 includes an inner thread formed therein, and the magnets 19 are bolts for engaging with the inner threads of the upper and lower members 12, 14 and for securing the members 12, 14 together without the fasteners 16.
Accordingly, in one embodiment the eyeglass assembly in accordance with the present invention includes a primary frame having a pair of magnets secured in the rim locks and having a configuration for preventing the magnets from affecting the assembling of the lenses.
Although this invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the detailed construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.
a primary frame including two sides each having a rim lock, each of said rim locks including an upper member and a lower member, each of said lower members including an opening;
two first magnets, each including an upper portion mounted withing said upper member and each including a lower portion receivable, with clearance, in said opening of said lower member for allowing said lower portion to be disengaged from said lower member;
an auxiliary frame for disposing in front of said primary frame, said auxiliary frame including two sides each having an extension extended rearward for overlying a corresponding rim lock; and two second magnets mounted in said extensions for engaging with said first magnets and for securing said auxiliary frame to said primary frame.
2. An eyeglass assembly according to claim 1, including holes in said upper and lower rim lock members and threaded fasteners engageable in said holes to hold the upper and lower rim lock members together.
a primary frame including two sides each having a rim lock, each of said rim locks including an upper member and a lower member, each of said upper and lower members including a threaded hole extending therethrough;
two first threaded magnetic fasteners, each extending through the holes of corresponding upper and lower rim lock members to hold said members together;
an auxiliary frame for disposing in front of said primary frame, said auxiliary frame including two sides each having an extension extended rearward for overlying a corresponding rim lock; and two second magnets mounted in said extensions for engaging with said first magnetic fasteners and for securing said auxiliary frame to said primary frame.

“Before I knew Feng Shui Master Tham, I went to few unethical masters as published in the advertisements which dragged me into more problems. Master Tham’s specially made takrut and blessings for me really do wonders. My relationship with my family members, office staff and friends had enhanced tremendously like miracles which I had not expected. My luck had improved tremendously. I have also overcome my financial problems. I am also very proud to have a master like you who is very ethical. I have informed you that with your blessing I have obtained the fund to overcome my financial burden. With your good ethics, you did not ask me to fork out extra any money, not even a single cent even though I have asked you many times what others steps should I required further to improve my life. It is not easy to get to know a truth master that can I count on like you, Master Tham. Thank you so much!!!!”

My friend Caren has a letterpress studio she kindly braved winter temperatures for, just so I could make use of the large guillotine to cut up large sheets of the screen prints I did last semester at Megalo and finally turn into concertina books (thank you Megalo and ACT gov arts!).
I've been wanting to see this studio for such a long time. Caren teaches book arts and letterpress at the ANU school of arts and is currently undertaking a Phd in Material Poetics and the Creative Book. I got that bit of info off her website Ampersand Duck but suffice it to say Caren and her type (pun intended - and I include myself here) have spent their lives judging books by their covers. The art of books. Book as art. Book arts. Artists' books. If this concept raises your heart beat even just a little check out this small selection gallery of Caren's work and swoon.
Out of everything in Caren's studio it was this 19th century press that beguiled me most. How could it not? Even the 'feet' were lion's paws. It's a work of art itself.
While 1960s comic book heroines featured on bags, coats, cardigans, shirts and dresses for Prada's Spring 2018 collection there's a kind of 1980s subtext here too. With the PRADA font, the colour palette - lots of bright red and electric blue — plus those silhouettes. It's hard then not to think of a 1980s night club when I see this collection — the underground print press with screen printed posters and thus a little bit of punk too. All very pre-Madonna. Yay Prada!
Hooray! It appears girls with sticky outy ears can now come out of hiding. If the above photos in this months British Vogue are anything to go by the long wait is over. No need to be shy anymore. Such Good News (not personally you understand...I'm just pleased for those poor unfortunate girls who now can take their hats and headbands off...it's nothing to me...).
Just as I decide to commit to a more minimalist way of living I discover Robyn Lea's gorgeous book Bohemian Living and I just don't stand a chance. The showcasing of 20 artists and their homes —Australian and International — plus their art and there I am, back again, craving colour, clutter and limitless creativity.
My mother was Catholic, my father was not. They had a deal that any boys they had would be raised Methodist by him, and any girls they had would be raised Catholic by her. God might love Catholics more because they ended up with three girls, and Dad never had to become Methodist (he was raised Jehovah's Witness, which is a whole 'nother post).
So I spent 12 years in a plaid skirt. And yet, I know quite a few non-Catholics who know more about the religion than I do. Perhaps it's because I stopped listening around second grade. So I present these to you, not as weird things Catholics believe, but as the weird ideas I got in my own head about what they believe.
On Vocation Day, we had to watch videos of nuns and priests talking about their vocation. It was sort of like career day with one career. What it really was, was a recruitment seminar. They wanted to be sure that we heard The Calling to become a priest or nun if that's what God wanted. But they did a lousy job of making it look like a fun life, so I was scared to death of "The Calling." The nuns would explain:
You know how sometimes you think you hear someone saying your name and you look around and don't see anybody you know? As a child, every time that happened to me I was terrified that I was getting The Calling. I thought these people really heard a voice calling their names. I didn't realize that The Calling was actually a conscious decision, and one that most nuns/priests were happy to make. The ones at my school certainly didn't look happy, and I already hated going to mass.
Surely you've heard of Limbo. Besides being a dance performed by drunk people on cruise ships, it's where babies go if they die before they're baptized. See, we can't have people who aren't baptized getting into heaven - that will make people think they don't need to get baptized and will go against our claim that we're all born with original sin. But on the other hand, we can't say that we think little innocent babies go to hell, either, because that'll offend all the baby lovers out there. So the Catholics made up Limbo.
As a child, when I thought of people stuck waiting, I pictured an big airport waiting lounge. I'd flown enough as a small kid to know that that's where everyone waits. Sometimes you wait a long, long time, especially if you're a military family waiting at an Air Force base to travel space available on a cargo plane to Hawaii because your dad doesn't want to pay for real airplane tickets (again, another post). Thus - many babies stuck at gate 7C.
The idea of babies being stuck somewhere was distressing enough that they shut Limbo down a few years back, and said babies were virtually baptized or something. But it was ingrained enough in me that I felt we had to get A. baptized. Just in case Limbo reopened.
Many Catholics take their First Communion around second grade. I guess they think that's the age most kids can start to understand the idea of the Body of Christ and all the mystery surrounding the sacrament. They're wrong. Kids are still very literal at that age, so if I'm seven and you tell me that Jesus lives in that little house at the back of the altar, I'm going to think that Jesus lives in that little house at the back of the altar.
But I'm not a complete idiot, and even at seven years old, I'll know that the host doesn't actually turn into Jesus' flesh, even if you tell me it's not a symbol, it really does change. That's why you want us to bow our heads when the bells ring during mass,* signifying the transubstantiation - so we won't see that, actually, NOTHING HAPPENS.** Well, you guys might not know this, but I kept my head up once. And nothing happened. Also, I reasoned, if the host really did turn into Jesus' flesh, we would have run out by now. Especially if he's only 10 inches tall. And why do we have to be cannibals, anyway?
Whenever I brought these issues up in First Communion class, the nuns would start talking about faith. Again, I wasn't an idiot so I understood that they were really saying, "If you ask those kinds of questions, you're a bad Catholic and maybe you're not ready for the First Communion." Well, my mother was counting on me wearing that very short poufy dress that both my sisters wore to their First Communions, so I learned to keep my mouth shut.
*When A. first heard these bells at his great-grandmother's funeral, he turned to me and said, "Telephone!" Ack! Maybe it was THE CALLING.
** I need to watch out. Apparently sometimes when you doubt the whole transubstantiation thing, God plays a trick on you and actually turns the host into a slice of heart and the wine into coagulated blood clots. Yuck.
The random ramblings of a mother on too much caffeine.I have A., a redheaded 8-year-old, Ben, an obstinate but very cute 6-year-old, and G., their dad and a cute guy in his own right.
For his whole first year, Ben was really stiff. He had to be folded into his car seat, and never put his head on our shoulders. After he loosened up, though, he discovered snuggling and is now a master snuggler, especially right after his nap. I keep telling G. that I want him to take photos of Ben snuggling with me, but he's never really around when it happens, so today I asked A. to get the camera and he actually took these photos of us. Pretty good, huh?

Just wrapped up wonderful Christmas party comedy show in Lethbridge Alberta. It was for all the McDonalds in the area including those in Coaldale, Taber, and Pincher Creek. It was the 2nd Christmas Party they booked me for this season, the first was for all the management and this one was for the restaurant workers and the management. Its a great compliment to be asked back to perform again, and I always appreciate it.
The audience was an even split of 14-18 year olds, the other half was 35 and over. They had estimated that 150-200 people were coming out, but 250 showed up. I’d like to think it was because the word of my comedy got out, but I’m guessing the free dinner helped 😉
The age range made for a really interesting and fun point to play off of. As usual I showed up early to get the inside scoop, and since I had played an event for them only 3 weeks prior, I still had some inside jokes to make the event fun and personal.
Lethbridge, Alberta (or LA as they call it) is a beautiful city but the weather wasn’t really co-operating. A snow storm blew in over night and made the roads an icy mess. When you play around 50-100 corporate shows a year, you learn fast to prepare and always leave plenty of drive time for inclement weather.
It seems people in cold climates that require lots of inside time, really enjoy comedy! I love to bring it for them.
If you are in need of a clean corporate comedian that can play an all ages show, please get in touch. I do shows across Canada and the USA. Chances are I will be doing a show near you in the future, from BC to Newfoundland and from California to New York, I have jokes and will travel.

I wondered if you could help, I am trying to track down a supplier of the 24 and 32 pounder fibreglass cannons as seen on HMS Victory. I'm not so interested in the carriage, just the barrel, can any help at all?
Might give you some leads. Trincomalee has 18pdr replicas. Nauticalia in Portsmouth Harbour had a couple of Hornblower cannon for sale a while back but they were probably 9 or 12 pdrs.
There is also a biggie at the Gunwharf Keys shopping centre in Pompey which is 'fired' (electric pyro) at regular times. Not sure if 24 or 32pdr but someone is obviously making them.
He makes rether lovely blank firing jobs with a liner and a nice compound which is harder than fibreglass which means the guns have a nice ring to them as well as looking spot on. He will also do non-firing replicas. The carriages on Victory appear on his website...
If you are after hire then I believe all the main armaments from Master and Commander are with Simon Athertons company, Zorg.

One of the basic "type"landscapes of which many many copies and variants exist. This original has some damage, but it also has some claim to being the prime (or the earliest) of the group.
The two paintings that Ertz calls possibly autograph variants, 1979 #s 161 and 162, are really extremely different.
One in Prado which Ertz originally suggested was Jan the Younger but seems not to have included in monograph on that painter.
OK variant sold New York (Sotheby's 17.i.92 #32), panel, 36.2 x 48.9. Ertz not only accepted this but suggested that the figures were by the young Rubens. I would not accept as Jan, midground shows clear boredom, it could be a studio work.
Feeble copy attributed to Jan the Younger (Ertz JBII #28) in Warsaw, Muzeum Narodowe, inv. #129170 (panel, 32 x 45.5). This does not look good enough to be a Jan the Younger, figures are awful.
Hysterically funny bad copy from maybe 18th century or even later sold Paris, Galliera, 7.xii.76 #31, panel, 36.5 x 47.5. This injects a bunch of motifs from Rubens and maybe Pieter Bruegel, it's really jolly.
Drawing closely related to the present painting: Landscape with Windmills (19.7 x 30.9), New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Inv. #42 186. Ertz is not sure whether the drawing is a study for or a copy after the painting; it is certainly not “followed” in any other version. In general, in fact, the group of pictures is an excellent example of how drawings or sketches of motifs–the windmill, a house, individual figures and groups of figures, horses, and carts–were shuffled and combined, reversed and reduced and expanded, to produce new variants at different scales and on different supports.
Not one of the Prado's better Jan Brueghels. It has sometimes been attributed to Jan the Younger. Note that the image currently on this website is trimmed on both left and right.
The figures seem staged. Specifically, there are characters that he repeats in his works such as the resting couple.
Today's tip is about keeping your professional biography up to date. If you haven't done it recently, take some time this week to add any new publications, exhibitions, and other relevant news to it. Add a reminder to your calendar on December 1 to update it again. It's an excellent idea to update a biography every 3 months (if you're really active, it could be more often). This way you aren't scrambling if you need a biography for something plus updating it on a regular basis keeps the news fresher in your mind so you aren't struggling to recall details from 2 years ago, and it will take moments to do rather than a potentially much longer time (ask me how I know!)

Jan Phethean has worked internationally in Europe, The Mediterranean and the USA as a painter and award winning architectural designer for over 35 years.
In the nineties she created the Clubhouse concept for Virgin Atlantic and designed International Airport Upper Class Lounges in the UK and the USA. A feature of her interiors were large scale murals which Phethean also designed and painted.
Jan, who has Cornish roots, moved to Cornwall in 2002 to paint full time and lives in a remote cliff top hamlet on the south east coast of Cornwall. She exhibits regularly in art galleries in the UK.
‘I am endlessly fascinated by those things unseen in our landscape which are nevertheless ‘felt’ and by the duality of the historical geology of a landscape, for example a high moor having once been beneath a sea .The secret life of the wild animals that live amongst us and the way that man has shaped the land through his tracks, farming and industry also play their part in my work.

Gorgeous highlighter alert! Why oh why did it take me so long to buy Benefits Watt’s Up highlighter I do not know, it has always been a product I have lusted for but was a little scared of it being a cream stick highlighter. I usually prefer to use powder type highlighters but after finding the Topshop glow pot I have become a little more adventurous so whilst out shopping for some other Benefit bits the other day I thought I’d pick this little beauty up and I’m so glad I did, it is a cream-to-powder finish so not too scary after all.
First of all the stick applicator is actually really easy to use, you can simply swipe it straight on to the cheek bone or desired area and blend with fingers or soften the edges using the little blending sponge attached to the stick. I have tried a few ways of applying and blending now for different finishes and looks and I love to use a mini stippling brush for a light highlight or add it direct for a full on glow. Another technique I have stumbled across is to blend with your foundation brush after application if you feel you’ve applied too much or just want a subtler look, it blends a dream and looks very pretty.
The colour of this is simply stunning it’s a gorgeous champagne gold that is definitely my favourite kind of shade to use when highlighting, it translates onto the skin beautifully and looks stunning with a tan. Whether your a full face make-up girl or prefer a quick and simple look this will be perfect for you. I plan to wear this highlighter a lot and hopefully this summer when/if I get a natural tan I shall be rocking this with no foundation, it’s the instant pick me up you need and really gives your face a youthful healthy glow.
It’s a big day for Apple today, with the 2018 iPhone lineup as well as a new Apple Watch all set to be announced in a few hours at an event to be held at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park. However, as the hours continue to tick down it’s looking increasingly likely that there will be nothing to actually announce after another slip up by Apple allowed more details to leak via its own website.
As has been discovered by AllThingsHow, a number of details have cropped up thanks to an XML file that provides the URLs for a number of unannounced Apple products, presumably ready for when the Apple Store comes back online after the event.
The issue is that AllThingsHow was able to get its hands on the file before the store was taken down this morning, giving us a look at what’s on the horizon.
1. We now know for sure that the 6.1-inch iPhone will be called the iPhone Xr thanks to the leak. We also know, thanks to the URLs discovered, that the iPhone Xr will come in a number of colors; black, white, red, yellow, coral and blue. Storage options will include 64GB, 128GB and 256GB.
2. We now also know that the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max names are correct, but we also know that those two iPhone models will also ship with a 512GB storage option as well, so anyone who finds themselves short on storage how has an option that they didn’t have before. Storage options will be 64GB, 256GB and 512GB.
3. Both the iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max will have official silicone and leather cases available at launch. The iPhone Xs will have Silicone Cases in Black, White, Midnight Blue, (PRODUCT)Red, and Stone, as well as Xs Leather Cases in (PRODUCT)Red, Taupe, and Black. Leather Folio Cases were also found in (PRODUCT)RED, Green, Black, Cape Cod Blue, and Peony Pink. Those buying an iPhone Xs Max will be able to choose from the same colors in silicone, although no leather options were spotted in the XML file. That doesn’t mean they aren’t there, though.
4. Finally, we have the Apple Watch Series 4 confirmed as well as two new display sizes; 40mm and 44mm. It’s likely these larger sizes are made possible by decreasing the bezel size as had been rumored, with GPS and cellular versions available in Gray, Silver and Gold aluminum. As usual, there will also be Nike and Hermes versions available, too, although no ceramic option was seen.
There was no mention of any iPad Pros in the XML file which might suggest we will not see those devices refreshed during this event, but we’ll have to wait and see in order to be sure.

H05K7/20745—Forced ventilation of a gaseous coolant within rooms for removing heat from cabinets, e.g. by air conditioning device
A system for cooling an environment housing a plurality of electronic equipment in one or more cabinets is disclosed, the system comprising a remote cooling unit(s) adapted to provide relatively cool air into the environment, an exhaust associated with each cabinet, the exhaust being provided with variable airflow means; the remote unit being adapted to receive exhausted air, and; sensor means adapted to determine cooling demand and alter the output of the remote cooling unit(s) accordingly. Schemes for using the system are described.
This invention relates to a cooling system for cooling data centres (ie environments where a plurality of IT equipment, eg data servers, is operated).
By far the most popular design of existing cooling systems for data centres is the use of downflow (CRAC) units. These rely on CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units supplying cool air into a raised modular floor plenum effectively creating a higher pressure in the void than in the ICT space. This increased pressure forces cool air out of floor grilles that are generally located in what is termed a cold aisle. A cold aisle is an aisle between ICT equipment racks that has floor grilles across its width and length and has the front of two sets of racks facing one another. Cool air is drawn into the front of the equipment cabinet by the ICT equipment and discharged at the rear of the rack. The rear of the racks will generally face one another to form a ‘hot aisle’. The ‘hot aisle’ will not have any floor tiles and may have some form of baffling to assist in returning hot air back to the CRAC units to cool and re-circulate once again.
The CRAC units are generally cooled either by a chilled fluid such as water or a water/glycol mixture or by a DX (direct expansion) system utilising refrigerants such as R22, R134a, R407C or R410A. Chilled fluid systems would be connected to an external ‘chiller’. Direct expansion systems would be connected to an external means of heat rejection typically an air cooled condenser or condensing unit. Occasionally water cooled DX systems may be used in which case the CRAC unit would be connected to one or more dry air coolers (radiators) or cooling tower(s).
CRAC units currently control to return air temperature. If the return air temperature falls below set point then the cooling capacity of the unit is reduced (by staging compressors or altering coolant fluid flow rates) whilst keeping the airflow constant. This results in the supply air temperature rising and the temperature differential over the CRAC unit becoming less.
FIGS. 1 and 2 show two typical installations of downflow CRAC units. Figure one shows a typical CRAC unit located in a room with an open top return to the CRAC unit. Figure two shows a similar system but this time return air is passed via a suspended ceiling void to the top of the CRAC unit. The supply air (ie air supplied to cabinets) is at about 14 to 16° C. and return air at about 22 to 24° C.
The main benefits of the downflow CRAC unit method are its flexibility in terms of locating equipment racks and that redundant units can be located in the room so that if a unit needs maintaining or fails there will be sufficient ‘standby’ capacity in the room for the ICT equipment to continue functioning unaltered.
Data centres are designed to have varying grades of redundancy to ensure that the ICT equipment is continuously available to the business. The most common forms are known as N+1 and 2N where N is the total cooling required to maintain design operation of the data centre. Taking an example of each grade of redundancy;
N+1=a data centre that has a total cooling load of 200 kW that is satisfied with 4 No 50 kW CRAC units but is fitted with a fifth 50 kW unit to provide +1 redundancy therefore N (4×50 kW)+1(1×50 kW).
2N=a data centre with the same 200 kW cooling load that is satisfied with 4 No. 50 kW CRAC units but is fitted with a further 4 No 50 kW unit to provide +N redundancy therefore N (4×50 kW)+N(4×50 kW) which equates to 2N.
It is clear that N+1 is less expensive than 2N and satisfies most commercial data centre operators requirements in terms of facility resilience, this makes it the most popular option.
The disadvantages of the downflow CRAC unit method are that is cools the room, not just the ICT rack, it is not controlled at the ICT rack level and that it moves more air than is required and at temperatures that do not suit ICT equipment which will be further explained later.
Despite some attempt at segregation hot aisle/cold aisle etc CRAC units tend to be used to cool the data centre itself and in doing so ensure that the ICT equipment is cooled. Rack coolers cool at the ICT equipment rack level.
Rack coolers generally consist of a cooling coil across which air from the rack is passed by fans. The cooling coil may be in the base of the rack and cool air be passed up the front face of the cabinet, or it may be mounted between the racks passing cold air across the front and taking the hot return air from the back of the rack. In some instances the rack is not closed to the data centre and the cooler sits on the back of the rack and cools the hot air as it leaves the rack.
Cooling mediums for these methods can be pumped refrigerant, CO2, or a chilled fluid such as water. In all methods heat rejection plant will be positioned externally to transfer the heat to atmosphere.
FIGS. 3 and 4 show two typical types of rack cooler. Figure three shows a rack cooler with the chilled water coil at its base and warm air is drawn down the back of the rack and cool air is forced up the front face of the rack. Figure four shows a similar system, this time the air is pushed horizontally across the front face of the rack and is drawn back at the rear of the rack, across the chilled water coil to begin the process once more. Supply air is typically at about 20 to 22° C. and return air at about 40 to 44° C.
The main benefits of rack coolers is that they control at a rack, not room level, and that the temperatures and airflows better match that of modern ICT equipment.
Disadvantages are that redundancy is required at the rack level which means that N+1 (the most popular configuration) is exactly the same solution as 2N. Each rack has its own cooler therefore to have N+1 each rack must have two coolers which is the same as 2N.
Another disadvantage is that the secondary cooling medium has to be run within the data centre. Some data centre operators are understandably nervous about moving large quantities of water or high pressure CO2 local to their business critical ICT equipment.
Finally, the cooling available from a rack cooler due to its different operating parameters is greater than that of the CRAC downflow system but because the rack is sealed the control loop is very tight. Some rack coolers are marketed as having up to 30 kW cooling capacity. The rack cooler is a closed system so if it were to fail there would be very little thermal inertia which results in thermal cut-out of standard ICT equipment within 5 seconds of the cooling failing.
Most if not all cooling methods of the modern data centre singularly fail to recognise that ICT equipment is perfectly capable of cooling itself as long as it is presented with the right quantity and temperature of air at its inlet and that the hot air rejected is managed away to prevent it short cycling and passing to the front of the equipment again.
The IBM blade server is an example of ICT equipment that has been developed over recent years. This server would be housed in what IBM would refer to as a Blade Center® that would comprise a plurality of these servers.
Published figures for an IBM Blade Center® (at time of writing) are 5.1 kW heat rejection based on an airflow rate of 220 l/s.
It is designed to have air introduced to its front face at between 20 and 22 degrees centigrade (° C.).
Based on the data above and using a standard equation for the calculation of nett sensible cooling we can derive that if 220 l/s of air was presented at the front face at 20° C. and it absorbed 5.1 kW of heat it would be discharged from the rear of the blade centre 19.3 degrees Kelvin (° K.) higher than it entered. So we can see that the ideal in terms of cooling for this piece of ICT equipment would be 220 l/s of air at 20° C. presented to its front face and then discharged from the rear at 39.3° C.
The table below shows the operating parameters of the two main cooling methods used and compares them with the requirements of this example of ICT equipment.
It is clear from the data above that the rack cooler method most closely matches the requirements of the server but asks the ICT equipment to have a higher temperature differential across it (due to supplying too little air) than the ideal. The CRAC system controls the room temperature and supplies air at too low a temperature which is inefficient and also supplies too much air, again this is inefficient.
FIG. 5 illustrates this imbalance. Each cabinet 7 in this example is populated with two blade systems (generating 10.2 kW). The air from the cabinets is at about 33° C. at a flow rate of about 0.44 m3/S. The maximum airflow in the cold aisle 6 (from the CRAC 1 through floor void 3 will be 2 m3/S, giving 1 m3/S per rack (in this example), ie about 12 kW.
Regardless of the amount of air supplied to the front face of the server, it will only ever draw across it the design flow rate of its internal fans. This point is stressed again because it is instrumental to the new invention's effectiveness that works in harmony with the ICT equipment not in isolation to it and in doing so provides large energy saving opportunities.
The present invention arose in an attempt to provide performance similar to that of the rack cooler but with the flexibility and benefits of CRAC systems.
The present invention arose from the understanding that ICT (Information Communication Technology) equipment, servers, routers, switches etc have a cooling design and philosophy of their own. Each item of ICT equipment that is air cooled (majority of ICT equipment) will generally have one or more heat sinks complete with fans to dissipate the heat energy produced as part of their operation.
With these facts in mind, the cooling solution is designed to work in harmony with the ICT equipment's requirements, to the improvement of the operating efficiency of the ICT and cooling process.
By maintaining a constant air temperature to the front of equipment racks that house ICT components and removing air at a constant temperature once the ICT equipment has used the cool air (to absorb the heat energy it generates) it is possible to operate a modification to an existing downflow cooling system in a way that ensures air is delivered to only those equipment racks that need it (racks will often have varying heat rejection values across a data centre) and allows for massive opportunities in terms of energy saving by using existing freecooling methods.
In a further aspect, the invention provides a system for cooling an environment housing a plurality of electronic equipment in one or more ICT (Information Communication Technology) equipment racks comprising one or more remote cooling units that introduce relative cool air into the space, an active exhaust product associated with each of the equipment cabinets, the active exhaust being provided with temperature sensing and variable airflow means; the remote unit being designed to receive air at relatively high temperatures and vary air volume as a means of controlling cooling capacity to maintain a constant temperature differential between the supply and return sides of the remote unit.
The invention further provides cooling apparatus for electronic equipment mounted within one or more data cabinets, comprising a cabinet exhaust unit mounted to receive exhaust air from a cabinet and which comprises variable airflow means which is controlled to maintain constant return air temperature.
In a further aspect, there is provided cooling apparatus for data centres, each centre comprising a plurality of data cabinets housing ICT equipment, comprising an active cabinet exhaust unit mounted to receive air from each cabinet and which comprises variable airflow means which is controlled to maintain constant return air temperature.
Furthermore, there is provided a method of controlling the climate of a data centre, comprising providing a cooling unit adapted to output relatively cool air to the data centre; means associated with each item of equipment or groups of items of equipment comprising an active cabinet exhaust for receiving exhausted air from the equipment cabinet, which active cabinet exhaust comprises variable airflow means and means for returning the exhausted air, via the active airflow means, back to the cooling unit, and further comprising sensing one or more parameters to determine the cooling demand or other parameters and using this to vary the cooling and airflow output.
Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which:
The cooling system of the present invention is a system designed to match the cooling requirements of the ICT equipment and in doing so present huge energy savings by utilising existing freecooling technology.
The main failure of an existing CRAC system is that it controls the room, not the ICT equipment supply and exhaust, and this results in air supply that is too cool and that is over supplied to take away any hotspots which are bound to occur when the ICT equipment is not matched to the cooling system. FIG. 5 shows how a typical CRAC downflow system is mismatched to the requirements of the ICT equipment.
The diagram shows how each cabinet housing 2 No. servers requires half the airflow actually provided and air could be supplied 6° C. higher. But in order to remove hot spots and maintain the room at a desirable temperature (20 to 22° C. approx. 1.7 m from the raised modular floor is typical) more air is provided and by the time the over supply of air mixes with the hot exhaust air from the ICT equipment it returns to the CRAC at around 24° C.
The maximum airflow in the cold aisle is determined by how much air can efficiently be introduced through floor grilles. The figure of 1 m3/s is based on 2 No. floor tiles which would be the effective discharge area in front of 1 No. 800 mm wide ICT equipment cabinet sitting in a three tile wide cold aisle (based on typical 600×600 mm floor grilles/tiles).
The system comprises one or more CRAC units 1, with return air section 2 having monitoring sensing means or one or more sensors. Cool air from the CRAC is applied through a floor void 3 (typically of depth 400 to 1,000 mm) and through grilles 4 formed by floor tiles 5 to a cold aisle 6. ICT cabinets 7 are populated (for example) with 4 blade systems (not shown). Typically, this arrangement might generate 20.4 kW of heat. Of course, other types of ICT equipment may be held by the cabinets. The rear doors of the cabinets are sealed so that temperature is neutral at the rear of the cabinet.
Warm air from the cabinet is exhausted into ACE (Active Cabinet Exhaust) units 8, each of which has variable airflow means and temperature sensing means T1. The variable airflow means may be one, two or more EC variable speed fans (just one is shown for clarity in FIG. 7), air volume control damper 10 (FIG. 12) with variable drive actuators, or any other airflow means.
Airflow from the ACE units is directed to, for example, a ceiling void 11 (FIG. 6) (typically of depth 300 to 600 mm) or ducting 12 (FIG. 12) which returns it to the top section 2 of the CRAC 1. The ACE units include a controller 20. They also may include an incident panel or flap 21, which can be arranged (by a spring mechanism or otherside) to release upon a high temperature alarm to vent the cabinet to the room. FIG. 7 also shows a suspended ceiling C (being part of the ceiling void).
The ACEs (Active Cabinet Exhaust) 8 are fitted with EC fans that modulate the airflow away from the rack varying the air volume to suit the ICT equipment housed in the cabinet—see FIG. 7 for an ACE section detail. If there are only a few items with a low heat dissipation then the fan will move more slowly and if there is a lot of high heat density equipment in the rack it will be operating near its maximum setting. This ensures that racks that are housing varying types and quantities of equipment are controlled individually. The ACE also ensures that no air is free to re-circulate back into the cold aisle and interrupt the temperature controlled cool air supplied to the front of the cabinets.
The airflow off the cabinets (with, for example, 4 blade servers) might be at, say, 36° C. (at a flow rate of 0.88 m3/S).
Standard CRAC units have a constant air volume and control to return air temperature, altering the supply temperature to the space depending on the sensed cooling demand. CRAC units according to the present invention, may be optimised so they could operate with higher temperature differentials across them and control to a constant temperature differential with the airflow changing to suit the requirements of the ICT equipment. Once again the ICT equipment can cool itself assuming it is presented with the right amount of air at the right temperature.
As shown in FIG. 6, high return air temperature can be achieved, such as 36° C. The higher return air temperatures would mean that freecooling would be approximately twice as efficient than with standard systems. Freecooling systems do not form part of this patent application, but the cooling system would be able to utilise them far more than any current cooling system.
1. Planet CRAC airflow and temperature differential match that of ICT equipment which improves efficiency.
2. Redundancy can be applied at the zone or room level, as with standard CRAC systems, reducing the amount of cooling plant required.
3. The system is more efficient at higher return air temperatures and is therefore comparatively smaller than current systems taking up less technical space.
4. CRAC fans are speed controlled to maintain constant temperature differential and vary airflow to suit cooling demand of ICT equipment.
5. ACE is speed controlled to provide constant return air temperature even with varying heat loads within individual racks.
7. ACE incident panel releases upon high temperature alarm so that the thermal inertia of the room is used to absorb heat rejected from the rack and thus increasing time to thermal cut-out of ICT equipment in event of cooling failure to multiples of minutes, not seconds as with rack cooler.
8. All secondary cooling mediums, water etc can be routed outside of the technical space, only air is controlled in the IT space.
9. Exhaust air from servers is actively managed so that the correct amount is transferred back to the CRAC, at the right temperature, preventing hot spots or the need to oversupply the room.
10. It is possible to absorb up to about 22 kW of heat per rack reliably as opposed to approx. 10 kW of heat per rack with a standard CRAC system.
12. At the higher return air temperatures the energy saving opportunities are huge and some form of freecooling would be available for up to 95% of the year at current UK climatic conditions.
As shown in FIG. 7, the ACE fans vary airflow to maintain contact temperature from rack discharge, thus matching the heat load from the ICT equipment.
FIGS. 8 to 11 show some examples of control and sensing strategy of the system within the IT space and does not include control options for external cooling or heat rejection plant which would be as is currently available in the market. In each, figure N is a network/control cable.
The selection of each option would be based on the particular requirements of each individual solution.
Fan speed and therefore airflow is determined by ACE temperature sensor values T1 and driven by ACE controller.
Cooling demand is determined by supply air sensor(s) T2 (in void) and return air sensor(s) T3. Cooling demand is calculated by the microprocessor and fan speed and compressor voltage/chilled water valve (of the CRAC) is driven accordingly.
Fan speed and therefore airflow is determined by ACE temperature sensor values and driven by ACE controller.
Cooling demand is determined by supply air sensor(s) (in void) and return air sensor(s). Cooling demand is calculated by the microprocessor and compressor voltage/chilled water valve is driven accordingly.
Sub-floor pressure is measured via floor void or CRAC fan mounted pressure sensors P1 and communicated to CRAC microprocessor.
CRAC airflow is then based on cooling demand and sub-floor pressure—whichever is the higher airflow demand is communicated to fans via CRAC microprocessor.
Fan speed is extrapolated into airflow rate (via EC fans) and communicated via LAN 15 to CRAC. The LAN (or a WLAN) is a cabling (or perhaps a wireless) system connecting the ACE units to the CRAC, for the transmission of signals.
Cooling demand is determined by supply air sensor(s) T2 (in void) and return air sensor(s) T3. Cooling demand is calculated by the microprocessor and compressor voltage/chilled water valve is driven accordingly.
In this arrangement, combined flow rates of the ACEs are calculated and CRAC airflows are modulated to ensure sufficient over-supply of air (approx. 20% above total ACE flow rates—excess air returns into ceiling plenum via ceiling mounted eggcrate bypass grilles)
CRAC airflow is then based on cooling demand and combined airflow measurement of ACEs—whichever is the higher airflow demand is communicated to fans via CRAC microprocessor.
Combined flow rates of ACEs calculated and CRAC airflows modulated to ensure sufficient over-supply of air (approx. 20% above total ACE flow rates—excess air returns into ceiling plenum via ceiling mounted eggcrate bypass grilles)
Sub-floor pressure is measured via floor void or CRAC fan mounted pressure sensors and communicated to CRAC microprocessor.
CRAC airflow to be based on cooling demand, combined airflow measurement of ACEs and sub-floor pressure—whichever is the higher airflow demand is communicated to fans via CRAC microprocessor.
In some applications it may be desirable to pass the air back to the Planet CRAC unit(s) not via a ceiling plenum but via solid ducting, as shown in FIG. 12. Note that this ducting may be used with any embodiment, not just the damper ACE shown in FIG. 12.
Although the standard fan driven ACE (Active Cabinet Exhaust) may be used, it would also be possible to use the CRAC unit fans, although up rated, to draw air through the return ductwork. In this configuration the ACE would be constructed as shown in FIG. 12. The operation in terms of control would be identical to the standard Planet VAVIT Cooling System but the ACE would be fitted with a damper 10 with a variable control device actuator which would modulate to control the airflow and in doing so the return air temperature back to the CRAC unit(s) in the same way as the variable speed fans do on the standard ACE component. The ACE damper 10 varies airflow back to the CRAC to maintain contact temperature from rack discharge, thus matching heat load from the ICT equipment. T12 is a temperature sensor in the air stream.
FIGS. 13 and 14 shows respective views of an ACE unit from generally below and above. Two fans 9 are included. The opening O on the underside of the ACE receives airflow from the rack.
In the embodiments of FIGS. 13 and 14, the flap 30 opens inwardly (as opposed to opening outwardly as in the embodiment of FIG. 7, for example). Any embodiment of the invention may use inwardly opening flaps. These can be safer in terms of health and safety and can also seal off the fans and allow air to exhaust more efficiently.

An arbiter for a switch maintains a pair of counters for each flow of traffic at each input port: one counter (also called “first counter”) to indicate an ideal transfer of traffic, and another counter (also called “second counter”) to indicate the actual transfer of traffic. Both counters are incremented when traffic is received by the input port, and the second counter is decremented when a unit of traffic (such as a cell or packet) is about to be transmitted whereas the first counter is decremented in a fractional manner (relative to the unit of traffic) in each period of arbitration, based on available bandwidth. The arbiter selects one of the output ports (also called “winning output port”) of the switch, based at least partially on values of the two counters for each flow from the input port to one of the output ports, and generates a signal to approve transfer of traffic from the input port to the winning output port. In several embodiments, the above-described flow can be for either high priority traffic or for low priority traffic, and any bandwidth leftover from transferring high priority traffic is used in transferring low priority traffic. Specifically, the arbiter maintains additional counters for each port indicative of total bandwidth being used, and the additional counters are used to allocate leftover bandwidth in an iterative manner, until a flow from an input port to an output port is saturated, at which time the saturated flow is removed from iteration.

Consider the problem of building a communication switch with N input ports and N output ports. If we place the buffers at the output ports, then we need to use memory with bandwidth equal to the sum of the bandwidths of the input ports. This can be done by using fast static memory with very wide memory buses. Using the current memory technology, this solution is only cost effective when the aggregate bandwidth of the switch is less than 50 Gbits/sec. Therefore, virtual output queued (VOQ) architecture is an attractive option for building switches with higher aggregate bandwidth. However, since the hardware complexity of the arbiter is O(N2), the VOQ switches are only practical for switches with a moderate number of switch ports (e.g. N≦32). Note that the number of switch ports is equal to the number of line cards. The actual number of switch ports can be larger as multiple ports can be multiplexed/demultiplexed by the line cards. In a switch with the VOQ architecture, the memory write bandwidth is equal to the input port bandwidth and the read bandwidth is equal to the switch bandwidth. The bandwidth of a cross-connect (FIG. 1A) is higher than the maximum port bandwidth by a speedup factor. The arbiter has to operate at or above the maximum port bandwidth. The output buffers need to have a read bandwidth equal to the output port bandwidth and write bandwidth equal to the bandwidth of the switching fabric.
Extensive work on the problem of enhancing the throughput of input buffered switches has been described by N. W. McKeown in an article entitled “The iSLIP scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches,” IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, vol. 7, no. 2, April 1999 and by N. W. McKeown, M. Izzard, A. Mekkittikul, W. Ellersick, and M. Horowitz in another article entitled “The tiny tera: A packet switch core,” in Hot Interconnects V, August 1996. Both these articles are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The arbitration problem is equivalent to a bipartite matching problem for which the best known algorithm has a time complexity of the order of nn/2 as described by J. E. Hopcroft and R. M. Karp, in an article entitled “An n5/2 algorithm for maximum matchings for bipartitle graphs,” SIAM Journal on Computing, vol. 2, no. 4, pp. 225-231, 1973. This article is also incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
A hardware arbiter has to make arbitration decisions within one cell interval of the switching fabric. This can only be achieved by using parallelism and careful methods to minimize probability of “synchronization” of decisions by independent modules working in parallel. One way of building an arbiter is by using two sets of N independent schedulers as shown in FIG. 1B. The jth scheduler in the first set corresponds to the jth output port and the ith scheduler in the second set corresponds to the ith input port. The jth output port scheduler selects an input port from the set of input ports that have indicated cell arrival to the jth output port. And the ith input port scheduler selects an output port from the set of output ports which had selected the ith input port in the first step. Any unmatched input and output ports are matched in the subsequent iteration(s). A prior art method called Parallel Iterative Matching (PIM) arbitration algorithm uses random schedulers: A requesting port is selected with uniform probability. This algorithm is further described by T. Anderson, S. Owicki, J. Saxe, and C. Thacker in an article entitled “High speed switch scheduling for local area networks,” ACM Transactions on Computer Systems, vol. 11, no. 4, pp. 319-352, November 1993 that is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
Another method, namely the iSLIP arbitration algorithm described in the article entitled “The iSLIP scheduling algorithm for input-queued switches,” uses round-robin schedulers. In the case of iSLIP, the schedulers are not truly independent: The round-robin scheduler in the input unit is only advanced if its selection is accepted by the round-robin scheduler at the output unit. Various weighted versions of the round-robin schedulers are used in commercial switches. However, it must be noted that a simple weighted round-robin scheme is not suitable as it increases the probability of “synchronization.” “Synchronization” occurs when more than one scheduler selects the same port repeatedly thus reducing the switch throughput. McKeown suggested the use of circular schedule lists to implement weighted iSLIP arbiters. However, very large schedule lists are needed and programming these lists as connections are added and deleted is not a trivial problem. Moreover, the two sets of schedulers use two sets of weights and there does not seem to be a simple relationship between the weights and the bandwidth allocated to the flows. The main drawback, however, of the arbiters using two sets of schedulers is that these arbiters do not provide fairness of the type described by D. Cavendish, M. Goudreau, and A. Ishii, in an article entitled “On the fairness of scheduling algorithms for input-queued switches,” in International Teletraffic Congress, December 2001, vol. 4, pp. 829-841 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
In accordance with the invention, an arbiter for a communication switch maintains a pair of counters for each flow of traffic at each input port: one counter (also called “first counter”) to indicate an ideal transfer of traffic, and another counter (also called “second counter”) to indicate the actual transfer of traffic. Both counters are incremented when traffic is received by the input port, but the two counters are decremented in two different ways as described next.
The second counter is decremented when a unit of traffic (such as a cell or packet) is approved for transfer by the input port to a destination output port. The amount of decrement is proportional to the size of the unit of traffic that is transferred. Therefore, the value in the second counter of each input port indicates the amount of traffic that has arrived at the input port and that has not completed transfer through the communication switch, regardless of traffic conditions at other ports. The first counter is decremented in a fractional manner (relative to the unit of traffic), if a fraction of traffic can be transmitted in a current period. The value in the first counter depends on the bandwidth available at the port and on traffic conditions at other ports.
In certain embodiments, the arbiter selects one of the output ports (hereinafter “winning output port”), based at least partially on values of the two counters for each flow from the input port to one of the output ports, and generates a signal (hereinafter “grant signal”) to approve transfer of traffic from the input port to the winning output port.
In several embodiments, the above-described flow is one of a number of flows for traffic of different priorities to be transferred between the input port and the output port, and each flow is associated with at least the first and second counters. Decrementing of the first counter for each high priority flow is performed automatically periodically unless the first counter is zero. If the first counter of a high priority flow is smaller than a bandwidth requirement (also called “weight”) of the high priority flow, then the decrement amount is equal to the first counter, else the decrement amount is equal to the bandwidth requirement.
In several embodiments, any bandwidth leftover from transferring high priority traffic may be used in transferring traffic in one or more low priority flows, based on an additional counter that is associated with each input port and each output port. Specifically, certain embodiments of the arbiter maintain a counter (hereinafter “used input port bandwidth”) for each input port indicative of total decrements in the first counter of each flow between the input port and all output ports, and also maintain a counter (hereinafter “used output port bandwidth”) for each output port indicative of a sum of decrements in the first counter of each flow between the output port and all input ports. The difference between the used input port bandwidth and a predetermined input port bandwidth represents the leftover bandwidth available at each input port for transfer of low priority traffic. Similarly, the difference between the used output port bandwidth and the maximum output port bandwidth represents the leftover bandwidth available at each output port for transfer of low priority traffic.
In some embodiments, the just-described leftover bandwidths are allocated in an iterative manner from the input units of the arbiter to the output units of the arbiter, until a flow from an input unit to an output unit is saturated, at which time the saturated flow is removed from the iteration. A flow is saturated if the bandwidth allocation for the flow cannot be increased because of port bandwidth constraint or because the bandwidth allocated for the flow has reached the bandwidth of a source of the flow. The port bandwidth constraint is reached when the sum of bandwidth of all flows through a port exceeds the maximum bandwidth supported by the port. The iteration may be performed a fixed number of times (e.g. 2 times), or alternatively may be performed until all flows are saturated.

In certain embodiments of the invention, a network element is architected to use a virtual output queued (VOQ) switch and an arbiter 120 (FIG. 2A) that maintains a pair of counters for each flow (buffered in a virtual output queue) at each input port. For example, a pair of counters 121AA and 122AA (together referred to as counters 123AA) are maintained for a first flow “A” (not shown or labeled in FIG. 2A) through a first input port 102A. In a similar manner counters 123AI are maintained for the ith flow through first input port 102A, and counters 123AN are maintained for the Nth flow through first input port 102A. Furthermore, counters 123IA are maintained for the first flow in the ith input port 102I, and so on.
Of the two counters 123IJ that are maintained for each traffic flow, one counter (also called “first counter”) indicates an ideal transfer of traffic regardless of the discrete size of each unit of traffic, and another counter (also called “second counter”) tracks the actual transfer of traffic. For this reason, in some embodiments the first counter has more resolution than the second counter, e.g. the first counter may be a 32 bit counter whereas the second counter may be an 8 bit counter or alternatively the first counter may be a floating point counter and the second counter may be an integer counter. Each pair of counters 123IJ are incremented (as illustrated by act 141 in FIG. 2B) on arrival of traffic at the respective input port 102I, and destined for the respective output port 103J.
Arrival of traffic into one of the virtual output queues (voqs) in an input port 102I may be indicated to arbiter 120 via a signal (called “traffic arrival”) that is generated by the respective input port of the network element. Note that the traffic can be in the form of variable length packets, fixed length cells or a combination, although in certain embodiments, the traffic is in the form of fixed length cells and in such embodiments the traffic arrival signal is referred to as cell arrival.
In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 2A, the traffic arrival signal automatically causes the respective pair of counters to increment, although in an alternative embodiment, such a signal is received by a logic 125 (hereinafter “arbitration logic”) that then increments the counters (as per act 141). Therefore, it is to be understood that embodiments may differ in use of specific hardware that performs any of acts 141-145 of method 140. Moreover such acts may be performed in any order (including simultaneously) although a specific order has been illustrated as being used in some embodiments.
To indicate an ideal transfer of traffic, during each period arbitration logic 125 automatically decrements (as per act 142 in FIG. 2B) the first counter for each flow, if the first counter is nonzero. Next, arbitration logic 125 selects (as per act 143 in FIG. 2B) zero or one flow at each input port (also called “winning flow”) based at least partially on values of counters in the pair for each flow from the input port to one of the output ports. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, the counters may be read by arbitration logic 125 via buses 128A-128N that are connected to the respective counters 123A-123N.
The specific criteria used in selecting a winning flow (and hence an output port which is also called “winning output port”) depend on the embodiment. In some embodiments, the selection is based on the relative values of the two counters of each flow associated with the input port. In one specific embodiment, arbitration logic 125 selects (in one example of act 143 in FIG. 2B) the flow that has the greatest difference between counters among all flows associated with the input port whose first counter is less than or equal to the second counter. Regardless of how the selection is done, if a winning flow is selected, arbitration logic 125 generates a signal (also called “grant signal”) on a bus 124I to input port 102I (see FIG. 2A) to approve transfer of traffic from the input port, to the winning output port of the input port, as illustrated by act 144 in FIG. 2B.
In response to the grant signal, each input port transfers the traffic of the winning flow (from a virtual output queue) to the communication switch 130 that may be implemented as a cross-connect in certain embodiments although other structures (such as a multi-stage switch e.g. a butterfly switch, a batcher-banyan switch or a clos switch) may be used in other embodiments. For example, traffic may be transferred by input port 102N via a bus 131N to switch 130 that in turn is programmed to transfer the traffic to the destination output port, e.g. port 103N, via bus 132N. For clarity, not all such buses are shown in FIG. 2A, although it is to be understood that each port in network element 100 is connected to switch 130.
Furthermore, in certain embodiments, arbiter 120 is coupled to switch 130 to receive therefrom a signal indicating congestion therein, for use in slowing down or stopping the issuance of grant signals to one or more ports responsible for the congestion. In several such embodiments, switch 130 is enhanced with a number of first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues at the inputs and outputs of switch 130, and each output of switch 130 has an independent scheduler which selects input ports for receipt of traffic therefrom in a round robin fashion.
At some point thereafter, the second counter of the winning flow is decremented by the arbitration logic 125 (e.g. via bus 128I) to keep track of the actual transfer of traffic (as per act 145 in FIG. 2B). Depending on the situation, one or more of the above-described acts 141-145 may be repeated in the next period (each period is defined by the time required to transfer the traffic in response to the grant signal, and the period may be fixed by the speed of the backplane (e.g. speed of buses 131N and 132N). For example, if in the next period additional traffic is received, then act 141 is repeated, followed by performance of acts 142-145 (e.g. if only one flow is active in the entire network element).
Moreover, even in the current period, acts 143-145 may be repeated for each input port (as per branch 147), or alternatively may be performed simultaneously. Furthermore, act 142 may be repeated as illustrated by branch 148, for example if no additional traffic is received in the next period, and if none of the flows at the input port are enabled for selection (enablement of a flow is required prior to selection in some embodiments, as discussed next).
Specifically, in some embodiments, prior to selection as per act 147 (FIG. 2C), arbitration logic 125 performs an act 146 (FIG. 2C) to enable zero or more flows at the input port based on a predetermined criterion. Depending on the embodiment, the predetermined criterion may be designed to reduce the probability of synchronization in selection of the same output port by more than one input port. In some embodiments, a predetermined criterion is designed to enable a flow at an input port 102I based on the value I, e.g. if the second counter is greater than the first counter by at least (R/N)*I where I is the flow identity, R is the resolution and N is the number of flows. Such use of the identity I results in staggered enabling of the flows of each input port, relative to the beginning of the period.
In several embodiments, the above-described flow of traffic is one of a number of flows, for traffic of different priorities to be transferred between the input port and the output port, and each flow (regardless of priority) is associated with at least the first and second counters as illustrated in FIG. 3A. For example, counters 123A include two pairs of counters, namely counters 121AAH and 122AAH which form a pair for a high priority flow in the first input port 102A, and counters 121AAL and 122AAL which form another pair for a low priority flow in the first input port 102A. Although only one set of counters 123AA are illustrated in FIG. 3A for a pair of high and low priority flows, it is to be understood that for each input port there are as many flows (and hence as many sets of counters) as the number of output ports, thereby to implement virtual output queued (VOQ) architecture.
Such embodiments perform a method 150 (FIG. 3B) including acts 151, 152 and 154-156 that are similar or identical to the corresponding acts 141, 142 and 144-147 described above in reference to FIGS. 2B and 2C, except that the flows are specifically for carrying high priority or low priority traffic. In such embodiments, decrementing of the first counter for each high priority flow is performed automatically periodically unless the first counter is zero. If the first counter of a high priority flow is smaller than a bandwidth requirement (also called “weight”) of the high priority flow, then the decrement amount is equal to the first counter, else the decrement amount is equal to the bandwidth requirement.
Moreover, in such embodiments, prior to the acts of enablement and selection (as per acts 156 and 157), arbitration logic 125 checks if there is any bandwidth leftover at each port (as per act 160) after allocation of bandwidth for high priority flows (as per act 152). If so, arbitration logic 125 allocates such leftover bandwidth for transfer of low priority traffic. When the bandwidth is allocated to low priority traffic, arbitration logic 125 decrements a first counter for each low priority flow to which bandwidth is being allocated (as per act 160). The leftover bandwidth may be allocated only to flows whose first counter is nonzero, thereby to ensure that the leftover bandwidth will be used to transfer traffic. Optionally, the allocation of leftover bandwidth may be done a small fraction at a time over a number of iterations until one or more flows are saturated. The specific allocation of leftover bandwidth to low priority flows may be done differently, depending on the embodiment.
Specifically, several embodiments of the arbiter maintain a counter (hereinafter “used input port bandwidth”) for each input port indicative of total decrements during a period in the first counter of each flow between the input port and all output ports, and also maintain a counter (hereinafter “used output port bandwidth”) for each output port indicative of a sum of decrements in the first counter of each flow between the output port and all input ports. The difference between the used input port bandwidth and a predetermined input port bandwidth represents the unused bandwidth (also called “leftover input port bandwidth”) available at each input port for transfer of low priority traffic. Similarly, the difference between the used output port bandwidth and the maximum output port bandwidth represents the unused bandwidth (also called “leftover output port bandwidth”) available at each output port for transfer of low priority traffic.
In many embodiments, the just-described leftover bandwidths are allocated in an iterative manner from the input ports to the output ports, until a flow from an input port to an output port is saturated, at which time the saturated flow is removed from the iteration. A flow is saturated if the bandwidth allocation for the flow cannot be increased because of port bandwidth constraint or because the bandwidth allocated for the flow has reached the bandwidth of a source of the flow. The port bandwidth constraint is reached when the sum of bandwidth of all flows through a port exceeds the maximum bandwidth supported by the port. The iteration may be performed a fixed number of times (e.g. 2 times), or alternatively may be performed until all flows are saturated.
Some embodiments of the arbiter provide grant signals for the transfer of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cells from the input ports to the output ports of a cross-connect. Several such embodiments simulate inside the arbiter a number of input ports that correspond to input ports of the cross-connect, a number of output ports that correspond to output ports of the cross-connect, and a transfer of fractions of cells (also called “fluid”) from each simulated input port (also called “input unit”) to each simulated output port (also called “output unit”). Therefore, instead of having a single arbitration logic 125, the logic for arbitration is distributed among all the simulated ports (i.e. among input units IU—1 to IU_N and output units OU—1 to OU_N as illustrated in FIG. 4). The fluid transfer between the simulated input ports IU—1-IU_N and the simulated output ports OU—1-OU_N is performed in a manner unconstrained by the discrete size of each cell, so as to allow arbiter 120 to maintain a historical memory over time of the bandwidth provided to each flow at each input port.
In several such embodiments, an input unit IU_i transmits to each output unit OU_j a signal (hereinafter “readiness signal”) as illustrated in FIG. 4. The readiness signal indicates readiness of an input port IU_i to transfer fluid, and is generated only if the first counter of the low priority flow is non-zero and if the leftover input port bandwidth is non-zero. Such readiness signals from all input units IU—1-IU_N are taken into account by an output unit OU_j to determine an amount (hereinafter “requested amount”) of fluid from a low priority flow destined to the output unit OU_j from each input unit IU_i, based at least partially on the leftover output port bandwidth. The requested amounts are then indicated by an output unit OU_j (via 8 bit buses) to those of input units IU—1-IU_N that indicated readiness.
A number of request amounts from a corresponding number of simulated output ports OU—1-OU_N are taken into account by each simulated input port IU_i in determining an amount (hereinafter “served amount”) of low priority fluid to be transferred from the simulated input port IU_i to the simulated output port OU_j. The served amounts are then used to reduce the leftover input port bandwidth at each ready input unit IU_i, and these served amounts are also identified to the output units that provided the served amounts. The served amounts are then used by each output unit to reduce the leftover output port bandwidth. The just-described acts may be iteratively performed, e.g. 2 times.
Note that although the readiness signal, the requested amount and the served amount are illustrated in FIG. 4 as being 1 bit wide, 8 bits wide, and 8 bits wide respectively these sizes are merely illustrative and any number of bits may be used depending on the embodiment.
In the implementation illustrated in FIG. 4, arbiter 120 includes a counter 402 (called “phase counter”) that is set to zero at the beginning of each period, and that is incremented a predetermined number of times (e.g. 10 times) during the period depending on the speed at which arbiter 120 operates. Counter 402 informs the current phase number (e.g. clock cycle number) to each of the input units IU—1-IU_N and output units OU—1-OU_N. Moreover, as illustrated in FIG. 4, arbiter 120 also interfaces with (but does not contain therein) a microprocessor 401 that reads and writes the contents of various registers in the input units IU—1-IU_N and output units OU—1-OU_N. In certain embodiments, microprocessor 401 is used to initialize certain registers, e.g. weights that may be allocated depending on the connections being set up through switch 130.
Referring to FIG. 4, the traffic arrival signal from a voq, for traffic at an input port i destined to an output port j is indicated by the notation “hp_cell_arrival (i, j).” In certain embodiments, each of the lines carrying the traffic arrival signal form a parallel bus (that is 2N bits wide, to accommodate one bit for each voq and one bit to indicate priority of the traffic). Data from the bus is converted into serial form during transmission across a backplane that separates each input port 102I from arbiter 120, and subsequently converted back into parallel form for use by arbiter 120. Moreover, a grant signal generated by arbiter 120 is indicated by the notation “grant (i, winning_output, priority)” wherein “i” indicates the input port IU_i, winning_output indicates the output port OU_j that has been selected for traffic transfer, and priority indicates whether the low priority flow or the high priority flow has been selected.
In FIGS. 5A and 5B, internal details of the input unit and output unit respectively are not illustrated, because such circuitry is different, depending on the embodiment. One embodiment of an arbiter for use with a low-speed cross-connect, includes a microprocessor with memory (also called microcontroller) that runs a firmware program that performs the functions of the input unit, the output unit and the fluid flow therebetween. Regardless of the circuitry that is used to implement an input unit and an output unit, each of these units has the signal interface illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B. Specifically, each input unit IU_i receives from a controller of each high priority virtual output queue (voq) in the input port i the signal hp_cell_arrival (i, j) for each high priority flow j that is associated with the voq j (not shown individually). Similarly, each input unit IU_i also receives from a controller of each low priority virtual output queue in the input port i the signal lp_cell_arrival (i, j) for each low priority flow j that is associated with a corresponding low priority voq j (not shown). In addition, each input port IU_i has a number of buses that are respectively connected to each output port OU_j. The just-described buses include a “ready” signal and a serve number that are both sent from an input port IU_i to an output port OU_j, and “request” signal that is sent in the opposite direction, from output port OU_j to input port IU_i.
Furthermore, as illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B, each input unit IU_i and each output unit OU_j also has a phase bus that indicates a phase (in the form of a number, e.g. in the range 1-10 that increases monotonically once per clock cycle unless it rollsover at the end of the range) in which arbiter 120 is currently operating. The phase is used by each input unit IU_i and each output unit OU_j to maintain synchronization with each other. Moreover, each input unit IU_i and each output unit OU_j also has a microprocessor bus that provides an interface to an external microprocessor 401 (FIG. 4), for use during initialization.
Registers contained in an ith input unit IU_i of one particular embodiment are illustrated in FIG. 6A. In the following description, these terms are used synonymously:
Each input unit IU_i contains N high priority fluid counters 608, N high priority discrete counters 609, N low priority fluid counters 610, N low priority discrete counters 611, N high priority weights 607, and N low priority weights 606, of the flows originating in the ith input unit. Each input unit IU_i also contains a register 601 to store bandwidth being used during the inter-arbitration period, a register 602 to indicate the amount of fluid drained from the input unit and a register 603 to indicate the sum Si in of weights of the active flows originating in the input unit. Each input unit IU_i also contains a logic 605 (also called “input unit logic”) that is connected to each of the just-described counters (also called “registers”) to read and/or write the registers in the manner described above (e.g. in reference to the method illustrated in FIG. 3B). For clarity, the connections between logic 605 and the counters are not shown in FIG. 6A.
In a similar manner, FIG. 6B illustrates an output unit OU_j containing registers for high priority weights 616 and low priority weights 617 of the flows destined to the jth output unit. FIG. 6B also illustrates registers 611-613 to respectively store bandwidth, the amount of fluid drained to the output unit and the sum of the weights of the active flows destined to the output unit. Output unit logic 615 is also connected to each of the just-described registers, to read and/or write the registers in the manner described above (e.g. in reference to the method illustrated in FIG. 3B). In FIGS. 6A and 6B, internal details of the input unit logic and output unit logic respectively are not illustrated, because such circuitry is different, depending on the embodiment.
In one specific implementation, an input unit IU_i includes a circuit 700 (FIG. 7A) for generation of the ready signal (discussed above), and an amount fluid served σij for a high or low priority flow (also discussed above) which are supplied to an output unit OU_j. The amount fluid served σij may be determined as discussed below in Addendum A in the description preceding equation (9) and as described in reference to equation (15). In this implementation, as illustrated in FIG. 7A, circuit 700 includes a subtractor 701 that has input lines connected to the above-described registers 601 and 602 (also referred to as aj in and si in registers), and output lines connected to a block 701 of logic to check for non-zero value. Specifically, block 701 checks if the value generated by subtractor 704 is nonzero, and if so drives a signal active to an AND gate 703. AND gate 703 receives its other input signal from another nonzero block 702 that in turn is connected to a counter 121AAL (also referred to as low priority fluid counter fij lp).
As noted above, under certain conditions, input unit IU_i may receive a request for fluid from the output unit OU_j, and the requested amount ρij is latched into a register 708 (FIG. 7A) that is also included in circuit 700. The latching is done in response to a signal latch_request becoming active (which goes active in phases 4 and 8 as illustrated in FIG. 12, e.g. due to a signal generator included in input unit logic 605). The latched signal is supplied as a first input signal to a block 707 that finds the minimum value of three input signals. Block 707 receives a second input signal (indicative of the amount of low priority fluid fij lp in the input unit) from counter 121AAL (also referred to as low priority fluid counter). Block 707 receives a third input signal from a multiply/divide unit 706.
In circuit 700, multiply/divide unit 706 receives three input signals, and provides as output the result of multiplying the first two input signals and dividing the result by the third input signal if the third input signal is nonzero. If the third input signal is zero, then multiply/divide block 706 supplies a zero value to min block 707. In circuit 700, multiply/divide block 706 receives as its first input signal a value generated by subtractor 704, as its second input signal a low priority fluid's weight wij lp in a register 606 i, and as its third input signal a sum of weights of active flows Si in. Block 707 supplies the smallest of ts input signals to a mux 710 that is a 2-to-1 multiplexer. Mux 710 receives as its other input signal a value from a min block 709 that receives two input signals, from each of two registers 121AAH and 607 i (also called high priority fluid counter and high priority weight respectively). Mux 710 supplies a signal to the serve bus, under the control of a signal serve_bus_select_hp that causes the serve bus to have the high priority amount when active and a low priority amount when inactive.
FIG. 7B illustrates, in a low level block diagram, logic 720 in one implementation of the input unit logic 605 of an input unit IU_i (FIG. 6A) for updating of an additional counter 602 (as per equation (16) in Addendum A), to indicate the served amount si in (i.e. the used bandwidth). Logic 720 includes an adder 721 that receives as input each of the served amounts from each of output units OU—1-OU_N, and provides the sum to another adder 722 that receives as its other input the total served amount si in held in register 602. A control signal update_served_in triggers register 602 to latch the output from adder 722, thereby to cause register 602 to increment the total served amount si in by the sum of the amounts in the serve buses to each of the output unit from the ith input unit.
FIGS. 7C and 7D illustrate circuitry in the input unit logic 605 of an input unit IU_i (FIG. 6A) for respectively updating the high and low priority fluid counters 608 i and 610 i. Referring to FIG. 7C, when the hp_cell_arrival signal is asserted, a multiplexer 731 selects its nonzero input, which is the resolution R and this R value is supplied to a subtractor 733. Subtractor 733 receives as its other input a zero value if signal decrement_hp_fluid is inactive and otherwise receives as its other input the served amount (from the serve bus from the ith input unit to the jth output unit). Therefore, if signal decrement_hp_fluid is inactive the high priority fluid counter 608 i is incremented by R, the resolution. When the decrement_hp_fluid control signal is asserted (e.g. by a control signal generator of the type illustrated in FIG. 9B) then the fluid counter 608 ii is decremented by the amount found in the serve bus shown. Note the above circuit 730 works as expected when both signals are asserted. The structure and operation of circuitry 740 (FIG. 7D) for low priority fluid is identical to that discussed above for high priority fluid, except that the corresponding quantities for low priority are used.
FIG. 7E illustrates, in a low level block diagram, logic in one implementation of the input unit of FIG. 6A for computation of the sum of the weights of the low priority flows with nonzero request originating from the ith input unit. Specifically, an adder 753 receives a signal from each of multiplexers 751A-751N, wherein each multiplexer 751 k in turn selects either zero value or the low priority weight wik lp depending on whether or not the requested amount from the kth output unit is greater than zero (which is checked in a checker 752 k). The sum provided by adder 753 is latched in register 603 when signal sum_lp_weights_in goes active (e.g. in phases 5 and 9).
FIG. 8A illustrates, in a low level block diagram, logic in one implementation of the output unit of FIG. 6B for computation of request amount to the ith input unit. Specifically, the circuitry 800 includes a multiply/divide unit 806 that receives three input signals: a first signal from subtractor 804, a second signal from register 617 j that identifies the low priority weight wik lp and a third input from register 613 (described above) that contains the total amount of fluid si out that is transferred to the ith output port during the current period. Multiply/divide unit 806 and subtractor 804 operate in a manner similar or identical to the corresponding items in circuit 700 described above, namely multiply/divide unit 706 and subtractor 704.
FIG. 8B illustrates, in a low level block diagram, logic 820 in one implementation of the output unit of FIG. 6B for computation of the amount of fluid served si out that is held in register 613, as per equation (18) in Addendum A. Logic 820 is similar in structure and function to logic 720 described above in reference to FIG. 7B, except that output quantities are used instead of input quantities.
FIG. 8C illustrates, in a low level block diagram, logic 850 in one implementation of the output unit of FIG. 6B for computation of the sum of low priority weights of flows with the ready signal asserted. Logic 850 is similar in structure and function to logic 750 described above in reference to FIG. 7E, except that a checker 752 k is not required because the ready signal is a single bit signal that directly controls operation of mux 851 k.
A number of control signals for use with logic in the input and output ports are generated as per the timing chart illustrated in FIG. 9A. FIG. 9B illustrates generation of these signals based on a phase count, by simply using a decoder to generate ten signals that are individually active in the respective ten sub-intervals of the current period. Therefore, if the current period lasts 10 clock cycles, then ten signals are generated (one per clock cycle), and each signal is active in a different subinterval. Each control signal that needs to be active in a particular subinterval is derived from a corresponding active signal from among the 10 active signals.
Some embodiments of the arbiter allocate bandwidth for low priority traffic as follows: (1) increment the used input port bandwidth (see FIG. 7B) and used output port bandwidth (FIG. 8B) by a value based on one or more of: (a) the leftover input port bandwidth, (b) the requested amount, and (c) the weight of the low priority flow from the input port (as illustrated by a “min” block 707 in FIG. 7A) (2) decrement the first counter for the low priority flow by the just-described increment value (see FIG. 7D), and (3) generate a served amount indicative of the just-described increment value (see FIG. 7A). The acts of (1) incrementing the used input port bandwidth, (2) decrementing the second counter and (3) generating the served amount may be repeated one or more times, to ensure that no bandwidth is left unused.
Numerous such modifications and adaptations of the embodiments described herein will be apparent to the skilled artisan in view of the disclosure.
For example, instead of transferring fixed-length cells, in an alternative embodiment, the cross-connect transfers variable-length packets. In such an alternative embodiment, instead of incrementing a flow at an input port by a fixed amount on arrival of a cell, the flow is incremented by a variable amount proportional to the length of the packet on arrival of the packet. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, instead of an arbiter of the type described herein controlling an electrical cross-connect switch, the arbiter may control an optical switch, and instead of time slots, bandwidth in the form of one or more wavelengths is assigned to each input port for transfer of traffic through the optical switch. Although in some embodiments a single processor is used in each simulated input port and each simulated output port of the arbiter, in other embodiments different processors may perform the individual acts of a method of the type described herein so that these processors together as a group perform such a method.
Moreover, some embodiments may have more than two counters associated with each flow that are maintained by an arbiter, in which case at least two counters are maintained in the manner described herein for the first counter and the second counter. Although in some embodiments the first counter (also called “fluid counter”) has greater resolution than the second counter (also called “discrete counter”), in other embodiments both counters may have the same resolution in which case the two counters are decremented differently: the second counter is decremented by a fixed amount that is larger than (e.g. one or two orders of magnitude larger than) the smallest amount by which the first counter is decremented.
Also, although described in the context of an arbiter, one or more structures of the arbiter and/or one or more acts of the method performed by the arbiter can be used in other devices. For example, a scheduler that schedules flow of traffic through a single port of a switch may perform the acts of (1) incrementing a pair of counters for a flow of traffic from an input port destined to an output port, in response to receipt of traffic at the input port, (2) decrementing a first counter in the pair of counters for each flow if the first counter is nonzero, (3) selecting a winning input port based at least partially on values of counters in the pair for at least one flow from the input port, and (4) generating a signal to transfer an amount of traffic from the winning input port, to the output port.
Numerous such modifications and adaptations of the embodiments described herein are encompassed by the attached claims.
Addendum A, Addendum B and Addendum C are integral portions of this detailed description, and are set forth below. Addendum A illustrates various principles for use in designing an arbiter of the type described herein. Addendum B provides an architectural specification for an arbiter designed based on the principles in Addendum A. Addendum C provides context for implementation of one example of an arbiter of the type described herein. In addition, the attached software appendix illustrates the construction and operation of an arbiter in accordance with the invention, in the form of a discrete event simulation.
Let rij be the bandwidth allocated to the flow of cells from the ith input port to the jth output port. If the port bandwidths are all equal to L and all the weights are equal, then fairness implies rij=L/N for all i and j in {1, 2, . . . , N}. We wish to extend the definition of fairness when the weights are not all equal and when port bandwidth are widely different.
A natural way of defining fairness is in terms of fluid flows. This is similar to the approach of defining (GPS) fairness for (weighted) service scheduling schemes of ATM multiplexers. Let ri(t) be the bandwidth received by the flow from the ith input port to the output port. Let wi be the weight assigned to the ith input port. Let B(t) denote the set of backlogged input ports at time t and L be the bandwidth of the output link. A scheduling scheme is said to be GPS fair if the set ri(t), 1≦i≦N is the unique solution to the following optimization problem: Minimize ( max i , j ∈ B ⁡ ( t ) ⁢ max t ≥ 0 ⁢  r i ⁡ ( t ) w i - r j ⁡ ( t ) w j  ) ( 1 )
There is a simple algorithm for computing the solution for the optimization problem (2). Increase the bandwidth, rij, allocated to the flow from the ith input port to the jth output port, for all i and j in {1, 2, . . . , N} by wijΔ, where Δ is a small amount, until one or more flows cannot be increased further because of port bandwidth constraint or because rij reached the source rate of the flow from the ith input port to the jth output port. Such a flow is called a saturated flow. Continue increasing the unsaturated flows until one or more of them becomes saturated. Iterate until all flows are saturated. The resulting set of rates, rij, is the solution to the optimization problem (2).
For each input-output pair (i, j), the FFTA has two counters: the discrete request counter dij and the fluid request counter, fij. When a request is received by the ith input port for the jth output port, both dij and fij are incremented by one cell.
FFTA simulates fluid flows from the input ports to the output ports according to the weights of the flows in the GPS fair manner described on page 21. For the ith input port, the FFTA grants to the jth output port whose discrete request backlog dij lags the most with the corresponding fluid request backlog, fij. And the selected dij is decremented by one cell.
To support two classes of services, high priority and low priority, we need four counters for each input-output pair: dij hp, fij hp, dij lp and dij lp. The discrete request counters assume only integer values, whereas the fluid request counters need to represent fractions of cells. Rather than using expensive floating point arithmetic for fluid request counters, integer counters can be used where a single unit represents a fraction, 1/R, of a cell. We will refer to R as the fluid resolution. If the discrete request counters need k bits, then the fluid request counters will need k+[log2 R] bits. A suitable value for R is 256, which means that the fluid request counters will need 8 bits more than the discrete request counters.
Each input-output pair also has two weights, wij hp and wij lp. The high priority weight, wij hp, specifies the bandwidth of the flow from the ith input port to the jth output port. It is specified as the fraction of cell per the inter-arbitration interval. The high priority class is a guaranteed bandwidth service class and there is no overbooking in this class. Hence, the high priority weights satisfy the following inequalities. ∑ i = 1 N ⁢ w ij h ⁢ ⁢ p ≤ a j out ( 7 ) and ∑ j = 1 N ⁢ w ij h ⁢ ⁢ p ≤ a i i ⁢ ⁢ n ( 8 )
The low priority service is an overbookable service where the wij lp's are dimensionless (non-negative) quantities. Roughly, the bandwidth received by a low priority flow from the ith input port to the jth output port is proportional to the weight wij lp but the exact amount of bandwidth received by the flow depends on several factors such as the total amount of high priority traffic, the port bandwidths and the amount of overbooking on the jth output port. Note that VCs are admitted so that there is no overbooking at the input ports.
The other quantities used by the FFTA are si in and si out. si in is the total amount of fluid transferred from the ith input port during the current inter-arbitration interval. Note that si in satisfies the bound: 0≦si in≦ai in. Similarly, sj out is the amount of fluid transferred to the jth output port during the current inter-arbitration interval and it satisfies the bound: 0≦si out≦ai out.
The structure of the FFTA is shown in FIG. 4, where hp_request(i,j) denotes the high priority request by the ith input port for access to the jth output port. Similarly, lp_request(i,j) denotes the low priority request by the ith input for the jth output port. The bus used to connect arbiter input units to the output units consists of three sub-buses. The single bit ready signal indicates that the input unit has (low priority) fluid available for the output unit. The [log2 R]-bit request bus indicates the amount of (low priority) fluid requested by the output unit to the input unit and the [log2 R]-bit serve bus indicates the amount of (low priority) fluid served by the input unit to the output unit.
The ith input unit contains the dij hp, dij lp, fij lp, fij lp for 1≦j≦N. It also contains si in and ai in. The jth output unit contains sj out and aj out. The weights wij hp and wij lp are accessible by both the ith input unit and the jth output unit.
Whenever the high (low) priority request signal to the ith input port for the jth output port is asserted, both dij hp, and fij hp (resp. dij lp, and fij lp) are incremented by one cell. Since one cell is equal to R units, the fluid counter is incremented by R units.
Every inter-arbitration interval, the FFTA performs two tasks in parallel. The first task transfers fluid from the input ports to the output ports and the second task computes grants by observing the differences between the discrete and fluid request counters. These tasks are done in parallel because grants can be computed based on the differences in fluid and discrete request backlogs in the previous inter-arbitration interval.
Table 2 shows the operations performed at each clock cycle within an inter-arbitration interval to transfer fluid from the input ports to the output ports. The high priority fluid can be transferred in one clock cycle whereas the transfer of low priority fluid, which is used to fill the leftover bandwidth proportional to the low priority weights, requires request-serve iterations. The output ports request for low priority fluid to the input ports and the input port serves low priority fluid to the requesting output ports. In Table 2, two low priority iterations are shown. The first iteration is done from clock cycle 3 to 6 and the second iteration is done from clock cycle 7 to 10. The details of the individual operations are given below.
In the sequel, the variable ρij denotes the amount of fluid requested by the jth output port to the ith input port via the request bus and σij denotes the amount of fluid served by the ith input unit for the jth output unit via the serve bus.
In the second clock cycle, the ith input port sets the serve bus connected to jth output unit to σij=min(wij hp, fij hp). The following operations are also performed in the second clock cycle:
The ith input performs the first two operations and the jth output port performs the last operation. Note that essentially, the amount of high priority fluid transferred from the ith input port to the jth output port is equal to the high priority weight, wij hp. The min( ) operation ensures that the amount of fluid transferred does not exceed the amount of fluid in the (i, j)th high priority fluid request counter fij hp. Also, note that, at the end of this cycle, si in≦ai in and sj out≦aj out because the inequalities (7) and (8) on page 24 are satisfied by the high priority weights.
In the third clock cycle, the ith input unit asserts the ready signal to the jth output unit, if (fij lp>0) and (si in<ai in). In other words, the ready signal is asserted if and only if the ith input unit has low priority fluid available for the jth output unit and the limit on the total amount of fluid that can be drained from the ith input port has not been reached. The jth output unit computes the sum of the low priority weights, Sj out, over all input units that have asserted the ready signal: S j out = ∑ i : ( f ij lp > 0 ) ⋀ ( s i i ⁢ ⁢ n < a i i ⁢ ⁢ n ) ⁢ w ij lp ( 12 )
Again, the first two operations are performed by the ith input unit and the last operation is performed by the jth output unit. Note the difference between these operations and the ones performed in the second clock cycle. In the second clock cycle, fij hp was decremented whereas in the sixth clock cycle, fij lp is decremented.
The clock cycles 3 to 6 perform a single iteration of the low priority fluid request-serve cycle. These steps are repeated in clock cycles 7 to 10 for the second iteration. If there are sufficient clock cycles available in the inter-arbitration interval a third iteration can also be done. The number of clock cycles per inter-arbitration interval is determined by the speed of the arbiter versus the clock speed. An arbiter operating at 2.5 Gbits/sec and clocked by a 155.52 MHz clock has 24 clock cycles per inter-arbitration interval.
In summary, the high priority fluid transfer is determined primarily by the high priority weight and the low priority fluid is transferred using an algorithm similar to the one described.
As already mentioned, the task of computing grants is performed in parallel to the task of transferring fluid described above. Each input unit (see FIG. 4) computes the grants by finding the output port with the largest difference between the discrete and fluid request counters. Consider the ith input unit. The jth output port is said to be eligible for winning if either d ij h ⁢ ⁢ p - f ij h ⁢ ⁢ p > R × i N ( 19 ) or d ij lp - f ij lp > R × i N ( 20 )
Note that an output port is made eligible at different time for each input port. Such staggered enabling minimizes the probability of burst of grants for the same output port to different input ports.
In other words, the winning output port and the winning priority pair, (jw, pw), maximize the difference between the discrete request and the fluid request backlog among all eligible output ports of the ith input port. The ith input port unit sends a grant to the ith input port for the jw output port and priority pw. Note that, to reduce hardware, the finding an eligible output port with the maximum difference can be done over a number of clock cycles.
1. Bandwidth controllability: Let wij hp (wij lp) be the high priority (low priority) weight for the flow from the ith input port to the jth output port. The bandwidth received by the high priority flow is (wij hp/WEIGHT_RESOLUTION*OC48_RATE). That is, each unit of the high priority weight represent an absolute bandwidth of (OC48_RATE/WEIGHT_RESOLUTION). A WEIGHT_RESOLUTION of 256 implies that the weights are 8-bit quantities. On the other hand, the bandwidth received by the low priority flow is ( w ij lp ∑ i ∈ A ⁢ ⁢ w ij lp * BW_AVAILABLE ⁢ _FOR ⁢ _LP ) .
The sum in the denominator is over all active input ports feeding low priority traffic to the output port and BW_AVAILABLE_FOR_LP is the output link bandwidth minus the bandwidth used by the high priority flows.
2. 100% Throughput: Simulation study showed that the FFTA provides 100% throughput under most conditions.
3. Facilitates Multi-QoS support: The FFTA is based on a flexible framework, which facilitates multi-QoS support
4. Facilitates Multicast and Bridging support: The flexible framework of the FFTA can be used to support multicasting and bridging without sacrificing throughput and without requiring any additional switch speedup nor additional hardware in the arbiter.
The FFTA simulates a fluid flow from the input ports to the output ports in such a way that the amount of fluid that flows from an input port to the output port satisfies the bandwidth requirement. The FFTA schedules grants so that the traffic flow tracks the simulated fluid flow as closely as possible. This is done by sending grants to the input-output pair whose packet flow lags the most with respect to the corresponding fluid flow.
Variables used by the FFTA include a number of weights. Let wij hp (wij lp) be the high priority (low priority) weight of the flow from the ith input to the jth output port. Let Ri out (Ri in) be the asynchronous bandwidth of the ith output (input) port. Then, as already described, the bandwidth received by the high priority flow is (wij hp/WEIGHT_RESOLUTION*OC48_RATE) and the bandwidth received by the low priority flow is ( w ij lp ∑ i ∈ A ⁢ ⁢ w ij lp * BW_AVAILABLE ⁢ _FOR ⁢ _LP ) .
A packet VOQ length counter is maintained by the FFTA as follows. Let pij hp (pij lp) be the length of the jth high (low) priority VOQ in the ith input port. pij hp (pij lp) is incremented whenever, the VOQC of the ith input port informs the arbiter of cell arrivals to its jth high (low) priority VOQ and it is decremented when a grant is sent to the ith input for the jth high (low) priority VOQ.
A fluid VOQ length counter is maintained by the FFTA as follows. Let fij hp (fij lp) be the length of the jth high (low) priority fluid VOQ in the ith input port. fij hp (fij lp) is incremented whenever, the VOQC of the ith input port informs the arbiter of cell arrivals to its jth high (low) priority VOQ. The fluid counter is decremented (by fractions of cells) during the update_fluid_queue_lengths( ) step of the FFTA algorithm described in the next section.
Amount of Service of Input and Output Ports are maintained by the FFTA as follows. Let si in (si out) be the amount of fluid cells transferred from (to) the ith input (output) port during the current arbitration cycle. These variables are reset to zero at the start of each arbitration cycle and is incremented every time fluid cells are transferred. Let ai in (ai out) be the maximum amount of fluid cells that can be transferred from (to) the ith input (output) port during each arbitration cycle. These variables are proportional to the number of asynchronous channels allocated to the port, viz., (WEIGHT_RESOLUTION*number_of_async_channels_allocated_to_the_port/MAX_NUMBER_OF_ASYNC_CHANNELS where the MAX_NUMBER_OF_ASYNC_CHANNELS is 60.
A variable called block fluid length is maintained by the FFTA as follows. Specifically, each output port of the arbiter has a variable called the “block fluid length.” This variable is incremented whenever an extraneous cell arrives to the port. Multicast cells, mate port cells of bridged VCs and cells that arrive when the output port buffer has exceeded its threshold are extraneous from the perspective of the arbiter, because these cells are not directly granted by the arbiter. To the arbiter, these cells appear as “background noise” and the arbiter works around them. That is, whenever, there is an extraneous cell, the arbiter impedes its rate of granting of low priority traffic as described below.
Service amount reduction is maintained by the FFTA as follows. pi out is an experimental variable associated with the ith output port. This value is set to (WEIGHT_RESOLUTION*sum of the multicast and mate port bridged flow to the port)/OC48_RATE. This amount is subtracted from ai out. This approach is to be used instead of the block fluid approach described above. The disadvantage of this approach is that low priority traffic cannot use the bandwidth allocated to the multicast and bridged VC, even when the latter is idle.
The data structures of the fluid flow tracking arbiter consists of variables associated with the input ports, the output ports and the input-output port pairs. In the pseudo-code shown below, the variables associated with the input port are shown as members of the stuck ARB_INPUT_PORT. Similarly, those associated with the output port and the input-output port pair are shown as members of the struct ARB_OUTPUT_PORT and struct ARB_INOUT_PORT, respectively. For example, each input port contains a boolean variable to indicate whether or not the input port is enabled or disabled, an integer variable to indicate the winning output port for the input port and variables to represent si it and ai in.
First of all, define the global constants, number of ports and the weight resolution, which is 8-bits.
The variables associated with the arbiter output ports are shown as members of the struct ARB_OUTPUT_PORT: These are the winning input port, ai out, si out, pi out and the block fluid length.
The variables associated with the arbiter input port are shown as members of the struct ARB_INPUT_PORT: These are the Boolean variable to indicate whether or not the input port is enabled. The input port is disabled if the cell queue at the input of the asynchronous crosspoint switch exceeds its threshold or if the grant queue exceeds its threshold. The winning output port, ai in and si in.
The variables associated with the arbiter input-output port pair are shown as members of the struct ARB_INOUT_PORT: These are wij hp, wij lp, the amount of (low priority) fluid cell requested by the output port to the input port, fij hp, pij hp, fij lp, pij lp.
An interface to the arbiter consists of member functions to set weights for the flows, inform the arbiter of cell arrivals to the VOQ, enable/disable input ports, enable/disable output ports, inform the arbiter of the asynchronous bandwidth of each port and functions to compute the winning output port for each input port. The arbiter also consists of several private member functions that are called by the public member functions. These functions will be described later when the public member functions are described.
Setting the weight of a flow (also called “input-output flow” may be performed via a public member function set_weight( ) which simply initializes the appropriate weight variable of the arbiter.
Informing the FFTA of cell arrivals to the VOQ may be done as follows. There are two types of cell arrival. A regular arrival increments the request counter of the input-output pair whereas a non regular arrival, which informs the arbiter of an extraneous cell arrival (cell arrival to the mate port of a bridged VC) is used to increment the block fluid length of the output port.
When a cell arrives to the multicast flows, the following function is used to introduce block fluid into all the output ports of the arriving multicast cell.
The following member function is used to set the service limit, ai in, of the input port. As already mentioned, this is proportional to the number of asynchronous channels allocated to the input port.
The following member function is used to set the service limit, ai out, of the output port. As already mentioned, this is proportional to the number of asynchronous channels allocated to the output port.
The following function is used to compute the grants. The caller supplies a pointer to an array of output ports and a pointer to an array of booleans. The function computes the winning output port for each of the input ports and whether or not the winner is high priority. This function is called every INTER_ARBITERATION_INTERVAL (e.g. every 12 cycles or 10 cycles depending on the implementation) and the result is used to send grants to the VOQC. The function works as follows: First the private member function update_fluid q_lens( ) is used to transfer appropriate amount of fluid cells from the input ports to the output ports. Then the private member function, find_output_port( ) is used to find the winning output port for each input port. If there are no winning output ports for an input port, this is indicated by −1. If there are winning output port for an input port, then the number of request is decremented by one.
The private member function update_fluid_q_lens( ) is shown below. It calls a series of other private functions. First the init_service( ) function is called to initialize, si in and si out to 0 for all the input and output ports. Then, the function transfer_hp_fluid( ) is called to transfer high priority fluid from the input ports to the output ports. The add_block_fluid( ) function is used to fill the remaining ai out with block fluid. Finally the functions make_lp_request( ) and serve_lp_request( ) are called a number of iterations to fill any remaining part of ai out with low priority fluid.
The transfer_hp_fluid( ) function simply transfers an amount delta from the ith input port to the jth output port and updates the variables, si in, si out and fij hp. Delta is simply equals to wij hp. However, since delta cannot exceed fij hp, (ai out−pi out−si out), (ai in−si in), delta is equal to the minimum of these four quantities.
The add_block_fluid( ) function transfers block fluid to the remaining ai out. That is, the output service limit is first filled with high priority fluid, then by block fluid and as will be shown any remaining part is filled with low priority fluid. Therefore, if there are sufficient amount of block fluid in the output port, then there will not be any room for the low priority fluid. This means that the low priority fluid is drained from the input port at slower rate and hence the rate at which the grants are issued to the low priority VOQ is less. As, already indicated, the feedback mechanism from the output port of the asynchronous switch is used to increment the block fluid of the arbiter output port.
Once the block fluid is introduced into the service quota of the arbiter output port, any remaining space is filled with low priority fluid. Consider the ith output port. Its remaining space (ai out−pi out−si out) is divided among the eligible input ports proportional to their low priority weights. An input port is eligible, if it is enabled, has fluid cells destined to the ith output port and its service quota is not used up: aj in>sj in. The outer loop of the member function make_lp_request( ) iterates through each of the output port The first inner loop of the function computes the sum of the low priority weights over all eligible input port: the sum of the weights for the ith output port is ∑ j ∈ E i ⁢ ⁢ w ji lp ,
Of course, if the jth input port is disabled, or if it does not have any low priority fluid or if the input ports service quota is used then the requested amount is 0.
The serve_lp_request( ) member function iterates through each of the arbiter input ports and computes the amount of fluid to be served to the requesting output ports. As in the make_lp_request( ) function, the first inner loop computes the sum of the low priority weights over all output ports with non-zero request to this input port. The second inner computes the amount of low priority fluid to be served to the output ports. The outer loop in the serve_lp_request( ) can be repeated to fill any remaining requests.
The function find_output_port( ) computes the winning output port and priority for each input port. The winning output port is the port with the largest difference between the cell queue and the fluid queue. The variable max_diff keeps track of the maximum difference. Note that, an output port is only considered if the difference between the cell queue and fluid queue is greater than some positive threshold. The value of the threshold is proportional to the index of the input port. The reason for this staggered enabling is to minimize burst of grants for an input port.
Floating point quantities may be avoided in the FFTA as follows. In the algorithm described above, ideally, floating point variables be used for the weights and fluid counters. However, the resulting hardware cost can be avoided by using integer quantities with sufficient resolution. A suitable resolution is 256 or 8-bits. Thus, the smallest high priority bandwidth that can be allocated is 1/256 of the OC48 rate=10 Mbits/sec.
The hardware structure of FFTA is shown in FIG. 4. It consists of a complete interconnection of 24 input units to 24 output units. The interfaces of the input and output units are shown in FIG. 3. The low priority fluid transfer iterations are done as follows: The ith input unit asserts the ready signal, whenever it is enabled, it has fluid cells destined to the output port and its service amount, si in<ai in. The jth output unit computes the request amount and requests the input units that are ready. The inputs compute the served amount and inform the output units that made non-zero request. As stated before, the amount served does not exceed, the amount requested nor does it exceed the amount of current fluid backlog. An input unit with disable asserted will not assert the ready signal. Similarly, an output unit with disable asserted will not request any service. The disable signals are asserted by the asynchronous crosspoint switch in a fashion similar to the current arbiter. The phase input to the input and output units inform, which phase of the algorithm is the current phase.
To compute the request amount, in one clock cycle, each output unit needs 24 8-bit multipliers and a single divider. Similarly, the input unit also requires 24 8-bit multipliers and a single divider. (These multipliers can possibly be shared, since they do not compute simultaneously.)
The multiplier unit computes the 8-bit quantity, r (request) from the three 8-bit quantities f (free amount), w (weight), and s (sum of weights). These quantities satisfy the following constraints.
To support bridging and multicasting, each input port needs some additional logic to keep track of the output ports to which, a copy of the cells has been sent. The input port needs to be able to hold the routing map and clear the bits as copies of the head of the line cell is sent to their output ports. As before, the round robin scheduler of each output port operates independently. If more than one output selects an input port, then the input port selects a subset of the output ports to which the head-of-the-line (HOL) cell is destined and sends copies of the HOL cell simultaneously to the subset of the output ports.
In one specific implementation, an arbiter of the type described herein has 24 input units and 24 output units, and keeps track of the length of each of the 24×24=576 VOQs using 576 counters for each priority. Since the arbiter supports two priorities (also called QoS classes), the arbiter uses 1152 registers to keep track of the VOQ lengths. By use of weights, the arbiter provides linear bandwidth controllability. For high-priority flows, the bandwidth received by the flow must never be less than the specified bandwidth. The high-priority flows are never overbooked. For the low priority flows, the bandwidth received by a flow is proportional to the specified bandwidth (in the form of weights). At least two unicast QoS classes may be supported in such an implementation. Including the multicast/bridging, the following classes are supported: a) Multicast/Bridge with Guaranteed Bandwidth and Delay b) Unicast Guaranteed Bandwidth and Delay and c) Unicast Weighted Best Effort. Furthermore, at least 2-way bridging (multicast) of not necessarily adjacent ports is provided for redundancy support. Specifically 2-way bridging is required for supporting unidirectional path switched ring (UPSR). The arbiter is scalable to higher speeds: one embodiment has a switch capacity of 50 Gbits/sec and another embodiment's capacity is 200 Gbits/sec. The arbiter has low hardware complexity and low power requirements because it is implementable in: a) 0.13 micron ASIC process or smaller, with b) maximum core clock frequency<=155 Mhz, and c) die area≦14 mm_sq.
This implementation of the arbiter is used with a passive backplane across which the line cards (input and output ports) and switching fabric cards (arbiter and cross-connect) are mounted. The backplane does not contain any active components so as to reduce the probability of it being a single point of failure. The line cards contain the ingress and egress network processors which perform such tasks as policing, per-virtual connection (VC) queuing, per-VC accounting, scheduling and shaping. In the case of virtual output queued switches, the line cards also contain the input buffers that implement virtual output queues (voqs), and controllers for the voqs that communicate with the arbiter to indicate arrival of traffic and receive grants for transfer of the traffic.
Specifically, the arbiter and the crosspoint switch are placed in the switching fabric card. The physical separation of the arbiter and the voqs has important implication for the switch design. The communication via the backplane is expensive because these signals have to be driven by high current transceivers to reduce signal degradation. Hence, the links between the line units and the switching fabric are only a few serial links and suffer some delay. If the arbiter grants are used to control the crosspoint switch directly, then the delay can reduce throughput of the switch.
A solution to this problem is to enhance a cross-connect of the type shown in FIG. 1A with one or more round-robin schedulers. As shown in FIG. 1A, small FIFOs are located at the input and output ports of the crosspoint switch. In the enhanced version of the cross-connect, the set of signals exchanged between an input unit and an output unit include the following three signals. A cell available signal from the input unit informs the output unit that the HOL cell in its FIFO is destined to the output unit. A select signal from the output unit informs the input unit that the output unit has selected the input unit. A multi-bit cell bus in the cross-connect, from the input unit to the output unit transfers the cell.
Each output unit of such an enhanced cross-connect also has a simple independent scheduler which serves the input units that have asserted the cell available signal in a round-robin fashion. An arbiter of the type described above does not directly control such an enhanced cross-connect. The arbiter simply receives indications of cell arrivals from voqs in the line unit and issues grants to them. Therefore, the arbiter is “loosely coupled” to the enhanced cross-connect. The arbiter only receives signals from the enhanced cross-connect indicating the fill levels of the FIFOs. If the FIFO levels exceed some set threshold, the arbiter slows down issuing grants to the congested ports. The loose coupling of an arbiter of the type described herein with a cross-connect that is enhanced with round-robin schedulers works well in practice. As noted elsewhere herein, instead of a cross-connect, any other switch may be used with such an arbiter and such other switch may be enhanced as described above.

is disclosed, wherein Ar and R are selected so that the aromatic polyanhydride hydrolyzes to form a therapeutic salicylate, another non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, an antifibrotic aminobenzoate, or a vasoconstricting phenylethanolamine. Implantable medical devices, such as scaffolding implants for tissue reconstruction, drug delivery systems prepared from the aromatic polyanhydrides, as well as therapeutic dosage forms and treatment methods are also disclosed.
The present invention relates to biocompatible aromatic polyanhydrides having improved degradation properties and processability and unique therapeutic properties. In particular, the present invention relates to aromatic polyanhydrides produced from ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides. The present invention also relates to ortho-substituted bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acids useful in the preparation of the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention.
Biocompatible and biodegradable aromatic polyanhydrides are disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,757,128 and 4,997,904. However, unless incorporated into a copolymer containing a more hydrophilic monomer, such as sebacic acid, the aromatic polyanhydrides of the prior art have slow degradation times as well as relatively insoluble degradation products. A major drawback to the prior art aromatic polyanhydrides is their insolubility in most organic solvents.
Biocompatible and biodegradable aromatic polyanhydrides prepared from para-substituted bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acids are disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,540. The para-substitution pattern results in higher melt and glass transition temperatures and decreased solubility, thus ultimately making these para-substituted polymers difficult to process.
A need exists for biocompatible and biodegradable aromatic polyanhydrides having improved degradation and processing properties, as well as therapeutic utilities.
This need is met by the present invention. It has now been discovered that the preparation of aromatic polyanhydrides from ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides disrupts the crystallinity of the resulting polymer, enhancing solubility and processability, as well as degradation properties. Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, an aromatic polyanhydride is provided having a repeated unit within the structure of Formula I:
wherein Ar is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring and R is a difunctional organic moiety substituted on each Ar ortho to the anhydride group. Ar and R are preferably selected so that the hydrolysis products of the polyanhydrides have a chemical structure resembling pharmaceutically-active materials, particularly salicyclates such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory naphthyl or phenyl propionates such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and the like, or other aromatic anti-inflammatory compounds such as indomethacin, indoprofen, and the like. In particular, Ar is preferably a phenyl group and R is preferably -Z1-R1-Z1- in which R1 is a difunctional moiety and both Z1's are independently either an ether, ester, amide, anhydride, carbonate, urethane or sulfide groups. R1 is preferably an alkylene group containing from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, or a group with 2-20 carbon atoms having a structure selected from (—CH2—CH2—O—)m, (—CH2—CH2—CH2—O—)m, and (—CH2—CHCH3—O—)m.
Ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides of the present invention are novel and non-obvious intermediate compounds having utility in the preparation of the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention. Therefore, according to another aspect of the present invention, ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides are provided having the structure of Formula II:
wherein Ar and R, and the preferred species thereof, are the same as described above with respect to Formula I and R is substituted on each Ar ortho to the anhydride group.
The present invention also includes ortho-substituted bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acids, which are novel and non-obvious intermediate compounds having utility in the preparation of ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides. Therefore, according to another aspect of the present invention, an ortho-substituted bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acid is provided having the structure of HOOC—Ar—R—Ar—COOH, wherein Ar and R, and the preferred species thereof, are the same as described above with respect to Formula I, and R is substituted on each Ar ortho to each carboxylic acid group.
The aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention meet the need for moldable biocompatible biodegradable polymers. Therefore, the present invention also includes-implantable medical devices containing the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention. When Ar and R are selected so that the aromatic polyanhydride hydrolyzes to form therapeutic salicyclates, the aromatic polyanhydrides have potential uses as biocompatible, biodegradable scaffolding implants for tissue reconstruction in which the degradation products have anti-thrombogenic qualities.
In addition, the aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form therapeutic salicyclates have potential uses as anti-inflammatory dosage forms, including dosage forms for oral administration, particularly in the treatment of digestive disorders, including bowel disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, and the like. Ar and R may also be selected so that the aromatic polyanhydrides hydrolyze to form therapeutic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory naphthyl and phenyl propionates that resemble compounds such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and the like, and other aromatic anti-inflammatory compounds such as indomethacin, indoprofen, and the like.
Therefore, the present invention also includes a method for treating inflammation by administering to a patient in need thereof a quantity of the aromatic polyanhydride of the present invention in which Ar and R are selected so that aromatic polyanhydride hydrolyzes to form therapeutic salicyclates at the site of inflammation in an amount effective to relieve the inflammation. The aromatic polyanhydrides may be administered orally. This is particularly useful in the treatment of digestive inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel disease, because the therapeutic salicyclates are formed in the gastro-intestinal tract of the patient. Methods for treating inflammation with aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form therapeutic naphthyl or phenyl propionates are included in the present invention as well, as well as methods for treating inflammtion with aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form indomethacin or indoprofen.
The present invention therefore also includes anti-inflammatory oral dosage forms consisting essentially of the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention that hydrolyze to form therapeutic salicyclates or naphthyl or phenyl propionates, or indomethacin or indoprofen, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The oral dosage forms may further include a biologically or pharmaceutically active compound to be co-administered with the therapeutic degradation products.
Ar and R may also be selected so that the aromatic polyanhydrides hydrolyzes to form therapeutic antiulcerative drugs such as rosaprostol, therapeutic antifibrotic aminobenzoates and therapeutic vasoconstricting phenylethanolamines and vasoconstricting drugs such as midodrine. Therefore, the present invention also includes a method for therapeutic treatment by administering to a patient in need thereof a quantity of the aromatic polyanhydride of the present invention in which Ar and R are selected so that aromatic polyanhydride hydrolyzes to form rosaprostol, antifibrotic aminobenzoates, vasoconstricting phenylethanolamines and midodrine. The present invention also includes oral dosage forms consisting essentially of the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention in which Ar and R are selected so that the aromatic polyanhydrides hydrolyze to form rosaprostol, antifibrotic aminobenzoates, vasoconstricting phenylethanolamines and midodrine.
In another embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic polyanhydrides are combined with a quantity of biologically or pharmaceutically active compound sufficient for effective site-specific or systemic drug delivery as described by Gutkowsky et al., J. Biomater. Res. 29, 811-21 (1995) and Hoffman, J. Controlled Release, 6, 297-305 (1987). The biologically or pharmaceutically active compound may be physically admixed, embedded or dispersed in the polymer matrix. Alternatively, derivatives of biologically and pharmaceutically active compounds can be attached to repeating units of the polymers of the present invention by covalent bonds linked to an Ar ring or an R organic moiety. This provides for sustained release of the biologically or pharmaceutically active compound.
Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for site-specific or systemic drug delivery by implanting in the body of a patient in need thereof an implantable drug delivery device containing a therapeutically effective amount of a biologically or pharmaceutically active compound in combination with an aromatic polyanhydride of the present invention.
A more complete appreciation of the invention and many more other intended advantages can be readily obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments and claims, which disclose the principles of the invention and the best modes which are presently contemplated for carrying them out.
The present invention provides aromatic polyanhydrides with improved degradation properties and processability having repeating units with the structure of Formula I in which Ar and R are the same as described above with respect to Formula I. R preferably has a structure of -Z1-R1-Z1-, in which R1 is a difunctional organic moiety and both Z1's are difunctional moieties independently selected from ethers, esters, amides, anhydrides, urethanes, carbamates, carbonates, sulfides, and the like. R1 may be an alkylene group containing from 1 to 20, and preferably 6, carbon atoms, or R1 may be a group having from 2 to 30, and preferably 6, carbon atoms having a structure selected from (—CH2—CH2—O—)m, (—CH2—CH2—CH2—O—)m, and (—CH2—CHCH3—O—)m, or R1 may have the structure -R2-Z2-R3-, wherein R2 and R3 are independently alkylene groups containing from 1 to 19 carbon atoms or groups having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms having a structure selected from (—CH2—CH2—O—)m, (—CH2—CH2—CH2—O—)m, and (—CH2—CHCH3—O—)m, and Z2 is selected from the difunctional moieties described above with respect to Z1.
Ar may be an alkylaryl group, in which a difunctional organic moiety is positioned between each anhydride carbonyl group and the corresponding aromatic ring. Preferably, however, each carbonyl group is directly substituted on the corresponding aromatic ring.
Preferred polymers of the present invention have repeating units with the structure of Formula I in which Ar is a phenyl ring and R is selected from -Z1-(-CH2-)n-Z1-, -Z(-CH2—CH2—O-)m-Z1-, -Z(-CH2—CH2—CH2—O-)m-Z1-, and -Z(-CH2—CHCH3—O-)m-Z1-, wherein Z1 is an ether, ester or amide group and n is from 1 to 20 inclusive, and preferably is 6, and m is selected so that R has from 2 to 20, and preferably 6, carbon atoms.
The aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention may be prepared by the method described in Conix, Macromol. Synth., 2, 95-99 (1996), in which dicarboxylic acids are acetylated in an excess of acetic anhydride at reflux temperatures followed by melt condensation of the resulting carboxylic acid anhydride at 180° C. for 2-3 hours. The resulting polymers are isolated by precipitation into diethyl ether from methylene chloride. The described process is essentially the conventional method for polymerizing bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acid anhydrides into aromatic polyanhydrides.
Aromatic polyanhydrides in accordance with the present invention have weight average molecular weights of at least about 1500 daltons, up to about 35,000 daltons, calculated by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) relative to narrow molecular weight polystyrene standards.
The aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention are produced from orth-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides having the structure of Formula II in which Ar, R and the preferred species thereof are the same as described above with respect to Formula I. As noted above, ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acid anhydrides are prepared by acetylation of the corresponding ortho-substituted bis-aromatic carboxylic acids in an excess of acetic anhydride at reflux temperatures. The dicarboxylic acids have the structure of Formula III, wherein Ar, R and the preferred species thereof are the same as described above with respect to Formula I.
The dicarboxylic acids are prepared by reacting a stiochiometric ratio of aromatic carboxylic acid having the structure Z3-Ar—COOH and a compound having a structure Z4-R-Z4 wherein Ar is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic ring on which Z3 is substituted ortho to the carboxylic acid group, R is a difunctional organic moiety and Z3 and Z4 are functional groups selected to provide the linkage desired between the difunctional organic moiety and the two aromatic rings.
Suitable Z3 and Z4 functional groups, and the manner in which they may be reacted to produce the bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acids of the present invention, may be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. For example, for aromatic polyanhydrides having the structure of Formula I in which Ar is a phenyl group and R is —O—(CH2—)6—O—, the ortho-substituted bis-aromatic dicarboxylic acid starting material may be prepared by reacting o-salicylic acid with 1,6-dibromohexane.
The aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention can be isolated by known methods commonly employed in the field of synthetic polymers to produce a variety of useful articles with valuable physical and chemical properties. The new polymers can be readily processed by solvent casting to yield films, coatings, dishes and sponges with different geometric shapes for design of various medical implants, and may also be processed by compression molding and extrusion. Medical implant applications include the use of aromatic polyanhydrides to form shaped articles such as vascular graphs and stents, bone plates, sutures, implantable sensors, implantable drug delivery devices, stents for tissue regeneration, and other articles that decompose harmlessly within a known time period.
The polymers of the present invention include aromatic polyanhydrides having a repeating unit with the structure of Formula I in which Ar and R are selected to provide aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form therapeutically useful salicyclates. As noted above, the salicyclates may be employed to treat inflammation, particularly digestive inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disorders. Thus, implantable or ingestible drug delivery devices of the present invention include oral dosage forms consisting essentially of the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention that hydrolyze to form therapeutic salicyclates, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The oral dosage forms function to deliver salicyclates to the site of inflammation, either directly, or by being absorbed into the bloodstream from the digestive tract. The salicyclates may be supplemented with other therapeutic agents in the polymer matrix.
Ar and R may also be selected so that the aromatic polyanhydrides hydrolyze to form therapeutic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory phenyl and naphthyl propionates, indomethacin and indoprofen. The identification of Ar and R moieties that provide aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form such therapeutic anti-inflammatory compounds can also be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.
Ar and R may also be selected so that the aromatic polyanhydrides hydrolyze to form other therapeutic compounds. For example, Ar and R may be selected to provide an aromatic polyanhydride that hydrolyzes to form the antiulcerative drug rosaprostol. Ar and R may also be selected to provide aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form antifibrotic aminobenzoates. Ar and R may further be selected to provide polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form the vasoconstricting drug midodrine, as well as vasoconstricting phenylethanolamines. Again, the identification of Ar and R moieties that provide aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form such therapeutic compounds can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation.
Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for oral administration are well known and include diluents such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose, glycine, and the like, lubricants such as silica, talc, stearic acid and salts thereof, and the like, binders such as magnesium aluminum silicate, starches such as corn starch, methyl cellulose, and the like, and disintegrating agents such as starches, agar, and the like, as well as dyestuffs, flavors and sweeteners. The dosage forms are manufactured in a manner that is in itself well known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, granulating or dragee-making processes.
The quantity of aromatic polyanhydride that hydrolyzes to form an amount of therapeutic salicyclate effective to relieve inflammation can be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. The quantity essentially corresponds stiochiometrically to the amount of salicyclate known to produce an effective treatment. Oral dosage forms of aromatic polyanhydrides that hydrolyze to form other therapeutic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds and other therapeutic compounds are prepared and administered in a similar manner.
The ortho-substituted aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention exhibit desirable adhesion to cell cultures. The disruption of crystallinity is believed to improve the attachment and growth of cells and may facilitate specific interactions with proteins, peptides and cells. The aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention are thus useful as scaffolding implants for tissue reconstruction. The polymer surfaces may also be modified by simple chemical protocols to attach specific peptides or to immobilize proteins to elicit selective cellular responses in tissue engineering applications or in implant design.
Controlled drug delivery systems may also be prepared, in which a biologically or pharmaceutically active agent is physically embedded or dispersed into the polymeric matrix, physically admixed with, or covalently bonded to the aromatic polyanhydride. Covalent bonding is accomplished by providing an aromatic polyanhydride having reactive functional groups on one or more Ar groups or R moieties and reacting the polyanhydride with a derivatized or underivatized biologically or pharmaceutically active compound capable of reacting with the functional group on the aromatic polyanhydride to form a covalent bond. Thus, biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds may be linked to aromatic polyanhydrides by means of ester groups, amide groups, and the like.
Examples of biologically or pharmaceutically active compounds suitable for the use in the present invention include acyclovir, cephradrine, malphalan, procaine, ephedrine, adriamicin, daunomycin, plumbagin, atropine, quinine, digoxin, quinidine, biologically active peptides, chlorin e6, cephadrine, cephalothin, penicillin IV, nicotinic acid, chemodeoxycholic acid, chlorambucil, and the like. Biologically active compounds, for the purposes of the present invention, are additionally defined as including cell mediators, biologically active ligands, and the like. The compounds are covalently bonded to the aromatic polyanhydride by methods well understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Drug delivery compounds may also-be formed by physically blending the biologically or pharmaceutically active compound to be delivered with the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention using conventional techniques well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
The following non-limiting examples set forth hereinbelow illustrate certain aspects of the invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise noted and all temperatures are in degrees Celsius. Except for acetic anhydride and ethyl ether (Fisher Scientific), all solvents and reagents were obtained from Aldrich Chemical. All solvents were HPLC grade. All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purified by distillation or recrystallization.
All compounds were characterized by a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Infrared spectroscopy was performed on an AT1 Mattson Genesis (M100) FTIR Spectrophotometer. Samples were prepared by solvent casting on NaCl plates. 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy was obtained on a Varian 200 MHz or Varian 400 MHz spectrometer in solutions of CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with solvent as the internal reference.
GPC was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Advanced LC Sample Processor (ISS 200) with PE Series 200 LC Pump and a PE Series LC Refractive Index Detector to determine molecular weight and polydispersity. The data analysis was carried out using Turbochrom 4 software on a DEC Celebris 466 computer. Samples were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and eluted through a mixed bed column (PE PL gel, 5 μm mixed bed) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Samples (about 5 mg/mL) were dissolved into the tetrahydrofuran and filtered using 0.5 μm PTFE syringe filters prior to column injection. Molecular weights were determined relative to narrow molecular weight polystyrene standards (Polysciences, Inc.).
Thermal analysis was performed on a Perkin-Elmer system consisting of a TGA 7 thermal gravimetric analyzer equipped with PE AD-4 autobalance and Pyris 1 DSC analyzer. Pyris software was used to carry out data analysis on a DEC Venturis 5100 computer. For DSC, an average sample weight of 5-10 mg was heated at 10° C./min. at a 30 psi flow of N2. For TGA, an average sample weight of 10 mg was heated at 20° C./min under a 8 psi flow of N2. Sessile drop contact angle measurements were obtained with an NRL Goniometer (Rame-hart) using distilled water. Solutions of polymer in methylene chloride (10% wt/vol.) were spun-coated onto glass slips, at 5,000 rpm for 30 seconds.
To a mixture of salicylic acid (77.12 g, 0.5580 mole) and distilled water (84 mL) sodium hydroxide (44.71 g, 1.120 mole) was added. The reaction was brought to reflux temperature before 1,6-dibromohexane (45.21 g, 0.2790 mole) was added drop-wise. Reflux was continued for 23 hours after which additional sodium hydroxide (11.17 g, 0.2790 mole) was added. The mixture was refluxed for 16 more hours, cooled, filtered, and washed with methanol. The yield-was 48.8%.
The dicarboxylic acid of Example I was acetylated in an excess of acidic anhydride at reflux temperature. The resulting monomer was precipitated from methylene chloride into an excess of diethyl ether. The yield was 66.8%.
The monomer of Example II was polymerized in a melt condensation performed at 180° C. for 3 hours under vacuum in a reaction vessel with a side arm. The polymerization vessel was flushed with nitrogen at frequent intervals. The polymer was isolated by precipitation into diethyl ether from methylene chloride. The yield was quantitative.
All compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, GPC, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis, contact angle measurements, UV spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, elemental analysis and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
The o-CPH monomer was polymerized by melt polycondensation for 60 minutes at temperatures ranging from 100° to 300° C. Analysis of the resulting polymers by GPC indicated that the highest molecular weight, coupled with the lowest polydispersity index occurred at 260° C.
The poly(o-CPH) was generally soluble in methylene chloride and chloroform, while the poly(p-CPH) was not. The poly(o-CPH) was slightly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, acetone and ethyl acetate.
Disks of poly(o-CPH), poly(p-CPH) and, as a reference, poly(lactic acid glycolic acid) were prepared and placed in 0.1 phosphate buffer solution at 37° C. for 4 weeks. The degradation media was replaced periodically. The degradation profile was linear up to three weeks time.
In currently used polyanhydride systems, the aromatic groups are para-substituted. This substitution pattern results in higher melt and glass transition temperatures and decreased solubility, thus ultimately making these para-substituted polymers difficult to process.
Poly(o-CPH), unlike poly(p-CPH), has both a lower melting point (65° C. vs. 143° C.) and glass transition temperature (35° C. vs. 47° C.). It is also possible to solution cast poly(o-CPH) using low-boiling solvents whereas poly(p-CPH) is relatively insoluble in most organic and aqueous solvents. This structural modification gives a polymer whose hydrolysis products are chemically similar to aspirin. Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory agent derived from salicylic acid, which is one of the reagents used to synthesize the inventive polyanhydrides. Therefore, the degradation products of this polymer may actually aid in patient recovery. Because of pliability and ease of processing, the aromatic polyanhydrides of the present invention have great potential as polymer scaffolds for wound healing.
1,3-dibromopropane (14.7 mL, 0.145 mole) was added to a mixture of salicylic acid (40.0 g, 0.290 mole), distilled water (44 mL) and sodium hydroxide (23.2 g, 0.580 mole) using the method described in Example I. After 4 hours, additional sodium hydroxide (5.79 g, 0.145 mole) was added to the reaction mixture. Reflux was continued for another 4 hours, after which the mixture was cooled, filtered and washed using the methods described in Example I. The yield was 37.7%
The dicarboxylic acid of Example IV was acetylated using the methods of Example II. The acetylated dicaboxylic acid was then polymerized using the methods described in Example III. The resulting polymer had a Mw of 8,500 daltons and a polydispersity of 2.3.
Contact angle measurements on solvent-cast films demonstrated that the hexyl chain of the polymer of Example III increased the surface hydrophobicity relative to the shorter propyl chain of the polymer of Example V. A comparison of thermal characteristics emphasized the effects of lengthening the alkyl chain. In particular, the polymer of Example III has a Tg of 34° C. and a Td of 410° C., while the polymer of Example V had a Tg of 50° C. and a Td of 344° C. Thus, the hexyl chain decreased the glass transition temperature (Tg) relative to the propyl chain, reflecting the increased flexibility of the polymer chain. The opposite trend was observed for decomposition temperatures (Td), with the longer alkyl chain increasing the Td.
Optimum polycondensation conditions were determined for the polymer of Example III. Optimum conditions were defined as those that yielded a crude polymer with the highest molecular weight and highest Tg. Higher reaction temperatures decreased the Mw values (measured by GPC) with a concurrent increase in polydispersity. As expected for a condensation polymerization, longer reaction times yielded polymers with higher molecular weights. However, over longer reaction times, there appeared a subsequent decrease in Tg. Based on these results, the optimum conditions were defined as temperatures of 220° C. for 150 minutes under a vacuum.
The initial synthesis of poly(anhydride-ester)dicarboxylic acid monomers was attempted using the same methodology used for the poly(anhydride-ether)dicarboxylic monomers of Example III. It was found, however, that the reactivity of the phenol was enhanced by benzylation of the carboxylic acid group. In addition, the solubility of benzyl salicylate in organic media increased the ability of the reaction to move forward.
Thus, benzyl salicylate (1.530 g, 6.720 mmole) and distilled tetrahydrofuran were combined under an inert atmosphere in a reaction flask. An ice-salt bath was placed under the reaction flask and the addition of 60% sodium hydride (0.4840 g, 12.10 mmole) followed. After one hour, sebacoyl chloride (0.7850 g, 3.280 mmole) was added drop-wise to the 0° C. reaction mixture. After 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was vacuum filtered, the filtrate collected and the solvent removed to reveal to yield the free carboxylate as a white solid residue. Purification was performed using a chromatron with ethyl acetate/methylene chloride (20/80) as the solvent system. The yield was 43%.
To remove the benzyl protecting groups, the 1,8-bis[(benzylcarboxy)carboxyphenyl]octane dicarboxylic acid ester of Example VI (0.06000 g, 0.9620 mmole) was dissolved in methylene chloride in a reaction flask (60.00 mL). The catalyst Pd—C (10%, 1.200 g) was added to the reaction flask. After 30 minutes, the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was filtered and the solvent removed to yield the free dicarboxylic acid as a white solid residue which was recrystallized using petroleum ether and methylene chloride. The yield was 45%.
The dicarboxylic acid was acetylated using the methods described in Example II and the acetylated dicarboxylic acid was then polymerized using the methods described in Example III. The resulting polymer had a Mw of 3,000 daltons and a polydispersity of 1.40.
Subsequent polymerizations yielded polymers with MY's ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 daltons with corresponding polydispersities of approximately 1.40.
The poly(anhydride esters) of Example VII were compression molded into circular discs and placed in phosphate buffered saline solution under acidic, neutral and basic conditions. Over the course of a three-week degradation study, the polymers in the acidic and neutral solutions showed no observable changes, whereas the polymer in the basic media showed significant morphological changes over time.
The 1,8-bis(o-dicarboxyphenyl)octane of Example II was copolymerized with 1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane using the methods described in Example III. In an in vivo mouse study, each mouse was implanted with 2 polymers, the copolymer of Example VIII and poly(1,6-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy)hexane). Each polymer was compression molded for 1 to 5 minutes at 1 to 20 K psi depending on the thickness of polymer needed. The polymer was placed under the palatal gingival mucosa adjacent to the first maxillary molars. The mice were sacrificed at 1, 4 and 10 day intervals and demonstrated the biocompatibility an biodegradability in vivo of the polymers of the present invention, with salicylic acid being released upon degradation, via hydrolysis of the polymer backbone.

PYONGYANG, North Korea — North Korea says the US should carefully consider the fate of the North Korea-US summit, in view of what it calls “provocative military disturbances with South Korea,” North Korea’s state news agency reported early Wednesday local time.
The warning comes as KCNA reported North Korea has suspended talks with South Korea because of a joint military drill conducted by South Korea and the US.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert defended joint US-South Korean military exercises Tuesday and said the US had not heard of any disruptions to either the planned exercises or the upcoming summit.
While media reports were just emerging as she took the briefing room podium, Nauert said, “We have not heard anything from that government or the government of South Korea to indicate that we would not continue conducting these exercises or that we would not continue planning for our meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un next month.”
“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” she cautioned to reporters. “This news just came out. We need to verify it to get additional information on that but we’re going forward in planning our meetings next month.”
A senior administration official told CNN that President Donald Trump has been alerted to the warning about the fate of the June 12 summit in Singapore and that the White House is preparing a response.
However, the White House was caught off guard by the reports, according to aides. One official affirmed the State Department’s assertion that it has received no information from Pyongyang about the status of the talks.
Meetings are underway now between White House officials, the National Security Council and Defense Department, the official said.
The KCNA report said the Max Thunder 2018 air combat drill was against the Panmunjom declaration — signed last month between the Koreas — wherein they agreed to cease all hostile acts against each other.
Back in March, when South Korea’s national security adviser told reporters at the White House that Kim had invited Trump to meet, he also said that Kim “understands that the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue.”

The Canton Public Library began in 1874 when Mr. Frank Webster, and other members of the Grand Army of the Republic, requested from the Town the amount of $500 to purchase books. This appropriation was to furnish a reading room established in 1873 in the Grand Army Hall on Washington and Church Street where Mr. Webster served as a voluntary Librarian collecting books donated by the townspeople. The request was granted with the stipulation that the books remain the property of the town for free use by the inhabitants. On June 6th the reading room became known as the Canton Public Library. A small agricultural library was absorbed in it. Bequests from the estates of George E. Downes and later Miss Caroline T. Downes provided the library with annual trust income of $350. The remainder of its support was from taxation, approximately $1,000 per year.
On completion of the Town Hall in 1877, the Canton Public Library opened in that building with $1500 appropriated. A catalogue was printed in 1883, and three or more supplements were later issued, before a card catalogue was established in 1895.
By 1898 the library held some 9100 volumes, circulating 19,073 volumes to borrowers. Patrons of the library were allowed a second library card to borrow non-fiction titles. The library was open on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 2 to 6 p.m. and 7:30 to 9 p.m. The town's population was 4,636.
The present building and grounds were bequested to the Town of Canton by Mr. and Mrs. Augustus Hemenway Canton philanthropists in 1901 "in consideration of [the] desire to promote the study of Science, Literature and Art in the Town of Canton, and for other good and valuable considerations...". Designed after the "Harvard" or "Old English bond" style it was built by architects Winslow and Bigelow for $70,000. On July 6, 1902, its doors were opened to the public.
In 1962 the town voted $261,175 for an addition of approximately 10,000 square feet brought the building to its present dimensions of 17,000 square feet.
In 1979 a building study was conducted and plans drawn for another expansion. The program proved overly ambitious for the economic times and as the needs and goals of the library changed, the plans were eventually set aside.
In 1986 the library joined with area public libraries to cooperate in automation and resource sharing. In 1988, the Old Colony Library Network was incorporated. After an effort with an unsuccessful library automation vendor, the Canton Library began circulating materials on line in April 1991. By this time, all cataloging was being done through the network database, and by Summer 1993, the remaining subject portion of the card catalog was removed from service.
There were 2 needed areas of change were projected for the 1990's. The first is the expansion of informational resources through telecommunications and other electronic means. Secondly, an expansion of the facility, particularly incorporating the changing service roles of the library. A space needs analysis, as part of a municipal study, was conducted in 1995 which determined that an increase in useful space of at least 50% was needed.
Access to the Internet developed throughout the nineties provided new challenges and opportunities for tremendously expanded services. Membership in the Old Colony Library Network (OCLN), as well as the South Eastern Massachusetts Library System (SEMLS) provided the advantages of group purchasing for authoritative on-line databases. The State of Massachusetts also provided statewide access to core periodical database services.
A building program based on needs and goals identified in strategic planning as well as continued broad community participation, was completed in 1998. A capital campaign, The Second Century Library Trust, was launched in 1999 to help propel the building project into the new millennium.
In June 2000, an historic town election voted 81% in favor of a $7,900,000 debt exclusion to renovate and expand the present building. Assisted by supplemental appropriations, $440,000 in private and corporate donations, and a $2,585,569 Mass. Library Construction Grant, the $9,771,000 project broke ground on June 23, 2002. The project was completed in 16 months. Following a gala celebration, a Family Day and Dedication was held on November 16, 2003 attended by over 3000 residents.
“The Mission of the Canton Public Library is to provide residents of Canton with access to the best available intellectual, cultural, and recreational opportunities to encourage a lifelong love of learning and reading, support educational success, enrich their quality of life, promote community participation, and preserve Canton's unique heritage."

Re: [llvm-dev] Does anyone have issues with clang-with-thin-lto-ubuntu buildbot failing for practically every commit?
Bots are generally configured not to send email if they didn't start /newly/ failing on the commit (or, unfortunately, the range of commits) in question. If you're seeing that (an already failing bot send fail-mail to a newer commit that wasn't involved in the change of state from green to red) - certainly something we should all look into.
Beyond that - some bots have longer cycle times which tends to mean larger commit ranges, which leads to a higher chance that any given cycle will fail (more changes, each with usually an independent/average chance of failure... etc). That's unfortunate, but about the only solution is to find some way for the bot to run faster (so it can have smaller commit ranges between each run) or use more machines on that bot configuration (so each one kicks off a smaller range/runs in parallel with others) - if a bot has a really long cycle time such that the blame is rarely useful, I think it's reasonable to push back a bit on the bot owner & perhaps they should be responsible for first level triage so as not to waste a lot of developers time looking at blames taht aren't theirs.
As Zach said - looks like perhaps it picked up some other change along with yours that was, probably briefly, out of conformance with warnings?

The history of cinema is replete with partnerships that seem so set in stone we can’t imagine the people in them working independently of each other. Where would Simpson have been without Bruckheimer in the 1980s? Where would Kurztman be without Orci, the writers behind films in the Transformers and Star Trek franchises?
And what will Leigh Whannell do without James Wan when the latter takes the reigns of one of the biggest franchises in Hollywood right now, Fast and the Furious? But before he takes a leave of absence from the genre that made his name, Wan talked about the sequel to his and Whannell’s breakout hit, Insidious.
Question: Interesting that it was announced you were doing something other than horror when you had another huge hit in the genre (The Conjuring, which beat many of the blockbuster hopefuls of 2013).
Answer: Yes, we’re very happy with how well The Conjuring is playing in Australia and all around the world.
Question: Do you think the success of The Conjuring will give Insidious 2 a boost in territories [like Australia] where the first Insidious didn’t do as well?
Answer: I hope so. I hope the effect will push people to see the Insidious films or at least introduce them to the franchise more than they were aware of it in the first place.
Answer: I think so, and I hope the Insidious films or the Insidious world is something people can get into maybe years from now.
Question: Your work with Leigh has been transformational for both your careers, but how important is it to forge your own paths as you have with stuff like Death Sentence and now with Fast and Furious?
Answer: It was really weird to make The Conjuring because it was the first film that I’ve literally made without Leigh’s presence at all. Even in Death Sentence I got him to come in and play a cameo role. The Conjuring was strictly Leigh Whannell-free and it was kind of weird to not have my buddy around so we could joke in between set ups and stuff like that.
But I do think it’s good and important that Leigh does his own thing and I go off and do my own things as well. We can go off and grow as separate filmmakers and then come back together to cook something else up.
Question: Do you think it’ll be a case of not being able to wait too long before you have to work together again?
Answer: I think so. Leigh and I just get along so well when we work, so hopefully we’re not apart for too long. But it’s kind of hard to say – who knows how long and how far separate paths can take you? But we work so well together so we definitely have aspirations to want to come back at some point.
Question: Post-Saw projects like Dead Silence and Death Sentence didn’t connectwith audiences. What was it about Insidious that re-established you in horror?
Answer: I guess after Dead Silence and Death Sentence we kind of went back to our roots and thought ‘we did it once with Saw, maybe we could do it again’. So that’s exactly what we did, we wanted to go back and make a movie we had full creative control of. We didn’t want any interference, we just wanted to make a movie that we believed in and just let it be what it is.
I also think between Saw and the first Insidious, I definitely grew as a filmmaker, so where I am right now as a director is very different to where I was when I first started in this business ten years ago. That growth has a lot to do with the way you look at things, the way you understand how the game is played in Hollywood and how to navigate this pretty treacherous world and be able to survive it.
Question: You were known as the Saw guy for a long time. Did the success of Insidious make you feel vindicated as a horror director?
Answer: Yeah, definitely. Leigh and I will always be very grateful for what the Saw films have done for us, especially the first one. It gave us our start, it allowed us the opportunity to have a career.
But it took me a while to get up from underneath its shadow because of what it became – it became this larger than life thing and it’s own mythology. For better or for worse it became its own brand as well, and I felt it had a lot of baggage going with it.
So it definitely took me a while to get out from under it, and it was around the time Saw VII was finishing off and Insidious was starting when I think people starting seeing me, not just as the Saw guy but started seeing me as a film, director.
Question: You’re still synonymous with horror though, at least for the time being. Does that bother you?
Answer: I don’t think it’s a bad thing. It’s always kind of good in today’s commercial world to have a brand. Plus I’m a real fan of the genre so I don’t look down at it in any way. I’m a big fan of all kinds of films so I always want to prove to people that I’m more than just one thing.
That was one reason why I went off and did Insidious and The Conjuring, because I felt those movies serviced different things and allowed people to see me in a different light. And now with Fast and Furious I think people are going to see me in a different world as well. I want to keep growing as a filmmaker and not really be known just for one thing.
Question: Fast and Furious is going to be quite different from low budget horror. Any thoughts on handling the increased scrutiny, money and pressure?
Answer: You hit the nail on the head with all those points. I definitely feel the weight of taking on something so big. It has its challenges and they’re big challenges, but I’m not looking at it like a bad thing, I’m looking at it as a positive thing I can use to my advantage, showcase what I love and what I’m capable of to people. And I think ultimately, it will be really fun.
What I’ve always admired about the Fast and Furious universe is that they’re always reinventing themselves, they’ve never been just one thing and I really admire that, so the chance to be part of the world and continue with that trend is very exciting for me.
Experts in deception shared tricks of the trade and showed their skills at Black Hat and DEF CON 2018.
It's not every day you hear or see social engineers in action – well, knowingly, anyway – but that's exactly what the crowd did at Black Hat and DEF CON 2018 held last week in Las Vegas.
Traditional methods of social engineering and phishing attacks are mostly well-understood and remain successful, explained Matt Wixey, technical research leader for PwC's UK cybersecurity practice. Still, attackers are finding new and more advanced ways to manipulate their victims.
Wixey detailed their efforts in a Black Hat presentation on Remote Online Social Engineering (ROSE), his name for long-term campaigns in which actors leverage false personae and highly detailed reconnaissance to compromise target networks. By building a relationship with their targets, attackers can persuade employees to send data and assist in corporate hacking.
"A big reason would be to bypass technical controls, and bypass the effects of user education and awareness," Wixey explained. Social engineers want to do more than slip past firewalls. They must also deceive a human's threshold for which behavior is suspicious and which isn't.
"Because [an attack] is designed to target a specific individual, it can be designed specifically to bypass that person's filters," he continued. We all have different standards for what constitutes phishy behavior, all of which vary depending on personality, upbringing, and other factors.
A ROSE attack starts with an in-depth analysis of the target: their online activity, how they communicate, responses to good and bad news, linguistic styles, and their motivations for taking particular actions. They learn where they went to school, where they previously worked and which roles they held, interests and hobbies, names of family members and friends.
The attacker can use this information to craft a profile before reaching out to the target. Their fake profile may include similar interests, a shared educational background, or another trait to facilitate an opening for conversation. Their profile photo may not be stolen but may be altered or concealed behind a paywall from a private source to conceal the attacker's identity, he said.
They may keep up this charade for a while to build credibility and, over time, they may automatically post content and/or alter their fake profile to reflect changes in employment, interests, styles, and politics. When working toward direct contact, the attacker may "like" content from their target's friends or related to their interests to make themselves known.
Finally, they go in for the hook. An attacker can ping their victim with a request for help or proposal for a business relationship. All the while, they'll use their earlier research to inform their conversation and pursue more frequent contact to build rapport and trust.
Social engineers rely on several techniques to make their interactions more believable, said Wixey. Lies often include more negative emotions and fewer sensory details. Liars often use cognitive details and keep things simple so there are fewer details to recall in the future.
"Liars may ask more questions, perhaps in an attempt to shift the focus from them onto the person they're trying to device," Wixey added.
In his presentation, Wixey referenced a study stating people lie in 14% of emails, 27% of face-to-face interaction, and 37% of calls. We saw the final stat live during DEF CON's Social Engineering Capture the Flag competition, in which competitors call corporate targets and use social engineering tactics to get its employees to provide different pieces of data ("flags").
Participants are assigned target organizations a few weeks before DEF CON and prepare by collecting open-source intelligence on the company, its employees, and other characteristics. They prepare a game plan: who their fake persona is, why they're calling, and how they might leverage social engineering techniques to persuade the target to hand over information.
This year's winner, Whitney Maxwell, directly called employees at service centers for the company she was assigned to target. She was doing an audit, she explained, and she just needed the answers to a couple of questions. By using techniques to establish legitimacy with the employee – saying they have the same name for example – she got some key data.
One conversation yielded information including the company's version of Windows (XP), whether they used wireless Internet, building security, type of computer and desk phone, and whether they used Outlook and Adobe. She confirmed the center's location and, in one instance, was able to convince an employee to enter a bit.ly URL into the browser.
"If you can do that over the phone, you can compromise a whole network," said Chris Hadnagy, president and CEO of Social-Engineer, Inc. and organizer of the DEF CON event.
Much of the time it's difficult to tell when the person on the other end of a phone call, email, or social media message is malicious. Wixey pointed to a few techniques businesses can use to stay safe as cybercriminals get stealthier.
To limit the amount of available information online, he advises setting a Google alert for your full name so you know when a specific term (your name, for example) appears in a Google search result. Conduct reverse image searches on new contact requests and research the people who want to join your network. If you're unsure about someone, check their account for early auto-posting and inconsistencies.
If a stranger pings you with a question or collaboration opportunity, second-guess their motives. Why might they ask you to do this, and how might they benefit? If they contact your corporate email address, how did they find it? Do they avoid face-to-face or video interaction?
"We lie all the time," said Wixey. "Everyone lies to each other, all day, every day." The challenge for businesses is determining where the malicious intent is.

The Pacific Crest Trail (or the "PCT") is a 2,650 mile long trail that extends from Mexico to Canada, passing through California, Oregon and Washington along the way. Like its sister hike, the Appalachian Trail (or the "AT"), it is a long distance journey that many backpackers attempt to complete in one season each year.
The PCT journeys through low valleys, high mountain ranges, sand, snow, wind, rain, lush forest and arid desert. Along its route it travels through seven national parks, and every eco-system but one. It is best traveled between late-April to early October, in order to avoid the harsher winter conditions that can make crossing the mountain ranges more difficult. Most people hike from South to North for just this reason: weather.
Each year approximately 500-800 people attempt to thru-hike the trail, with only 30% of those actually finishing the entire route. In 2013, the year I hiked, there were over 1,300 long distance permits applied for! In total, about 400 of those people completed the whole trail end to end. I was one of those lucky few who spent an amazing summer walking from Mexico to Canada, and enjoyed the memories that such an adventure brought me. By reading my journal below, you can join me on my journey.

“My family and I thank you so much for your great help rendered to overcome so many of our problems such as my company’s business and children problems. I remembered that ever since I have consulted you and obtained the amulet and your Takruts and also received your blessing, my life turn for the better in every way. My current daily life with everyone is not only peaceful but with many helpful people around. Whenever I faced any problems or do not know which action should take, your Takrut would give me the wisdom to solve it. My children such as my daughter, after wearing your takrut and your blessing without her physical presence her bad luck changed completely for the best. At the presence, she is peaceful and has happily found a good job and enjoying working in the bank. My son who is wearing your takrut is also expecting good fortune. My family and I could keep on narrating all your good deeds which you have done for us endlessly, but we would just wish to conclude here by thanking you so much for your honesty and trustworthy in making the powerful takruts and your blessings for us which its capabilities in helping us not only proven once but have been proven numerous times. Please keep our appreciations and thank you in your unaccountable records.
This is not a topic going around the blogosphere or G+ right now, so I assume that most folks have already spent a lot of time talking about this and have come to some form of consensus or it has somehow been successfully ignored by bloggers. No, I don't think the latter option is very likely, either. I know that I've gotten a few people's opinions on the matter, and have spent a lot of time thinking about mine. Or rather, I think about the issue as tangential to other issues, particularly when considering one system's merits versus another's (as in, why not Swords & Wizardry rather than DCC?).
When I was growing up in the hobby, I think we missed the "you get xp for treasure you find" memo. My introduction to gaming came with the '83 Mentzer red box (bought at a garage sale, but somehow miraculously still containing all the dice and *gasp* the crayon), and though "xp for gp" was in there, I think we didn't notice it, particularly because we didn't really understand what xp were yet. And then we (somehow) moved into Palladium Fantasy and 2e at the same time, which we sort of looked at as the same game, but I think we read the xp rules from Palladium Fantasy and not 2e (Palladium Fantasy very much makes a point of not granting xp for killing monsters or gaining treasure, but if you weren't supposed to earn xp for killing things, why did everything in D&D have an xp value?). Wow, I never thought about how strange this mash up was ... Well our 2e/Palladium strangeness didn't bother tracking xp because we had managed to get ourselves sufficiently confused on the issue, so the DM (me) would just decide that people had gained levels because ... we were in fifth or sixth grade at the time and didn't know any better. (Yes, I know that there are plenty of gaming groups out there who are perfectly happy with "levels by DM fiat;" I am not one of those gamers.) Long story short, I completely missed that I should have been earning and awaring xp for treasure and that, by the time I became that "xp for gp" was a thing, I thought it was a feature of games I'd left behind (like BECMI).
One of the reasons that I dig the "xp for gp" concept is that I've rarely gotten to take advantage of it, Beyond that, it does seem to fit certain types of campaigns exceptionally well, particularly the murderhobo sort of campaign. When the players play glorified tomb raiders, it makes a lot of sense to reward them for accomplishing their chief goal: the acquisition of filthy lucre. Here we have reinforcement of greed and that's perfectly fine, following that particular campaign model. Further, campaigns with the "xp for gp" rule seem to have the possibility of ever-escalating gp awards being necessary to satisfy the players' lust for xp, but that doesn't seem like a real criticism to me (you just have to make sure that the dragon guarding all that treasure is big and bad enough and the problem is solved; if the players earn the treasure by defeating the dragon/demon/monster, no problem, if not, they're dead and it's time to reroll). Systems with "xp for gp" build that logic straight into their xp per level tables, making it a presumption of the balancing one class against any other. Thus, fighters need more gold to level than clerics or thieves, whereas magic users need more than even fighters. This all has an internal consistency that I really dig, however...
All wealth exists to make challenges easier for players in one way or another. In city environments, you can often throw money at problems. In dungeons, magic arms and armor make fighting easier. In my DCC games, you can buy more level 0s whenever you're in town. Xp, as an award, also makes things easier, so awarding "xp for gp" seems like double-dipping into the award sauce, especially since many games (including DCC) award xp based on the difficulty level of challenges overcome, meaning that easier encounters (made easier by the award of treasure) earn less xp, but if "xp for gp" is in effect, then making an encounter less difficult by "throwing treasure at the problem" doesn't actually curb the xp award (so long as there's some treasure included in the encounter). In other words, if there's a treasure to be had, throwing money at the problem of overcoming the dragon/demon/monster/old god guarding it doesn't end up reducing the amount of xp awarded for the encounter. I find something fundamentally disturbing in this logic.
All in all, I'd say that deciding to use "xp for gp" works if and when the campaign model calls for it. In my DCC game, where each treasure is special and every magic item has a name, treasure is a motivating factor, but the name of the game is facing off against mad challenges from the depths of imagination, so awarding treasure for anything that doesn't contribute to this campaign focus seems to miss the point. Similarly, in, say John's Swords & Wizardry game that I play in on Saturdays on G+, treasure is largely the point of adventuring, so awarding xp for any treasure found (actually, John awards it for treasure spent, but you get the picture) just makes sense. Right. So, "xp for gp?" It all depends.
In real world news, my wife and I should be earning xp for treasure during the adventure we're heading on tomorrow. Tomorrow, we launch head first into that nightmare territory called Toledo on a journey to a little-known and out-of-the-way little place called Stanley's Market, home of the best damn kielbasa I've ever tasted. Hamtramck has nothing on Stan's. Kielbasa I ate in Poland has nothing on Stan's. Every Christmas season (and normally at least one other time each year), my wife and I make the pilgrimage to Stan's and bring back way too much of the stuff. This year, the kielbasa will be our contribution to the wife's family's Christmas party, possibly along with some pierogi or golabki, though I think we're going to experiment in making some ogorkowa (dill pickle soup) to bring, too. I know that the testimonial of some dude online you've never met isn't quite as much of an endorsement as it could be, but if you ever find yourself in Toledo, stop in at Stan's and do yourself a favor. Were a player to offer me Stan's kielbasa, that's one treasure I'd never hesitate to award xp for.

A place outside the boundaries of your home or workplace where you can be alone or with your friends and not be bothered with the hovering staff to take your order, execute and slap a bill and wait for you to empty space. I love my personal space and I’m very protective about it. So when the saturation sets in, ( being a mom to two naughty boys, I need to reset myself very often) I head to a nearby cafe just alone or with my bestie to spend next few hours in peace.
High Pressure Castings for Aluminum Hardware Brackets vs. Aluminum Sand Castings. Aluminum hardware brackets are used in fountains, lighting fixtures, and electric fans. In construction projects, aluminum hardware brackets in the form of braces are used to hold wooden beams at the correct angle while a structure is still being built. It goes without saying that aluminum hardware brackets are used for various purposes in everyday life, so how can they be manufactured quickly enough to meet consumers’ needs?
To make aluminum hardware brackets, manufacturers can use either the pressure die casting method or sand casting, which are just two of the many methods used to cast aluminum. Pressure die casting basically involves melting the aluminum, which is then injected under pressure into a hardened steel mold or die in the shape of a bracket. Afterwards, the mold is cooled, often in water. When the aluminum has hardened, half of the mold is moved and ejector pins push out the new aluminum cast that is now a hardware bracket. Sand casting, on the other hand, involves mixing sand with binders and compacting water around metal or wooden pattern halves to produce a mold that is shaped as a bracket. The mold is then removed from the pattern, and aluminum is poured into the mold’s cavities. The mold is cooled first and afterwards, it is broken to remove the aluminum cast which has settled into the shape of the mold. Sand casting is suitable for producing both ferrous and non-ferrous castings in a wide range of sizes and shape complexity, while pressure die casting is appropriate for manufacturing small to medium non-ferrous castings of thin walls and varying complexity. The method for producing aluminum hardware brackets obviously depends on the purpose for which aluminum hardware brackets are to be used.

Aluminum Chassis Enclosure Castings. High pressure die casting is the process used to make aluminum box enclosures and chassis housing castings. This process is now becoming more and more popular in several major manufacturing industries because of its many advantages.
Furthermore, Aluminum is a great metal to work with. Unlike other metal alloys, it has several strengths. This metal can be found almost everywhere in the planet. Supply will not run out, so it is easy to acquire and not heavy on your pockets.
Faster production rate. In fact, production quantities can be done within a few days instead of several weeks!
Also, you can produce aluminum die casts according to your preference and specifications, such as the trim, clean, machine, inspect, powder coat and the package of your aluminum cast parts.
The use of aluminum castings over still helps you reduce weight, boost strength, and save you more money.

Die Casting Aluminum Boxes are used in many ways. How are Die Casting Aluminum Box Enclosures used? These boxes are used for retail product packaging because they can easily get grounded since aluminum can conduct electricity. These are also used as enclosures for parts which should be protected from sudden impact, dust, or moisture. These boxes are also used as a means of blocking away radio waves and frequency which may affect the capacities of the electronic components. It offers protection to the electronic components by providing RF or EMI shielding.
Aside from these uses, a die casting aluminum box enclosure is also utilized as a “grounding plane” or as a common electrical circuit for the electrical machinery inside the box. Die casting aluminum boxes can also be used as storing equipment since they are durable enough to contain materials when one is out on a road trip. These boxes can be manufactured huge so these can be used at the back of pick up trucks. But they can also be crafted in a small size so they can be used in the home as storage for magazine and comic book collections. These can also be used as mailboxes which can survive the harsh weather for a couple of years. Die casting aluminum boxes are also used as large transportation enclosures for both equipment and animals.
Low Production Die Castings Cost. Heating plates are mostly seen in the home and in laboratory equipment that need continuous heating or source of heat like chocolate fountains. Many manufacturers prefer producing heating plates using aluminum alloy because this alloy has thermal properties that are suitable to play the role of heating plates. Many manufacturers also use die casting in producing heating plates because they find it more convenient and economical to use as compared to other processes.
In die casting, aluminum is melted by exposing to extremely high temperature. When the metal is already melted, it will be injected in molds or dies to take the shape of the parts. Afterward, when the metal is already solidified, the parts or casts in the dies will be removed and will be slightly polished. The parts are near net shape, meaning they are produced as whole parts so joints will be avoided. This makes the pressure die casting more efficient because it produces stronger and more durable products unlike other processes like extrusion. In extrusion, the products produced are in cross section making the parts less durable as compared to die casting. Aside from this, heating plates do not need hollow parts like that of what will be produced in extrusion. Lastly, pressure die casting is much inexpensive than extrusion that is why many manufacturers use die casting instead of extrusion.

Hello Miguel, this reminds me of my own typing class in highschool - I was the last generation to take one, but it provided me with a 10finger system of typing which proves very helpful right now, and every day.
Very nice post. I agree 100%. Two skills that schools do not teach proper penmanship (printed and cursive writing) and typing. A third could be added for those college bound; shorthand. I learned to type in high school and was not interested to take shorthand as an elective class. Then I went to college. Beautiful Smith-Corona typewriter. I wish my desk were so neat and orderly.
Very true! I took typing in 8th or 9th grade but could have used a refresher course before college. I now typically use about 4 or 5 fingers when I type and could be much more efficient if I had kept up the 10-finger method I learned over 30 years ago.
Very well said! And I totally agree... With computers we all think we know how to type properly. But we don't. I do believe most of us don't use our 10 fingers to type.
I still remember the nostalgia with some of my older friends and family looked at my typewriters when I have started collecting them. Apparently they had all learned to work with them when they were at school!
I am been a hair stylist in the beauty industry for 26 years and have lived and worked in the Portland area for the past fourteen. I LOVE THIS CITY!
I specialize in Framisi color; but have extensive experience with multiple color lines and also like to use Redken Shades EQ. While I focus on highlights and precision hair-cutting, I consider hair color an artistic expression of personal beauty. As a hair stylist, I take great pride in attention to detail and customer care. For me, it’s never just about haircuts, color or styling. It’s about understanding each individual’s hair and the natural way it grows. There’s an art to revealing a style that suits each client’s personality. It’s exciting for me to get to know you and provide you with the look you want or help you find that someone deep inside that has been waiting to emerge.

H01L27/02—Devices consisting of a plurality of semiconductor or other solid-state components formed in or on a common substrate including semiconductor components specially adapted for rectifying, oscillating, amplifying or switching and having at least one potential-jump barrier or surface barrier; including integrated passive circuit elements with at least one potential-jump barrier or surface barrier
H01L27/0262—Particular design considerations for integrated circuits for electrical or thermal protection, e.g. electrostatic discharge [ESD] protection for MOS devices using bipolar transistors as protective elements including a PNP transistor and a NPN transistor, wherein each of said transistors has its base coupled to the collector of the other transistor, e.g. silicon controlled rectifier [SCR] devices
A high voltage isolation protection device for low voltage communication interface systems in mixed-signal high voltage electronic circuit is disclosed. According to one aspect, the protection device includes a semiconductor structure configured to provide isolation between low voltage terminals and protection from transient events. The protection device includes a thyristor having an anode, a cathode, and a gate, and a thyristor cathode-gate control region that is built into the protection device. The protection device is configured to provide multiple built-in path-up to power-high terminals and path-down to power-low terminals at different voltage levels. The protection device also includes independently built-in discharge paths to the common substrate that is connected to a different power-low voltage reference. The conduction paths may be built into a single structure with dual isolation regions. As a result, the protection device enables superior robustness and compact protection solutions for smart power applications.
Implementations of the invention relate to electronic systems, and more particularly, to protection and high voltage isolation of low voltage interface terminals systems for mixed-signal high voltage integrated circuits (ICs).
Certain electronic systems are configured to protect circuits or components therein from transient electrical events. A transient signal event may be in the form of an electrical signal of a relatively short duration having rapidly changing voltage and high power. Transient signal events can include, for example, electrical overstress/electrostatic discharge (EOS/ESD) events arising from the abrupt release of charge from an object or person to an electronic system.
Transient signal events can damage integrated circuits (ICs) inside an electronic system due to overvoltage conditions and/or high levels of power dissipation over relatively small areas of the ICs. Electronic circuit reliability is enhanced by integrating protection devices in an IC such that the protection devices are connected between the different pads or pins of the IC. The protection devices can be incorporated on-chip or at the system-level, and can maintain the voltage level at the pads within a predefined safe range by transitioning from a high impedance/low leakage state to a low impedance/high conductivity state when the voltage of the transient signal reaches a trigger voltage. Thereafter, the protection device can shunt the largest portion of the current associated with the transient signal before the voltage of the transient signal reaches a positive or negative failure voltage that can lead to one of the most common causes of IC damage in the field. After activation, a protection device can remain in the low-impedance state as long as the transient signal voltage level is above a positive holding voltage or below a negative holding voltage.
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors (CMOS), Bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS), or Bipolar Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductors (BiDMOS) devices may be configured to operate at input/output voltages that are a fraction of the power supply source voltage. ESD protection for these devices may also include additional discrete protection components which provide isolation between the various voltage terminals. As a result, conventional solutions which include separate isolated devices may present limitations due to excessive loading, voltage terminal isolation sensitivity, large area requirements, and added complexity to the circuit design layout and integration.
The systems, methods and devices of the disclosure each have several innovative aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes disclosed herein.
According to one embodiment, an apparatus and a method of manufacturing an apparatus are disclosed. The apparatus includes a substrate of a first conductivity type, a first isolation region disposed on the substrate of a second conductivity type that is opposite to the first conductivity type, a second isolation region disposed on the first isolation region of the first conductivity type, an epitaxial layer disposed on the substrate of the first conductivity type, a thyristor region disposed on the epitaxial layer. The thyristor region includes a thyristor gate region, a thyristor anode region, a thyristor cathode region, and a thyristor cathode-gate resistance-control region. The thyristor anode region coupled to an input/output voltage terminal, and the thyristor cathode region and the cathode-gate resistance-control region are coupled to a first voltage source terminal. The apparatus also includes a first decoupling component region comprising a first decoupling component anode region at least partially abutting a first decoupling component cathode region. The first decoupling component anode region is coupled to the first voltage source terminal. The first decoupling component cathode region is coupled to the input/output voltage terminal. The apparatus also includes a second decoupling component region comprising a second decoupling component anode region at least partially abutting a second decoupling component cathode region. The second decoupling component anode region is coupled to the first voltage source terminal, and wherein the second decoupling component cathode region is coupled to a second voltage source terminal.
According to another embodiment, an apparatus and a method of manufacturing an apparatus are disclosed. The apparatus includes a substrate of a first conductivity type, a first isolation region over the substrate of a second conductivity type that is opposite to the first conductivity type, a second isolation region over the first isolation region of the first conductivity type, an epitaxial layer over the second isolation region of the first conductivity type, a thyristor having an anode coupled to an input/output voltage terminal and a cathode coupled to a first voltage source terminal, a first diode having an anode coupled to the first voltage source terminal and a cathode coupled to the input/output voltage terminal, and a second diode having an anode coupled to the first voltage source terminal and a cathode coupled to a second voltage source terminal. The thyristor, the first diode, and the second diode are each formed at least partially on a surface of the second isolation region.
FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an example of a protection device and a high-voltage mixed-signal communication circuit according to some implementations.
FIG. 2A is a perspective view of a high voltage-isolated/low voltage communication interface protection device according to some implementations.
FIGS. 9A-9B depict quasi-static transmission line pulse (TLP)-type conduction path characteristics of a protection device according to some implementations for LV VIO to LV VSS and LV VIO to LV VDD, respectively.
The following detailed description of certain implementations presents various descriptions of specific implementations of the invention. However, the invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings where like reference numerals indicate identical or functionally similar elements.
Terms such as above, below, over and so on as used herein refer to a device orientated as shown in the figures and should be construed accordingly. It should also be appreciated that because regions within a semiconductor device (such as a transistor) are defined by doping different parts of a semiconductor material with differing impurities or differing concentrations of impurities, discrete physical boundaries between different regions may not actually exist in the completed device but instead regions may transition from one to another. Some boundaries as shown in the accompanying figures are of this type and are illustrated as abrupt structures merely for the assistance of the reader.
As discussed above, CMOS, BiCMOS, or BiDMOS devices may be configured to operate at input/output voltages that are a fraction of the power supply source voltage. According to some implementations, a single structure protection device that is formed on the same substrate and is capable of tolerating high voltage while maintaining isolation to the substrate for low voltage communication interface pads or pins is disclosed. The protection device is capable of providing a full built-in discharge path to the different power rails on a circuit. The protection device also provides dual-tub isolation between voltage terminals coupled to the circuit and the substrate.
FIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an example of a protection device 100 and a circuit 105 according to some implementations. As shown in FIG. 1, the protection device 100 is coupled in parallel between the circuit 105 and voltage terminals 104, 106, 108, and 110. The circuit 105 may be provided on a circuit board that includes connections to high voltage power rails having a range of, for example, about −50V to about +50V. For example, a substrate of the circuit 105 may be coupled to a high voltage negative power supply terminal 108 having a voltage of HV VSS. The voltage terminals 104, 106, and 110 can be configured to provide voltage levels that are a fraction of the voltages that are provided through the high voltage power rails, which may be coupled to other circuits on the same substrate. For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the circuit 105 is coupled to a low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 having a voltage level LV VDD, and a low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 having a voltage level LV VSS. The circuit 105 is also coupled to a bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 that has a voltage level equal to LV VIO. For example, the HV VSS voltage may be equal to about −50V, the LV VDD voltage may be equal to about +5V, the LV VSS voltage may be equal to about −5V, and the LV VIO voltage may vary within a voltage operating window of, for example, about 0V to about 5V. Other voltage levels may also be used, for instance the LV VDD voltage may be equal to about +5V, and for the LV VSS voltage may be equal to references 0V. In some implementations, the voltage levels LV VSS, HV VSS, LV VDD, and LV VIO may also be provided within a range of voltages having the same polarity.
As shown in FIG. 1, the protection device 100 is coupled in parallel between the voltage terminals 104, 106, 108, 110 and the circuit 105. As will be discussed in greater detail below, the protection device 100 is configured to provide ESD protection for the circuit 105 and isolation of the voltage terminals 104, 106, 108, and 110.
FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate a protection device 200 according to some implementations. FIG. 2A is a perspective view of the protection device 200. FIG. 2B is a cross-section view of the protection device 200 along a Z-X plane of FIG. 2A.
As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the protection device 200 includes a substrate 202 including a semiconductor material (such as silicon). For application in the range of 30 V to about 100 V, for instance 60V, the substrate 202 can have a doping concentration from about 7×1014 atoms/cm3 to about 1×1016 atoms/cm3, for example about 1×1015 atoms/cm3, and a thickness within a range of about 80 μm to about 150 μm, for example about 100 μm. As shown in the illustrative embodiment of FIG. 2B, the substrate 202 has a p-type doping concentration. A p-type epitaxial layer (P-Epi) 208 is disposed on the substrate 202. The p-type epitaxial layer 208 may be grown over the substrate 202 and may have a p-type doping concentration in the range of about 5×1013 atoms/cm3 to about 4×1014 atoms/cm3, for example about 1×1014 atoms/cm3, and a thickness within a range of about 4.0 μm to about 6.5 μm, for example about 5.0 μm. Other applicable doping concentrations and thicknesses will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. While shown as discrete sections and/or layers, the various wells, regions, and layers described and illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2D may be formed by doping the p-type epitaxial layer 208 to different doping concentrations and conductivity types in different sections of the p-type epitaxial layer 208. For example, n-type regions may be formed in the p-type epitaxial layer 208 by doping the p-type epitaxial layer 208 with a negative dopant (for example, group V atoms such as phosphorus or arsenic atoms), and p-type regions having a higher doping concentration than the doping concentration of the p-type epitaxial layer 208 may be formed by doping the p-type epitaxial layer 208 with a positive dopant (for example, group III atoms such as boron atoms).
The doping depth of the various regions will be described with reference to the top surface of the protection device 200 in the Z direction as shown in FIG. 2A. As shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, an n-type buried layer (NBL) 204 is disposed on the substrate 202. The n-type buried layer 204 may have an n-type peak doping concentration in the range of about 9×1016 atoms/cm3 to about 1×1018 atoms/cm3, for example about 2×1017 atoms/cm3, and the depth of the doping peak may be within a range of about 4 μm to about 6 μm, for example about 4.5 μm, from the top surface of the protection device 200. Other applicable doping concentrations and doping depth will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. In one embodiments, the doping concentration of the n-type buried layer 204 may be set to minimize the parasitic effect of parasitic devices formed by the interfaces along a vertical path from the terminals 104, 106, and 110 to the substrate 202 of the protection device 200. A deep p-type well (DPW) 206 is disposed on the n-type buried layer 204. The deep p-type well 206 may have a p-type doping peak concentration in the range of about 8.5×1016 atoms/cm3 to about 2.5×1017 atoms/cm3, for example about 1×1017 atoms/cm3, and a doping peak depth within a range of about 1.5 μm to about 2.5 μm, for example about 2 μm, away from the top surface of the protection device 200. Other applicable doping concentrations and thicknesses will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The deep p-type well 206, along with the n-type buried layer 204, are configured to provide isolation along a vertical path between the terminals 104, 106, and 110 and the substrate 202. The n-type buried layer 204 also provides a variation in the conductivity type between the p-type substrate 202 and the p-type epitaxial layer 208. Due to this variation and separation of the p-type layers, the parasitic devices formed by the structures of the protection device 200 exhibit lower gain.
As illustrated in FIG. 2B, the deep p-type well 206 has a width 250 along a surface of the n-type buried layer 204, which corresponds proportionally to an effective resistance of the deep p-type well 206. As will be discussed in greater detail later with reference to FIG. 8, the width 250 of the deep p-type well 206 may be set to control the resistance of the base of an embedded NPN bipolar transistor in the protection device. The p-type epitaxial layer 208 is lightly doped relative to the other regions of the protection device 200. The deep p-type well 206 has a peak doping concentration (for example, 1×1017 atoms/cm3) that is slightly higher than the doping concentration of the p-type epitaxial layer 208 (for example, 1×1014 atoms/cm3), thereby facilitating the formation of a high resistance of the base of the NPN bipolar transistor.
Alternating high-voltage p-type wells (HVPW) 210A-210C and high-voltage n-type wells (HVNW) 212A-212C are also provided over the substrate 202. The high-voltage p-type wells 210A-210C may have a p-type doping concentration in the range of about 1.5×1016 atoms/cm3 to about 1.0×1017 atoms/cm3, for example about 2.5×1016 atoms/cm3, a peak doping concentration close to the top surface of the protection device 200 and a diffusion depth from the top surface of the protection device 200 within a range of about 3.0 μm to about 5 μm, for example about 4 μm. The high-voltage n-type wells 212A-212C may have an n-type doping concentration in the range of about 5×1016 atoms/cm3 to about 1.0×1017 atoms/cm3, for example about 3.0×1016 atoms/cm3, a peak doping concentration close to the top surface of the protection device 200 and a diffusion depth from the top surface of the protection device 200 within a range of about 3.0 μm to about 5 μm, for example about 4 μm. Other applicable doping concentrations and thicknesses will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. As shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, high voltage p-type well (HVPW) 210A is disposed on the substrate 202 and is at least partially embedded in the substrate 202. The high voltage p-type well 210A is separated from the high voltage n-type well 212A by a region of the p-type epitaxial layer 208. The high-voltage n-type well 212A is disposed on the n-type buried layer 204. As shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, each of the high voltage p-type well 210B and high voltage n-type well 212B are disposed on the n-type buried layer 204. High voltage n-type well 212C is formed at least partially over the deep p-type well 206, and at least partially over the n-type buried layer 204. The interface between high-voltage wells 212A, 210B, 212B, 210C, and 212C provides a metallurgical junction which blocks current during normal operation as will be discussed in greater detail below.
As shown in FIG. 2A and FIG. 2B, shallow wells 214A, 216A, 214B, and 216B of alternating conductivity type are disposed on high-voltage wells 210B, 212B, 210C, and 212C respectively. The high voltage wells 210B, 212B, 210C, and 212C reduce the resistance and improve conductivity between the shallow wells 214A, 216A, 214B, 216B and the n-type buried layer 204 or the deep p-type well 206. A p-type shallow well 214C is disposed on the p-type epitaxial layer 208. An n-type shallow well 216C is also disposed on the p-type epitaxial layer 208. The p-type shallow wells (ShPW) 214A, 214B, and 214C have a peak p-type doping concentration close to the surface in the range of about 5.0×1017 atoms/cm3 to about 1.0×1018 atoms/cm3, for example about 8×1017 atoms/cm3, and have a diffusion depth away from the top surface of the protection device 200 in the range of about 0.5 μm to about 1.5 μm, for example about 0.8 μm. The n-type shallow wells (ShNW) 216A, 216B, and 216C have a peak n-type doping concentration close to the surface in the range of about 1.5×1017 atoms/cm3 to about 8×1017 atoms/cm3, for example about 2.5×1017 atoms/cm3, and have a diffusion depth away from the top surface of the protection device 200 in the range of about 0.5 μm to about 1.5 μm, for example about 0.75 μm. Other applicable doping concentrations and thicknesses will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.
A p-type active region (P+) 220A and an n-type active region (N+) 224A are disposed on the high-voltage p-type well 210A and the high-voltage n-type well 212A respectively. P-type active regions 220B, 220C and n-type active regions 224 b, 224C are disposed on corresponding p-type shallow wells 214A, 214B and n-type shallow wells 216A, 216B as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. An n-type active region 224D is disposed on the n-type shallow well 214C. A p-type active region 220D is formed at least partially over the p-type shallow well 214C and partially over the n-type shallow well 216C. The active regions 220A, 224A, 220B, 224B, 220C, 224C, 224D, and 220D are separated from one another by shallow trench isolation (STI) regions 218. The shallow trench isolation regions 218 may include a dielectric material, such as silicon dioxide, or the like.
An n-type active region 224E is disposed on the n-type shallow well 216C. A p-type active region 221 is also disposed on the n-type shallow well 216C. The n-type active region 224E is configured to function as an isolation region in order to block hole carrier leakage that can occur between the p-type active region 221 and p-type active region 220D, thereby avoiding the formation of a floating gate P-type mosfet device between these two regions. The p-type active region 220D, the n-type active region 224E, and the p-type active region 221 are separated by portions of the n-type shallow well 216C. The p-type active regions 220A-220D, 221 may have a peak p-type doping concentration close to surface in the range of about 1×1020 atoms/cm3 to about 8×1020 atoms/cm3, for example about 2×1020 atoms/cm3 and a narrow diffusion depth of about 0.3 μm. The n-type active regions 224A-224E may have an n-type peak doping concentration in the range of 1×1020 atoms/cm3 to about 8×1020 atoms/cm3, for example about 5×1020 atoms/cm3 and a narrow diffusion depth of about 0.3 μm. Other applicable doping concentrations will be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.
As shown in FIG. 2B, a highly conductive material layer 222 is disposed on the p-type active regions 220A-220C, 221 and over the n-type active regions 224A-224D. The highly conductive material layer 222 may include a material such as silicide, or the like. The highly conductive material layer 222 is configured to provide a conductive connection path to corresponding terminals of the protection device 200, and to enhance conductivity within each of the active regions. As shown in FIG. 2B, the highly conductive material layer 222 is not disposed over the p-type active region 220D or the n-type active region 224E. In some implementations, the highly conductive material layer 222 may be provided over the p-type active region 220D and/or the n-type active region 224E to enable external trigger control of the device (e.g., by utilizing an external current source).
With reference to FIG. 2B, the protection device 200 is coupled to terminals 104, 106, 108, and 110 having corresponding voltage levels LV VDD, LV VIO, HV VSS, and LV VSS, respectively, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 2B, the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108 is coupled to the p-type active region 220A. The low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 is coupled to the n-type active regions 224A and 224B. The bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 is coupled to the p-type active regions 220B and 221, and to the n-type active region 224C. The low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 is coupled to the p-type active region 220C and the n-type active region 224D.
The protection device 200 includes a plurality of interfaces of different conductivity type which form a plurality of electrical components. For example, the central region of the protection device 200 above the p-type epitaxial layer 208 may be referred to as thyristor region of the protection device 200. The thyristor region includes NPNP interfaces corresponding to n-type active region 224D, p-type shallow well region 214C, n-type shallow well region 216C, and p-type active region 221, respectively, which effectively form an equivalent thyristor having a gate, anode, and cathode. The n-type shallow well region 216C and the p-type active region 221 correspond to the anode of the equivalent thyristor, the p-type active region 220D corresponds to the gate of the equivalent thyristor, and the n-type active region 224D corresponds to the cathode of the equivalent thyristor. As discussed above, the anode of the equivalent thyristor (for example, n-type shallow well region 216C and p-type active region 221) is coupled to the bi-directional low-voltage input/out terminal 106, while the cathode of the equivalent thyristor is coupled to the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110. The gate of the equivalent thyristor (for example, p-type active region 220D) is configured to be floating as shown in FIG. 2B. That is, the p-type active region 220D is not connected to a voltage or current source. The floating gate structure enables a reduced response time and lower breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor. The trigger voltage of the equivalent thyristor for the protection device 200 may be varied based on control of the connections to and conduction between the active regions that are formed above the n-type shallow well region 216C and the p-type active region 220D which functions as a gate of the equivalent thyristor. An open circuit, as shown in FIG. 2B, will result in a low breakdown voltage for a particular protection device, while a gate region short circuited to p-type active region 221 in FIG. 2B will result in a higher breakdown voltage for the particular protection device. In some implementations, the trigger voltage can be controlled by utilizing an external current or voltage source, such as a transient trigger/control current source, which is activated by a specific transient condition (e.g., a change in voltage over time (dV/dt) that exceeds a predetermined value). For example, an external current source (not shown) may be coupled to the n-type active region 220D, and may be configured to inject current to or source current from the effective gate of the thyristor to control the trigger voltage of the effective thyristor.
As illustrated in FIG. 2B, the equivalent thyristor of the protection device 200 may have a breakdown voltage in the range of about 3.0 V to about 12.0 V and a response time to a transient event of in the range of about 1.5 ns to about 4.5 ns. As will be discussed in greater detail with reference to FIGS. 8 and 9A below, the equivalent thyristor is configured to block current at operating voltages, and to shunt currents at excess voltages. For example, the equivalent thyristor is configured to block current for an operating voltage range corresponding the bi-directional low voltage input/output (10) terminal 106 and to shunt current for voltages that exceed the operating voltage of the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106.
As shown in FIG. 2B, a first blocking region 228A may be disposed on the n-type shallow well 216C in an area between the p-type active region 220D and the n-type active region 224E. A second blocking region 228B may be disposed on the n-type shallow well region 216C in an area between the n-type active region 224E and the p-type active region 221. The first and second blocking regions 228A, 228B may be formed of a polysilicon material and may be configured to provide isolation between the corresponding active regions that are disposed on the n-type shallow well region 216C, thereby improving the response time of the protection device 200. For example, the first and second blocking regions 228A, 228B are configured to further block hole carrier leakage that can occur between p-type active region 221 and p-type active region 220D. As shown in FIG. 2B, a conductive material layer 222 is disposed on the first blocking region 228A and at least partially over the second blocking region 228B. The conductive material layers 222 that are disposed on the first and second blocking regions 228A, 228B, are separated from other conductive material layers 222 formed in adjacent regions by an isolation layer 226 as shown in FIG. 2B. The isolating layer 226 may be formed of an oxide having a high dielectric constant.
The direction of current and isolation/decoupling between the voltage terminals 104, 106, 108, and 110 is controlled based on the interface regions having doping concentrations of different conductivity type, which provide a metallurgical junction configured to block current during normal operation. The interfaces may correspond to partially contacting regions having doping concentration of different conductivity type. For ease of description, some of the functionality of the device may be described to behave similar to diodes having an anode region corresponding to a p-type doped region and a cathode region corresponding to an n-type doped region. For example, isolation and direction of current flow between the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 and the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 may be controlled based at least in part on the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210C (equivalent diode anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212C (equivalent diode cathode). Isolation and direction of current flow between the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 and the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 may be provided based at least in part on the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210B (equivalent diode anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212B (equivalent diode cathode). Isolation and direction of current flow between the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 may be provided based at least in part on the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210C (equivalent diode anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212B (equivalent diode cathode). Isolation and direction of current flow between the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 may be provided based at least in part on the interface between the combination of the high voltage p-type well 210A and the p-type epitaxial layer 208 (equivalent diode anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212A (equivalent diode cathode). The width of the protection device 200 in the Y direction can be set to handle different levels of current for different design requirements. In some implementations, the width of the protection device (e.g., protection device 200) can be within a range of about 25 μm to about 100 μm in the Y direction. For example, the width of the protection device may be about 50 μm for 6 Amps of TLP current handling capability for a single finger protection device formed as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. The TLP may be defined by a stress condition of 2 ns rise time and 100 ns pulse width. For example, a protection device having a width of 30 μm may be capable of withstanding a 2000 V human-body model (HBM) ESD stress condition. Similarly, variation in the width of the protection devices illustrated in FIGS. 3-7 may also be set for different design requirements.
FIG. 2C is a top view of one embodiment of the protection device 200 along horizontal line 2C-2C of FIG. 2B. For ease of illustration, FIG. 2C does not include the highly conductive regions 222 and the oxide isolation regions 226 discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. FIG. 2D is a top view of the protection device 200 along horizontal line 2D-2D of FIG. 2B. As shown in FIGS. 2C and 2D, each of the illustrated regions with the exception of the central p-type active region 221 is formed as an annular region. It will be understood that in practical embodiments, the lines of FIGS. 2C and 2D can be straight or curved and do not need to be parallel. In addition, the corners of each of the regions can be rounded.
FIG. 3 is a cross-section view of a protection device 300 according to some implementations. The protection device 300 is an example of the protection device 100 discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. The substrate 302, n-type buried layer 304, the deep well region 306, the p-type epitaxial layer 308, and the regions 310A-310C, 312A-312C, 314A-314C, 316A-316C, 318, 320A-320C, 321, 322, 324A-324D, 326, and 328 may be similar to the substrate 202, n-type buried layer 204, the deep p-type well 206, the p-type epitaxial layer 208, and the regions 210A-210C, 212A-212C, 214A-214C, 216A-216C, 218, 220A-220C, 221, 222, 224A-224D, 226, and 228A-228B discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. As shown in FIG. 3, the protection device 300 includes a variation in the structure of the equivalent thyristor region relative to the structure described above with reference to FIG. 2B. The equivalent thyristor region of the protection device 300 includes an n-type shallow well region 316C similar to the n-type shallow well region 216C. However, unlike the equivalent thyristor region of the protection device 200, the thyristor region of the protection device 300 does not include p-type active regions between the p-type active region 321 and the n-type active region 324D. Rather, the protection device 300 includes an n-type active region 324E that is formed partially over the n-type shallow well region 316C between the p-type active region 321 and the n-type active region 324D. The n-type active region 324E includes the highly conductive material layer 322 formed thereon. An blocking region 328 is disposed on the n-type shallow well region 316C and includes the highly conductive material layer 322 and isolation layer 318 as shown in FIG. 3. The blocking region 328 is configured to isolate the n-type active region 324E from the p-type active region 321. The variation in the structure of the thyristor region for the protection device 300 relative to the protection device 200 provides variation in the breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor. The breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor of protection device 300 may be in the range of about 2.5 V to about 10.5 V for example about 8 V, while maintaining a response time in the range of about 1.5 ns to about 4 ns, for example about 1.8 ns.
FIG. 4 is a cross-section view of a protection device 400 according to some implementations. The protection device 400 is an example of the protection device 100 discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. The substrate 402, n-type buried layer 404, the deep well region 406, the p-type epitaxial layer 408, and the regions 410A-410C, 412A-412C, 414A-414C, 416A-416C, 418, 420A-420C, 421, 422, 424A-424D, 426, and 428 may be similar to the substrate 202, n-type buried layer 204, the deep p-type well 206, the p-type epitaxial layer 208, and the regions 210A-210C, 212A-212C, 214A-214C, 216A-216C, 218, 220A-220C, 221, 222, 224A-224D, 226, and 228A-228B discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. As shown in FIG. 4, the protection device 400 includes a variation in the structure of the equivalent thyristor region relative to the structure described above with reference to FIG. 2B and FIG. 3. The protection device 400 is similar to the protection device 300 discussed above with reference to FIG. 3, with the variation to the n-type active region 424E relative to the n-type active region 324E. As shown in FIG. 4, the n-type active region 424E does not include the highly conductive material layer 426 formed thereon. As a result, the equivalent thyristor of protection device 400 exhibits a higher breakdown voltage than the equivalent thyristor of protection device 300. The variation in the structure of the region for the protection device 400 relative to the protection devices 200 and 300 provides variation in the breakdown voltage of equivalent thyristor. The breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor of protection device 400 may be in the range of 2.5 V to about 10.5 V for example about 8 V, while maintaining a response time in the range of about 2 ns to about 4 ns, for example about 2.5 ns.
FIG. 7 is a cross-section view of a protection device 700 according to some implementations. The protection device 700 is an example of the protection device 100 discussed above with reference to FIG. 1. The substrate 702, n-type buried layer 704, the deep well region 706, the p-type epitaxial layer 708, and the regions 710A-710C, 712A-712C, 714A-714C, 716A-716C, 718, 720A-720C, 721, 722, 724A-724D, 726, and 728 may be similar to the substrate 202, n-type buried layer 204, the deep p-type well 206, the p-type epitaxial layer 208, and the regions 210A-210C, 212A-212C, 214A-214C, 216A-216C, 218, 220A-220C, 221, 222, 224A-224D, 226, and 228A-228B discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. Unlike the protection device 200, the protection device 700 does not include n-type active regions in the thyristor region (for example, between the n-type active region 724D and the p-type active region 721). Rather, as shown in FIG. 7, the thyristor region includes p-type active region 720D which is formed partially over the p-type shallow well region 724C and partially over the n-type shallow well region 716C. An blocking region 728 is disposed on the p-type shallow well region 714C and between the n-type active region 724D and p-type active region 720D. The highly conductive material layer 722 is disposed on the blocking region 728, and the isolation layer 726 is configured to isolate the highly conductive regions 722 as shown in FIG. 7. In some implementations, the highly conductive material 722 may be excluded from the p-type active regions 720D in order to reduce leakage current of the protection device 700. As shown in FIG. 7, the highly conductive material layer 722 may be provided and coupled to an external current or voltage source (not shown) in order to further control the trigger voltage of the effective thyristor of the protection device 700.
The variation in the structure of the thyristor region for the protection device 700 relative to the protection devices 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 provides variation in the breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor. The breakdown voltage of the equivalent thyristor of protection device 700 may be in the range of about 3.5 V to about 13.5 V for example about 11 V, while maintaining a response time in the range of about 1.5 ns to about 4 ns, for example about 1.8 ns.
FIG. 8 shows an equivalent circuit diagram of the protection devices 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. The equivalent circuit diagram shown in FIG. 8 is illustrated only for ease of description of the operation of the protection devices discussed above, and one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the structures illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2D and FIGS. 3-7 do not necessarily correspond to the equivalent circuit components relied upon for the description of the functionality of the protection devices. The connections between the various nodes may correspond to conductive paths between the nodes, including through capacitive coupling. The circuit components illustrated in FIG. 8 may be discussed by referring to regions and structures of protection device 200 as examples. However, the equivalent circuit diagram shown in FIG. 8 is similarly applicable to the protection devices 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. As discussed above, each of the protection devices 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 include some variation in the equivalent thyristor region, thereby providing a variation in the trigger voltage of the corresponding equivalent thyristor for each protection device.
When the voltage difference between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 is less than the breakdown voltage of the N-P blocking junction at the collector of the NPN bipolar transistor 806, a small amount of leakage current can flow through the thyristor 802 from the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 to the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110. However, when the voltage difference between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 exceeds the breakdown (for example, “trigger voltage during transient stress conditions”) VT close to the breakdown of the N-P blocking junction at the collector of the NPN bipolar transistor 806, the NPN bipolar transistor 806 will begin to conduct current in a forward direction as indicated by current I1 as shown in FIG. 8. The collector of the NPN bipolar transistor 806 will draw current from the base of PNP bipolar transistor 804. As a result, the PNP bipolar transistor 804 will also begin to conduct current. The PNP bipolar transistor 804, in turn, provides current to the base of NPN bipolar transistor 806, driving NPN bipolar transistor 806 further into a conducting mode. Thus, once triggered, the PNP bipolar transistor 804 and the NPN bipolar transistor 806 are in a high-conduction regenerative feedback mode that will be maintained as long as a voltage difference between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 is greater than the holding voltage VH, or minimum on-state voltage defined by the relative gain of the embedded bipolar devices upon device activation. The thyristor 802 presents a high resistance/low leakage path until the trigger voltage VT condition is reached, but thereafter presents a low resistance path for high current to flow in a direction from the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 to the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 to protect the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 during a transient event (such as an electrostatic discharge event). Control of the base of the PNP bipolar transistor 804 and the NPN bipolar transistor 806 further enhances the design optimization according to some embodiments. For example, the cathode-gate control resistor 808 can be customized to adjust the breakdown voltage during transient conditions of the NPN bipolar transistor 806, such that higher resistance values of the cathode-gate control resistor 808 will result in a lower trigger point. The cathode-gate resistor 808 is built-in to the protection device and is adjustable based on the implementation of the protection device. In the implementation illustrated in FIG. 2B, for example, the effective resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808 is provided at least partially based on the p-type shallow well 214C, the p-type epitaxial layer 208, the p-type deep well 206, the high voltage p-type well 210C, the p-type shallow well 214B and the p-type active region 220C. Increasing the spacing between the regions may provide higher resistance and a lower breakdown of the NPN bipolar transistor 806, while decreasing this resistance will provide a higher trigger voltage. For example, with reference to FIG. 2B, the spacing between n-type active region 224D and p-type active region 220C may be varied in order to control the effective resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808. By adjusting the effective resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808, the operating condition of the protection device may be adjusted accordingly without external control components.
The resistance of the cathode-gate control resistor 808 can be varied, for example, by varying the lateral spacing as indicated above. Further, the resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808 may be varied by varying the width of each of the doped regions. For example, the p-type deep-well region 206 in FIG. 2B may have a lateral spacing 250 as indicated in FIG. 2B of about 25 μm for sub-0.18 μm minimum dimension features technology, and up to 45 μm for up to 0.35 μm minimum dimension features technology, for example about 34 μm for 0.18 μm minimum dimension features technology. The indicated lateral spacings 350, 450, 550, 650, and 750 in FIGS. 3-7 respectively may also be similarly varied to adjust the resistance of the corresponding cathode-gate resistor 808. In some implementations, the resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808 can vary from about 50 Ohms to about 500 kOhms. A small variation in resistance can be implemented, for example, through variation of the width of high-voltage n-type well 212C with reference to FIG. 2B. A larger variation in resistance can be implemented, for example, through variation of the width of the p-type epitaxial layer 208. The resistance of the cathode-gate resistor 808 may be set to achieve a desired stability during operation and a desired turn-on speed for a particular application.
A first diode 812 is configured to provide a reverse conduction path between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110. The first diode 812 may be provided as a built in electrical component of the protection device which is formed at least in part by the interface between two regions having doping concentrations of different conductivity types. For example, the first diode 812 may be formed at least in part by the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210C (for example, first diode 812 anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212C (for example, first diode 812 cathode) as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. The first diode 812 may have a first high reverse breakdown in the range of about 15 to about 30 V, for example about 20 V, and a first diode forward bias voltage VD1 of about 0.7 V such that when (LV VSS)−(LV VIO)>VD1, the first diode 812 is triggered to conduct a current in a forward direction of the first diode 812 as indicated by current direction I2 in FIG. 8.
A second diode 814 is configured to provide a forward conduction path between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104. The second diode 814 may be provided as a built in electrical component of the protection device which is formed at least in part by the interface between two regions having doping concentrations of different conductivity types. For example, the second diode 814 may be formed at least in part by the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210B (for example, second diode 814 anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212B (for example, second diode 814 cathode) as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. The second diode 814 may have a second diode high reverse breakdown in the range of about 15 to about 30 V, for example about 20 V, and a second diode forward bias voltage VD2 of about 0.7 V such that when a voltage difference (LV VIO)−(LV VDD)>VD2, the second diode 814 is triggered to conduct a current in a forward direction of the second diode 814 as indicated by current direction I3 in FIG. 8.
A third diode 816 is configured to provide a forward conduction path between the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104. The third diode 816 may be provided as a built in electrical component of the protection device which is formed at least in part by the interface between two regions having doping concentrations of different conductivity types. For example, the third diode 816 may be formed at least in part by the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210C and the high voltage n-type well 212B as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. The third diode 816 may have a third diode high reverse breakdown in the range of about 15 to about 30 V, for example about 20 V, and a third diode forward bias voltage VD3 of about 0.7 V such that when a voltage difference ((LV VSS)−(LV VDD))>VD3, the third diode 816 is triggered to conduct a current in a forward direction of the third diode 816 as indicated by current direction I4 in FIG. 8.
A fourth diode 818 is configured to provide a forward conduction path between the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104. The fourth diode 818 may be provided as a built in electrical component of the protection device which is formed at least in part by the interface between two regions having doping concentrations of different conductivity types. For example, the fourth diode 818 may be formed at least in part by the interface between the high voltage p-type well 210A (for example, fourth diode 818 anode) and the high voltage n-type well 212A (for example, fourth diode 818 cathode) as discussed above with reference to FIG. 2B. The fourth diode 818 may have a high reverse breakdown in the range of about 70 to about 120 V, for example about 100 V for a 60V process, and a fourth diode forward bias voltage VD4 of about 0.8 V such that when a voltage difference (HV VSS)−(LV VDD)>VD4, the fourth diode 818 is triggered to conduct a current in a forward direction of the fourth diode 818 as indicated by current direction I5 in FIG. 8. The first diode 812, the second diode 814, the third diode 816, and the fourth diode 818 may be referred to as decoupling components of the protection device that are configured to decouple the corresponding voltage terminals as discussed above.
A low voltage protection clamp 820 may also be coupled to the protection device and may be configured to function as a power supply current clamp. The low voltage protection clamp 820 can be configured to conduct a current in a forward direction as indicated by current I6 in FIG. 8. In some implementations, the low voltage protection clamp 820 may be configured to provide a low resistance during conduction of current between the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 to the low-voltage negative power supply terminal 110 during a stress condition between the bi-directional low-voltage input/output terminal, 106 and the voltage supply terminals 110 and 104. For example, during a condition in which the bi-directional low-voltage input/output terminal, 106 is stressed negatively versus the low-voltage positive power supply terminal 104, current is conducted from low-voltage positive power supply terminal 104 via the low-voltage protection clamp 820 to the low-voltage negative power supply terminal 110, (for example, current I6 as shown in FIG. 8), and from low-voltage negative power supply terminal 110 to the bi-directional low-voltage input/output terminal 106 (for example, current I2 as shown in FIG. 8). As shown in FIG. 8, the protection device is configured to provide all the necessary built-in path-up to power-high terminals and path-down to power-low terminals.
As illustrated in FIG. 8, the equivalent protection device also includes an effective PNP bipolar transistor 810. The PNP bipolar transistor 810 includes an emitter coupled to the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110, a base coupled to the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104, and a collector coupled to the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108. For example, with reference to FIG. 2B, the PNP bipolar transistor 810 may be formed by the deep p-type well 206 (effective emitter), the n-type buried layer 204 (effective base), and the substrate 102 having a p-type doping concentration (effective collector). The PNP bipolar transistor 810 is configured to provide isolation between the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 and the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108, and between the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 and the high voltage negative power supply terminal 108.
As illustrated in FIG. 8, and as discussed above with reference to FIG. 3-7, the conduction paths I1-I6 are built into a single structure. The structure includes dual-deep-well isolation regions corresponding to the n-type buried layer 204 and the deep p-type well 206. As a result, the protection device exhibits improved robustness and reduced area relative to conventional devices.
FIGS. 9A-9B illustrate examples of performance characteristics of a protection device. The illustrated examples may correspond to the performance of the protection devices 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 discussed above. For ease of comprehension, the performance characteristics are discussed with reference to the equivalent circuit diagram of FIG. 8. FIG. 9A illustrates an example of TLP test showing a voltage and a current measurement obtained by forcing a current pulse, for example a rectangular 100 ns current pulse having about a 2 ns rise time, into a protection device and measuring the voltage difference between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 (for example, LV VIO−LV VSS) in an area that is about 40% and about 90% of the rectangular pulse width. The plot shown in FIG. 9A includes an ESD protection window 902 which corresponds to the voltage levels of transient events that may be encountered by a circuit. An operational area 904 illustrates the operating region equal to the voltage difference between LV VIO−LV VSS of a circuit (for example, circuit 105 as discussed above with reference to FIG. 1). As shown in FIG. 9A, for positive voltage differences (LV VIO−LV VSS) that exceed the trigger voltage VT of the thyristor (for example, thyristor 802), a snapback effect occurs to a lower voltage difference through an increased current in a forward direction (for example, current direction I1 as shown in FIG. 8) between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110. For negative voltage differences (LV VIO−LV VSS) that exceed the forward bias voltage VD1 of a first diode (for example, first diode 812), the voltage difference is substantially maintained by an increased current in a reverse direction (for example, current direction I2 as shown in FIG. 8) between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110.
FIG. 9B illustrates an example of TLP test showing a voltage and a current measurement obtained by forcing a current pulse, for example a rectangular 100 ns current pulse having about a 2 ns rise time, into a protection device and measuring the voltage difference between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 (for example, LV VIO−LV VDD) in an area that is about 40% and about 90% of the rectangular pulse width. As shown in FIG. 9B, for positive voltage differences (LV VIO−LV VDD) that exceed a forward bias voltage VD2 of a second diode (for example, second diode 814), the voltage difference is substantially maintained by an increased current in a forward direction (for example, current direction I3 as shown in FIG. 8) between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104. For negative voltage differences that exceed a forward bias voltage VD3 (for example, 0.7 V) of a third diode (for example, third diode 816), the voltage difference is substantially maintained by an increased current in a direction (for example, current direction I4 as shown in FIG. 8) between the bi-directional low voltage input/output (IO) terminal 106 and the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104. The current level during this stage is also partially provided as a function of a power source current (for example, from low voltage protection clamp 820) in a direction between the low voltage positive power supply terminal 104 and the low voltage negative power supply terminal 110 (for example, current direction I6 as shown in FIG. 8).

Raymond Cho, an unlikely Progressive Conservative, becomes new Scarborough-Rouge River MPP - Local GTA | Local GTA
If Raymond Cho, victor in the Scarborough-Rouge River byelection based his candidacy on anything, it was this, and not policies of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.
And yet here he is – at nearly 80, likely the oldest person ever elected to a rookie term in the legislature – breaking through for the PCs in Toronto, and snatching a seat that had stayed Liberal red since the riding was formed in 1999.
“Together, we made history,” he told supporters in his packed Sheppard Avenue headquarters on Thursday, Sept. 1, night.
Courtly and practiced in his handshake from infinite community appearances he’s made in 25 years as a local councillor, Cho, when talking about Cho, nearly always stresses the support, the recognition, the love his residents have for him.
One thing he never had, despite a consistent core of support in the city’s Ward 42, is a higher political office.
Cho’s old colleague on Scarborough Council, Bas Balkissoon, ran for the Liberals in a 2005 byelection, and fought off all comers until this March, when he suddenly quit politics.
It seemed an odd fit: Cho is a former social worker who often makes short speeches about the environment. He was never considered a right-winger on Toronto Council, started out in politics as a New Democrat, and once ran for MP as an “independent Liberal.”
In the 2014 provincial vote, he finished third behind Balkissoon and Neethan Shan, a New Democrat and school trustee who on Thursday made his third unsuccessful run for MPP in Scarborough-Rouge River.
This time, though, with Patrick Brown as PC leader – the man Cho predicted will become premier in 2018 – and some help from Toronto political celebrity Doug Ford, his campaign co-manager, Cho achieved his dream.
Liberal candidate Piragal Thiru, a first-time candidate and a transportation planner in York Region, could not catch Cho, and Shan slipped into third place.
Earlier, Thiru clapped supporters on the back as he made his way up stairs to a rooftop restaurant on Morningside Avenue, where his party’s volunteers gathered. “We tried,” he said.
With all polls in, Cho got 36.6 per cent of the votes, and won by 2,429. Thiru took 28.9 per cent, and Shan wasn’t far behind at 27.4 per cent.
A by-election to fill Cho’s post on council seems likely, but a caretaker councillor could also be appointed for the next two years.
The PC campaign ran steady, attacking high electricity costs and seeming to side with doctors who rejected a proposed fee agreement with the Liberal government.
Cho supported the one-stop Scarborough Subway extention to Scarborough Town Centre. He also promised he’d fight to see the subway continue further north to Sheppard Avenue, though it was unclear when this could be done or who could pay for it.
One late hiccup came in the form of a letter, signed by Brown and delivered to doors in the riding, promising to “scrap” changes the Liberals introduced last fall to Ontario’s sex education curriculum. Brown later said the letter and its pledge were a “mistake,” an admission which may have confused some local voters who cared about the issue.
“The party’s over, Kathleen,” a jubilant Ford said from the stage beside Cho and Brown. “Finally the people of Scarborough are going to be heard.”
At the restaurant, Scarborough Centre MPP Brad Duguid, one of Wynne’s ministers, said the Liberal government will learn from the byelection.
“We’re the one party that has supported the Scarborough Subway. The others have vacilated,” said Duguid, adding the Liberals will continue to invest in local hospitals.
Brown, however, said the PCs are gaining momentum, “and now we have a seat the Liberal party has never lost in Toronto.”
Also running were Libertarian Allen Small, Ania Krosinska of the Trillium Party, Dwight McLean of the People’s Party, Wayne Simmons of the Freedom Party, and Above Znoneofthe for the None of the Above Party.
“All amulets that are in Feng Shui Master Tham’s cabinet are genuine. It is because in a hurry, I just simply pick one and Master Tham blessed me together with the amulet. Within a few days, I stroke a 4 digits lottery. Although it is not much it is the first time in my life to strike a 4 digits. Now my life is with good luck. My utmost sincere thanks to Master Tham. I am now recommending my relatives and friends to get amulets from Master Tham as well as to get his blessings.”
“Thank you very much Feng Shui Master Tham! After your effective feng shui properly done to my house, wearing your amulets and takruts with your blessing, I am now having a wonderful life. Earlier my life was so monotonous. My mother became very healthy. My health is now excellent and I do not need to take any medications as compared to the past. I have a lot of friends and just came back from overseas. And of course, my income has improved tremendously.”
“ Before I had met Master Tham, my family had gone through a lot of hardship. My son was semi-paralyzed in a car accident. In order to meet day ends and to pay for my son’s medical bills, I have to go to beauty saloons to offer massage earning 70% of the charges while my husband would be selling vegetables at the night market. We had gone through a difficult phase in our lives. However with Master Tham’s authentic genuine feng shui, our life has unexpectedly changed tremendously. We have moved to a large corner lot house, 10 times bigger than our old house. Our car porch could park 5 to 6 cars. We had employed 2 maids to attend my son as well as to do house chores. We had our own massage parlour and my customers are mostly from the upper class and they keep on recommending their family and friends to our massage parlour. You will never know how effective Master Tham’s feng shui is until you have experienced it. It could affect your whole life tremendously. That is why you should be careful in having a right choice for your feng shui master. Choosing a wrong master could destroy your life. Master Tham is the genuine master but very humble. With such a “truth” and good master, how would we forget to stop appreciate for all the good things for Master Tham which have done for us – My gratitude to him can never be expressed in thousands words.”
Claire West, Dennis Christie, people's church warden; Joan and Archdeacon Roderic West, Melissa Cunningham, rector's church warden; and Rev Joanne Megarrell, curate assistant, at a farewell event at St John's Parish Centre, Moira, for Archdeacon West who is moving to a new church. US1712-501cd
ON Friday April 20, St Johns Parish Centre, Moira was filled to capacity as they said farewell to their rector, Archdeacon Roderic West, his wife Joan and daughter Claire.
The West family came to minister in Moira in June 1995. The rector was appointed Canon of Dromore Cathedral in 2005 and then Chancellor in 2007 before being made Archdeacon in 2011.
The evening began with entertainment, hosted by the Curate Assistant Rev Joanne Megarrell and the Youth Ministry Co-ordinator, Mr Simon Henry.
The choir, the praise group and the junior choir treated the audience to some hymns and children's songs; the staff team performed a sketch and Naomi Beattie and Linda Doogan recited poems.
After an interlude for some supper, speeches were made by the Area Dean, the Rev Canon Gareth Harron, the Rev Howard Gilpin (representing the local clergy of Moira) Mr Bertie Logan (representing the nominators who appointed Archdeacon West) the Rev Joanne Megarrell (Curate Assistant of St Johns, Moira) and Mr Dennis Christie, the people's church warden.
Tributes were paid to the rector, Mrs. West and Claire for their faithful ministry in Moira which has seen much change in recent years. Archdeacon West then reflected on his time in Moira and wished the Parish well in the future.
Mr Dennis Christie, on behalf of the Parish, presented Archdeacon West with a cheque and a beautiful graphite drawing of St John's, Moira, the Logic Café, the rectory, the Parish Centre and the Main Street, painted by local artist and parishioner Mrs Janice Lightowler. The rector preached his farewell address at the morning services on Sunday April22. His institution as Co-ordinator Seapatrick, Banbridge is on Friday April 27 at 8.00pm.

Tarquin Compton, the tall dark dandy with a taste for rare poetry and pornography, is the hero of my third Burgundy Club book. I can now reveal that the title of the book. THE AMOROUS EDUCATION OF CELIA SEATON will be published in August 2011. (Pre-order now from Amazon )
You may find the book listed around the web as How to Marry a Governess, but that was a placeholder while discussions went on with my publisher. I'm over the moon about The Amorous Education - it's really descriptive and not at all generic. By the way Celia is a governess so the placeholder wasn't inaccurate either. (I don't think it's a spoiler to let on that Tarquin and Celia get married in the end).
Settling on a title is quite a business, with all sorts of factors being considered, mostly relating to sales potential. My editor and I typically come up with dozens of ideas, most of them pretty terrible and many very silly. My all time favorite stupid title was a chick lit idea for NEVER RESIST TEMPTATION: Baking and Boinking - the sexy tale of a pastry chef and her bad boy British lord.
Quite a few people have asked me what's coming after THE DANGEROUS VISCOUNT. While the information is buried somewhere on the website, I thought I'd better make it accessible.
My next book will feature Tarquin Compton, who is about to lose most of his clothes and be brought down a peg or several. I don't usually have anyone specific in mind when I create a hero, but Tarquin is very dark and I'm always happy to look at a picture of Richard Armitage (aren't you?) so here you are. The book is still untitled but it will be published in August 2011. I think the story is great fun and includes the reappearance of Sebastian, Diana, and Minerva from The DV.
I am working on a book about Minerva, Diana's little sister. I'm not saying anything more now except, in Minerva's case, "be careful what you wish for...." No release date for this one yet. Gotta finish it first.
4. His favorite means of communication is the grunt (which might be OK in a caveman romance but this is a Regency)
So what happens to this unpromising male specimen? He falls in love. He takes one look at Diana Fanshawe’s accidently exposed leg and he’s a goner. But sadly for Sebastian, Diana wants to be a duchess and she bets Sebastian’s detestable cousin Blake (a ducal heir) that she can get Sebastian to kiss her.
Poor Sebastian! When he finds out he’s devastated, he’s miserable, and hell hath no fury like a bookworm scorned. With the help of his buddies in the Burgundy Club he gets an extreme makeover and the fun begins.
Sebastian cleans up really well, and Diana can’t help noticing that he’s really quite the hunk. On the other hand she kind of misses the clever, inarticulate guy he used to be…
So romance readers. Are you ready for a nerd hero? Would you love him even if he didn’t get cleaned up?
October 2010 is a big month in the world of historical romance. There are new books on the way from Liz Carlyle and Elizabeth Boyle, eagerly awaited debuts from Jenny Brown and Tiffany Clare, and not one but two books by Janet Mullany. There’s even a new book from yours truly. But all these events, thrilling as they may be, pale into insignificance beside the Really Big News. A new book by Tamara Lejeune. I for one will be beating on the doors of my local Borders, itching to get my hot little hands on CHRISTMAS WITH THE DUCHESS. And by God, Borders, you’d better have it in stock or There Will Be Trouble.
I discovered Ms. Lejeune by accident. SIMPLY SCANDALOUS is, I believe, the only book I’ve ever bought because Amazon told me I’d like it. Also, it was only $3.99 and I thought that was a special deal, just for me. (When I learned Zebra was selling books to every Thomasina, Richenda and Henrietta for $3.99 I stopped being excited about it.) Also, the color was such a repellent shade of pink I couldn’t resist. Best $3.99 (plus shipping) I ever spent. I had no idea.
Look at the cover. Think the cover model is good looking? It doesn’t matter. Lord Swale, the hero of Simply Scandalous is one hundred times as hideous; he’s ugly, ill-mannered, crude, and borderline illiterate. Take this dinner table discussion of Shakespeare.
“So that’s Hamlet, is it? The man’s mother marries his father’s brother—have I got it right?” asked Swale. “Fairly beastly, what? I must say, I can’t approve. English people ought to behave better, set an example for the world even in our plays.”
“Ancient Rome, yes, obviously. And the Greek chap who married his own Mamma–Octopus or Edifice or what is it?”
“Danes. The play is set in Denmark.” Juliet shook her head, almost unable to credit the extent of his ignorance. “for heaven’s sake, it’s called Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.”
How can one possibly resist such a man? Actually, as Swale himself claims, he had hidden depths with knobs on. And Juliet has her issues, like being a towering bitch. She calls him Ginger and sets fire to his food; he swears to break her heart and stomp it into the ground. They are perfect together. I laughed out loud all the way to the last page of this inspired farce and counted the days till the sequel.
SURRENDER TO SIN did not disappoint. The hero, Juliet’s brother Cary, wears nothing but purple, right down to his tinted glasses. The heroine, unlike your standard feisty lass, is so shy and amiable she can’t bring herself to disagree with anyone. I’m not going to discuss the third book because I hated it (hey, even the Beatles recorded the occasional dog) but Tamara came roaring back with THE HEIRESS IN HIS BED.
Julian is not only penniless but a stockbroker (a word that usually makes my eyes glaze over) and Lady Viola Gambol (great name) the most charmingly willful, spoiled, over-the-top sweetheart of a heroine I’ve ever read. They made an adorable couple and I hope they will reappear in CHRISTMAS WITH THE DUCHESS. (Knowing Viola, I wouldn’t be surprised if she’d managed to have her penniless stockbroker made a duke.)
The author is a mystery. She has no website and seems to exist under the romance social network radar. The only person who reviews her is Mrs. Giggles, who loves her as much as I do. (BTW I love Mrs. Giggles even though she said my couple reminded her of puppies. No one can insult a book with such panache). Since Ms. Lejeune refuses to publicize her own books, I have decided to undertake the job for her.
Back last night from Orlando in a fairly exhausted state. The RWA conference is always enormous fun and very draining. I posted my photos on Facebook - mostly a lot of romance writers partying and trying on a pirate hat. When I get the energy I shall do a proper post here, but it may not be for a while. As people kept reminding us at the conference, our most important job is writing our books and I have one to finish. But I had to just show you this lovely snap from the Avon party of my editor Esi Sogah (right) and the super fabulous Meg Cabot.
With only two months to go until launch day, I can expect to see a few early reviews of THE DANGEROUS VISCOUNT popping up via Google Alerts. It's nerve-wracking, waiting to see if everyone is going to hate the book. (That hasn't happened yet but there's always a first time and writers are neurotic lunatics). Months later the thrill of a good notice hasn't diminished. After all, we hope our books will continue to find new readers for years to come.
Since it's been almost a year and a half since the book came out, I was pleasantly surprised to get a nice review for NEVER RESIST TEMPTATION from Susan May on the Petits Fours & Hot Tamales blog. She calls it "a hot historical where food is a turn on. A hunky hero and spunky heroine, and a fun time. Well worth a read." Thank you, Susan!
The setting and the use of the rare book auctions during that era, and tales of the folks who went to great lengths to own them was original and extremely interesting. I always enjoy a story where I not only am entertained but learn something of historical significance as well. Ms. Neville did an admirable job of creating lively and interesting protagonists, including a fine cast of secondary characters, a surprising villain and original plot. Those looking for new authors who can spin a good sensual story without a lot of graphic intimate detail should find THE WILD MARQUIS to be a perfect story and one I can seriously recommend.
I was already booked up for two weeks in England this July when Janet Mullany mentioned she was going at the same time and planned to attend the Romantic Novelists’ Association (Brit version of the RWA) conference. It happened to work with my other commitments so I signed up for the first day of the conference, which took place in Greenwich, on the outskirts of London.
I know people are excited about Disney World but when it comes to locating a conference, the RNA knows how to pick’em. The Royal Naval College is a huge seventeenth century spread built by Sir Christopher Wren in a stunning location on the River Thames. I traveled to Greenwich the traditional way – by boat from Westminster Pier.
It was a gorgeous sunny morning and the river was pristine. Too pristine. Since the last time I took this journey by boat, probably twenty years ago, a lot had changed. New buildings crowded every inch of the water front on both sides. And the river was empty. The port of London no longer operates in the old center and the docks, so rich in history, have been developed into blocks of flats and offices for financial service companies. Yes it used to be dirty and smelly and noisy but now it’s so quiet. There’s nothing going on at all on that beautiful expanse of water. I find myself nostalgic for the days when the London docks were the hub of a bustling commercial empire. I would have liked to see it when it looked like the 1806 Rhinebeck Panorama at the end of this post, rather than this, as it appeared last week.
The approach to Greenwich never disappoints. I disembarked, walked along the river front and into the central courtyard flanked by the wings of the Naval College and leading up to the Queen’s House, built for James I’s wife Anne. The conference took place in the left hand wing, now part of the University of Greenwich campus. For the buffet lunch we were able to take our plates out and sit in the sun in the Wren courtyard. I shared the experience with Mills & Boon luminaries Louise Allen, Joanne Maitland, and Sophie Weston.
The conference was much smaller and more intimate than the RWA – only 200 or so attendees as compared to the 2000 who will be at the US bash in Florida later this month. But like romance writers everywhere, everyone was friendly. I enjoyed putting faces to a few familiar names: Lynne Connolly (familiar from a number of loops and blogs), Nicola Cornick, and Anna Sugden (one of the dear Romance Banditas).
Because I was only attending one day out of the three, I missed most of the workshops, including a speech by the venerable Joanna Trollope and a presentation by Lucy Inglis, whose Georgian London blog I adore.
For me, the stand out workshop was a presentation on the state of UK publishing by David Shelley of Little, Brown. Some of his concerns are the same as those of US publishers – the decline of indie book stores, the significance of the growing electronic market, the power of Amazon and Apple – and some a little different, such as the role of the big supermarket chains in the book business. Shelley says romantic fiction is booming, citing Nicholas Sparks (!), Stephanie Meyer, J.R. Ward, Christine Feehan, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Tess Gerritsen, and Erica Spindler as top names. He did mention that UK readers prefer their romance to be packaged as something else. Books about “aspirational lifestyles” are particularly popular. (I interpreted this as aspiring to be, say, a successful businesswoman rather than a vampire).
Literary agent Erin Niumata and writers Janet Mullany, Nicola Cornick and Rosemary Laurey gave a panel to the Brits about writing for the US market.
After tea (of course) a panel celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the RNA with some excellent reminiscences. I was most impressed that Sophia Weston had been taken to a champagne lunch at the Ritz by the original Mr. Boon of Mills & Boon. Sadly, such occasions are not offered to writers nearly as often as one would wish.
When everyone retired to their rooms to tart up for the gala dinner, I left for the Underground to return to a family party in central London. Being an old church fan, I popped inside St. Alfege, Greenwich (designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, one of my favorite architects). A wind and piano quintet was rehearsing Mozart for a concert. I sat and listened for fifteen minutes, a lovely ending to the day.
Roman Catholics in England labored under severe disadvantages. Before the passage of relief acts culminating in Catholic Emancipation in 1829, a Catholic couldn't attend a university, enter the armed services or professions, or sit in Parliament, without paying lip service to the Church of England. Nevertheless, there were a number of noble families that remained catholic and some of them were rich. The Arundells of Wardour, in Wiltshire, are an interesting example. By cleverly marrying a succession of Catholic heiresses, Lord Arundell held one of England's most prosperous estates in the second half of the eighteenth century.
In the 1770s he commissioned the architect James Paine to build New Wardour Castle, a huge Palladian mansion that included an elaborate chapel. While not quite secret, the chapel was discreetly incorporated into the house so it couldn't be seen from the outside. Inside was another matter: the decor is ornately Roman in style. The 8th Baron Arundell brought a socking great marble altar from Rome and the chapel had to be enlarged. John Soane designed the expansion in 1788 (an early work by the architect who went on to great distinction).
The Arundell family no longer live at Wardour Castle but Chapel has remained in continuous use as the local Catholic parish church.
Mompesson House in Salisbury is a beautiful early 18th century house. If it looks familiar, it may be because it appeared in the movie of Sense and Sensibility, playing the part of Mrs. Jennings' London house. It certainly isn't hard to imagine Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet, dressed in their Jane Austen garb, staying here. Unlike many of the huge British country houses that are open to the public, Mompesson is a nice manageable size that one can imagine living in without an army of servants.
The feature I liked best is the hall and stairway. The plasterwork on the walls and ceiling is simple and elegant -- plain white with no gilt in sight. The walled garden at the back is delightful. A chalkboard was marked up with the names of the roses in bloom.
The house is located in the Close, the area around Salisbury's famous cathedral. I set part of The Wild Marquis in Salisbury (which happens to be the city where I was born). Juliana Merton, the heroine of the book, takes a nostalgic walk thorough the city. The scene was quite easy for me to write because so many buildings remain that existed in 1819. Shown below (left to right): seventeenth century alms houses; the medieval High Street Gate leading into the Close; the spire of the cathedral, seen across the Close.
I'm off to England on Thursday for a family wedding. Unfortunately my laptop goes with me. I have a book to finish so it won't all be fun and games. I also discovered the UK Romantic Novelists Association is holding its conference while I am in London. I've signed up for one day and I'll be fascinated to find out how they do things, compared to the RWA.
The conference takes place at The Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. I'm not sure if it's actually going to be in this incredible Christopher Wren building, right on the Thames. The National Maritime Museum is located here, but there's plenty of room.
My friends Gavin and Deborah gave a party to promote The Wild Marquis. Now understand, they live in Hanover, New Hampshire, the small town that is home to Dartmouth College. We’re not talking the average romance reader here and I figured it could be a tough crowd, so I decided to soften them up with cucumber sandwiches.
I don’t know when the cucumber sandwich was invented. I’m guessing they weren’t around in the Regency. The famous English afternoon tea didn’t come into fashion until the 1840s and cucumber is the quintessential English tea sandwich.
The cucumber sandwich is famous in literature for its star turn in The Importance of Being Earnest. Algernon is expecting his Aunt Augusta, the alarming Lady Bracknell, for tea.* Before she arrives, Jack Worthing turns up and eats all the sandwiches. When Lady B complains, Algie’s manservant, a literary forebear of Jeeves, comes to the rescue and says there were no cucumbers at the market that day, “not even for ready money.” I have an image of the man standing around Covent Garden, brandishing a fistful of pounds notes in a vain effort to score some forbidden fruit. (Yes, cucumber is a fruit according to Wikipedia, the fount of all knowledge).
I know how to make cucumber sandwiches. I am English and learned at my mother’s knees, along with how to eat marmite and make a nice cup of tea. But, because it’s what I do when I cook, I consulted a book: Great British Cooking by Jane Garmey. What Ms. Garmey has to say about cucumber sandwiches is of no importance –I ignored it. But she did provide me with an Oscar Wilde story I never heard before. Apparently a waitress brought him a plate of cucumber sandwiches that he found unsatisfactory. “My dear,” he said, “I asked a for a cucumber sandwich, not a loaf with a field in the middle of it.”
History does not reveal whether Oscar made his own, but he understood the principle. A cucumber sandwich should be slim, elegant, and deceptively inconsequential. A bit like a Wilde play, come to think of it. So here’s my recipe:
Very thinly sliced white bread (or whole wheat if you insist on being healthy but really, why bother?). I use Pepperidge Farm Very Thin
1. Slice the cucumbers very thin. Put them in a colander mixed up with some† salt, weigh them down with a plate, and leave them in the sink to drain for an hour or two.
4. Put two layers of cucumber slices in each sandwich and press flat with your hand so it all sticks together, preferably without becoming totally squashed.
So how did it go? The guests were charming, appreciative and asked intelligent questions. Many of them bought copies of my books. They seemed to like the sandwiches too. Many thanks to my hosts for putting on a lovely event and providing much delicious food in addition to the CSs.
Back to Oscar. I am a big Wilde fan. The title of my first book is a reference to one of his lines (“I can resist anything except temptation”) and the text itself contains a line swiped from one of the plays. If anyone spotted that daring theft (though I prefer to call it a homage) and can cite it, I’ll send them an ARC of The Dangerous Viscount (which happens to contain a similar homage)
Jack. How can you sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be perfectly heartless.
Algernon. Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.
I finally got the go-ahead to reveal the cover of THE DANGEROUS VISCOUNT, which will hit the shelves September 28, 2010. When I saw that gorgeous blue I let out a big, happy "aaaah!" (Given the lack of control we authors have over the covers of our books, it's always a relief when we get a good one.)
Readers of THE WILD MARQUIS may remember Sebastian Iverley as a bespectacled, woman-hating book collector, not the most obvious hero material. To put it bluntly, he's a Regency nerd. When he falls in love, he falls hard, only to discover that the lovely Diana is trifling with him. Hell hath no fury like a bookworm scorned, so he's determined to get back at her. Not only does he conveniently inherit a peerage, he also cleans up very well indeed.
My friends and neighbors, Rick and Emmy, have a little house in Tuscany they bought a few years ago and visit twice a year, renting it out as a vacation home at other times. After I dropped hints too heavy for them to ignore, they invited me to join them for April vacation (Emmy is a schoolteacher and has a week off then.)
The plan was to fly from Montreal to Florence, via Paris. With genius timing, we left the first day European airline traffic went into meltdown due to the eruption of an Icelandic volcano with an endless name. By the time we made it to the airport our Air France flight had been cancelled. Determined to get to Italy, we managed to buy the last three seats on a flight to Rome late that night. (Side note: this small airline also had a flight to Paris that wasn’t cancelled. When we asked why, the counter clerk, who must have skipped Airline Customer Relations 101, informed us with glorious frankness that Air France had really high safety standards and Air Transat was less fussy.) I’ll spare you the details of an endless journey that ended with a five-hour drive from Rome to northern Tuscany. What with the time change it’s hard to figure, but I believe the journey ended up taking about 36 hours.
As a result we were pretty exhausted, but rest was not in the cards. Rick and Emmy have many delightful Italian friends and a group had organized a visit to a Parmesan cheese factory. The only rub was that we had to leave at 7 am the very day after our journey. So, half dead, we piled into a minivan and crossed a mountain range in a snowstorm. This was Italy? Too bleary to notice the less than toasty weather, I had put on my brand new sandals.
In my imagination I had decided a Parmesan cheese factory would be something like a liqueur distillery, probably located in a medieval monastery where ancient recipes had been perfected by wise old monks. Wrong. The setting was rural, agricultural and thoroughly modern. Sadly for my sandals (black patent leather) it was raining. But I am extremely fond of Parmesan cheese (actually all cheese) so I was fascinated to see the process by which the stuff is made. This co-operative caseificio produces 40 giant cheeses a day (each with a “street value” or Whole Foods retail price of about $1500). Thousands of cheeses are stored awaiting aging, a rigorous inspection process, and sale.
At the end of the tour we were treated to a feast of samples: fresh ricotta, salami made from local pigs fed on leftover whey (We got to visit them too. My sandals!), and three different Parmesans – one, two and three years old. The oldest and most expensive is demonstrably superior. The flavor is intense, enhanced by an almost gritty texture. A chunk of it goes superbly with a glass of local wine which was, of course, served with the cheese, even at 11 am. We were pretty hungry and ate well, only to discover that lunch had been laid on at a local restaurant. Five courses and more wine were a harbinger of dietary disasters to follow.
The next day the skies cleared and I was finally able to take in my surroundings. During a few visits to Italy I’ve done the famous parts of Tuscany: Florence, Siena, Arezzo, Montepulciano, and so forth. I was unaware of the existence of the northernmost corner, above the city of Lucca. The Garfagnana region lies between two mountain ranges, the Apuan Alps and the Oracchiella. The area is best known for its quarries, in particular Carrara where Michelangelo got his marble. Tiny villages and ancient towns are perched on hillsides, reached by terrifying mountain roads twisted into hairpins. It’s a different landscape from the conventional Tuscan one, but nonetheless spectacular. My hosts’ house sits in the tiny village of Vibbiana, surrounded by snow-capped crags with a spectacular view of the medieval fortress at Verrucole, a kilometer or two below us.
As keen hikers, Rick and Emmy were initially attracted to the region by the number and variety of walking and climbing trails. Though not a major outdoorswoman myself, I knew what I was getting into: they’ve dragged me over Vermont mountains on foot and skis. I did quail when they pointed at an Alp visible from their house. That’s the Pania di Corfina, they said, a nice easy climb and a rite of passage for our guests. Did I say Alp? More like a Himalaya. Readers, I made it. And it was worth the slog. Marvelous views (too hazy to see the Mediterranean over the next range but I could believe it was there) and a delicious reward of chocolate and oranges. We descended the longer but gentler way, through alpine meadows with wild flowers and patches of snow, reminding me of scenes from Heidi. We’d just disturbed a herd of muffloni (wild sheep) when modern life rudely intruded in the form of Rick’s cell phone. His boss called from Vermont, asking him to find some replacement bolts for an Italian-made hay cutter. Searching for these bullone became a minor theme of the following week.
Another day we drove up to Campocatino, an abandoned high mountain village used in the past for summer livestock grazing. More fabulous views of the two Vagli villages in their picturesque setting on a lake formed by a hydroelectric dam – nature improved by art though not so fun for those whose houses were lost in the drowned valley. We walked a trail further up the mountain to a magical secret place. Built into a sheer cliff face overlooking a narrow gorge, the hermitage of San Viviano, a medieval ascetic, supposedly dates from the fourteenth century.
On a more earthly level, Emmy is a brilliant cook and she loves to shop. Even exploring the local supermarkets is fun, but the best time was weekly market day at Castelnuovo. While Rick went to a guy’s shop in search of the elusive bullone (what is it with men and machine parts?) Emmy and I examined every stall in a market that stretches all over the historic center of the town. We bought purple-tinted artichokes, blood oranges with green leaves still attached, tablecloths printed with designs of olives (only 5 euros each!), lace-trimmed petal-soft cotton scarves, and farro – a local product and the oldest cultivated grain in the world. (Not to be confused with spelt, whatever you do. No chance of that with me since I had no idea what spelt is either).
While Rick and Emmy came to the Garfagnana for the hiking, they stayed for the people. They possess a circle of Italian friends remarkable for their joy and generosity. Communication in a mixture of Italian and English somehow works, despite limited linguistic skills on either side. For my part, a year of Italian in college has been topped up over the decades with vocabulary gleaned from Italian restaurants and opera. I’m strong on food and drama (revenge, passion, curses, and death in all its forms) but not so much on everyday conversation. Somehow it doesn’t matter: as the week progressed I understood better and spoke more (something to do with quantity of red wine drunk) and had a marvelous time.
Sadly, our visit ended too soon. Once we knew our flight was taking off early on Sunday morning, we drove to Florence to spend a day and a night. Much of the day was spent wandering: the Boboli Gardens, the famous piazzas, the Duomo. The lines for the famous museums are endless and we decided to skip them. Even in April the city is chock-a-block with tourists. Yet it isn’t hard to get away and remember that Florence is a city where real people live and work. Not a foreign word was heard in the San Ambrogio market where we gazed on exquisite fresh produce and mouth watering prepared foods.
That evening we walked up to the church of San Miniato al Monte and the dazzling panorama of the city from the heights. Opting for a picnic dinner and early night, we found a small grocery run by Asians (a little touch of New York) and bought tiny spicy stuffed peppers, artichoke hearts in olive oil, and wine. The store owner uncorked our bottle and provided plastic cups. Sitting in front of the Palazzo Pitti we feasted on the last of our three-year-old Parmesan cheese, salami, and bread. Red wine and many toasts to Italy kept us warm despite a chilly wind. And it’s never too cold for a gelato.
Several months ago I stumbled across a description of Lady Jane’s Salon, Manhattan’s only romance reading series. That sounded just my cup of tea so I contacted one of the four organizers, my fellow Regency writer Maya Rodale, and asked how I could get on the roster. Turned out this salon, in only a few months of existence, had got pretty popular: I had to wait six months for a slot.
The group meets on the first Monday of each month and, as befits an organization of New Yorkers, the location is nothing so mundane as a library or bookstore. The location is a bar in Soho called Madame X. The décor can best be described as Victorian brothel: dim light, shabby old furniture and a preponderance of red velvet. I loved it. And so, apparently, do others. I arrived early but there was already a decent crowd and by seven o’clock it was standing room only: about a hundred romance readers, writers and publishing professionals chattering like magpies. But only before, after, and in between the readings. While I and my fellow readers were on stage the concentration of the listeners was all one could wish, rapt silence broken only by pleasing laughter at the right moments and gratifying applause at the end. I couldn’t have asked for a better audience for my selections from The Wild Marquis – and in such a romance savvy crowd I could read some of the naughty bits without blushing (much).
I was joined on the roster by N.K. Jemisin. A selection from The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, her debut fantasy, whetted my appetite for a book that’s in a genre I don’t pay much attention to. At RWA in D.C. last year Kate Noble and I, being members of the small and exclusive group of “N” authors, waved at each across the aisle at the Literacy signing. She has been nominated from a RITA and her new book, The Summer of You, has been winning all sorts of rave reviews. Hearing a chapter of this charming Regency historical told me why. It was definitely Regency night because the last reader was new Avon star Sarah MacLean. I’d already read Nine Rules to Break While Romancing a Rake and adored it. So I wasn’t at all bored to hear her read the brilliant first kiss scene. Nine Rules has made it to the New York Times and USA Today lists this week, a very totally deserved success for the best historical romance debut in years.
I was thrilled that my wonderful agent, Meredith Bernstein, came downtown to see me. From Avon: Carrie Feron, Tessa Woodward and my very own Esi Sogah, looking stunning is a low cut black and white dress. I chatted with Leis Pederson and some other nice ladies from Berkeley and Mary-Theresa Hussey from Silhouette. I’m told there were also people from Orbit and Scholastic in the room.
I was very happy to meet Cara Elliott/Andrea Pickens (Don’t miss her recent release To Sin With A Scoundrel). We’d been emailing back and forth and while the internet is wonderful for forming connections, and even friendships, there’s nothing like being in the same room with one’s friends. Ditto historical novelist and non-fiction writer Leslie Carroll, whom I know from the Beau Monde loop. She’s about to move to Vermont so I should get to see her in the flesh (why does that phrase sound a little creepy?) more often. I’d met Sara Lindsey in DC. She’s doing a library degree and taking a rare book course so we chatted about that mutual interest. Despite her intended avocation, Sara isn’t at all prim and neither is her recent debut Promise Me Tonight. Stacy Agdern invited me to sign my books for stock at Posman Books in Grand Central Station. We sat at the bar for a while and talked books and writing. It’s always a treat to see the lovely Wendy La Capra, who will herself be reading on that stage one of these days.
I ended the evening (quite late) on the outdoor porch in back of the bar with three of the four Lady Jane organizers: Ron Hogan, Hope Tarr and Leanna Renee Hieber, talking books and industry gossip. Among other things we agreed that American historicals are past due for a come-back. Why should Edith Wharton hold the monopoly on the Gilded Age?
I wish I had pictures but, although I packed my camera, I was too busy gabbing to take any. If anyone has any I'd love to get copies.
It’s book launch week and a friend just emailed me and asked what I was doing about it. The answer is, not a lot. I will be blogging quite a bit; the blogs for next week are all written and sent off. I shall stop by a few local bookstores, drop off bookmarks and sign stock. On Saturday I have a reading and signing at my nearest store.
But otherwise there isn’t much I can do. The books are printed. My publisher has taken orders and shipped copies. (OMG paranoid nightmare! Suppose they forgot!) Starting Tuesday, The Wild Marquis will appear on shelves. I hope readers will snap it up, take it home and enjoy it. But there’s not a whole lot I can do to convince a shopper to buy my book.
Instead of sitting around obsessively googling myself every five minutes and checking my Amazon rankings, I have an agenda for the week.
• Buy myself flowers. Tulips are gorgeous right now. And I’m not going to settle for one of those measly bunches of 5 (Didn’t you used to get 6? When did florists get cheap?) I’m going to buy LOTS. More than one vase worth. Maybe enough for three vases.
• Go to the movies. I hardly ever see a film in the theater. I don’t know what’s current but investigating will give me something to do.
• If I run into an acquaintance and they ask me what’s going on I shall shrug and say “Nothing much. Same old same old.”

As apart of our lovely stay here in Toronto, we had the opportunity to listen to four very inspirational, successful women. The purpose of this was for us to learn …
But that being said, I love watching the wrestling, and this week marks 25 years of one particular character ‘The Undertaker’. I used to watch years ago but then there was a time I could not afford to pay for the sports channels, now as I get them for the rugby I have picked up watching wrestling again and I have to say I still love it. If you look at wrestling as a series sport then of course you will be disappointed but it is not the in ring action that really keeps it going, it is the writing, the story lines, rivalries and characters them selves. If you consider the character of the Undertaker and allow one storyline per year (and in reality he may have two or three) and compare that to releasing a book each year, then there are very few series that keep going for that long and allow the main character to alternate between the good guy and the bad ass. Even more traditional forms of soap have very few characters that stay in a show for that long and have major plots on a regular basis. If you want serious sport watch the Olympics if you want great entertainment then sometimes you have to just let yourself ignore the obvious short punches.
I have discussed this film before but have no idea what happened to that post it may have been as part of a challenge, it goes to show the importance of tags at a later date lol. The thing I love about this film as much as the film itself is the idea of a single second or action having the power to change your life opposed to the idea that fate will always bring you back to the same place. Whenever there is a disaster there are always those people who just missed a plane, people who were running late cursing as the missed a bus or train only to later discover that it was actually a blessing. We have all driven past accidents knowing if we had been two minutes earlier we may have been in it. It is that idea of what if vs it was meant to be that I find fascinating, have you ever had a major life changing moment as a result of missing a bus or train?
Now I know Bunny can be a little annoying to some people but personally I love her quirkiness and that she encourages young girls to just be themselves and not worry about being ‘normal’, whatever that is supposed to be on any given day. I really like this series because we have all seen those products on TV that seem like they would be really cool, very occasionally we take the plunge and buy one, half the time we go on to be disappointed. I love that she really does put these products to the test, if someone tells her she has done it wrong she often does a second follow up video having tried viewer suggestions. She buys these products herself and has no qualms about telling it as it is, and inspires honesty, integrity and individuality as traits her viewers should value, plus the monster loves watching her as well.

Book Review: Thyssen in the 20th Century – Volume 4: ‘The Thyssens. Family and Fortune’, by Simone Derix, published by Schöningh Verlag, Germany, 2016
Reviewing this book is a huge aggravation to us, as so much of it has been derived from our groundbreaking work on the Thyssens, published a decade earlier, for which the author grants us not a single credit. It is surprising that Simone Derix does not have the respect for professional ethics to acknowledge our historiographic contribution; especially since she stated in a 2009 conference that non-academic works, whilst creating feelings of fear amongst academics of losing their prerogative to interpret history, are taking on increasing importance.
Ms Derix herself is not the fearful type of course, though somewhat hypocritical. She appears to be preemptively obedient and committed to pleasing her presumably partisan paymasters, in the form of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation. Alas, she is clearly not the smartest person either; writing, for instance, that Heinrich Lübke, Director of the August Thyssen Bank (he died in 1962), was the same Heinrich Lübke who was President of Germany (in that position until 1969).
But Ms Derix’s intellectual shortcomings are much more serious than simple factual errors, which should, in any case, have been picked up by at least one of her two associate writers, three project leaders, four academic mentors and six research assistants. She is in all seriousness trying to convince us that research into the lives of wealthy persons is a brand new branch of academia, and that she is its most illustrious, pioneering proponent. Does she not know that recorded history has traditionally been by the rich, of the rich and for the rich only? Has she forgotten that even basic reading and writing were privileges of the few until some hundred and fifty years ago?
At the same time, contrary to us, Derix does not appear to have had any first hand experience of exceptionally rich people at all, particularly Thyssens. Her sponsorship, earlier in her studies, by the well-endowed Gerda Henkel Foundation, was presumably an equally ‘arm’s length’ relationship. Rich people only mix with rich people, and unless Derix got paid by the word, there is no evidence that she ever in any way qualified for serious comment on their modus operandi.
What is new, of course, is that feudalism has been swept away and replaced by democratic societies, where knowledge is broadly accessible and equality before the law is paramount. Yes, her assertion that super-rich people’s archives are difficult to access is true. They only ever want you to know glorious things about them and keep the realities cloaked behind their outstanding wealth. To suggest that this series is being issued because the Thyssens have suddenly decided to engage in an exercise of honesty, generously letting official historians browse their most private documents, however, is ludicrous. The only reason why Simone Derix is revealing some controversial facts about the Thyssens is because we already revealed them. The difference is that she repackages our evidence in decidedly positive terms, so as to comply with the series’ overall damage limitation program.
Thus, Derix seems to believe she can run with the fox and hunt with the hounds; a balancing act made considerably easier by her pronouncement, early on, that any considerations of ethics or morality are to be categorically excluded from her study. The fact that the Thyssens camouflaged their German companies (including those manufacturing weapons and using forced labour) behind international strawmen, with the benefit of facilitating the large-scale evasion of German taxes, is re-branded by Derix as being a misleading description ‘made from a state perspective’ and which ‘tried to establish a desired order rather than depict an already existing order’. As if ‘the state’, as we democrats understand it, is some kind of devious entity that needs fending off, rather than the collective support mechanism of all equal, law-abiding citizens.
It is just one of the many statements that appears to show how much the arguably authoritarian mindset of her sponsors may have rubbed off on her. The fact that academics employed by publicly funded universities should be used thus as PR-agents for the self-serving entities that are the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the Thyssen Industrial History Foundation and the ThyssenKrupp Konzern Archive is highly questionable by any standards, but particularly by supposedly academic ones. Especially when they claim to be independent.
In Derix’s world, the Thyssens are still (!) mostly referred to as ‘victims’, ‘(tax) refugees’, ‘dispossessed’ and ‘disenfranchised’, even if she admits briefly, once or twice in 500 pages, that ‘in the long-term it seems that they were able always to secure their assets and keep them available for their own personal needs’.
As far as the Thyssens’ involvement with National Socialism is concerned, she calls them ‘entangled’ in it, ‘related’ to it, being ‘present’ in it and ‘living in it’. With two or three exceptions they are never properly described as the active, profiting contributors to the existence and aims of the regime. Rather, as in volume 2 (‘Forced Labour at Thyssen’), the blame is again largely transferred to their managers. This is very convenient for the Thyssens, as the families of these men do not have the resources to finance counter-histories to clear their loved ones’ names.
But for Simone Derix to say that ‘from the perspective of nation states these (Thyssen managers) had to appear to be hoodlums’ really oversteps the boundaries of fair comment. The outrageousnness of her allegation is compounded by the fact that she fails to quote evidence, as reproduced in our book, showing that allied investigators made clear reference to the Thyssens themselves being the real perpetrators and obfuscators.
Yet still, Derix purports to be invoking German greatness, honour and patriotism in her quest for Thyssen gloss. She alleges bombastically that the mausoleum at Landsberg Castle in Mülheim-Kettwig ‘guarantees (the family’s) presence and attachment to the Ruhr’ and that there is an ‘indissoluble connection between the Thyssen family, their enterprises, the region and their catholic faith’. But she fails to properly range them alongside the industrialist families of Krupp, Quandt, Siemens and Bosch, preferring to surround their name hyperbolically with those of the Bismarck, Hohenzollern, Thurn und Taxis and Wittelsbach ruling dynasties.
In reality, many Thyssen heirs chose to turn their backs on Germany and live transnational lives abroad. Their mausoleum is not even accessible to the general public. Contrary to what Derix implies, the iconic name that engenders such a strong feeling of allegiance in Germany is that of the public Thyssen (now ThyssenKrupp) company alone, as one of the main national employers. This has nothing whatsoever to do with any respect for the descendants of the formidable August Thyssen, most of whom are, for reason of their chosen absence, completely unknown in the country.
In this context, it is indicative that Simone Derix categorises the Thyssens as ‘old money’, as well as ‘working rich people’. But while in the early 19th century Friedrich Thyssen was already a banker, it was only his sons August (75% share) and Josef (25% share), from 1871 onwards (and with the ensuing profits from the two world wars) who created through their relentless work, and that of their employees and workers, the enormous Thyssen fortune. Their equal was never seen again in subsequent Thyssen generations.
Thus the Thyssens became ‘ultra-rich’ and were completely set apart from the established aristocratic-bourgeois upper class. They could hardly be called ‘old money’ and neither could their heirs, despite trying everything in their power to adopt the trappings of the aristocracy (which beggars the question why volume 6 of the series is called ‘Fritz and Heinrich Thyssen – Two bourgeois lives in the public eye’). This included marrying into the Hungarian, increasingly faux aristocracy, whereby, even Derix has to admit, by the 1920s every fifth Hungarian citizen pretended to be an aristocrat.
The line of Bornemiszas, for instance, which Heinrich married into, were not the old ‘ruling dynastic line’ that Derix still pretends they were. The Thyssen-Bornemiszas came to be connected with the Dutch royals not because Heinrich’s wife Margit was such a (self-styled) ‘success’ at court, but because the Thyssens had important business interests in that country. Thus Heinrich became a banker to the Dutch royal household, as well as a personal friend of Queen Wilhelmina’s husband Prince Hendrik.
The truth is: apart from such money-orientated connections, neither the German nor the English or any other European nobility welcomed these parvenus into their immediate ranks (religion too played a role, of course, as the Thyssens were and are catholics). Until, that is, social conventions had moved on enough by the 1930s and their daughters were able to marry into the truly old Hungarian dynasties of Batthyany and Zichy.
But until that time, based on their outstanding wealth, this did not stop the brothers from adopting many of the domains of grandeur for themselves. Fritz Thyssen, according to Derix, even spent his time in the early 1900s importing horses from England, introducing English fox hunting to Germany and owning a pack of staghounds. He also had his servant quarters built lower down from his own in his new country seat, specifically to signal class distinction.
These are indeed remarkable new revelations showing that the traditional image put out by the Thyssen organisation of bad cop German, ‘temporarily’ fascist industrialist Fritz Thyssen, good cop Hungarian ‘nobleman’ Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza is even more misleading than we always thought.
Truly lamentable are Derix’s attempts to portray Fritz Thyssen as a devout, christian peacenik and centrist party member. And so are her lengthy contortions in presenting Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza as the perfectly assimilated Hungarian country squire. She does, however, report that Heinrich’s wife had stated he did not speak a word of the language, which does not stop Felix de Taillez in volume 6 writing that he did speak Hungarian. ‘If you can’t beat them, confuse them’ was Heini Thyssen’s motto. Clearly, it has also become the motto of these Thyssen-financed academics.
Meanwhile, Derix’s book is the first work supported by the Thyssen organisation to confirm that Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza did retain his German (then Prussian) citizenship. She also does venture to state that his adoption of the Hungarian nationality ‘might’ have been ‘strategic’. But these gems of truthfulness are swamped under the fountains of her gushing propaganda designed to make the second generation Thyssens look better than they were. This includes her development of August Junior’s role from black sheep of the family to committed businessman.
On the other hand, the author still fails to explain any business-related details on the much more important Heinrich Thyssen’s life in England at the turn of the century (cues: banking and diplomacy). How exactly did the family come to be closely acquainted with the likes of Henry Mowbray Howard (British liaison officer at the French Naval Ministry) or Guy L’Estrange Ewen (special envoy to the British royals)? A huge chance of genuine transparency was wasted here.
Derix also fails to draw attention to the fact that the August Thyssen and Josef Thyssen branches of the family developed in very different ways. August’s heirs exploited, left and betrayed Germany and were decidedly ‘nouveau riche’, except for Heinrich’s son Heini Thyssen-Bornemisza and his son Georg Thyssen, who really did involve themselves in the management of their companies.
By contrast, Josef’s heirs Hans and Julius Thyssen stayed in Germany (respectively were prepared to return there in the 1930s from Switzerland when foreign exchange restrictions came into force), paid their taxes, worked in the Thyssen Konzern before selling out in the 1940s, pooling their resources and adopting careers in the professions. Only the Josef Thyssen side of the family is listed in the German Manager Magazine Rich List; but for unexplained reasons Derix leaves these truly ‘working rich’ Thyssens largely unmentioned in her book.
Fortunately, Derix does not concentrate all her efforts in creative fiction and plagiarisation, but manages to provide at least some substantive politico-economic facts as well. So she reveals that Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza was a member of the supervisory board of the United Steelworks of Düsseldorf until 1933, i.e. until after Adolf Hitler’s assumption of power. This, combined with her statement that ‘Heinrich seems to have orientated himself towards Berlin on a permanent basis as early as 1927/8 (from Scheveningen in The Netherlands)’ pokes a hole in one of the major Thyssen convenience legends, that of Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza having had his main residence in neutral Switzerland from 1932 onwards (i.e. conveniently from before Hitler’ assumption of power; having ‘left Germany just in time’); though this does not stop Derix from subsequently repeating that fallacy just the same (- ‘If you can’t beat them, confuse them’-).
Fact is that, despite buying Villa Favorita in Lugano, Switzerland in 1932, Heinrich Thyssen continued to spend the largest amounts of his time living a hotel life in a permanent suite in Berlin and elsewhere and also kept a main residence in Holland (where Heini Thyssen grew up almost alone, except for the staff). His Ticino lawyer Roberto van Aken had to remind him in 1936 that he still had not applied for permanent residency in Switzerland. It was not until November 1937 that Heinrich Thyssen and his wife Gunhilde received their Swiss foreigner passes (see ‘The Thyssen Art Macabre’, page 116).
Derix also readjusts the old Thyssen myth that Fritz Thyssen and Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza went their separate ways in business as soon as they inherited from their father, who died in 1926. We always said that the two brothers remained strongly interlinked until well into the second half of the 20th century. And hey presto, here we have Simone Derix alleging now that ‘historians so far have always assumed that the separation had been concluded by 1936’. She adds ‘despite all attempts at separating the shares of Fritz Thyssen and Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, the fortunes of Fritz and Heinrich remained interlocked (regulated contractually) well into the time after the second world war’.
But it is her next sentence that most infuriates: ‘Obviously it was very difficult for outsiders to recognise this connection’. The truth of the matter is that the situation was opaque because the Thyssens and their organisation went to extraordinary lengths and did everything in their power to obfuscate matters, particularly as it meant hiding Fritz Thyssen’s and Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza’s joint involvement in supporting the Nazi regime.
Amongst the Thyssens’ many advisors, the author introduces Dutchman Hendrik J Kouwenhoven as the main connecting link between the brothers, who ‘opened up opportunities and thought up financial instruments’. He worked from 1914 at the family’s Handels en Transport Maatschappij Vulcaan and then at their Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart (BVHS) in Rotterdam from its official inception in 1918 to his sacking by Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza during the second world war.
The asset management or trust company of BVHS was called Rotterdamsch Trustees Kantoor (RTK), which Derix describes as ‘repository for the finance capital of the Thyssen enterprises, as well as for the Thyssens’ private funds’. She does not say when it was created. ‘Its offices and all the important papers that Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza had lodged (at RTK) were all destroyed in a German aerial bombardment of Rotterdam on 14.05.1940’, according to Derix. To us this sounds like a highly suspicious piece of information.
Of the files of BVHS she curtly says that ‘a complete set of source materials is not available’. How convenient, especially since no-one outside the Thyssen organisation will ever be able to verify this claim truly independently; or at least until the protective mantle of Professor Manfred Rasch, head of the ThyssenKrupp Konzern Archive, retires.
Derix alludes to ‘the early internationalisation of the Thyssen Konzern from 1900’, ascribing her knowledge of its bases in raw material purchases and the implementation of a Thyssen-owned trading and transport network to Jörg Lesczenski, who published two years after us (and whose work, like that of Derix herself, was backed by the Fritz Thyssen Foundation). But she leaves cross-references aside concerning the first tax havens (including that of The Netherlands) which were set up in the outgoing 19th century, conveniently referring this area to ‘research that should be carried out in the future’.
Derix names the 1906 Transportkontor Vulkan GmbH Duisburg-Hamborn with its Rotterdam branch (see above) and the 1913 Deutsch-Überseeische Handelsgesellschaft der Thyssenschen Werke mbH of Buenos Aires (by the way: to this day ThyssenKrupp AG is a major trader in raw materials). She also states that American loans to the Thyssen Konzern started in 1919 via the ‘Vulcaan Coal Company’ (failing to mention that this company was based in London).
According to Derix, August Thyssen began transferring his shares in the Thyssen companies to his sons Fritz and Heinrich in 1919, first those of Thyssen & Co. and from 1921 onwards those of the August Thyssen smelting works. She then adds that existing Thyssen institutions outside of Germany were used in order to carry out this transfer.
From 1920 onwards, Fritz Thyssen began to buy real estate in Argentina. Meanwhile, the Thyssens’ Union Banking Corporation (UBC), founded in 1924 in the Harriman Building on New York’s Broadway, is described solely in the language of the ‘transnational dimension of the Thyssens’ financial network’ and as being ‘the American branch of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart’.
We had already detailed in our book how Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, via Hendrik Kouwenhoven, set up in Switzerland the Kaszony Family Foundation in 1926 to lodge his inherited participations and the Rohoncz Collection Foundation in 1931 to place art works he bought as easily movable capital investments from 1928 onwards. Now Derix writes that the Rohoncz Foundation too was founded in 1926. This is astonishing, since it means that this entity was set up a whole two years prior to Heinrich Thyssen buying the first painting to find its way into what he called the ‘Rohoncz Castle Collection’ (despite the fact that none of the pictures ever went anywhere near his Hungarian, then Austrian castle, in which he had stopped living in 1919).
The timing of the creation of this offshore instrument just proves how contrived Heinrich’s reinvention as a ‘fine art connaisseur and collector’ really was.
Derix even freely admits that these Thyssen family foundations were ‘antagonists of states and governments’. However, just like Johannes Gramlich in volume 3 (‘The Thyssens as Art Collectors’), she too leaves the logistics of the transfer of some 500 paintings by Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza into Switzerland in the 1930s completely unmentioned, including the fact that this represented a method of massive capital flight out of Germany. The associated topics of tax evasion and tax avoidance stay completely off her academic radar; ignoring our documented proof.
In another bold rewriting of official Thyssen history the author states that the Thyssen brothers frequently acted in parallel in their financial affairs. And so it was that the Pelzer Foundation and Faminta AG came to be created , by Kouwenhoven, in Switzerland, on behalf of Fritz Thyssen and his immediate family. (Derix is hazy about exact dates. We published: 1929 for Faminta AG and the late 1930s for the Pelzer Foundation).
Derix points out that these two instruments also allowed secret transactions between the Thyssen brothers. She adds enigmatically that ‘Faminta protected the foreign assets of the August Thyssen smelting works from a possible confiscation by the German authorities’, whilst withholding any reference to a time scale of when such a confiscation might have been on the cards (is she suggesting a possibility prior to Fritz Thyssen’s flight in September 1939, i.e. anytime during the period 1929-1939?).
At the same time, in the 1920s, Fritz and Amelie Thyssen established a firm base in the south of the German Reich, namely in Bavaria – far away from the Thyssen heartland of the Ruhr – which Derix brands as a fact which has ‘so far been almost completely ignored by historians’. Of course, not only was this most royalist of German states close to Switzerland, but it was also, at that time, the cradle of the Nazi movement. Adolf Hitler also much preferred Munich to Berlin.
All the family’s financial instruments, meanwhile, continued to be administrated by Rotterdamsch Trustees Kantoor in The Netherlands. ‘These new Thyssen banks, companies, holdings and foundations created since the 1920s were connected to the Thyssen industrial enterprises (in Germany) through participations’, Derix continues.
These enterprises etc. were also supportive of the rising Nazi movement of course, such as when their Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart around 1930 demonstrably made a loan of some 350,000 RM to the Nazi party, at a time when both Fritz Thyssen and Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza had controlling interests in BVHS.
According to Derix, it was starting in 1930 that Heinrich Thyssen sold his shares in the United Steelworks to Fritz while Fritz sold his Dutch participations to Heinrich and as a result Heinrich Thyssen alone was in control of the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart from 1936 onwards.
Specifically, it was a Thyssen entity called Holland-American Investment Corporation (HAIC) which facilitated Fritz Thyssen’s capital flight from Germany. According to Derix, ‘(in the autumn of 1933, the Pelzer Foundation acquired) shares in HAIC from Fritz and therefore his Dutch participations which were pooled therein. This was done in agreement with the German authorities who knew of HAIC. But in 1940, the Germans found out that there was a considerable discrepancy between the 1,5 million Reichsmark of Dutch participations held in HAIC as had been stated and the actual, true value, which turned out to be 100 to 130 million RM.’
Considering that Heinrich’s wife stated that he had taken some 200 million Swiss Francs of his assets into neutral countries, this would mean that, together, the Thyssen brothers possibly succeeded in extracting from Germany the cash equivalent of close to the complete monetary value of the Thyssen enterprises! This is not, however, a conclusion drawn by Simone Derix.
One begins to wonder what there was actually left to confiscate from Fritz Thyssen once he fled Germany at the onset of war in 1939. Derix admits that his flight happened not least because he preferred to complete his self-interested financial transactions from the safety of Switzerland, with the help of Heinrich Blass at Credit Suisse in Zurich.
Although we had managed to unearth several leads, we did not know that the real overall extent of the Thyssen brothers’ capital flight was quite this drastic. For Simone Derix to point this out on behalf of the Thyssen organisation is significant; even if she fails to draw any appropriate conclusions, as they would most likely be at odds with her blue-sky remit.
Truly, and in the words of the far more experienced Harald Wixforth no less: for these ‘mega-capitalist(s) (…) the profit of their enterprises (i.e. their own) always assumed far greater priority than the public’s welfare’.
In this readjusted official light, Derix’s admission that Fritz and Amelie Thyssen’s ‘expropriation’ in late 1939 ‘did not directly result in any curtailment of their way of life’ no longer comes as any surprise.
The author also finally reveals for the first time official departure details of Fritz Thyssen’s daughter Anita, her husband Gabor and their son Federico Zichy to Argentina. Apparently they travelled from Genua, sailing on 17.02.1940 on board the ship Conte Grande, bound for Buenos Aires. In order to provide her with befitting financial support, shares in Faminta AG had been transferred to the Übersee-Trust of Vaduz shortly beforehand, of which Anita Zichy-Thyssen, a Hungarian national, was the sole beneficiary.
Derix then states that by April 1940, Fritz Thyssen ‘used his political knowledge on the German Reich and the German armaments industry as an asset that he could use in exchange for support for his personal wishes’. But what exactly were those wishes? The hubristically delusional Fritz obviously thought he could get rid of Hitler as easily as he had helped him get into power. For this, he was prepared to share German state secrets with French Foreign Minister Alexis Leger and Armament Minister Raoul Dautry in Paris. But for Derix, rather than being anything as contentious as active treason or an expression of power, his behaviour is nothing more than an ultra-rich man’s legitimate right to express his elevated lifestyle choices.
While all previous Thyssen biographers, apart from us, have purported that Fritz and Amelie Thyssen suffered tremendous ‘excrutiations’ during their time in concentration camps, Derix confirms our information that they spent most of their German captivity in the comfortable, private sanatorium of Dr Sinn in Berlin-Neubabelsberg. She writes that they were kept there ‘on Hitler’s personal orders’ and ‘on trust’, though Fritz and Heinrich’s personal friend Hermann Göring, during his post-war allied interrogations, stated that their privileged treatment had been down to his initiative. After Neubabelsberg, they were taken to different concentration camps, but Derix is now forced to admit that they enjoyed ‘a special status’ which is retraceable ‘for each and every location’. Which makes one wonder, why German historians previously felt the need to misrepresent these facts.
Derix’s list of Fritz Thyssen’s allied, post-war interrogations is particularly noteworthy. It illustrates the seriousness in which he was considered to have been guilty of (albeit blue collar) war crimes, which should have been punishable by incarceration:
In July 1945 he was taken to Schloss Kransberg near Bad Nauheim, namely to the so-called ‘US/UK Dustbin Centre for scientists and industrialists’. In August, he went on to Kornwestheim before being taken, in September, to the 7th Army Interrogation Center in Augsburg.
Derix also vagely asserts that Fritz Thyssen was interrogated at some point ‘in 1945’ by Robert Kempner, chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg trials.
Thyssen suffered a collapse and had to go into medical care. He was taken to the US prisoners’ camp of Seckenheim, then to Oberursel. His health deteriorated. From April to November 1946 he went through various hospitals and convalescent homes between Königstein (where he made a surprise recovery) and Oberursel. From November 1946 onwards, he was at the Nuremberg follow-up trials as a witness (one presumes in the cases of Alfried Krupp and Friedrich Flick amongst others), while receiving continuous hospital treatment in Fürth.
On 15.01.1947 Fritz Thyssen was released to join his wife Amelie in Bad Wiessee. This was followed by his German denazification proceedings in Königstein, where he and Amelie lived at the sanatorium of Dr Amelung. In that court, as befitting his insincere character, Fritz Thyssen described himself as penniless.
Meanwhile, according to Derix, Anita Zichy-Thyssen made contact with Edmund Stinnes, who lived in the US and his brother-in-law Gero von Schulze-Gaevernitz, a close collaborator of US-secret service chief Allen Dulles. In the spring of 1947, ‘hoping to facilitate exit permits for her parents to go to America’, she met former US-senator Burton K Wheeler in Argentina, who travelled to Germany in 1948 ‘in order to help Fritz Thyssen out of his denazification problems’. It is certainly an aspect of high-level influence which we documented even more intensively, but which, astonishingly, Johannes Bähr in volume 5 (‘Thyssen in the Adenauer Period’) of the series has totally rejected.
Another Thyssen who should have had problems with his denazification, but didn’t, was Heinrich’s son Stephan Thyssen-Bornemisza.
While his brother Heini Thyssen went to the German school in The Hague, Stephan had boarded at the Lyceum Alpinum in Zuoz, Switzerland, where most pupils were from German speaking Switzerland, The Netherlands and the German Reich, respectively were Germans living abroad. Consequently, the school ran three houses named ‘Teutonia’, ‘Orania’ and ‘Helvetia’. After studying chemistry in Zurich and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he became an assistant at a research laboratory of the Shell Petroleum Company in St Louis. He then wrote his dissertation at Budapest University and began working in natural resources deposit research.
Since 1932, whilst living in Hanover, Stephan worked for Seismos GmbH, a prospecting company founded in 1921 by Deutsch-Lux, Phoenix, Hoesch, Rheinstahl and Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks AG. Derix writes: ‘From 1927 Gelsenkirchener, which belonged to the United Steelworks founded in 1926, was the main shareholder, holding 50% of the shares. This means Seismos came under Fritz Thyssen’s part of the family inheritance. (…) In the 1920s, prospecting groups of Seismos worked for oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell or Roxana Petroleum in Texas, Louisiana and Mexico, looking for Oil. (…) Its radius then extended to the Near East, South-Eastern Europe and England’.
In 1937, Seismos was bought for 1.5 million RM by Heinrich Thyssen and incorporated into his Thyssensche Gas- and Waterworks. During the war, according to Derix, the company was ‘involved in the exploitation of raw materials in the (Nazi) occupied territories (…) During their withdrawal from the Eastern Ukraine during the 1943 tank battle of Kursk they had to leave behind much equipment’.
So, of no little importance for a company which so far, in Thyssen-backed histories, had been portrayed, if at all, as being of little consequence.
And not for the secretive Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza either, whose son Heini Thyssen shortly after the war would get his Swiss lawyer Roberto van Aken to lie to the US visa application department thus: ‘From the advent of the Nazis’ rise to power, and particularly from 1938 onwards, Dr Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza’s (…) corporations were directed with the definitive purpose of minimising the Nazi armament efforts’ (The Thyssen Art Macabre, page 207).
It is, if anything, in that same obfuscating spirit that Derix still conceals the fact that the Seismos company moved its headquarters from Hanover to the Harz mountains during the war, where the Nazis’ weapons of mass destruction program (V-rockets) would come to be based.
Derix reveals that Stephan Thyssen-Bornemisza was a member of the Nazi Aircorps and confirms he was a contributing member of the SS. Nazi officials apparently declared Stephan Thyssen’s political stance to be ‘beyond all doubt’. But Derix cannot bring herself to even mention, let alone detail his additional involvement with another company, namely Maschinen- und Apparatebau AG (MABAG) of Nordhausen, also in the Harz.
We had already established that Stephan Thyssen had become chairman of the supervisory board of MABAG in the early years of the war. This company, in conjunction with IG Farben, ‘had built a vast network of caves and tunnels in the Kohnstein mountain near Nordhausen equipped with tanks and pumps (…). From Februar 1942, Armaments and Munitions Minister Albert Speer recommended all possible support for the development of rockets. This represented massively ambitious armaments manufacturing plans and a great deal more work for MABAG, who, under the control of the Wehrmacht, were now also producing turbo fuel pumps for V-rockets’ (The Thyssen Art Macabre, page 160).
We had speculated that Stephan’s position of chairman of MABAG must have been due to a major investment made by his father Heinrich. While Simone Derix entirely fails to address any aspects of this topic, the lawyer and historian Frank Baranowski has unearthed a highly important document and explains on his website:
‘In 1940, the Deutsche Petroleum Konzern, following a change in their management, divested itself of all its works which did not fit into their framework of petroleum and coal extraction, including MABAG. Deutsche Bank negotiated the transfer of the share capital of 1 million Reichsmark into various hands. The majority was acquired by the solicitor and notary Paul Langkopf of Hanover (590,000 RM), which was most likely done on the orders of a client who wished to remain anonymous. Smaller share parcels were held by the Deutsche Bank in Leipzig (158,000 RM) and in Nordhausen (14,000 RM) as well as by Stephan Thyssen-Bornemisza in Hanover (50,000 RM). On 14.09.1940 MABAG elected its new supervisory board: Director Schirner, Paul Langkopf, Stephan Thyssen-Bornemisza and the Leipzig bank director Gustav Köllmann. (MABAG came to see itself as a company entirely geared to the production of armaments, …..including grenades, grenade launchers …….and turbo pumps for the A4-rockets)’.
It just so happens that Paul Langkopf was a professional whose services had been engaged by various members of the Thyssen family over the years. It can be presumed with near certainty that the ‘anonymous’ shareholder was Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. The secrecy of the transaction fits his style completely. And while Baranowski’s and our views on the use of forced labour by MABAG differ, his evidence is another indication towards the fact that Heinrich was definitely 100% pro-Nazi during the war, even while he was apparently retiring from the world, far away in his Swiss safehaven, pretending to have nothing to do with anything.
The great Simone Derix, meanwhile, prefers to concentrate on relatively trivial revelations such as the fact that Stephan’s mother Margit also lived in Switzerland with her second husband, the ‘germanophile’, ‘antisemitic’ Janos Wettstein von Westersheimb, who lost his job at the Hungarian embassy in Berne when the war turned in 1943. Apparently, she lobbied ‘for Stephan to be allowed out of Germany (after the war) via Heinrich Rothmund, who during the war had been responsible in large parts for the anti-Jewish asylum policies of Switzerland’.
Finally Simone Derix covers two other important topics in her book – as did we, albeit to a different degree -; namely: 1.) The Thyssens’ pre-war London gold deposits and their fate during, respectively after the war and 2.) the removal of the Thyssens’ and Dutch royals’ share certificates from the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart in Rotterdam to the August Thyssen Bank in Berlin during the war, and their return to Rotterdam after the war, through an illegal act by a Dutch Military Mission, code named ‘Operation Juliana’. We will analyse the coverage of those topics more adequately in our reviews of Jan Schleusener’s, Harald Wixforth’s and Boris Gehlen’s forthcoming volumes.
In both matters, members and associates of the Thyssen family played questionable roles, using their high-level (diplomatic and other) positions, to help the Thyssens play off one host nation against another, in their pursuit of limitless personal advantage. Simone Derix only takes her critical analysis as far as to say that these interferences allowed smaller states such as The Netherlands or Switzerland to pressurise victorious powers of the second world war in order to safeguard their own national interests in the Thyssens’ fortune.
While our book has been called a possible ‘handbook for revolution’, Derix describes hers as ‘a model showing the way concerning the central, investigative strands for a history of the infrastructures of wealth’. She evokes the driving forces of ‘jealousy’ à la Ralf Dahrendorf, by the general public towards the super-rich, while ignoring the concept of ‘anger’ at their selfish sense of perennial legal immunity, as described by many such as Tom Wohlfahrt.
Simone Derix’s writing style is very clear and during her book presentation at the Historisches Kolleg in Munich, the suave voice of the specially engaged Bavarian Radio reader made the passages sound like high literature, marinated in integrity. However, this academic, who was introduced to the audience by Professor Margit Szöllösi-Janze as ‘elite researcher’, definitely arrogates to herself a greater authority in broadcasting historical judgements than she is currently entitled to.
At the subsequent podium conversation with the historian and journalist Dr Joachim Käppner of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Derix rejected the concepts of power and of guilt unequivocally on behalf of the Thyssen family. In doing so, however, she had to be coaxed by Käppner repeatedly to focus her extremely hesitant flow of answers, which gave every impression, nevertheless, of having been pre-agreed.
Let’s hope Simone Derix does not remain the only contributor of the series to formulate answers to these important questions – But with more honesty, hopefully, if not greater independence from the questionable role of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation.
We offer systems and strategies for trading stocks in a tough market. We have the experience to help you conquer the world of stock trading. Simple and straight-forward, trading stocks is the best way to get your feet wet in the world of investing. The methods are many and varied, but we’ll talk about the three most popular ways to trade stocks. So, let’s get started – this won’t take very long, I promise.
The long-term “buy and hold” method is the oldest and most used to trade stocks. You could spend ten years reading books by proponents of this method. It’s tried and true, so long as you have the patience to wait while trading stocks. This just means that you buy and hold stocks for a long period. How long is long? At least a year and probably much longer.
This is my style. Day Traders profit from small moves (up or down, makes no difference). The point is, it’s short-term and the desire is to accumulate gains from many quick trades that scalp small profits. Of course, you have to pay the cost of more commissions, but it’s the net after expenses of more wins than losses that is the goal. When the day is over, the trades are over and tomorrow the game begins once more. The only way to get the experience required for proficiency is to practice paper-trading in simulation. You need focus that can only come from planning and practice before you start trading stocks.
This is the middle ground method – somewhere between long-term and day trading stocks. Usually if you swing trade, you hold your position for a few days or weeks. Swing traders are the ones who use all those technical indicators and drive everyone nuts with their constant analysis of all possibilities.
Which method you choose is dependent upon your individual style and how much effort you want to put into trading stocks. If you are busy with family and career, then long-term stock trading is probably for you. If you like excitement and anxiety, then you just might be a stock day trader. If you are the middle-of-the-road type, you’re more than likely a swing stock trader.
Regardless of which stock trading method you decide to use (maybe all 3?) you must get the knowledge you need to make good decisions. After all, whether you lose your money in one day or if it takes a year, you still lost it, didn’t you? We’ve all been there, but you can overcome the negative side.
When you buy a share of stock, you are purchasing a small piece of that company. Stocks are called shares of the business and the purchase of those shares is known as trading stocks.
When you check on stock prices, the information you receive is on common stock, the usual type of shares held by investors.
As owner of a piece of the business, you receive dividends (if they pay them). That’s the major difference between preferred stock and common. Preferred stockholders receive dividends first when trading stocks.
There are different type orders you place with your broker to invest in trading stocks. Let’s just review some of them:
This is the most common and quickest way to buy or sell stock. You place a market order and almost instantly a buyer or seller is found for you. You are saying that you will accept the amount that is currently the market price. It’s easy, but you may not get what you want. Things happen fast in the market and you might not wind up where you wanted to be trading stocks.
Now, this will cost you more in broker commissions, but your trade will not be completed unless you receive the exact amount you indicated in your limit order. This can prevent you from getting filled, but at least you didn’t get a surprise.
I think this is the most important of all orders. You place a stop loss order at a price below the current market. That way, if the market makes a quick drop, you won’t be caught in the “falling knife,” when prices plummet and you are left in the dust trading stocks. It’s sort of an insurance policy reducing your risk in your trade and I believe it is vital to use stop loss orders.
Now the beauty of this order is that, while like a stop loss order, it gives you protection, but it’s protecting your gains instead of limiting losses while trading stocks. If your trade is moving along and you’ve made some profit, you want to protect that, and a trailing stop order will do that trading stocks. As the name implies, it trails along as the price goes up. Your pluses continue to add up. Ah, it’s a beautiful thing.
Simply said, this order is only good until the market closes. Tomorrow you will have to place it again before trading stocks again.
If you properly prepare and gain confidence, you can trade stocks like a pro and I hope you do. Trading stocks doesn’t have to be difficult. Remember that becoming a successful investor doesn’t happen overnight. But with time and determination you can certainly become profitable at trading stocks.
The Charles C. Myers Library has installed two water bottle fillers to enable easy filling of reusable water bottles while counting the number of disposable water bottles saved from landfills. So far, in less than 2 weeks of use, the UD community has saved nearly 1,000 bottles!
Installed in an effort to encourage behavioral change to help the UD community go green, the bottle fillers were funded, in part, by a Sustainable Dubuque grant.
The April 8 event is a collaboration between the UD Web of Life student organization and the library staff. Web of Life will host their annual Water Bottle Challenge in conjunction with the reception celebrating the new fillers. Refreshments will be provided… and water, of course!
Anne Marie Gruber, assistant director for library instruction and public services, and chair of the library’s Green Team commented, “In the past five years, the library has reduced paper use by 50%, but we knew there were other ways we could help facilitate sustainability. Going green doesn’t have to be unattainable—it starts with individual, daily steps that, when added together, can make a big impact. If we can encourage bigger changes on campus, all the better!”
“We have many shops in Ipoh and competition is very strong. Our competitors always launch promotions to attract the customers. The prices offered are at break-even, making things difficult especially in covering our expenses. Our business was badly affected and many of our staffs left. We decided to consult Master Tham’s feng shui expertise. It is amazing that this particular branch with feng shui done by Master Tham has been generating profit although there are many other shops only nearby. We have also many good and helpful staff. We do not encounter with any business problems with this shop and everything flows smoothly. In fact our business continues with more prosperity. We had also consulted Master Tham for another branch of ours. This branch which was on the verge of closing down has becomes very profitable after feng shui has been done by Master Tham. We continue to seek for Master Tham’s genuine feng shui advice for the remaining shops and we are continuing to enjoy the positive outcome. We are not worried about my competitors anymore as our business is very stable now. We would proudly recommend Master Tham’s expertise to our family and friends. Seeing and believing is not enough, but the most important is reaping the benefits there from!” To any one out there listening and seeing is just not enough. You and your family would only able to enjoy the benefits if you have consulted Master Tham immediately. Thank you Master Tham for not only your good feng shui but FANTASTIC FENG SHUI being sincerely done for us!”
Oldcastle Workhouse served as a civilian internment camp from December 1914 to May 1918, holding almost six hundred Irish-based civilian men of German and Austrian birth as “enemy aliens”. Tom French has recently edited a book containing a collection of essays on the Camp under the title “Oldcastle Camp 1914-18 – an Illustrated History”. In this talk he will focus on the scholarly work which has been done on this subject, paying particular attention to the material in the book just edited by him.
Tom French works in the Local History department of Meath County Council Library Service. He is also a poet, and his books – the most recent of which is The Last Straw (2018) – are published by The Gallery Press, and were awarded the O’Shaughnessy Prize in 2016. He has edited Oldcastle Camp 1914—1918: an Illustrated History, published by Meath County Council and Moylagh Historical Society in 2018 on the centenary of the closure of the Camp.
In its Heritage Lectures the Lismullin Institute seeks to explore various aspects of our local heritage so that visitors to the Lismullin Conference Centre and our neighbours will have a greater knowledge and appreciation of the history and attractions of their surroundings. The Lismullin Institute is pleased to invite you to some or all of these public, stand-alone lectures in Lismullin Conference Centre. The Lectures will begin at 8pm and light refreshments will be served afterwards.
“How do you create a blog?” While there is a lot to running a successful blogging business, the first thing you need to do is have a blog. That means hosting and a good solid platform.
Blogging can be a great way to bring in additional money to your household. Of course, not every person who starts a blog will make enough to replace a full time income. So, if you start one for that reason, you may be setting yourself up for failure (so please, don’t start one if you think you’ll become rich and famous because of it).

Is it just me or has the progress made in making Linux easier for the non-techies/Linux users actually made it harder to make Linux do what it was best at, molding into the great tool that fits you better than the other OSes out there? I rant on my issues getting Ubuntu to do what I want on my new Laptop and ponder if Ubuntu's outgrown me or I've outgrown it.
To the podcast, I am not sure it sounded very ranty (kind of polite), but it definitely was an improvement over the last rant.
Now for the topic. It sounds like you’ve already come to a realization about Ubuntu and how it fits your use model. I have to say, this is a trend with Ubuntu that has been some time in the making (Gnome in general for that matter). The trend is the sacrifice of advanced power user configurability, for the benefit of the average guy.
I’m not a super old school Linux user, but I do have some time under my belt. I began with Redhat 6, and I have been an Ubuntu user since 6.x. However, I have never been exclusive. I always run multiple distros simultaneously on my various boxes. I have noticed myself increasingly using Ubuntu less and less in favor of OpenSUSE and Gentoo.
I really admire the work Ubuntu/Canonical are doing, but I’ve accepted that I am not their target audience. My wife fits that better. Say what you will about Gentoo, but I cannot envision that distro ever causing that kind of grief over a GDM dependency. The system is exactly what I want, with nothing extra. OpenSUSE fits my corporate Linux world testing better and that is why it’s on my work laptop. Zypper is also quite impressive and has largely fixed the RPM hell situation. I think it helps me to run multiple distos, I feel like I stay more Linux agnostic and can better appreciate the differences.
On that note I have heard good things about Arch. I’ve been meaning to try it. It’s also been awhile since I looked at Fedora and Mandriva. It’s definitely hard to experiment with kids! I had soo much more time for this fun before the gremlins were here. Now my time is consumed by another type of fun, so I can’t complain.
Yea, I have my conclusion and it’s just a matter of finding time for me to make the transition. I’ve been pretty exclusive. All the time running Ubuntu alone has taught me all the tricks and things I need to run it really well. I’ve never been able to use a RH/Suse system for longer than a weekend without pulling my hair out.
I have always declared myself “platform agnostic”. After all, web dev just takes a nice text editor and a web browser, and you get that in any system.
I think openSUSE, Ubuntu/Mint, Mandriva/PCLinuxOS, have all made great strides in this. I happen to prefer gnome, so I use Ubuntu. Using openSUSE at work has proven very stable, and it’s easy to see the contrast in security between Ubuntu and openSUSE, but Ubuntu still has the speed.
I’m still undecided on the future. I like the fact that Ubuntu runs faster, updates more often, and how I don’t have to change repositories to run the latest version of FF. But someday I may want to grow up….
Well, even a web dev cares. I mean you still need to worry about how your server is setup, if it has packages for your web environment. It was great that I could try out cherokee web server with uwsgi for a really fast web server environment for my python web apps. Not all distros have a packaged setup for that.
True, but you could have pretty easily setup apache with python, a more common server enviro. Jus’ saying.
Noticed that one thing Ubuntu hasn’t made simple is subscribing to a podcast. Woulda been cool to click on “subscribe with iTunes” and have it load into Rhythymbox. Still don’t know if I’m subscribed or not. Not generally a Rhythymbox (or iTunes) user. I like the radio.
See, I don’t think that the power users have been left in the cold by Ubuntu. I think what folks are having a problem with is the stuff that automagically gets set for them when they install and start a new Ubuntu instance. So, it’s a balance between the stuff that we’ve had to learn over the years vs. things just magically showing up and working properly. I’m not sure about the rest of you, but I’m happy that things “just work” now. granted, when things don’t just work, I get a bit cranky, however, I’m overall pretty satisfied with Ubuntu and the direction it’s taking. Now, when they remove all of the things that I particularly care about, then we’ll talk. 🙂

A business process that is modeled by "use cases" should be translated into a system process that is visualized through "activity diagrams". Connecting use cases to their supporting activity diagrams is a useful way to switch between business and system domains. This is an approach that explains not only מה the system will do but also איך it will do it.
When designing a new service, my first task is to capture the numerous abstract ideas on paper. More specifically, I use a modeling tool to identify the individuals and systems (e.g. the מי) that will be interacting and their usage scenarios (e.g. the מה). In UML terms, the individuals are called "actors" and usage scenarios are called "use cases".
Registration and login are an example of a universal usage scenario, as almost all web sites have a business requirement for a user to create an account before they can log in. How a user registers and logs in, in other words the system's behavior, can differ greatly. Registration can require the user to complete a long application form, submit just an email address, or use a central authentication system such as OpenID. These are all system-specific means to achieve the same business requirement.
The use case diagram above shows that user registration and login will be part of the design. It does not explain how this will be achieved.
This activity diagram is segmented into "swim lanes" showing the activity on the web browser and network-based, web server. The dotted box represents the activity for the "Visitor Creates an Account" use case, allowing a software developer to visualize what is actually meant by the use case.
One way to implement this mapping is presented by an article from Enterprise Architect, Mapping Use Cases.
The EA modeling tools sometimes gets in the way of simplicity, as in this case. For simpler use cases and activity diagrams, I would just create an activity model inside a use case diagram on the EA "project browser"

Energy efficiences of some common multiple cropping systems of the Eastern Himalaya are analyzed and compared to multiple cropping practices of the Central Himalaya. Various inputs (seed, labour, farm manure and chemical fertilizer) and outputs (agronomic yield and crop by-produce) were converted into energy equivalents and efficiency was calculated as output:input ratio

Perhaps the key furniture piece (particularly during christmas) may be the household furniture. Whether its anchored front and center within an open home or positioned in the middle of a proper household furniture, the home furnishings are a gathering spot and a focal point. But past as being a stand apart furniture piece, the home furnishings must be durable as a rock, easily helpful and, in some instances, even versatile in shape and size.
If youre taking a wooden household furniture, usually go for hardwood such as mahogany, pine, maple, walnut, or teak wood rather than composite wood, including plyboard, hardwood solids and MDF (Medium Denseness Fiber board). Even though designed woods such as MDF that is a mixture of soft and hard wood pieces that have been compressed into panel form are durable, they are less strong and durable as hard wood. And while MDF, might be steady sufficient for the short term, hardwood is far more more durable. 1 key fact to bear in mind is the fact that tables with removable legs often tend be made of fiberboards, a fabric made of pushed wooden scraps. Its not a good option for the lengthy-run, but when you will make use of the table only occasionally (or you transfer often) then it can make sense to choose fiberboard. For those of you searching for something past conventional hardwood, we like the feel of gal steel, grainy marbled, or shaped plastic material.
The important things to consider when purchasing plastic material home furniture chairs are the types and styles of plastic home furniture chairs, the types of plastic material utilized in producing the seats, the seat and table measurements, and additional ways to use the chairs. The most crucial step is to first figure out the correct size seat needed for the table. The desk and seats should be appropriately matched up. Subsequent, choose the kind and style of seat to suit the areas decoration. A far more contemporary decoration might use the Panton Utes Chair to create a chic declaration. A classical design could incorporate Louis Ghosting armchairs and Victoria Ghosting side chairs. Numerous plastic material house furnitures can also be used as home furnitures as well. Whatever the design or meant impact, provides a diverse variety of plastic material home furniture chairs for any budget, decoration, or flavor. eBays substantial entries mirror the growing recognition and affordability of plastic material home furniture seats.
Hi everybody, I just stumbled on this site via Serious Eats and I'm loving it so far. Major cheese fan along with all the usual favorites -- sushi, Thai, Mexican, Italian, French, Indian, Vietnamese, New American ... pretty much everything except, regrettably, most Polish/Russian food. But, that could also simply be because I just haven't had any good ones yet.
Moved here over three years ago from Los Angeles and after moping because there just aren't a lot of fast and loose taco trucks in Chicago, I've really come to enjoy the culinary environment here. I will say that I did not know jack shit about beer or whiskey until I moved to this city!
Welcome Short Pants! Look forward to reading your posts. If you want to get the full LTH experience, keep your eyes peeled for posts on the picnic coming up on 9/22--it is a true food blow out and an opportunity to meet a lot of our members. Hope you'll join us!
I'm Matt, and I've been living and working in Chicago for 15+ years, but have just started exploring the amazing dining in the city the past few years (I'm a late bloomer). I've had some amazing meals in that time, but my list of new places to visit keeps getting longer and longer. I'm an omnivore, but my wife is a vegetarian, so we're always on the lookout for places with great vegetarian options.
"This is the violet hour, the hour of hush and wonder, when the affections glow and valor is reborn, when the shadows deepen along the edge of the forest and we believe that, if we watch carefully, at any moment we may see the unicorn." Bernard DeVoto, The Hour.
And welcome to you too Matt! In my first couple of years on LTH, I started a list of places that I wanted to go to based on this board and for every place I tried, it seemed like I'd add 5 more. I finally gave up Don't be afraid to post a date/time/place of somewhere you've been wanting to try--it's a great way to check out places, especially those that your spouse might not be interested in or to enjoy a more extensive sampling of the menu. It's one of the best features of this community. Hope to meet you at a lunch or dinner soon!
Not an introduction as such: my partner and I move to Manhattan in a week or so, I leave The Fresh Market as an accoladed cook/
trainer. I opened twenty stores during my tenure, among them the biggest grand openings in company history.
And now I'm here in the Dominican Republic. Finally got Time/Warner installed. We're at tree top level so I can truly be Christopher Robin. The neighborhood reminds me of a cross between the Oaxacan edge of Wicker Park in the early aughts and the lower Mission in San Francisco in the 90's. More San Francisco, really with the greenery, the hills, the Cloister's tower. Could be Coitus Tower if you squint. Local Food: a great burger at District 12, consistently strong pan-Chinese/Malaysian at Amy's, good al pastor/lengua/carne asada tacos from Tulcingo Azteca. Those are just around the corner places. Reviews from downtown to come.
Hi, Scott W. here, I'm a librarian at the Harold Washington Library Center downtown. Since my section has all the cookbooks, I've had to turn a passing interest in food culture into something resembling expertise, so here I am: to learn and more than likely get schooled on everything I don't know about local eats. Big thanks to Ronnie for welcoming me to the Forum, and if anyone out there doesn't have a library card, I promise not to glare.
Oh, born and raised on the South Side, now living in Andersonville. The only things I ever learned how to make from a recipe were chocolate mousse and beef stroganoff, the first being my favorite dessert (at the age of ten) and the second my father's favorite meal, because I had a revelation: if I knew how to make those things I could eat them whenever I wanted.
I've been a lurker on this website for a long time, probably about five or six years. I finally decided to join because I think I drive some of my Facebook friends nuts with all the posting I do about eating and drinking.
I'm in my mid twenties and my genesis of a love for food is a combination of childhood memories, Hot Doug's, and paying attention to chefs like Grant Achatz, Charlie Trotter, and Thomas Keller.
I am an intronise in the Chaine des Rotisseurs Baillage de Chicago, a supporter of the James Beard Foundation, and a guy who likes food all the way from a $2 hot dog at Jimmy's Red Hots, to a meal at Grace or Alinea. I just have a love and passion for food.
Professionally I spend my time working on the northwest side in my family's business. We are a small company that my father started 30 years ago. We re-concept and re-develop commercial-industrial buildings. I studied at DePaul university.
I look forward to hopefully becoming a loyal member and a good poster here on LTH. I know some of you already, too, so within no time it'll be like home!
"People are too busy in these times to care about good food. We used to spend months working over a bonne-femme sauce, trying to determine just the right proportions of paprika and fresh forest mushrooms to use." -Karoly Gundel, Blue Trout and Black Truffles: The Peregrinations of an Epicure, Joseph Wechsberg, 1954.
I've been lurking here a while...not being a Chicago resident, I'm mostly content to watch. As you might have guessed from my SN, I reside in (Madison) Wisconsin. I'm an antiques dealer by profession, which means lots of travel, which means lots of restaurant food (not that I needed the excuse...I'm a terrible cook and long ago rationalized eating out every day).
I am planning to do some longer posts on Madison dining since it appears some of you make an appearance up here...Madison has a great farmers market (that every single native takes for granted...we never consider it special until outsiders ooh and aah over it), excellent Lao food, and a few weird outliers in other cuisines that you wouldn't necessarily expect. We are sorely lacking in BBQ (recently, a few contenders have opened), soul food (the average life of a Madison soul food restaurant, including IMO some pretty good ones, is about 6 months), Middle Eastern any better than average, or decent Indian food. The recent news is the explosion of authentic Chinese places catering to the large numbers of Chinese students at UW-Madison. Seriously, in the last year we've gained a Dongbei place, 3 Sichuan places, and a Hong Kong noodle spot, and all of them seem to be doing well. I'm sure this is nothing special for a big city, but Chinese food used to be pretty woeful as recently as five years ago.
Outside of my amateur foodie hobbies (the dirtier, and the more hidden, the restaurant the more I like it, as long as the food measures up), I like DIY music of most every variety, foreign languages, science fiction, and anything to do with bicycles--riding them, building them, racing them. I like to travel and will be soliciting advice on areas I haven't been before.
Not every local takes your Madison market for granted. My friends Terese Allen and Joan Peterson have written a food calendar book to orient people on when to expect to find seasonal fruits and vegetables. It pretty much is a guide on what to expect at the Madison market.
Some good Wisconsin food is also of interest: diners, hamburgers, pizza, cheese and do you have fried eggplant at fast food joints like they do in Milwaukee? That is something we do not see in Chicago.
"You'll be remembered long after you're dead if you make good gravy, mashed potatoes and biscuits." -- Nathalie Dupree
I grew up in mid-Michigan, where my ancestors have been farmers for generations. My parents broke the chain and became an autoworker and a kindergarten teacher instead. I have degrees from both Michigan State and University of Michigan, though I am a loyal Spartan. I grew up on hearty, country cooking, and now, like all the other members of my family, I'm trying to retrain myself on how to cook in a more healthy way. But, my favorite meal will always be BBQ grilled chicken, buttered noodles, corn on the cob, and strawberry shortcake.
I moved to Chicago 9 years ago for my job, and have lived in Andersonville with my 2 cats ever since. I work for the public library, so I don't have a ton of money to spend on fine dining, but because I work in a branch, I get to travel to neighborhoods all over the city, which is great fun, and also means I get to try lots of neighborhood restaurants.
Ahaha, I knew this was going to come up: I cannot offer even one smidgen of advice on Wisconsin cheese. Or any of our other fine dairy products. Or the relative merits of various butterburgers. I am literally allergic to all of it.
So, Asian restaurants make up a big part of my rotation. As for fried eggplant, I haven't seen it in Madison. No real specific-to-Madison diner/fast food quirks, unless you count diners having fancy hipster coffee (it *is* Madison, after all.)
However, if you're looking for a good Wisconsin breakfast specialty, it's been a couple years but I recall the Walleye-and-eggs at the Cottage Cafe on Atlas Ave to be quite adequate and very cheap. If you're looking for traditional Friday fish fries, Dexter's Pub at North & Johnson is good (be prepared for a Loooooong wait during peak hours) as is Brothers Three at Fair Oaks & Hwy 30.
EDIT: one more local diner quirk: Go to Mount Horeb, WI, about 25 miles west of Madison (on a very nice bike trail, too) and try the Swedish potato sausage at Schubert's Restaurant. My favorite breakfast food in this world. All the traditional Swedish pastries and rye bread too.
This looks like this is the place to be for information on food and food related items. So far the posts I have read are very interesting and everyone seems to respect one another. I am looking forward to some good reads and hopefully some good added input and feedback.
Met several of you at the BBQ today, so thought I'd better sign up and do a little formal introduction. LTH has given me several awesome dining ideas before; I also enjoy some of the longer pieces that get featured here. In the future, I look forward to contributing and getting to know more of the community.
I like traveling which to me means learning about a place for what it is instead of what it's known for, aka tourism. There were periods when I wasn't able to travel extensively, so trying foods from different places became a proxy for traveling. I have a soft spot for ethnic restaurants run by old grandmas, but they're certainly not the only ones with an interesting story to tell.
I grew up in Hong Kong, but I've spent quite a few years now in LA and Chicago. At one point I wanted to be an orchestral conductor but it turns out it's all the hard work of a musician with none of the booze and escapades (or is it), so now I'm a consultant.
I used to live in Santiago too, for about ten years, so I particularly enjoyed your comments about keeping an eye out for Chilean food.
Compared to what Chicago has to offer, I do not miss Chile's idea of hot dogs ( ) or pizza ( ), but I heartily agree about the bread. It was great to be able to pop into any of half a dozen places on a walk home from work -- even at bakeries in shopping hallways in the subway stations -- and buy high-quality bread every day. There are of course some great bakeries in the Chicago area (I live in the northern suburbs); but it does require a car and a hunt; not the same thing as just buying it on the way home every day. I didn't need to worry about the waistline consequences of eating bread so frequently because I walked so much more there than I do here.
That said, at least while I was there, Chile held the world record for highest per capita consumption of carbonated beverages, and I didn't go along with them on that. If Chile's unofficial food motto is "mayo con todo!" its unofficial beverage motto is "Coca-Cola con todo!" But then, the summers are longer and hotter and drier there than they are here.
I also miss Chile's great big beef empanadas, with hard-boiled egg and golden raisins and mayo and avocado sauce on tap for dipping---I never went to the Jumbo hipermarcado wthout a stop at the empanada bar, and the ceviche-and-wine bar too! I miss Chilean fried seafood empanadas too, but I especially miss the baked beef empanadas. Appetizer-size Argentinean/Colombian fried, often cheese-filled, empanadas, are available at some places in Chicago, and they're very tasty, great happy hour treats, but they're different.
I particularly miss a certain bakery at the Rotunda Tomas Moro that sold huge quantities of empanadas on Sunday mornings. They sold them all week long but cranked out a lot on Sundays, and people (including me) lined up to get boxes of a half dozen or a dozen or more, the way people buy boxes of doughnuts in the US, either to stock up for the week or for a Sunday lunch with family. It wasn't that long ago --- when I first started living there, and perhaps back when you did --- that there were no shopping malls in Chile and practically no stores open on Sunday, so Sunday afternoons revolved not around going out shopping and errand-running but rather staying home or visiting family members' homes and eating long afternoon lunches. Sometimes at such family gatherings, empanada making becomes a group project (for those who had not stopped off at La Panaderia Tomas Moro): someone to cook the beef and prepare the fillings, someone to prepare the dough, someone to fold up the empanadas, somone to swap them in and out of the oven; cheers from the dining room when another batch was served.
I also miss produce sellers at red lights. Here, avocados cost $1 a piece; asparagus costs upwards of $2 a pound; in the summer in Santiago, you stop at a red light and roll down your window and someone will step off the curb and sell you a bag of ten avocados or an equally large bag of asparagus for the equivalent of about a dollar. Or, if you're in the mood for it on a hot summer day, any kind of ice cream/frozen chocolate/frozen fruit treat you need to cool off, for about 20 cents, before the light changes.
There used to be one Chilean restaurant on the north side of Chicago, but sadly, it has closed, so I don't think there's any source in Chicago right now for specifically Chilean empanadas. I used to buy pebre by the quart there; now I make batches of it at home and eat it on good bread with butter -- sometimes that's my whole meal. And of course, in the winter, pastel de choclo.
Chicago is not alone in this dearth of Chilean cuisine. I look for it when I'm travelling and very rarely find it. I once had some time to hunt around in New York City and found and ate at the only Chilean restaurant there* (Pomaire; sadly, it's closed now too). I think there may be one or two Chilean restaurants in, say, the Miami area, but that's about it. (*Updated to add that there appear to be some pan-Latin cuisine places in NYC that serve, among other things, Chilean empanadas, but as far as I know there is not a dedicated Chilean restaurant in NYC any more.)
There's a Chilean woman who now lives in Texas who has a food blog, and a few Chilean food blogs, including one that aggregates recipes from other Chilean sites. I can send you some recipe and blog links, if you're ever interested.
All I can do for now is prepare Chilean dishes at home. And now you've prompted me to launch an empanada-making project.
"Your swimming suit matches your eyes, you hold your nose before diving, loving you has made me bananas!"
Thanks for introducing yourself. I knew you would have a story to tell. I enjoyed learning more about you and your family. Again, welcome!
I'm going to go all the way back to 1996, when I first got my own internet account. (The internet service was actually being paid for by my dad, so he had an e-mail username ending in 1, and my e-mail username ended in 2.) Thankfully, I swiftly found a free, web-based e-mail service. I switched my main e-mail account there. I still insist that web-based e-mail accounts are where you should go for security, privacy, and anonymity.
On that subject, I learned quite early what somebody had to do in order to fend off spam and virus attacks, which back then, were directed at you if you had JavaScript | ActiveX® on, and you surfed to a World-Wide Web page where your assailant had seeded the tainted payload. In the 20th Century, it was simple to turn off JavaScript in Netscape | Firefox. It was in Tools>Options>General. Today, in Firefox (still the best W-WW browser for security conscious surfers), you have to mess with "about:config" (getting its dire warning message!) .
But even back then, I was into craft beer. I ran a craft beer tasting {free} at the (annual) United Soccer Boosters Convention. It was an add-on for people who arrived at the convention on Thursday. The USBC didn't officially begin until Friday. It was the cheapest marketing opportunity for brewers in North America. I didn't require a represenative from the brewery, nor a payment to the organizer's pet cause {Oops! This still occurs nowadays.}. I asked for two cases of 12-oz bottles of beer for each brand a brewery wanted to submit. We would ask the tasters which beers they especially enjoyed. They were identified by their age group, gender, and metropolitan area. After the convention ended, I collated the results and wrote back to each brewery where were the areas which especially enjoyed their beer(s). I would include text where I informed the brewery which submitted the beer I especially enjoyed. Over the years, there were a small number of beers which were completely consumed on Thursday night - and I made a special note of that to those breweries which had brewed that beer.
I scribe over the years because I did this for 15 years. The reason I ceased was the dwindling number of people attending the USBC. Twenty people are not a convention.
So I had the side door of a foodie. I always made sure to have at least one sleazy macrobrew beer for people not into "weird beers" (as I heard them described sporadically). (The pinnacle example being 1995 in Saint Louis, MO., where Budweiser was not present, but we had Falstaff. )
[*Pabst was never considered a sleazy macrobrew because it never sent us PBR; but it did send its variants like Pabst Genuine Draft {which won a Gold Medal @ GABF in its category}; Old Tankard Ale {back again!}; and Andeker; as well as other brands under its portfolio like Ballantine, Lucky, and Olympia.]
I would have to state that I stumbled into gastronomy because my mother's cooking was really substandard. I am sorry; but you will never espy me claiming something was 'as good as mother's' because it was just such. I dare state some pasta from 2008 is still in the cabinets because I was indoctrinated you do not throw out food .
There was a street food base for myself. From 1967-1970, mom was a secretary for Illinois State Senator Peter C. Granata. He was nominally a Republican, but it came to be known that he was one of the pipelines from the syndicate to public governments. As such, I am certain there is an F.B.I. file on my mother. Am I going to request it? No way, bunky. They may have opened a file on me as well, because each summer, I wasn't left alone at home here. I got to sit in the office on west Taylor St. waiting for orders to be processed, after which my Uncle Willy and I would take to the streets in his auto to the venues where they were ordered.
Every day I would have lunch from Al's Italian Beef. If there had been something like Foursquare back in 1969, I would have been the mayor of Al's Italian Beef.
I am actually composing this in live time online. I wonder how can I jump forward to what I enjoy today. I can tell you that when I rode Chicago Transit Authority buses and “L”'s on a Sunday SuperTransfer in the 1970s, I would hit obscure food stands in neighborhoods distant from Belmont-Cragin, where I lived then, and still reside today. In the early 1980s, I latched on to a paperback book titled "Hot Dog Chicago". In 1984, I appeared on camera {the segment was taped at Yo-Joe's @ Addison & Narragansett} on the PBS television show adapting the book. When Pat Bruno was writing about stands for the Chicago Sun-Times, I wrote to him. My remarks about Lulu's (@ Taylor & Ogden) (then, a great stand purveying Kosher Zion hot dogs) were published. {I think the reprint of the article still hangs on a wall there.}
I'm really racking my mind here. I know my first post had to do with Japanese Ramen. So perhaps it was via a World-Wide Web search for "ramen" in Chicago. LTHF was one of the top-ranked results which was not specific to a particular ramen shack. Ramen is coming on strong here in Chicago. As somebody who has had it in Japan, I feel I can cohesively scribe about it insofar as how authentic the Chicago version of it is. (When in Japan, I have eaten "Chicago-style" pizza {most notably @ DevilCraft Kanda}, and I have had hot dogs there.)
So after a route #9 Ashland Ave. run of this article, I think this explains how I wound up here. If anybody else wants to question me or fill me in on something I may have missed, please go ahead.
First off, let me preface this review by saying that this is pretty far removed from the kind of book I normally read. It's basically Romantic (in the older sense of that term) fiction. However, the setting sort of reached out and grabbed me: the book is set in the historical twentieth-century third world. When I discovered that the public library had it on audio, I went ahead and checked it out.
As historical fiction, however, I found the book disappointing. The book jacket information raves that "personal lives are inextricable from the history playing out around them", but I find this to be less than altogether true, as the main characters are two very reclusive women. During the bulk of the story they almost never leave the house and so have almost no opportunity to directly observe anything going on outside its walls. The history is reported almost entirely through the men in the story, who are really side characters, and through intermittent narration largely irrelevant to the story. We hear about the Soviets through Laila's father, and about the Mujahideen and the Taliban through Rasheed, a man so distant (and poorly detailed) that he is himself almost a part of the setting rather than a character. There are two notable times that the history really has a direct impact. One is when a stray rocket serves as a plot device to keep Laila from leaving the city with her family. Historical fiction is not a genre that I've read extensively, but in what I have read of it, the history was much more integrated into the story than this. (The other instance, admittedly, is better writing, if a bit macabre: the hospital conditions for the delivery of Laila's second child.)
The two main characters are developed thoroughly and well. They are multi-faceted, dynamic, interesting, and reasonably realistic, and the reader can identify with them and feel sympathy for them. Most of the other characters, however, are relatively underdeveloped: flat, largely uninteresting, and in many cases static. The story suffers for this, particularly from the poor development of Rasheed. Here we have a major character, around whom the plot is wrapped like a glove, so that virtually everything that happens to the other major characters is a result of some action on his part, and yet he is so poorly developed, so distant, that I found myself completely unable to identify with him at all, unable to care at all what happened to him (for good or ill). The parents of the four women all also have important roles in the early part of the book, but of the four, only Jalil has more than one facet of his personality explored in any depth. Later, Aziza is a fairly important character, or could be, but we know almost nothing about her.
The plot writing is, in my estimation, better than the characters. Although it is predictable and even obvious at times, there are a number of unexpected turns. Most of these turns are created by actions taken by Rasheed, not by the "history playing out"; nonetheless the story has a satisfying complexity and completeness. This had to be difficult to achieve, with characters who spend nearly all of their time at home, but the author manages it surprisingly well.

I just hit 1,000 views on my little blog!!! I can’t believe it. I’m so thankful that you all have taken the time to read my rants. It has been ridiculously fun writing these posts and extremely therapeutic for my brain. I know some of my favorite blogs probably hit this milestone every day but since I just started a month ago I’m excited and truly can’t thank you all enough.
Because I’m a huge nerd and love tracking performance metrics I’m constantly watching my blog stats. So I can tell you all that you prefer to read about me controlling my urge to not murder my children and that you enjoy hearing about me getting pooped on. So, more of those stories in the future – which shouldn’t be a problem since those types of things happen to me with great regularity.
Hitting that big number made me think about everything else I am thankful for and what other things have happened in my life 1,000 times. Like:
1,000 times I’ve texted pictures to my Mom of everything from my toddler’s first poo in the potty to my 10-year olds first daddy/daughter dance.
1,000 diapers changed over the last several years. Yes, I’m thankful for diapers. A doctor told me once I probably wouldn’t have children and here I am with a bunch of them so I’m thankful I even have dirty diapers to change.
1,000 hours that I have been able to be with my kids instead of working since December. I’m SO lucky to be a SAHM. I wouldn’t trade it for anything!

A great big thanks to all of you who visited my inaugural post, especially to those of you who forwarded it to others and reposted it on Facebook. Not only did it get 205 views (Yay!), your comments and messages made me feel great and made me realize how fun this is going to be. But enough of the love – lets get to the murder.
I wrote the first post nearly a week ago. Then I decided to just wait. Mommy mishaps happen to me daily and sometimes hourly so I figured I would just wait for one to happen and would have to rock, paper, scissors with myself to decide what super awesome mishap story to share. Then….NOTHING. My kids didn’t do anything weird with their pee, I didn’t get the kids loaded in the car and sit in the passenger seat instead of the drivers seat, nothing. My week couldn’t have been any more ordinary. Until today.
It was a beautiful day. A lazy Sunday morning where we stayed in our pjs until well after 10am followed by a fun mid-afternoon BBQ at the in-laws. But suddenly the toddler hit an annoying level of epic proportions.
Now, those of you who have raised a devil-in-training, ahem…toddler, already know all of this. But this post will be most helpful to my expecting and new Mommy friends who are staring lovingly at their growing belly or gorgeous newborn imagining running in the park holding hands with their child, watching them in their first school play or picking daisies from a field and putting them in your hair. These things may happen, and I promise you my kids do beautiful things all of the time. But I also promise you this. There will no doubt be a moment where you will want to murder your child. This is a guarantee. And that does not make you a bad parent or need to be committed, it just makes you human. Am I right parents?
So today as my toddler was doing everything she could think of to bother us as if she’d got a book called “Annoying Tricks for Dummies” and was trying it out, it led to a final crescendo of her trying to pet my boob while I nursed her baby sister. That’s when I hit my murder-point. Enough already!
STEP ONE – Self medicate. Now I’m not suggesting actual medication, but medication of the booze variety. I know there are moms (and dads) out there that don’t drink. I’ve just never really met one. Ever. I read the cutest post last night from a very clever blogger about a term she coined “mojito muffs”. These are beer goggles for grown ups. You should really check it out at The Pursuit of Normal – Mojito Muffs. Basically the key here is that even one little cocktail after a hard day can make it all seem a little better.
STEP TWO – Just wait for them to do something freakin’ adorable. And this always happens. For me tonight it was when my daughter stood in front of us and sang a song loud and proud. Obnoxious, yes. But also completely adorable and it immediately made the stress go away.

Don’t get me fallacious, I’m not anti-partnership but I’m extremely curious as to why as people we seek to affix with another. Juno in Scorpio: Your soulmate or companion is passionate and that may very well be what attracts you to him or her, robust sexual attraction. The connection between you and your soulmate is not like the rest you have got ever skilled. One important concept has seeped through, and since then there’s been no more searching for a soulmate.
Juno in Cancer: Household might be the motivating power that attracts you to your soulmate. Discovering one’s soulmate is in reality a search for a missing Half to type one’s Complete Self. I can’t touch upon Jen Schefft personally of course, but my point is that for some, discovering your soulmate is greater than only a numbers recreation.
As you ponder these questions permit your self to have an experience of current second consciousness the place you possibly can feel what it feels prefer to be sharing your life, right now, with your soulmate. It’s a incontrovertible fact that soulmate relationships and marriages have been effectively researched by many professional institutes together with the Gottman Institute.
“Master Tham, your GENUINE Jatukam amulet has saved my life! Or else, I won’t be able to share my cheat death experience with you. It was a sunny day when I met with the road accident. I was speeding when a car coming from behind knocked the back of my motorcycle. I lost my control and knocked on the lamp post. I thought that I would definitely die. My motorcycle split into two parts. I was flung to the other side of the road and I fainted. However, out of nowhere, I smelt the fragrance of Master Tham’s Jatukam amulet. Slowly, I regained my consciousness and I found myself under a MPV. I crawled out from the MPV in daze. Surprisingly, I am UNHARMED. If I am lying at the road side I would also have definitely been killed by the many passing vehicles. It was amazing that there were no major injuries on my face, hands and other parts of my body. I only suffered with a slight cut on my left hand’s index finger knuckle. Even those passer-bys who had witnessed this accident was surprised and shocked. It is a miracle. A miracle for me to be able to share my real life story with you! Thank you so much for your blessing and your fantastic genuine Jatukam.”

Wil is feeling like he went from gutterbutt to NYE, Courtney is a titty, Beyoncé is the universe and Leif is the new Carson Daly! What a journey this episode is! We all know Mariah is our most viable democratic presidential nominee for 2020 but did you know Mariah suffered from stage fright early in her career? Well until she slayed MTV’s Unplugged… From dealing with racism as a child to serving white fish at the top of the charts Mariah Carey’s Cinderella story is nothing short of iconic.

Lightly pet your braid ladies and gentleman and grab a few Bud Lights because boy do we get into it today. The topic is FAILURE. What does it mean to fail? More importantly (GASP!) has Beyoncé ever failed? Was Pink Panther a failure? How about falling down a set of stairs or ‪Carmen a Hip Hopera‬? Sure you could call it a FAILURE… you could also go F**K yourself! We cover it all from failed looks to failure to launch. Whether it’s a white woman in a RocaWear purse or a Jamaican shirt and a Rasta belt at a teens only party it’s called FASHION look it up! Courtney’s too busty to get in trouble, Wil’s out here bamboozling hoes and Leif has the vocal range of ‪Rihanna‬!

The wisdom is vast this episode everything from knowing people in porn to Mariah in her shoe closet to an innocent boat ride with Pam & Tommy all we can say is, “Not in front of our salad!” We even get down to the age old question, FUNNY PORN… who’s that for?! It’s a hot and heavy one but don’t worry you’ll have a chance to cool down with a little Country Time Lemonade and a rock solid round of “What gets you harder?!” We may not be Bernadette Peters queens but we do know a peaceful protest ain’t shit!

Horny as hell. Will & Grace premiered in the fall of 1998 so this episode has all the late 90s references you could ever want (Kid Rock! Blackstreet! Mad About You!) and so much more! Wil presents his thesis on how Will & Grace is the reason gay marriage is legal in this Country, Mike is trying to become John Goodman and Courtney is a poor mans Karen Walker! After discussing this groundbreaking show we end the episode with a round of WHO’S YOUR DIVA?! We give out some Mariah love (forget about the Nick Cannon years), talk Beyoncé v. Oprah (actresses first) and Mike ends up incriminating a close friend (allegedly).

In addition to relationships and chatting about our boyfriendhusbands, we’re all sweaty and trying to get botox. Littley is busy manipulating Courtney Love and we discuss how Kris Jenner’s warmth is probably from the lighting. Wil won’t put his nipples away and Khloe Kardashian (Simpson?) is a philosopher.

A lot of huge questions this episode… Do Wil and Courtney settle their lifelong beef over Beyoncé’s Insta game? Did Andrew burn down his Frat house? Who is Benihana? Of course the most important question is that of our NEW GAME… WHO’S YOUR DIVA?! If you think the gays are shady you won’t believe these Frat BOYZ!

Said lil b*tch you can’t f**k with us if you wanted to cause we got the one and only Miss Christina Galston in the building! From the top of this episode we are reading rights and spreading the truth! Christina has one of the most powerful Beyoncé check up on its to date and provides us insight on this episodes topic… Hoe Sh*t. We talk Hoes, Hoe Sh*t and F**k Shit. The definitions are shady and the talk is real. Court and Christina almost had a threesome and Wil and Cristina would f**k for some Chick-fil-A. That’s right everyone we’re all loose in the booty here on the Narcisistas! On top of our wisdom and wild stories we reveal the true meaning behind Bootylicious… We can only wonder if Kelendria and Tenitra know?!

Blue bless you everyone and welcome to another dumb ass episode of the Narcisistas podcast!! It’s our beautiful baby angel Wil’s birthday!! All she wants for her birthday is a hunk of cheese in the tub! We talking birthdays and birfdays. We can all agree the only way to have a good birthday is sucking on a strippers titty in the club or a snow bunny themed surprise drag performance. Its one of the two! We can also agree that getting older is terrible but not as terrible as Patrick Schroeder of The Good, The Dad and The Ugly Podcast who is in fact a shady trifling ass bitch! Rate, review, subscribe and worship us! Also you better send Wil some birthday love and listen to BDAY on repeat cause it’s Virgo season y’all!
The Narcisistas have no guest this week but they are so full of themselves they hardly even notice! The topic is CONFIDENCE so they get down to the FACTS… Courtney jerked off a minion and Wil is hammered drunk. Don’t worry they don’t let that stuff distract them too long because they’ve got a lot of Beyoncé to talk which NATURALLY evolves into an analysis on the confidence and power that is living legend Rihanna. We also learn why Wil and Courtney can’t be embarrassed even though they constantly should be! They end the ep with a heartfelt Kanye convo and trying to shame Leif into being confident. If you are living for thick Ri or even thicker B, living for yourself or just love gay stuff give this episode a listen!

While Myka says she is too pretty to fight she WILDLY tries to come at the Narcisistas about the vocal talents of one Beyoncé Giselle Knowles Carter… let’s just say it gets HEATED. We throw pop star shade, praise the legend Britney Spears and talk about why we want to hunt the rich! We end the episode with a sopping round of “What Gets you Wetter?” during which Myka tells us what gets her wetter… “Christians in wigs or Kristin Wiig?” It’s one of our best yet! Oh and please never forget they’re not really Mom jeans until you pee in them a little…

The Weekly meeting is trying out a new room for meeting that will hopefully be more quiet, then our previous one, it is a bit smaller but comes with its own restroom, and is a bit cheaper then our previous room.
The new room for meeting is room #5 which is just a few more doors down on the left if you are looking at our meeting room Door, and you can always look for out meeting sign board.
On, July 30th 2018, Pastor Willis and his Wife Sheri were celebrating their first wedding anniversary with a trip to Alaska, when in a tragic turn, their canoe capsized, Sheri and the other passengers survived the ordeal but Pastor Willis did not.
Pastor Willis, you will be missed, you were the face, and heart of the First Christian Church, not to mention a friend to all.
Your light may have faded, but it has not been extinguished, and it shall shine even brighter in the Kingdom of God.
Wanted to let you all know about Western Friend Magazine, Western Friend Magazine is a Quaker based Magazine that specializes in Quakerly things occurring in the West, not only can you subscribe to the magazine but you can also read some of their articles at the Website www.westernfriend.org but we also have lots of back issues on hand in the book cabinet.
So please stop by and check out Western Friends website, but also stop in for a good meeting with us, and read a article or two from Western Friends while you wait.
We are still here, The website has become a little outdated, as we haven’t been posting a lot of new content lately, but we have been active at meetings and attending Quarterly meeting. Hopefully, that is about to change. Now that the U.S. Elections are over it is a time to start healing again.
We have added a new book cabinet to our meeting area so it is even easier now to find a good Quaker book or pamphlet, and are currently working on a way to make it easier to track books that are out, so we can make sure they get returned to allow more people to enjoy.
We are working on making a digital listing of our books and pamphlets so that you can browse our library at home and when you come to meeting you can take a great book home with you.
I have also been throwing around the idea of allowing our members to have their own blogs so they can use it as on online journal, or even detailing some of the activism or projects they are working on. If you happen to like the idea or are even interested in starting your own blog then please let me know.
Tomorrow we will be celebrating World Quaker Day, Friends World Committee is the group that is responsible for hosting this event. The idea behind the event is:
As the sun rises in each area of the world, we want to remember that Quakers are worshiping through every time zone, celebrating our deep connections across cultures and Quaker traditions. We are united in love and can accompany each other on this special day that draws us together. As we worship, let us hold each other in prayer and thanksgiving, and let our hymns of praise resound across the world. The theme Let Your Life Speak: Living the Kabarak Call for Peace and Ecojustice, connects us to the work we did at the World Conference of Friends in 2012 in Kenya, taking the work forward in the context of our spiritual communities.
We will be meeting at a Members house this Sunday (1st Day) to enjoy in the celebration. If you would like to attend then please email me at [email protected]
We had a great time at the World Quaker Day meetup. We had a good group of approximately 9 in attendance, a great host and an Awesome assortment of store bought and home cooked food.
I, Just did a recent trip to Corona California and I decided to look for a local Quaker meetup. I went to Google and typed in “Quaker Meeting Corona”and it gave me one result of http://www.coronafriendschurch.org/, and I noticed that it was an Evangelical friends Church and I had only been familiar with Un-programmed Meetings so this was going to be a little bit of an adventure. So here is a little run down of some of the notes that I took down during the service. Continue Reading →
In large skillet, combine beef, onions and garlic. Cook until beef is no longer pink, stirring to break up the meat. Drain any accumulated fat (we use really lean beef so there isn't any).
Add peppers and mushrooms and saute for 5 minutes. Add Worcestershire sauce and tomatoes and cook until most of liquid has evaporated. Stir in rice and broth. Simmer, partially covered until liquid is absorbed and rice is soft, stirring occasionally, about 20-25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
*** Now my kids liked vegetables but for those whose kids balk when seeing bits of vegetables, you can omit the mushrooms and peppers. You're losing some flavor but it will still be good. And you can substitute an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce in place of the chunkier peeled tomatoes. Obviously, using tomato sauce will mean you don't have to cook very long before adding the rice and broth. ***

So my plans for releasing last weekend went… well, badly. Ongoing illness and me never being at my best this time of year aside, the main reason is that my ability to plan ahead is at best negligible and what little “skill” is actually there will often be completely overpowered by industrial quantities of procrastination. Plan A was started but was too ambitious so ran out of steam and the switch to a more realistic Plan B simply arrived too late in the day to be viable. It’s probably telling that my last contribution to X was For Teh Win in 2006 – back when I was more able to pull all-nighters if needed – where the actual workload was smaller since it ran from a single file and I didn’t do the graphics…
It’s not that I didn’t get anything done though because some code was written and indeed linked, so what I’m “planning” to do now is consolidate Plan B and another project that’s been on the back burner for ages into one, easily manageable demo with the intention being to push the results out of the door in time for the C64 competition at Forever next year since there’ll be a joke in there which should hopefully work with that audience… because if you can’t be top of the pops for technical expertise and haven’t really got the conviction to carry off something thematic, try going for the laugh.
Anyone who hasn’t looked at the releases from X’2018 should give them a go, there were twenty one demos and six 4K intros in total (as well as a couple more demos released outside the competitions and a metric bucketload of music and graphics entries) with even the just-for-fun entries like the one from Poo-Brain – only the second C64 release from the newly-minted C64 division of a usually Windows-based group – being enjoyable to watch.
As an unexpected but happy Wednesday morning addendum, I’ve just noticed that the CSDb Intro Creation Competition is back for 2018 as of Monday. The closing date is on the 6th of January 2019 so that’s a solid two months of coding time and participants can enter up to three intros. I’ve thrown my hat into the ring for a couple of previous instances so it’s the well that Macro Sleep, Refix 2017 and Koalatro sprang from as well as C64CD release Clonetro. I think there’s a few existing ideas knocking around amongst my workfiles so, once things are back on a more even keel, I’ll have to start dusting them down to see where I stand.

Here, we report on the complete genome sequence of the hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeum Thermoproteus tenax (strain Kra 1, DSM 2078(T)) a type strain of the crenarchaeotal order Thermoproteales. Its circular 1.84-megabase genome harbors no extrachromosomal elements and 2,051 open reading frames are identified, covering 90.6% of the complete sequence, which represents a high coding density. Derived from the gene content, T. tenax is a representative member of the Crenarchaeota. The organism is strictly anaerobic and sulfur-dependent with optimal growth at 86 degrees C and pH 5.6. One particular feature is the great metabolic versatility, which is not accompanied by a distinct increase of genome size or information density as compared to other Crenarchaeota. T. tenax is able to grow chemolithoautotrophically (CO(2)/H(2)) as well as chemoorganoheterotrophically in presence of various organic substrates. All pathways for synthesizing the 20 proteinogenic amino acids are present. In addition, two presumably complete gene sets for NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (complex I) were identified in the genome and there is evidence that either NADH or reduced ferredoxin might serve as electron donor. Beside the typical archaeal A(0)A(1)-ATP synthase, a membrane-bound pyrophosphatase is found, which might contribute to energy conservation. Surprisingly, all genes required for dissimilatory sulfate reduction are present, which is confirmed by growth experiments. Mentionable is furthermore, the presence of two proteins (ParA family ATPase, actin-like protein) that might be involved in cell division in Thermoproteales, where the ESCRT system is absent, and of genes involved in genetic competence (DprA, ComF) that is so far unique within Archaea.

slowdowns were a deliberate effort to keep older phones running longer as the battery wears down—not a push to buy a new model.
“Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components,” Apple’s statement said Lithium batteries degrade over time because of what happens during the charging and discharging cycle During both those events, lithium ions migrate through the material forming the battery Lithium-ion batteries degrade with use Studies using electron microscopes have shown that each time the ions do this they make tiny changes to the physical structure of that electrolyte.
The effect is like “rust creeping unevenly across steel”, according to one scientist who has studied the phenomenon The changes effectively erode the material so it can hold less of a charge and can hamper its ability to provide a steady power supply Higher voltages make the erosion happen more quickly, as do higher temperatures.
Apple software aims to avoid unexpected shutdowns on older phones and this, in turn, can slow the phones. Apple said last year it had released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to help avoid such blackouts. With the recent iOS 11.2 operating upgrades, it’s extending that feature to iPhone 7 and plans to add it to future products Apple’s confirmation comes after Reddit users noticed that their devices were getting slower as the batteries in their iPhones got weaker.
Subsequent tests on older iPhone 6S and iPhone 7 and recent versions of Apple’s iOS software by John Poole, founder of the popular Geekbench benchmarking tool for measuring performance on devices, added weight that this was indeed happening.Who does this effect? iPhone 6, 6S, and 7 users at the moment, but it will likely
continue for all future iPhones until further notice. Something to note about the iPhone 7: with the A10 chip, it has low power and high power cores.
The low power cores are used 90% of the time, and should stay at full speed, so you won’t notice any slowdown except in intensive programs such as benchmarks, demanding games, video editing, etc Some Reddit users reported that replacing the battery in their older phones sped things up iPhones, like many recent Android devices, do not have batteries that can be easily replaced by users.
Apple charges $79 for a new battery for those without its AppleCare warranty protection, a cheaper cost than several hundred dollars for a new device. here apple official statement “Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices. Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components.
“Last year we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. We’ve now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future.”

This was a post-meeting meeting. The place is quite small and cramped and the interiors are not as inviting as other breakfast places around the area – I didn’t bother taking photos. The venue serves all-day breakfast but I didn’t feel like eating rice for late lunch so I decided to have Toffee Banana Pancakes and iced tea (Php 250). When the order came, I was very overwhelmed with the huge serving. It has 3 layers of banana flavored pancakes topped with a generous serving of fresh bananas, toffee syrup and 3 scoops of ice cream!! It was heavenly. The pancakes were fluffy and the toppings just complemented everything. It was a very heavy meal though, I was not able to finish everything up so I had to have the half packed to-go. I guess these orders are good for sharing.

Ever since I had carried your Jatukam and amulet, my hairstyling business has improved a lot and starting to create a niche among the competitors. More good and experienced staffs are employed. Once mentioned of my saloon, people will know about it. My customers would be flowing in non-stop from 10am till 6pm and sometimes, and usually booking is required to avoid waiting. Master Tham’s blessing and his genuine Buddhist amulets are amazing and HIGHLY recommended. THANK YOU SO MUCH MASTER THAM!!”
Sunday July 28th marked a new step forward in the development of the Pembrokeshire Beekeeping Centre when Apiary Manager Paul Eades and volunteer John Dudman extracted the first honey in the Honey Kitchen.
All systems worked as planned and any minor glitches, such as a blown fuse in the uncapping tray, were quickly identified and dealt with.
Over 100 lbs of Association honey were extracted and will be on sale soon in the shop at Scolton Manor and at the County Show in August.

The Horseclans are searching for their legendary homeland�and death awaits any who get in their way!
The call has gone out and the clans are gathering to hear the words of their war chief, Milo of Morai�words of prophecy that promise an end to wandering and a land of their own, the legendary homeland from which their ancestors had come ages ago.
Yet before they can abandon their present hunting grounds, the Horseclansmen have one last debt to settle. They must rescue several of their children from kidnappers and teach their enemies the price of harming any people of the clans.
But the path to both vengeance and their long-lost home will lead them down a treacherous road and straight into a sword-swinging battle with two powerful armies�a war in which there can be only one victor left alive�
Robert Adams (1932-1990) was a career soldier whose Horseclans series drew on his military background to lend verisimilitude to the exploits of 26th Century of immortal mutant warriors in a balkanized North America. The Coming of the Horseclans (1975) was the first of 18 novels in the sequence, which ended, with The Clan of the Cats (1988), only on account of the author�s death.
His non-Horseclans work included two other series. Castaways in Time (1980) and its five sequels were a mix of alternate history and time travel. The Stairway to Forever and Monsters and Magicians (both 1988) were the only volumes to appear of a projected fantasy series.
He also co-edited several anthologies, among them Barbarians (1985, with Martin H. Greenberg and Charles H. Waugh), four Magic in Ithkar volumes (1985-87, with Andre Norton), Robert Adams' Book of Alternate Worlds (1987, with Pamela Crippen Adams and Martin H. Greenberg) and Robert Adams' Book of Soldiers (1988, same co-editors).
The Great River, which had shone bright blue at a dis�tance, rolled muddy-brown as it slid under the blunt prow of the broad row-barge. Senior Trader Shifty Stuart occasionally spat from the cud of tobacco in his cheek into the river, but he did not bother to look at the water, nor did he look back to the west, at Traderstown, which the vessel had just left. His eyes were for the east, for Tworivertown, where he would shortly make landfall with his cargo of furs, hides, fine horn-bows, matchless felts and blankets of nomad weave, beauti�fully worked leather items and a vast assortment of oddments obtained by the far-ranging horse-nomads of the transriverine plains by trade or warfare from other folk farther west, south or north.
This was not Stuart�s first such return from a long summer of trading with the nomads. For sixteen summers he had roved the plains country in a caravan of trader wagons�endless days of baking heat, choking dust, swarms of biting flies and other noxious insects, the incessant lowing of the huge oxen that drew the oversized, high-sided wagons on their five or six-foot wheels from one clan meeting place to another or, every fifth summer, up to the semi-permanent Tribe Camp for the quintennial meeting of the chiefs of all or most of the sixty to seventy clans of horse-nomads that had ruled the plains for most of the five or six hundred years since the fabled Mercan civilization had gone down in death and destruction at the hands of some far-distant enemy who must have suffered equal or worse devastation and decimation, since no invading armies had ever followed up the bombs and plagues.
Stuart had heard all the tales, and he even believed some of them, for he had seen with his own two eyes the cracked and splintered shards of the network of fine roads that had once crisscrossed the land, and the long-dead and overgrown, but still impressive by their far-flung hugeness, cities of the plains. On three occasions, he had overruled the superstitious maundering of his wagoners and associates to camp in the ruins of one of the larger of these, that one that the nomads called Ohmahah, and on each visit he and his men had gar�nered several hundredweights of assorted metal scraps out of the ruins, for all that the nomads had doubtlessly combed and recombed them for generations.
Others of the old tales were believed only by fools and children, opined Stuart, such as the yarns concerning men traveling to and walking upon the moon, or living beneath the sea or crossing the sea in boats lacking either oars or sails. Silly, asinine nonsense, all of it!
The senior trader leaned his weight against the massive timber beside him�one of four, two each at prow and stern, which were built into the flat bottom of the barge and ran through every level to more than twenty feet above the top deck, where they supported the iron rings through which was let a hempen cable over two feet in thickness and extending from the ferry dock of Traderstown to the ferry dock of Tworivertown, enabling the ponderous, top heavy barges to bear men and women, wagons, livestock and goods across the wide water in any weather and in complete safety.
He cocked up one leg to rest a booted foot upon the low rail and began to calculate his probable profits. Then a hand was tugging gently at his sleeve. He turned his head to see Second Oxman Bailee.
Stuart waved a hand impatiently. Bailee was a good oxman, when he wasn�t drunk at least, but he took forever to say anything in his whining, nasal, Ohyoh-mountaineer drawl.
As an afterthought, he yelled at the oxman�s back, �And when she�s emptied herself, bring her up here to me.�
The trader settled back against the immobile timber baulk with a self-satisfied smile. In his recent calculations he had clean forgot to add the probable sale price of the girl and of the two other younkers, as well, not to mention the three fine, spirited plains ponies. And even if she and the boys were to bring Stuart not a penny, still the last few weeks of use of her slender, toothsome body of nights would be almost rec�ompense enough.
The treks outward, in the springtime, were not so bad, for the trading trains most always carried along comely young fe�male slaves for sale to the nomads. Unlike most of the eastern, civilized slave buyers, the horsemen of the plains cared not a scrap of moldy hide whether or not their human purchases were virgins. Indeed, they would pay more for a pregnant girl or one nursing a new brat than for the very prettiest virgin or barren slut. Therefore, all the traders and many a common wagoner or oxman usually had a soft-breasted bedwarmer every westward leg of the year�s trek, un�til she quickened or was sold into some clan or other.
But the returns usually were companionless. Providing food and water for any chit that had for whatever reason not been sold by the end of trading was unbusinesslike. Nomads would not take a sickly or lunatic slave girl even as an outright gift, and many a trader drove these unprofitable leftovers out into the vast sea of grasses to fend for themselves. But Stuart was a bit more kindly. He had a guard or oxman slit the crea�tures� throats and leave the carcasses for the wolves and buz�zards.
The horse-nomads only bought, however; they never sold slaves of any description. For all that, the rarely captured no�mad women brought high prices from eastern buyers, while a trader lucky enough to acquire even one little nomad boy could practically name his own price from the slave mongers who had journeyed inland from the coastal lands of the Ehleenee, no trader who valued his yearly custom and his hide would so much as mention his willingness to deal in no�mads to any of those shaggy, smelly, flea-bitten, but grim and ferocious warriors and chiefs with whom he dealt.
Nor could an enterprising man simply snatch a few of the immensely profitable nomad spawn and bear them back eastward with him, for his own guards�hired here and there, from this clan or that, for the season�would not only desert him, but would bring back the fierce warriors of the closest clan to wreak a horrible vengeance upon the kidnappers and free the captives.
�You�re a dang lucky son of a bitch, Shifty Stuart!� the trader told himself for the umpteenth time in the last three weeks. �If them four savages had come a-riding into camp even two days earlier, wouldn�t �ve been a dang thing we could have done �cept to give �em a feed and a mebbe do a little trading for them raw hides and horns they had. With them dang Clan Muhkawlee guards still in camp. I�d �ve just had to watch a small fortune ride back off from me.�
Through the sleeve of his tough linen shirt, Stuart gingerly kneaded the healing but still painful stab wound in his upper arm, thinking, with a prickle of justifiable fear, �It were a near thing, though, fer all that. If thet young feller had got away...� He shuddered, his thoughts going back to tales he had heard of what had been done by vengeful nomads to would-be kidnappers of their kin. He shook his head. �Whoever would �ve thought a little squirt�he couldn�t �ve been more�n fifteen or sixteen, an� dang skinny, to boot!�so groggy he couldn�t hardly stand up from the drug we�d snuck into his bowl of stew, could of kilt two growned men outright, hurt another so bad he died thet night, an� stabbed or slashed four or five others, got on his horse and been on his way, afore ol� Lyl sunk thet dart in his back?�
Fleetingly, the trader once more regretted the loss�un�avoidable as it had been�of the third nomad boy, then shrugged, ruminating, �Ain�t no good to fret over spilt milk, I reckon. Mean as thet little bastid was, likely he�da had to be beat plumb to death afore a body got any use outen him, anyhow.�
He had been the first to take the girl, and the little minx had fought him like a scalded treecat�pummeling, punching, kicking and clawing until his arm wound had started to bleed again, not to mention tooth-tearing his bristly chin and very nearly biting his right ear off; which last injuries she had wrought on him after he had had her wrists and ankles se�curely tied to the wagon sides, nor was he the only man she had savagely marked. That he had successfully resisted the impulse to give her back as good or better with his big, bony fists and strictly forbidden any of the others with whom he shared the use of her to strike her face had been based upon a good, sound principle of business�broken noses and knocked-out teeth lowered the value of female slaves.
He had not, of course, expected her to be a virgin, nor had she been; no nomad girl ever was so for any length of time after attaining puberty.
�But,� he mused and again grinned to himself, �they says them there slave doctors in Fanduhsburk could make a virgin outen a thirty-year-old whore. Mebbe I oughta git �em to make this gal inta one? Hmm, I�ll think on it. She�d sure bring more thet way, eastern buyers likin� virgins the way they does.�
He returned to his mental calculations for another few mo�ments, then Bailee was shoving the girl to a place beside him at the rail, and he lost his train of thought. A glance down�ward gave him a glimpse only of the top of her head of dull, matted, dirty, dark-blond hair, for like all her people she was small, barely as high as his armpit.
The girl�s baggy trousers and full-sleeved shirt were both somewhat the worse for having been violently removed from her body on several occasions, as well as being filthy from having been lived in and slept in for the weeks since her cap�ture. Her short boots of red felt and brown leather had sur�vived in better condition, since she had been carefully locked out of sight in one of the big wagons for most of the journey.
She stood at the rail for some minutes, then shyly edged closer, closer, until her slender body was in contact with Stuart�s. Her grubby, broken-nailed, but slim and graceful right hand hesitantly extended to touch, then gently massage his genitals through the stuff of his clothing.
Without turning his head, he said, �Bailee, you can jest go on back, �bout your work. Me an� this here little gal�s got us some palav�rin� to do up here.�
The trader closed his eyes in ecstasy as the captive girl rubbed and kneaded and caressed his flesh, and he was com�pletely unaware of her other hand�s activities, not even feeling the easing of the silver-hilted knife from out its sheath in the top of his right boot.
When he did feel the girl�s body begin to crouch lower, he began to turn to face her...and a white-hot agony lanced in behind his right knee! Even as he suddenly realized that the right leg no longer would support him, the girl�still firmly clutching his scrotum in her wiry grip�launched her�self forward, over the rail. Stuart, screaming his agony and terror, was dragged over and down and into the muddy brown water of the Great River.

Craft homemade cards with your K-Kids to show appreciation for school staff or members of the community, such as the elderly, members of the military, or those in the hospital. Before gathering supplies, find out which materials will be allowed in the organization to which you donate. For instance, some hospitals do not accept cards with glitter or latex.
Once you are familiar with the organization’s permissions, gather items to decorate cards, such as stickers, hole punches, pencils, markers, pens, paint and paintbrushes, glueable accessories, and more. Encourage K-Kids to be as creative as they can while decorating and personalize their messages. Once finished, deliver the cards to your group of choice.
A teacher’s job is not easy, but it’s very rewarding. Some of the tasks that make it challenging are filling out paperwork, detailing lesson plans and trying to reach and teach each and every child even though they are all very different. Teachers are too caring to leave anyone behind, which is why we get stressed in our careers. We care for each child as if they are our own and we want them to succeed more than anything. We will do whatever it takes to make sure every student has a voice and tries their hardest to reach their goals. No matter what obstacle is thrown our way, we will push through and make sure we stick to the curriculum map.
Not all schools are fortunate enough to have support in areas like behavior management and rewarding students who have achieved their academic goals. This is where your Kiwanis club can help. The Terrific Kids program rewards students for great behavior and the BUG (Bringing Up Grades) program rewards students for growing academically. These programs empower these young minds and acknowledge their great work.
Having a K-kids club is a great way for schools to serve the community service and create young leaders. K-Kids share their enthusiasm with other students and foster a spirit of community in their schools. Simply asking a school what it needs could open the door for community service for your Kiwanis club. Teachers will be so thankful for the smallest acts of kindness, and they may even show interest in joining your Kiwanis club.
Thank you for the support you have given teachers and I encourage you to thank your faculty advisors for taking on an extra role to make sure the children of the world are on the right track.
Making a difference in your school and community is what K-Kids is all about. Club members identify needs and develop a plan of action to meet those needs. Foster self worth by encouraging members to reflect in the classroom and the community. These project ideas will get you started.
Help K-Kids members become more mindful and reflect on positive aspects of their lives by creating a gratitude jar. Check out K-Kids on Pinterest for printable decoration ideas. Distribute strips of paper to K-Kids so they may write what they are grateful for. Allow members to add to the jar as often as they would like. Decide how often the jar should be opened to reflect on entries—for example, at the end of each week or at the end of the school year. Mix up the entries by using a prompt from time to time, like “I love _______ because _______” or “I'm proud of _______ because _______.”
Help the club create positive posters or daily announcements to share with the the school. Allow each member to create his or her own poster or allow the club to create them as a group. Ask permission to hang the posters in busy areas of the school where people are more likely to see them. Check out how a middle school in Taylor Mill, Kentucky, started a movement to uplift others with powerful quotes. Decide how often the club will contribute to daily announcements and brainstorm messages of encouragement. If a principal or other adult normally handles the announcements, ask if a K-Kids member may be allowed to cover only the positive messaging portion.
Beautify an empty indoor space in your school or community by creating a wall of happiness. Using blank index cards, encourage K-Kids members to write what makes them happy. For smaller spaces, allow students to write multiple entries per card. For larger spaces, use one card per entry. Encourage members write in different colors to brighten the wall. For a more advanced project, bring in magazines and newspapers to allow members to cut out and paste images in addition to writing their own words. Once members are finished, display the index cards in either a simple grid or a unique pattern designed by them.
The role of the educator has never been so important. The demographics in many schools reflect the great melting pot of our society. In the fall of 2014, the overall number of Latino, African American, and Asian students in public K–12 schools surpassed the number of non-Hispanic European Americans for the first time. In addition to a thorough knowledge of their subject areas and teaching methods, today’s educators must have the skills to relate to diverse students.
But some students bring more than just diversity to school. Some also bring deeply troubling problems. For example, one out of five children in the U.S. goes to school hungry—as the number of children living in poverty has increased to more than 15.3 million. The physical, emotional and cognitive needs of these children require schools and classroom teachers to provide multiple levels of support. However, many school districts with high levels of poverty can’t fully fund the very programs their students need.
At the same time, the focus on standardized tests and, in many states, the link between teacher pay and students’ test scores have contributed to many teachers’ feelings of loss of autonomy and valuable instructional time. It’s no surprise that up to 50% of newly hired teachers have left the profession by their fifth year, and that the number of college students pursuing degrees in education has dropped by 35% nationally.
So why do teachers return to their classrooms day after day—despite the legislative mandates, lack of support and other pitfalls? Because no profession is more rewarding. Nothing compares with the pride and newfound confidence in the eyes of a student who has just read his or her first word after a long struggle to develop literacy skills. For a teacher, moments like these—when a student gains a new skill or connects to a new idea or concept—inspire an intense sense of joy and accomplishment. Where else can a professional find an opportunity to change lives every day?
In the words of entertainer Danny Kaye: “The greatest natural resource that any country can have is its children.” Teachers have the power to magnify the impact of this vital natural resource. Through education, students discover their potential to make a difference in the world. To be the one who guides that personal discovery is to be a part of something magical and profound at the heart of a noble profession.

+ I'm Fyd! A full time working Malaysian Biotech scientist based in Kuala Lumpur, who loves crochet, crafts & DIYs.
+ Here's where I started sharing my craft journey since 2010. Since then I've been featured in some of the local TV shows and also magazines.
+ I'm a life member of The Arts & Crafts Guild, KL & Selangor and currently a crochet instructor in Spotlight, Malaysia.
Yes! I was invited to be a guest in The 8TV Quickie, live on the 1st March Tuesday (Girlie Guide) to talk about my crafts. I was super surprised & honored to be invited to one of the popular, cool & urban TV show in Malaysia which hosted by fun & quirky hosts!.
Honestly, I'm a bit nervous & worried whether I can talk about my craft on live TV! I hope I can do well when the time comes. Wish me luck!
Anyway, for those who don't know about The 8TV Quickie, it's a 15 minutes show starts 11.30pm everyday (except 12pm on Wednesday & Sunday) on 8TV. There will be some freebies from me for callers on the show so do stay up to watch & call to get them =)
This is the newer version of MFK name card that I've been working on these few days. I wanted to make a black colour name card but of course my printer can't print white. So I've decided to carved my details on an eraser stamp (my previous post) & stamp on the the card using the ink stamp pad that I've bought from Scrap.n.Crop. Here's the outcome:
I still have my old cards. Why need to waste them. To give them a new look, I've also gave them the crochet touch too =D
An unplanned meet up of my paper crafter (Miyyah from Miyyah@kertas, Saza from ShareYourLoveWithCards) & felt crafter friends (Norlie from SekociNorlie, Azza from ChomelCraft) at a local store Scrap.n.Crop which sells plenty of paper & scrap booking supplies! You can get nearly everything there from paper to stamp pads. Normally they sell online (from their site the largest scrapbook online store in Asia!) but they do sometimes have open days where you can checkout the items yourself. Luckily I'm not a paper crafter (yet =P) but if I am one, I'm sure will be drown by all the goodies there! Here's some snapshot of the happy crafters in the store:
I was thinking of making a new name card, so I start carving for a new eraser stamp. This time I carved my details on the eraser (7 x 3cm, largest that I have) by carving out my own handwriting. Here's the carved eraser:
The carving was not that clean but then it's readable (acceptable). Actually that's my good readable handwriting. You won't want to see my REAL handwriting. No one can read it accept me! Heheh.
So next will be mounting the eraser. I'm thinking of trying to use new stuff to mount the carved eraser (something water proof). I'll be posting about it again if I've found the best material.
For this name card version, I'm aiming not to use anything that is printed out =). I hope my plan will turn out ok!
My first order of gadget sock for a MP3 player. This order was from Farahana, Fallahiah sis who ordered some beret beanies previously. My experiment family mobile socks attracted her to order one from me. So here's the sock:
An interesting order from Lina for her university dinner which doing a nature theme. She ordered a green ring with the flower button (remake from my previous post) & a green based bracelet with yellow beads & red edging. Here's her order:
This is another order that I've managed to complete during the CNY holidays. Both ordered by Azila for both of her lil princesses. It's the first time I've made a Coral Beret for kids which is slightly smaller compare to the adult size. I've also design a new beanie with visor too, Coral Beanie with visor. The Oohanas was attached permanently to the both beanies as her request. Check out the outcome:
The Coral Beret Beanie is exactly the same design that my lil sis wore in my previous post here but slightly smaller.
A custom order by Jaclyn who wanted a Coral Beret with shades of pink. It's the first time I've mix this much colour in an adult beret beanie =). Quite challenging & fun to do. She also requested an lilac OoHana pin with turquoise acrylic beads to go with the beanie.
This is an order from Fallahiah. A black Lacey Beret with pink bow & a Plain Beret with orange Oohana. I've changed the design a bit for the Lacey Beret. So here's the berets:
The lacey beret was adapted from Iman's lacey beret. I've made the bow slightly bigger than the normal double bow I've made previously to balance it out when it's attach on the beanie.
This is a new design of F'dyHana which I've made by using a technique called cro-tat. A combination of crochet & tatting technique. Normally a shuttle is use for tatting but there are several other method using needle & cro-tatting hooks. This method produces more lacey pattern compare to crochet itself. With my first attempt of cro-tat, I've made a new design F'dyHana pins. So here's the outcome:
A new item that I've never crocheted before. I did this one actually end of last year when my family was in KL. As my mum makes coffee (I love coffee!) in the morning, she packs some in my flask for me to bring to the office (I get headache if I don't have coffee in the morning, addicted =P). It's kinda hard to bring a 0.5L flask in my handbag so I've crocheted a flask bottle holder. So here it is:
I still remember mum's crocheted blue water bottle holder which I used to bring to school everyday. Anyone else uses crocheted bottle holder before when you are young? =)
Here's an order my Adeline before the new year in December. As MFK was closed in December I started to make this beanies in January. She requested 2 custom bubble beret beanies with different colour combination, one for herself & another one for her friend. Here's the 2 completed beanies:
She ordered 2 different combination of colours, ivory white+grey & dark blue+grey with a dark blue Oohana pin. Hope that both of them will like it. =)

This is a relatively hardy banana. Although it’s native to India, it has developed some resistance to cold over time; if given some shelter it can be grown outside in Northern Europe, though it does need good drainage. The green leaves have conspicuous maroon markings and red ribs, so that the entire plant is highly ornamental.

“My family and I are glad that we have consulted Master Tham for our bungalow’s feng shui. Since then, our fruit orchard has been bearing more and more fruits.

After since your consultation, our lives have no major obstacles or difficulties. We are lucky that we have engaged the truth and correct feng shui master. That’s why our lives are moving towards a better and healthier living.”
“After we came back from overseas, my husband fell ill seriously and he has to be admitted to the hospital. Not long after, he laid coma in hospital. The hospital has tried many ways to identify his root of illness but failed. Thereafter, I transferred him to another hospital. Again, the doctors failed. My brother-in-law immediately contacted Master Tham and explained my husband’s condition to him. According to Master Tham, my husband had offended the tree spirit. With Master Tham’s helped, it was surprising that my husband regained his consciousness and he left the hospital in good health. It was a miracle and the doctors were puzzled! When I told him about Master Tham’s findings, my husband admitted that he had cut down a tree’s branch that blocked the door of our store. We thanked Master Tham for his sincerity. He is very frank and helpful and very professional in his practices. It is not easy to come across a trustworthy master like him. Finally, we had consulted Master Tham’s feng shui advices for our house. It gives us new hope and another source of income. Master Tham is not only an expert in feng shui but spiritual knowledge as well. You are the BEST!!!!”

It would be a huge financial investment if you were to buy all of the specialized equipment they use. Plus, landscapers usually have a group of workers who have the ability to aid them with big projects.
A lot of Egan, Louisiana Landscaping Service providers are Educated: Landscaping takes specialized abilities and understanding that many of us simply do not have. A professional landscaper knows which plants will thrive in particular conditions, the best time of year to seed, methods to help your yard grow, in addition to design abilities to change any yard into a lovely showplace. There is a lot more to landscaping than just trimming lawn and watering a lawn.
Landscaping Design Skills: A professional landscaper has the capability to take a look at any yard and imagine the design and design that will certainly transform the area into a pleasing location for the property owners to take pleasure in. By taking and evaluating the land into account soil conditions, shading, water overflow, and more, the landscaper is able to create a yard layout that will certainly look beautiful and has the best possibility for survival.

No longer will you have to invest your weekends doing lawn work.
The best way to select a Egan, LA certified landscaper in your location is to ask close friends and family for recommendations. Ask to see a portfolio of work they have done.
There are lots of landscape designer companies in Egan these days and therefore there’s a great deal of competition – this is good for you as the costs would be much better due to the tough competitors. Despite the fact that they might all look the very same, if you do a little bit of research on a certain service provider you’ll learn a lot more about them. Make sure to do your study prior to you hire someone.
Before you even trouble to look into the other aspects of a landscaping provider, the first thing that you have to do is have a look at their business license. You must never ever hire them if they’re not certified to do the task. Some of the licenses that they would have to possess consist of: A basic liability license, irrigation licenses, nursery certificates and a lot more; nevertheless, the licenses differ from state to state.
Another essential factor to consider is the cost of a Egan landscape designer contractor. Do they charge a flat rate or do they consider your garden and give you’ll a tailored quote based on what you require. Generally when thinking about pricing landscape contractors consider 3 important factors: the labor involved, equipment required which likewise consists of the plants, products and soil as well as their total revenue.
If you’re hiring a landscape service company that is currently set up, they would definitely have previous customers that you would be able to talk to and even visit to take a look at exactly what they have actually done to their gardens. Would not it be fantastic if you would be able to see exactly what your garden would look like prior to they even begin working on your garden?
You have to see to it that the contractor you hire is open to interaction. That is, they should listen to what you have to say as well as offer you detailed updates about the landscaping task. You might go ahead and fulfill up with them to find out more about exactly what they could do for your garden as soon as you find an appropriate service company which satisfies these requirements.
One important landscaping idea that one need to constantly bear in mind is to make your backyard look great at all times. This might sound impossible because throughout winter season, your lawn might look ugly and dull. To obtain rid of this scenario, it is very important that you select the ideal plants that will certainly still bloom and bring beauty to your house even if it is winter or summer. The majority of landscaping needs a substantial amount of watering or irrigation - at least when it is at first grown. Failure to water is a sure method to lose what you have committed to trees, yards, plants and flowers. When you can, pick shrubs, flowers and lawns that do not require excessive amounts of watering particularly if you do not have time to spend in preserving your landscaping.
Ducking in behind the pawnbrokers on Saxmundham High Street the footpath leads north, following a sheltering embankment of cow parsley and crisp packets. After a few hundred feet and glimpses of neat allotments, I emerge alongside rails, picking up speed like a train pulling free of the town. Ahead of me, the track splits, the Lowestoft service passing on up the coast. How many of its passengers ever spot a sister track, half-hidden behind gravel sacks and wire? This forgotten line curves gently away to the east, disappearing into the hedgerows. I cross the rails, a necessary trespass to follow the old route to the sea.
Board a train anywhere in mainland Britain tomorrow and you have roughly eleven thousand miles of track ahead of you. You can coast along steels to every city, a thousand towns and even the odd village. Yet if you yearn to travel by rail into the small corners of the British countryside, you have missed your train by a margin of fifty years or more.
From the moment the first steam engine berthed in the 19th century, British railways spread fast across the length and breadth of the islands. At its peak the system extended over twenty-three thousand miles of rail, hundreds of branch lines diverting from the main trunks and journeying into lonely valleys and onto isolated headlands. As the network expanded it became increasingly eccentric, with different operating systems and burgeoning costs. With the rise of the roads after the First World War, traffic from many of the smaller tracks found other means and some branch lines ground to a halt. Following nationalisation in 1948 this programme of closure accelerated but, by the 1960s, the warp and weft of the network was still haemorrhaging over three hundred thousand pounds a day.
In the midst of this deepening crisis, two opposing forces came head-to-head on the spider-web of British rail. The infamous Dr Beeching, rationalist and man of science, newly appointed Chairman of the British Transport Commission, and John Betjeman, romantic and man of letters, soon to be appointed Poet Laureate. These men were emblematic of polarised attitudes, on one side the desire to modernise Britain’s sprawling rail network and cut its crippling deficits, and on the other a passion for preservation, for conserving a rural and industrial past and the communities served by the branchlines. The ‘Beeching Axe’ was victorious. Link-by-link most of the remaining tracks were torn up or cut off; they became fading constellations in a universe of shrinking steel.
Trains that end in the sea have always had a peculiar romance. As the ground falls away to the coast, the traveller seems to pick up speed, accelerating to meet land’s edge. For one hundred years and six, a small railway branch on the East Suffolk coast serviced fish, coal and passengers. Leaving the Lowestoft line it looped away from a junction, breaking for the sea on a long descent through small towns; Leiston, Thorpeness and finally to the shore at Aldeburgh.
Today, it is a half-track, four miles of rail and four more of farmland. The dawning of the nuclear age has saved the first section as far as Leiston. The A, B, and coming C of Britain’s nuclear power complex at Sizewell beach provides enough traffic, construction and radioactive waste, to keep the steels in place. Beyond, the old track is marked only by its absence. There is little evidence left of the thousands of tonnes of fish sacks or coal stacks, or the people who used the line.
I wanted to recapture the views of fifty years long gone, to come to the sea as a tourist might have done half-a-century ago, not funnelled up a tarmac corridor but flying over the flatland. By following the line from beginning to end, along the repossessed nuclear railway and then on, to the traces etched in crag path and clearing, I hoped to rediscover a lost perspective on familiar country. I wanted to conjure, just for one day, the steaming splendour of ‘The Eastern Belle’, ‘The East Anglian’, and other trains that once took this track, loaded with ice-cream anticipation, sea visions and thoughts of escape.
Turning off down the branch line, the track is well ordered. New Magnox rivets secure the sleepers and steel and, once a year, a ‘weed-killer’ engine comes shunting up these rails, lacing the embankment in a chemical cocoon, keeping the passage clear for nuclear flasks passing in the night. In photographs these toxic containers look just like the classic cash boxes of great Hollywood heist movies; treasure chest-shaped and lying in state on single carriages. Their innocent form cloaks a dead weight of fifty tonnes, steel casing and lead linings housing radioactive waste in transit. I try to imagine the flasks passing me on the track, mistaken for holy relics washed up by the sea; a funeral procession on its way up the line to some inland place of rest.
The track is sloping toward the seaward horizon now. Elated calls of mating birds blend with the distant curses of lone farmers, spring bringing sex for one and toil for the other. I am walking in the long shadow of Good Friday, though the parish churches I glimpse from the embankment will be observing it in small, solemn congregations barely filling single pews, much like the last passengers on this branch line nearly fifty years ago.
My legs were not manufactured for this gauge of railway. Just too short to bridge sleepers with a single stride, I fall between the cracks, boots scudding on the aggregate and clipping alternate ties. After a mile of this halting pace, I catch a rotten sleeper and fall headlong with hands outstretched. I make to rise, looking back between my legs and ahead, embarrassed by my mistake. Then I remember where I am, exposed but alone, and settle back onto the railroad, balancing my head on the warming noon steel.
There is a strange magnetism attached to walking a railway. Just as a train is bound to the limits of the line, after an hour walking between the rails I feel locked in and unable to deviate. A pedestrian on rails is melded in my mind with ideas of the American West; frontier towns, steel-driving men, endless horizons. As I press on down the old branch line the comparisons with springtime Suffolk do not seem so remote. The sporadic shotgun cases of farmers and poachers lie alongside the bones of predated rabbits in the track bed. On either side spreads flat desert with patchy trees and silent tractors, loose metal sounding in the wind. The pancake of coastal East Anglia becomes twinned with territories in Wyoming or Utah, all ‘big sky country’. On old ordnance maps, used when this line still carried passengers, some of these fields bear the same colouring as Saharan sand.
I come off the line on the outskirts of Leiston, next to the town cemetery. I have avoided the thousand pound trespass fine with no more than a hostile look from an old woman at one of the crossing cottages. I wonder if she has made a phone call and the British Transport Police block the next crossing, lazy blue sirens spinning on the verge. In my experience, there’s never been such a good way to meet people as trespassing on their property. You’ve immediately given them the high ground, which makes them a lot more sociable. You can then proceed to roll over like a dog. Everyone loves dogs.
Eating the remainder of my lunch, pulverised pork pie and sweet tea, I look back at the blank hedge behind me with no sign of the railway hiding under its blackthorn ridge. Like the Suez Canal, it takes a moving object to make you aware of what lies concealed in this landscape. The blackthorns form a ha-ha, hiding the margin into the next field and history in their shadow.
In 1872 an iron safe was installed in the Leiston ticket office. The volume of trade and passengers on the line had reached such levels that the Station Master regularly found fifty pounds worth of fares burning through his pocket at nightfall. In contemporary cash, that’s nigh on a grand. As I enter Leiston’s suburbs, walking in the shade of post-war housing estates, I try to conjure a cantering 19th century villain, shotgun under arm, cresting the rise ahead of me and bent on the day’s takings.
Beyond Leiston, I come to Crown Farm siding, where radioactive waste leaves the coast for its long journey North for reprocessing. In a gap at the end of the street, the titanic globe of Sizewell B sits, half-buried in its seaside bunker of sand and shingle. An elderly man, shuffling out of the adjacent Sizewell Social Club, looks at me suspiciously. “Yer awright boi?” he says, fag in mouth. Here men come to play pool and poker in the lee of the reactors, successive phases of British power sculpted by father and son. I give a thumbs up and scuttle off into the undergrowth behind the loading bays. There are no nuclear flasks lying upended in the scrub.
Past the bays and winches and the rails end abruptly, a sharp transition from steel to sand. Only rabbits use this railroad now, the old grooves providing perfect speedways for bunnies going about business. The ghost of the track remains in the landscape; rows of gorse bushes clinging to an unseen ridge; gate posts facing each other across fenceless margins.
Clouds gather and a light rain falls on a group of cabbage pickers, working under pylons in the field beside the track. Watching their progress I am surprised to turn forward again and find myself on a long, narrow lawn, running straight for two hundred feet toward a small bungalow. I pause outside, wanting to go in and compliment the owners on their well-mown piece of railway history. Beyond the bungalow, abandoned in a small grove is Thorpeness Halt, the penultimate stop on my journey. I find the platform buried in brambles. Ambitious trees have rooted themselves in its spilt lip and tall thistles are the only travellers, swaying as they wait for a train that will never come again. Somewhere beyond the weeds is the Meare at Thorpeness, the resort vision of John Barrie, and behind that the town and the sea washing its back. I kneel on the ruined platform, bewitched by the mummified air surrounding a station that no longer exists as a mark on the map. If you take express trains across Britain there is a degree of comfort as you speed past tantalising, half-glimpsed stations, that you might one day alight there. The only way to return to Thorpeness Halt is on foot.
Continuing on down the last seaside miles to Aldeburgh, something drifts across the path behind me, dry leaves and dust. All the absent elements of the old railway, the steels, the broken ties, the shifting rock of the embankment, reassemble in my head. The wind through the firs that line the path starts to gather strength and then subsides, like the memory of an engine that won’t start anymore. Is this the first whispers of a ghost train soon to come steaming around the weeds and deadwood? I conjure a gleaming Pullman bearing down on the dog-walkers, bird-watchers and cyclists, all trespassing on its route.
I arrive at the end of the line at nineteen minutes past four in the afternoon – a late-running service. A journey that once would have taken twenty-two windswept minutes has lasted five hours on foot and the sun is already low in the west. What it must have been like, to come rolling in at dusk with ducks skimming off the marsh and the lightships slowly flickering to life out at sea. On the promenade a wind whisks salt rain over the houses and clouds bunch overhead. The advent of a storm is imminent, but even under dark skies The Railway Inn at the ruined end of the line is full; beer and chips spilling out onto the street once home to the terminus. That business should be so good makes me wonder, did Dr Beeching destroy a sleeping fortune?
The scratched plastic of the shelter spots with rain as I wait for a bus back to the working rails and the city. My thoughts turn to the future on this stretch of coast. When East Anglia sinks into the mud of the North Sea, what will become of this small embankment; a barely-visible lip, breaking the incoming tides that flood the land around it? Perhaps in another hundred years people will swim across these fields, long since underwater. Looking down through clouded masks they may glimpse a strange line of aggregate, fading slowly into the silt. Who amongst them will recognise the golden age of rail, lost beneath the sea?
Wonderful. I know this area quite well - or thought I did - but had overlooked this. A tiny stretch of it near Thorpeness has been incorporated into The Sandlings Walk I think.
Perfect. In my 1970s childhood the single track railway was our arterial route to other trespasses. And with a handful of trains per day, it was a lot safer than the public highway.
A couple of years ago I biked along the old railway bed out of Ballater. There was an overwhelming beauty about that quiet 'decay'.

I’m the Recruitment and Outreach Coordinator for Infant and Child Studies, a group of researchers at UMD studying child development through mutliple lenses of cognitive science. It’s research close to my heart, as I spent three great years as an undergraduate research assistant in the ICS affiliated Project on Children’s Language Learning.
We rely on participation of local families in all of our studies. My job is to get the word out in the community about our research, and talk to parents and kids about signing up. Hopefully, I can get families excited about the research being done in their college town, and help our researchers publish better results.

Highly recommended to all employees or those who are engaged in the business world. This book isn't about your job, it's about yourself and your security.
This book is written to help someone negotiate the often tricky world of personal finance. Understanding savings and investments – for the long and short term – need not be a big mystery; nor should it be something the average person is afraid to look into. All of the options open involve choices. It is the author’s hope to make these choices clearer and easier, and to help promote a safe return on one’s investments.
But realizing that dream may require sacrificing some of today for a better tomorrow. The goals are as varied as individuals themselves and the means through which those ends can be achieved. “Tomorrow” may involve a second home, travel, or a comfortable retirement. It could mean helping children pay for higher education, their wedding, or their home. And of course it could be a hedge against the unexpected.
Individual investors have to develop the discipline of setting aside money through some kind of vehicle if they want to arrive at their goals and realize their dreams. Those means could be as simple as establishing a savings account or an interest-bearing certificate of deposit, or certain types of insurance during one’s working career. It could be as complex and volatile as the stock or bond markets, or speculating in commodity trading – especially futures – once the investor is more established.
Personal savings involves more than putting aside funds for tomorrow. It means utilizing credit and mortgages, as well as learning how to budget cash for both short and long terms. It means getting a basic understanding of the confusing, multiple parts of income, gift, and estate tax laws. It means setting up the beginnings of a retirement plan, whether that plan is provided by an employer or not, and understanding social security as part of that plan. As for investing, it is important to be able to read financial statements, ratios, and other measurements of the health of a business. Insurance also plays a role in the world of savings and investing – universal life, term, and perhaps long term care. I will cover savings, the markets and insurance in depth in Chapters 1, 2, and 9.
An individual might think that the personal strategies available to him or her are unique and different from those employed by businesses. However, they are, in reality, very nearly identical. Finance in the corporate world has more sophisticated jargon that could seem alien or confusing to the individual investor, but in essence the strategies for both are the same when you strip away that jargon. The bottom line then becomes – whether considering a multinational corporation or a family – it is necessary to take some earnings and put them in a safe place in order to justify risk and sacrifice. And both types of entities have to look at diversifying at some point. That’s where a good financial planner comes in, one whom an individual can trust to allocate his or her funds to both the secure and the risky for a best rate of return. Of course, in the corporate world, the return would be to investors.
In this book I will explore some of the best strategies I have found in my research, practice and teaching for navigating the world of personal finance.

It was always a community. Even after some PP27 drama it went away fast. Even though LGM thought I was PP27.
Anyway we dealed with the PP27 alt, but it didn't matter to me. as long as he wasn't rude to me, I was fine.
I am going to tell you about my class. We started with 21 kids in our class. we were all friends, there was one boyfriend and girlfriend which was weird, but wasn't the first time. We then had a girl from Camden, New Jersey. She was 13, but she kind of hated everyone. It was mean. She started a rift in the class and then one of our kids in our class left and then another one.
Finally, I understood this forum. The real way. And then this forum didn't seem so bad. There are some people causing a rift like the newcomers(*cough*PP27*cough*)(*cough*RANGERS*cough*). I might doing some spam, but I am not going down people's throats and that's the problem.
There will always be spam, but we hate each other for some reason. Who knows why but I am going to blame PP27 and RANGERS.
The tension with the newcomer, andhisnameisjohncena, for me is wrong, but for some reason I think he's RANGERS.
Many years ago there's a forum that was started and it continues today. Full of misfits the site continued to grow. Players, passwords, stories and logs galore. The place to be to talk about sports, qualifications, and everyday life. Everybody was so friendly and the site was easily accessible. The leader who's past was a shade of dark. A net of 34 dishes. An ex major leaguer and a fuzzy Brewer. This site was amazing.
The place changed over the years veterans came and went giving the newer members advice as well as tips on how things should and shouldn't go. Just as the golden years started they seemed to fade away... Posts began to not make sense, members would constantly argue, and members would be getting bullied. The dark days of the site had arrived. The longest day started with a bad post was usually diffused but the arguments continued sometimes going on for days at a time.
I myself have come and gone seeing how the site was like when it first started. The fighting I had and sometimes caused had ceased. The trolling I had been put through as hazing had stopped as well. For a minute I felt as peace with the site. Nobody was online it was very peaceful but also terribly lonely. I miss this site and all of its chaos.
But I guess where he's coming from. I've read past threads and they aren't as bad either. But we are at each other's throats way too much.
It might be a rift, but it's slowly being fixed. I feel that if we become a community again we won't have to fight fire with fire. (*looks at*phils)
however, I don't see why we don't just ban him - even if he comes back we know it's him. he *(censored)* up his chance already
Posts like these are killing our forum. I also think the Jacob Sartorius crap though on the Rewop Sorp post was wrong, but I don't care. It's splitting us. All of it is splitting us. I don't know where this should be, but this should be a baseball community, not a forum of hate.
It's really sad that this baseball forum has come to a forum of hate. I love this place. It's nice here, it's not bad. I don't care about spamming at this point either. And we need help here. We need to come together and hold hands. We need to come together as a forum. As a forum for gods sake. As a community.
I know I've posted stupid stuff and things fighting fire with fire against RANGERS, but I've learned that's not the awnswer. Also the thing about well hating on atheism. That was my fault too. But I've matured my non-matureness, if that's a word. That's what cbassian told me to do. As this forum is slowly dying and does not look like it's going to get especially better, it is. I believe in this community.
I'm scared myself of what people will say, after I get cussed out by pretty much everyone, but I think we need to start be understanding of everyone. I have started to tolerate andhisnameisjohncena. I'm starting to get everyone here. We've come important steps closer to friendliness like stopping the tism nonsense, but it's time to make another big step towards coming together as a community.
We did it! Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media).
Nah, you know what, I agree, and sure, I haven't been on here that long. Part of that is definitely because certain people are comfortable just using this as a place to hang out with friends and talk shit. It turns off the few new members who might be interested—mostly because of the shit talking. Not everyone wants to spend time on a forum with such a bad attitude.
There are a lot of bright spots here. The game binds us together—we need to build off the Marvins, not off the Zero Gibsons (not the forum member, I mean the in-game character). Positive emphasis is the right way—encourage that, just ignore any serious shit talking. Obviously some will stay, it's a tight community, but that crap has to be the exception, not the common feeling.
Just my couple of thoughts. I like the intimacy of the forum (as opposed to big ones like OS), I like it a lot, but I am in agreement that it would be a lot healthier without so much shit and [re-joining for the purpose of] spamming/trolling.
I don't even try to come back it's just compulsory for me to visit this site every time I open up a web browser

As a little girl I remember my mommy preparing dishes for potlucks she would have at work but funny thing is they called them pitch –ins. (lol) I had so much fun helping her prepare dishes for the pitch –ins and would also love that she would bring home some yummy food from the other teachers. With all of the experience I had as a little girl I feel like I was born a Potluck Queen. I love creating wonderful dishes and beverages with love just like my mommy did when I was a little girl.
February is full of different holidays that give you the opportunity to have a great potluck. I am excited to be a part of the virtual Black History Potluck along with 27 other amazing food bloggers.

In the pursuit of justice, the esteemed Maryland spinal cord injury lawyers of The Snyder Litigation Team have developed a reputation for offering experience, wisdom and results. Snyder & Snyder can get you the compensation you so rightly deserve if you've sustained spinal injuries due to malpractice or the gross negligence of others.
A spinal cord injury (also referred to as myelopathy or SCI) often entails the loss of feeling and mobility one experiences when the body’s spinal cord is lacerated due to a sudden blunt trauma. Moreover, the ensuing bleeding, swelling, and inflammation can make the damage worse over time. The most common type of spinal cord injuries are compression, involving excess pressure being applied directly to the spinal cord, and contusion, which involves the bruising of the spine. These serious life-affecting injuries are often brought on by accidents -most commonly motor vehicle accidents for those under the age of 65. Those over the age of 65 are more prone to suffering spinal lacerations due to falling accidents.
Sadly, every year, an estimated 11,000 Americans suffer a spinal cord injury. Among those individuals who have suffered serious spinal trauma, only 52% are covered by insurance at the time of injury. Many individuals do not receive the treatments they so desperately need. This is perhaps why 200,000 Americans still sustain long-term disability due to spinal cord injury. Individuals who've suffered this most grievous form of injury because of the wrongdoings of others deserve better. While the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke is working hard to ensure spinal cord injury can be alleviated in the future, you deserve justice now. If you've suffered SCI due to negligence or medical malpractice, you can always turn to Maryland spinal cord injury lawyers, Snyder & Snyder.
Highly renowned for our decisive $150 million verdict in an MTBE Ground Water Contamination case against Exxon Mobile, among other crucial legal victories, The Snyder Litigation Team fights to bring justice to the citizens of Maryland and Washington, DC. We offer a synthesis of experience and knowledge, which we attribute to the continued success of our firm and our clients. By devoting the necessary amount of time and attention to each of our clients' cases, Snyder & Snyder can achieve the justice you so rightly deserve. Call today for a consultation of your potential case.
Whenever you feel something is wrong with your body, you take the time to go see your doctor. You may feel a sharp pain in your stomach or you could be coughing an excessive amount. Whatever the case may be, you expect your doctor to provide you with the proper care you need in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there are times when diagnosis of the real issue is delayed. This can have serious consequences and leave the patient severely injured or permanently damaged.
At The Law Office of Snyder & Snyder, P.A., our Baltimore medical malpractice attorneys understand how dangerous delayed diagnosis can be. We know what can occur as a result. Because of this, we outline some of the dangers of delayed diagnosis below.
One of the dangers of delayed diagnosis is that the patient would not get the medication necessary. If the doctor fails to diagnose a patient during the first visit, the condition may worsen. The medication or treatment needed to help remedy the condition may not be administered. The condition can become severe and leave the patient with a long-term disability or result in death.
A delayed diagnosis can be more severe with certain conditions than with others. For instance, if a patient has cancer and the diagnosis is delayed, when the cancer is finally found, it may be too late to do anything about it. The cancer may be too far in the late stages to treat.
If a patient has an infection that is not diagnosed right away, it could spread to other areas of the body, including vital organs. Furthermore, a condition that worsens because of a delayed diagnosis may require significant medical attention in the future or develop into more, related conditions.
It is extremely important for doctors to pay close attention and provide proper care when dealing with a patient. They must officially rule out conditions based on proper testing before they can move on to another potential diagnosis. If they fail in this action, a patient who sustains serious damage may seek compensation through a medical malpractice lawsuit. Our firm can help you take this action and right the wrongs done to you.
I didn't think I was at that stage yet; I thought I was going to write up more first. Then I just felt like I needed to print it all out to be able to do more. After all, I do have a beginning, some early stages, a tiny bit of the middle, and an ending (maybe not the end end but some of the end). Time to take a step back and see what I have in order to be able to see what I need.
Having printed out said manuscript, I read through it all yesterday. Some of this I wrote months and months ago and have barely looked at since. So it's a strange sensation to suddenly see it physical--and to see that it does work toward a whole. Sometimes I've felt like I've really been letting this latest book drag. But there are pieces of it that I could only have written at certain specific times. When I was writing the beginning, for instance, I only knew the beginning; I knew nothing of the rest. Later, I started to get the pieces that I was missing.
In fact, I was missing so much that I expected, when I read through it all, to find a definite tone shift halfway through. I was expecting to find incongruence that I'd need to fix. Surprisingly, though, I didn't find much of that. Instead I just find gaps that I need to fill in more (which I already knew I'd need given that this is a complete-but-not-complete draft). I did write one scene twice--and it's quite different each time. I mean, I wrote the same scene for Black Tree two or maybe even three times because I thought I hadn't written it yet (and then I ended up not even using it; it might actually work better in this new book, though, strange enough). That scene was mostly the same each time that I wrote it. Not the case for this current one. One version is definitely better as far as theme and character go, but I do love the setting of the other version--so I might have to just keep the setting and figure out what scene is supposed to go with that setting.
And I realize that I'm missing a scene that I remember writing. I write in a couple of different notebooks (one is more for when I'm free writing, but that often turns into content that I can use) and occasionally on loose paper (I type it all up later), but I can't find that scene anywhere. So a little bit of organization is necessary, I suppose.
Anyway. It's been a while since I did a sale for Black Tree. So let's call it an Independence Day sale for 40% off paperback and hardcover copies at this link.
I'm a writer with a tenacious tendency toward the random, which leads to the all-inclusive Delirious Documentations style. In college, I studied literature, so I often focus on the realm of books. I also post a new chocolate review about once a week. Along the way, anything and everything else that I'm thinking about or enjoying may make its way in. But isn’t the randomness what makes it all fun? Follow @deannaskaggs for updates and be sure and check out my book.
Toxicology evaluation of radiotracer doses of 3-deoxy-3-18Ffluorothymidine 18F-FLT for human PET imaging: Laboratory analysis of serial blood samples and comparison to previously investigated therapeutic FLT doses
BackgroundF-FLT is a novel PET radiotracer which has demonstrated a strong potential utility for imaging cellular proliferation in human tumors in vivo. To facilitate future regulatory approval of F-FLT for clinical use, we wished to demonstrate the safety of radiotracer doses of F-FLT administered to human subjects, by: 1 performing an evaluation of the toxicity of F-FLT administered in radiotracer amounts for PET imaging, 2 comparing a radiotracer dose of FLT to clinical trial doses of FLT.
MethodsTwenty patients gave consent to a F-FLT injection, subsequent PET imaging, and blood draws. For each patient, blood samples were collected at multiple times before and after F-FLT PET. These samples were assayed for a comprehensive metabolic panel, total bilirubin, complete blood and platelet counts. F-FLT doses of 2.59 MBq-Kg with a maximal dose of 185 MBq 5 mCi were used. Blood time-activity curves were generated for each patient from dynamic PET data, providing a measure of the area under the FLT concentration curve for 12 hours AUC12.
ResultsNo side effects were reported. Only albumin, red blood cell count, hematocrit and hemoglobin showed a statistically significant decrease over time. These changes are attributed to IV hydration during PET imaging and to subsequent blood loss at surgery. The AUC12 values estimated from imaging data are not significantly different from those found from serial measures of FLT blood concentrations p = 0.66. The blood samples-derived AUC12 values range from 0.232 ng*h-mL to 1.339 ng*h-mL with a mean of 0.802 ± 0.303 ng*h-mL. This corresponds to 0.46% to 2.68% of the lowest and least toxic clinical trial AUC12 of 50 ng*h-mL reported by Flexner et al 1994. This single injection also corresponds to a nearly 3,000-fold lower cumulative dose than in Flexner-s twice daily trial.
ConclusionThis study shows no evidence of toxicity or complications attributable to F-FLT injected intravenously.
“I have many relatives and friends who had consulted for various feng shui masters. Some of them were cheated by bogus feng shui master and they had experience the worst situation in their whole life. My friends and relatives had given me the most important advice, “ You should only engage the most reliable and trustworthy feng shui master. Or else, you may be landed by disaster and causing disharmony among the family members.” I am proud to say that I have Master Tham to be my feng shui consultant. My family and I have been witnessing the positive effects of genuine feng shui. We could feel the impact of before and after consulting Master Tham. My health has improved a lot even though I have reached the prime of my life. We do not get sick so often now. My sons and daughter-in-laws treats me very well and are staying happily together with me. They are also very hard working and co-operative with each other. All of us are in good health and financially stable and we enjoy traveling for our holidays. It is a miracle from a genuine feng shui. Recently, we have engaged Master Tham for his feng shui services for my late wife’s tomb and my living base (san kei). As the well-known saying goes, a genuine feng shui master could change your destiny for the better. Master Tham is definitely the one in a million!!”

Art theft is an ancient and complex criminal offense. When you look at the a few of the most well-known cases of art thefts in history, you see thoroughly planned operations that involve art dealerships, art fakers, mobsters, ransoms, and countless dollars. Here you can check out about a few of the most popular cases of art theft in the history.
The very first documented case of art theft was in 1473, when 2 panels of altarpiece of the Last Judgment by the Dutch painter Hans Memling were taken. While the triptych was being transferred by ship from the Netherlands to Florence, the ship was assaulted by pirates who took it to the Gdansk cathedral in Poland. Nowadays, the piece is revealed at the National Museum in Gdansk where it was recently moved from the Basilica of the Presumption.
The most well-known story of art theft involves one of the most well-known paintings in the world and one of the most famous artists in history as a suspect. In the night of August 21, 1911, the Mona Lisa was taken from the Louver. Soon after, Pablo Picasso was detained and questioned by the cops, but was released quickly.
It took about 2 years up until the mystery was solved by the Parisian police. It ended up that the 30 × 21 inch painting was taken by one of the museum workers by the name of Vincenzo Peruggia, who simply carried it hidden under his coat. Peruggia did not work alone. The crime was thoroughly carried out by a infamous bilker, Eduardo de Valfierno, who was sent out by an art faker who meant to make copies and sell them as if they were the original painting.
While Yves Chaudron, the art faker, was busy creating copies for the well-known work of art, Mona Lisa was still concealed at Peruggias house. Eventually, Peruggia was captured by the authorities while attempting to offer the painting to an art dealership from Florence, Italy.
The biggest art theft in United States occurred at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. On the night of March 18, 1990, a group of thieves using cops uniforms broke into the museum and took thirteen paintings whose cumulative worth was estimated at around 300 million dollars. The thieves took 2 paintings and one print by Rembrandt, and works of Vermeer, Manet, Degas, Govaert Flinck, as well as a French and a Chinese artifact.
Since yet, none of the paintings have actually been found and the case is still unsolved. According to recent rumors, the FBI are investigating the possibility that the Boston Mob along with French art dealers are connected to the criminal offense.
The painting by Edvard Munchs, The Scream, is probably the most demanded painting by art burglars in history. It has actually been taken two times and was only recently recuperated. In 1994, throughout the Winter Season Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, The Scream was taken from an Oslo gallery by 2 thieves who broke through an open window, set off the alarm and left a note saying: thanks for the bad security.
3 months later, the holders of the painting approached the Norwegian Government with an deal: 1 million dollars ransom for Edvard Munchs The Scream. The Government refused the deal, but the Norwegian authorities collaborated with the British Police and the Getty Museum to organize a sting operation that brought back the painting to where it belongs.
10 years later, The Scream was stolen again from the Munch Museum. This time, the burglars used a weapon and took another of Munchs painting with them. While Museum officials awaiting the burglars to request ransom loan, reports declared that both paintings were burned to conceal proof. Eventually, the Norwegian authorities discovered the two https://www.whitepages.com/name/Kurt-Criter/Denver-CO paintings on August 31, 2006 but the truths on how they were recuperated are not known.
When you look at the some of the most popular cases of art thefts in history, you see completely prepared operations that include art dealerships, art fakers, mobsters, ransoms, and millions of dollars. The most well-known story of art theft involves one of the most popular paintings in the world and one of the most well-known artists in history as a suspect. The criminal offense was carefully carried out by a well-known con male, Eduardo de Valfierno, who was sent out by an art faker who planned to make copies and sell them as if they were the original painting.
Ultimately, Peruggia was caught by the authorities while attempting to sell the painting to an art dealer from Florence, Italy. The painting by Edvard Munchs, The Scream, is probably the most sought after painting by art burglars in history.

Hello my name is Lani and I’m a book addict. My husband has half-joked that I need a twelve-step program to help with my addiction. But the first step would be to admit that I have a problem, and I don’t. After all, a book addiction isn’t a bad thing. Right? :)
As part of my book obsession, I love to meet authors. I would rather meet an author than any other type of celebrity. I love being able to listen to their inspiration, to hear their take on their characters and to talk about how their books made me feel.
Some of the experiences weren’t that fabulous–not because of any flaw on the author’s part–but because my carefully crafted façade of cool was knocked down by my inner dork. I talked too fast or got way too enthusiastic. The writers are always gracious about it, but sometimes I’m grateful to get lost and forgotten in the crowd of other fans.
My meeting with Bree Despain is a perfect example. I love and adore her book, but when I opened my mouth to wax poetic on all its beauty, all I said was, “I really liked your book, it was neat!
It’s sad but true that I managed to write an eighty-odd-thousand-word book full of descriptions and yet the best way I could describe the wonder of The Dark Divine was the word “neat.” Sigh. To this day I hang my head in shame. I cringed as soon as the word left my mouth. I certainly don’t think I impressed her with my vocabulary and I’m sort of hoping she forgot that moment (and by sort of hoping I mean really really REALLY hoping).
I did much better when I got to meet Janette Rallison. I love her books! If I’m sad, they always make me feel better. Some of her characters have Lucile Ball moments and I’ve been known to snort with laughter while reading. Yes, I just admitted to that. In fact, I admitted it to Janette Rallison. I’m not exactly sure how she felt about being told that I snort with laughter when I read her books, but really, I meant it as the highest form of praise.
When I found out Libba Bray was coming to Arizona (only five hours away), my friend Cherie and I made the road trip. We got in the car on the spur of the moment, drove five hours, listened to her amazing Q&A, and met her. She was just as cool as her blog had led me to believe. After dinner we turned around and headed home. It was a short trip but a necessary one. (A Great and Terrible Beauty is the reason that I started reading for pleasure again. College had burned me out on reading, but her books brought me back and fed my creative desire strongly enough that I finished writing Intrinsical.)
I was a little overcome by meeting Kelley Armstrong. Okay, I was overcome just by being in the same room as Kelley Armstrong! I’ve been waiting years to tell her how amazing she is. When I finally got a chance to talk to her in person I veered close to having another fan-girl moment… I think I talked more to her than with her. She listened patiently to my endless praise and handled it with good humor. (In my defense, I had years worth of enthusiasm and fangirl-ness built up and I had only about 5 minutes to share it with her. That means talking fast!)
Rachel Vincent might have been a little overwhelmed with the depth of my fangirl-ness for her Soul Screamer books. I talked to her for a really long time about the depth of my love and how concerned I was about several of her characters. I have witnesses to prove that what I will now claim actually did happen: she told me I made her night. Joy! I was so excited I had adrenaline running through my veins. It was like getting a dose of my addiction in its purest form, straight from the source.
And it wasn't very long ago I went to Rachel Caine's signing and had my two page, typed list of questions for her to answer. In my defense I wasn't going to pull out the list. I was just going to have me and my two friends ask them one at time. My friend Melonie thought it's be easier to just give Rachel the list and ratted me out for having it. It's not my fault her Morganville Vampire books are so addicting.
Probably the time where I went the most fangirl though was when I helped throw three parties for Stephenie Meyer. I threw an “I love Edward” party, helped plan the Eclipse Prom, and I was the co-host of the Prom’s after-party (which was an “I Love Jacob” party). All three of those experiences were amazing, especially since Stephenie came to all three. Aside from partying with Jonny Depp (and by partying I mean waiting in a line all day to see him at the Pirates 2 premier), that was my most awesome celebrity moment. I really went all out for these parties. Stephenie called me an Alice when it came to party planning–can anyone get better praise than that? Stephenie is very kind hearted and good to her fans.
I've met other authors and I have a fun story for each of those signings too, but that would make this post way too long. I know the characters in books aren’t real, but while I’m reading a good book they feel as though they are. The adventures in stories get carried with me into my dreams where my subconscious tries to fix whatever peril they are in. I love books and every time I read, the stories, plot and characters become a part of me, some more than others. Anytime I read a book I love and I have thoughts about it, I simply have to email the author. That’s why being able to ask them my questions in person is a hundred times better! I love being able to talk with the people who created the worlds that have become part of me. I hope my fangirl emails give them half the joy that reading their books has given me.
I get the same way when meeting authors. I think of all these cool things to say and when I get up to them I stumble all over my words, haha. It's embarassing, but I have yet to meet an author who hasn't been kind, so it's all good. :-D Just be prepared for some gushing about Intrinsical when we meet.
You're like a female version of me! I have a MAJOR book addiction (and I agree - it's the best kind of addiction to have!) and I would much rather meet an author than any other celebrity. This post was so much fun to read, and I'm so jealous that you got to have so many encounters with Stephenie Meyer! (Twilight is the reason I started writing again)
I didn't know you met so many authors, that's so cool! Sounds like all of them were a blast too, even meeting Bree ;)
Oh, and BTW? If we ever get to meet? Yeah, it'll totally be a fangirl moment for me, for reals. But then I'd be cool & show you around Anne land. :P
Okay, I thought if I got that out of my system now, when I actually meet you, I'll be able to talk coherently. The curse of the writer, at least for me and others I know, is that I can put together a string of words into the most beautiful, meaningful message...when those words come out of my fingers. Not so much when they come out of my mouth.
This was wonderful to read; it's always a pleasure seeing someone in this industry so down to Earth and humble. I'm sure - if not already - there will be fans lining up to snap photos with you, too. On a side note, the photo taken with you and Bree makes it look like the two of you could be sisters. So fun when that happens!
Jamie- It sounds like we could be good friends. :) I met Stephenie way back in the day. Before she was so famous she was able to interact more with her fans. It's nice to have someone understand my book obsession. I'm glad you enjoyed the post. :)
Lesley- Thanks for the post compliment. Having Stephanie come was pretty awesome. I'm still proud of my goody bag creations. :) All of the signings really were fun even when I embarrassed myself. :)
Colleen- It's hard to image anyone having a fan moment meeting me. LOL I'm looking forward to my trip to see you. It's going to rock. I"m glad I'll have a local to show me around.
Kristie that made me laugh so hard! I'll be just as nervous to meet you. Let's not judge each other by what comes out of mouths, okay? :)

Note: Reviews are graded from 0-5, anything higher or not showing is from our old style. Scores, however, do not reveal the important features. The written review that accompanies the ratings is the best source of information regarding the music on our site. Reviewing is opinionated, not a qualitative science, so scores are personal to the reviewer and could reflect anything from being technically brilliant to gloriously cheesy fun.
Demos and independent releases get some slack since the bands are often spent broke supporting themselves and trying to improve. Major releases usually have big financial backing, so they may be judged by a heavier hand. All scores can be eventually adjusted up or down by comparison of subsequent releases by the same band. We attempt to keep biases out of reviews and be advocates of the consumer without the undo influence of any band, label, management, promoter, etc.
It's sad, sad as guitarist Amon's breezy vocals, knowing that the greater part of humanity will miss Moonshine's third album. Why? Because these South Koreans have only played live once and barely anyone in the Western hemisphere know them. Nevertheless, for their latest, Moonshine execute a record so well put-together, so fluid in its composition, that it just flows inside your ears, stews in your brain, and lingers like a cherished memory. No flashy guitars or numbing blasts here (except for one song); from start to finish, "Eternal" is smooth as silk and cooler than fog. The band, consisting of the aforementioned Amon, drummer Giga, and bassist M, dish out flighty keyboards, whining guitar licks and sing-along pop choruses to your ears' delight if you dig this particular genre. Opener "Moonshine Madness" starts with a lonesome wolf's howl cut short by a bewitching melody that oozes from your speakers. On its more subdued counterpart, "(We) Die Cold," the first duet between Amon and she-singer Paranoid (yes, that's her name), the music explodes at the end of each nonchalant boy-girl verse. The band exudes well-bred class on "True Heart" and then turns 180 degrees for an extreme metal exercise titled "Isolation," which harnesses the intense stuff; snarling black metal screams, buzzing drums, and a thrash metal riff. Moonshine does have some bad in them after all.
"Dark Reception" easily makes the grade as the album's best cut. Soft piano notes set a perfect mood that's matched by a great hook and an LSS inducing chorus--it's irresistible. Just when you thought that the filler might come along past the halfway mark, "Chaos Lover" arrives and you can't help smiling at how seductive it gets. The aural cuddling continues up to "Dying In Beauty", whose chorus may go "You're gonna die/without her love," yet Amon's unique voice makes it sound like the sweetest endearment. On the next track, a few deep breaths work as the perfect sound bytes prior to the monster riff that begins "Breathless", Moonshine's sole venture into unbridled heavy metal. This is the song where worshippers of Megadeth, Judas Priest, and WASP are aurally gratified. Returning to their usual composed selves the moment it ends, Paranoid shares the spotlight once more and lends "No Name" its feminine touch. As good as it gets, this sparkling number would've made a hit single if the band were signed to a bigger label. Finishing with the instrumental "Regret" that has the usual pomp and flightiness for band's deeply entrenched in their melodic identities, the album still runs four songs deep as Moonshine revisit "Eternal's" better moments (namely "We Die Cold," "True Heart," "Dark Reception," and "Chaos Lover") in Korean, though they still retain some of the English choruses. Fans of Nightwish and other bands usually fronted by chicks will find "Eternal" an attractive release. This 2008, Moonshine have succeeded in creating a balanced album with universal appeal. Reason enough for it to deserve a place in your want list.

“Saying it out by words without evidence is not sufficient. The same goes for feng shui masters. Master Tham is one good example. He is the most genuine and reliable master I have ever come across. His testimonials are not only by merely words, but fully supported by clients. They had taken photographs together, in which I have not seen any masters with strong testimonials like his. His feng shui knowledge is SUPERB!! My business has improved tremendously. My daily sales have increased and there is more and more demand from my customers each day. In the past I have suffered with deteriorating business and could not compete with others until I have respectfully seeked Master Tham advised. My relationship with my wife and children is wonderful. My children are doing well in their studies, especially my mischievous son. He was first in his class and he had become very hardworking. My daughter has furthered her studies in Singapore, majoring in Accounting. Our life is perfect now. Thank you Master Tham. Your feng shui skills are not only GOOD but FANSTASTIC!!!”
“I have heard many of Master Tham’s clients complimenting of his marvellous blessing, genuine Buddhist amulets and Takruts. My career has never been smooth during the least few years. No matter how hard I’ve work hard, how much effort I’ve put into, my employer would never notice it as I have been sabotaged by my manager without my knowledge until I was been blessed by Master Tham and wearing his amulets. I was always thinking my manager was a good person. I have even missed a few promotion periods. I decided to seek Master Tham for his Feng Shui expertise to improve my career and financial luck. I am really surprised and satisfied with the results. My career has become very smooth. My employer starts to notice my hard work and effort. I was promoted and my salary has increased as well. I am gaining respect from my colleagues as well. Not only that, Master Tham’s blessing and statues, amulets had also save my wife and I from been killed from a large falling tree. With full trust in Master Tham, we finally invited him to feng shui our home in Singapore. Master Tham is a very capable master. He’s the TRUTH and GENUINE MASTER!!”

This summer the twins spent a fortnight with the grandparents whilst Paul and I worked (this has been the most difficult part of going full-time for me, not being able to spend the school holidays with my girls). At the end of the fortnight, Paul and I travelled up to the Midlands on Friday after work and we all spent the weekend together.
We have visited a number of places on previous visits, Sherwood Forest, White Post Farm and Newark, all of which are beautiful but this time the grandparents took us to Creswell Crags.
It’s such a strange name that doesn’t give anything away, does it? But if you venture out to this beauty spot you’ll be surprised at what a great place it is for the family and especially for the kids.
The first thing that struck me was the fact that this place has been a stop off for travellers for thousands of years, we’re talking between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago.
The limestone gorge has plenty of caves along the sides and in some of them, stone tools and animal remains have been found along with the most amazing Ice Age rock art proof of the dwellers that passed by many years ago.
We are lucky to have a number of caves used in prehistoric times in Britain and walking around them brings a quick history lesson to life – not just for the children! It’s impossible to not think about how it would have been and looked all that time ago. How cold would the caves have been to sleep in? How would they have kept themselves warm and safe with no door to close?
Situated on the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border Creswell Craggs has a large car park where you can leave the car all day for just £3. It is free to visit the site and walk around the lake and gorge and you can also stop off in the cafeteria and gift shop before making your way home.
There are two tours that you can book to attend The Ice Age Tour and the Rock Art Tour. We hadn’t booked anything and arrived at the wrong time to join a tour so it’s worth checking their website before you go for times and prices.
The Ice Age tour takes place in Robin Hood Cave, the largest cave on the site and you find out who lived there, why they were there and how the information was discovered.
The Rock Art tour shows the only Ice Age Rock Art known in Britain. It was discovered in 2003 and consists of engravings of animals, birds and motifs. The engravings are estimated to be 13,000 years old making Church Hole Cave the oldest in Britain.
We chose to walk around Creswell Crags under our own steam. The walk is a leisurely one with the girls scrambling up every rock face they can to peek into the caves – which incidentally are closed and only opened by the tour guide. The photo above is down at the bottom of the gorge working our way back up to the centre. We also collected a bagful of wild blackberries on our way round and added them to our roulade pudding that nonna prepared that evening.
There are lots of informative signs as you go round which the twins loved reading. I don’t think they could quite understand the extent of how old it all was but they found it fascinating and I know it’s the kind of information that stuck.
Down at the bottom of the gorge, we got caught in some light rain and the pair of them danced around having a good laugh and enjoying being outside in the fresh air.
Sometimes it’s when you least expect it that you get a really good photo. I love this one of Alice in the tree whilst we were waiting for the rain to stop.
Once we had completed the gorge, we worked our way back to the centre where there is a large green area with games for the children to play on – slides down the mammoth’s tusks and climbing frames. There are also some picnic tables, where we stopped for lunch and as you get to the top there is the gift shop full of fossils, semi-precious stones and plenty of other merchandise to tempt you.
If you don’t have a picnic, the coffee shop has snacks and drinks and there is also an exhibition that you can pay to enter too.

“Thank you very much Master Tham. My whole family appreciated what you have done for us. Your feng shui advices had made my business to expand from one shop to double which I have never expected. Both of my sons have scored well in their studies and currently, they are pursuing their degrees majoring in Computers and Engineering. Our family is very close, understanding, healthy and everything goes well for us. We could feel that we are more energetic and younger. Now, we would go for breakfast every morning together before we head to work. Thank you very much Master Tham for practicing “truth” feng shui for us and for others!”
“I am a widower. Since I have consulted Master Tham for his feng shui advises, my business has improved and my landed properties have started to accumulate. I have bought a piece of plantation land as well as housing development land. My son has improved in his studies. He had taken Penilaian Tahap Satu (PTS) and passed the examination. He had skipped Standard Four and proceeded on to Standard Five. He had scored Straight As in his Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) examination. Now, he has furthered his studies in college with scholarships. I am very glad as I do not have to worry about his studies anymore. My relationship with my children is very close and we lead a happy and healthy life. We thank Master Tham for not only good feng shui but for his FANTASTIC FENG SHUI!”
“My husband and I are involved in different business. I am involved in trading of bulk goods, where I am the middle person while my husband operates a hardware shop and spare parts. Before we consulted Master Tham, I am always lacked of luck and not well in dealing in human relationship. I could never agree in good terms with the suppliers and customers. I had lost a lot of businesses, especially the major customers. My husband’s businesses did not go on well. He always has difficulty in collecting his debts. My only son is very quiet and has difficulties in mixing around. We decided to pay Master Tham a visit during my sister from KL after been recommended by her friends with great hopes to improve all our luck. It is very unique to have a feng shui master with so many real life testimonials with photographs taken along with his grateful clients. My brother-in-law had been unemployed for quite some time and my sister was facing insomnia. After some consultation and recommendations from Master Tham, we had purchased takruts for personal protection (TR001), takruts for enhancing relationship and business (TR002) and building takruts (TR003 and TR004). It is amazing to feel the changes in our life after we had carried the takruts with us. I could instantly feel that my relationships with others had increased, even those passer-by on the road would smile at me! My son begins to mix around and gain new friends. Most important of all, he is more obedient and listens to my advices. My husband is able to collect his debts. As for my brother-in-law, he is very happy as he is able to secure a good job and my sister is sleeping soundly every night. Recently, I have requested Master Tham to tailor a specially-made Takrut to suit my birth chart as I am meeting with a supplier from Hong Kong. We are very satisfied with the results and thank you Master Tham!”

The average dental operatory cannot comfortably handle a wheelchair with the fixed operatory chair as an obstacle. This is a barrier to dental care for millions of patients in wheelchairs and gurneys (W&G). Such patients deserve the equal opportunity to sit or lie comfortably while dental work is performed on them. This CE webinar will illustrate how movable operatory chairs glide to the side of the room to allow wheelchairs to be rolled right next to them, facilitating easy patient transfer into the operatory chair.
This CE webinar will describe and demonstrate a long-handle multipurpose tool that utilizes amber and violet intraoral light to reveal increased vascularization in the mouth, whereby oral cancers can be differentiated from normal oral tissue. Its white light detects enamel crazes and fractures. Its intraoral light and disposable mirror retract the cheek allowing an easy oral exam in the dental operatory or off-site.

Every dental operatory needs special lighting to illuminate the doctor’s and hygienist’s clinical field. Old-style halogen lighting has both clinical and environmental limitations, and involves added expense. LED technology, by contrast, provides improved visibility, is designed to work with the latest restorative materials, and offers superior environmental performance. LED operatory lighting facilitates the creation of beautiful restorations in office, and is an essential piece of equipment for today’s high-tech dental office.
Digital impressions have been around for over 27 years beginning with the CEREC system. In the past years 3 more systems have entered the marketplace with four or more coming during this year.

After choosing the right storage facility that fits your needs, now you need to consider how to protect your storage unit belongings in the best way. While you can easily throw all of your things into your unit, this can become a big hassle and may end up damaging some items that are too expensive to replace, or even priceless. Here are some tips to help you protect your valuable possessions and belongings in your storage unit.
Determine whether the goods you are storing will be better protected by placing them in boxes, totes, or other containers. You may need to purchase specialized boxes and other packing supplies to protect your items during the move and while they are stowed away in storage.
Thoroughly clean, disinfect and dry refrigerators, freezers, stoves and other appliances. Prevent possible injury during moving by using packaging tape to make sure that appliance doors are securely shut. Also make sure that all appliances are thoroughly dry before storing in order to prevent mold or rust overtime. For other machines that may be placed in storage for an extended period of time, use a few drops of machine oil to lightly coat any items in order to prevent rust.
Use wardrobe boxes to store any clothing that is usually placed on a hanger at home. Another option is to use space-saver bags or totes for clothes. We would highly recommend space-saver bags because they protect your clothing and they help to maximize storage space in your unit. An added note is to clean and launder all drapes, curtains, linens and clothing items before they are placed in storage.
Take care when packing your fragile items such as dishes or glassware. Use bubble wrap and other packing materials to protect your storage unit belongings, and especially when storing delicate items. Pack similar items in the same box and fill empty spaces with packing peanuts, bubble wrap or newspaper.
Cover computer screens and large television screens with dust covers and wrap in bubble wrap if you are storing these items next to furniture and other equipment. You can also use the original packaging to protect your storage unit belongings if you still have them at home. As an alternative, there are also TV packaging boxes, which you can purchase online, that are specifically made to protect TVs during a move or while in storage.
For the last couple of weeks our internet has been patchy to non-existent, but things seem to be running faster today so I'm going to try uploading a catch-up blog post. So ... what has been going on in our little corner of the mountains recently?
Well, we have gotten back into our school groove and are in our third week of Abeka K5. We have a teacher and classmates on our school DVDs, and Mrs Reese is Anna's kindergarten teacher this year.
Reviewing her accomplishments last year on her first day of this school year. She needed some spelling help, but got a lot of it on her own!
This is a very different approach from our first year of school, but it's going pretty well. The first month or so of DVD lessons is reviewing material already covered last year, so at some points in the DVD we just switch to our own material and continue where we left off before the summer. A definite strength of the Abeka program is their focus on memorisation. In the first three weeks of classes, Anna has committed to memory the Pledge of Allegiance, the Lord's Prayer, three Bible verses, three poems and numerous new songs, and is also learning to write in cursive. Levi will often sit with her and listen to her classes, and has started reciting bits and pieces of her work with her, which is fun to listen to :)
This little girl is growing quickly; hard to believe she is approaching 7 months! She is almost sitting up by herself, and can squirm her way around on the floor now. She's started eating solids, although I think I may have ruined her for life by making the rookie mistake of starting her on delicious bananas instead of some bland vegetable. So now she has her mama's incurable sweet tooth and rejects her vegetables, silly girl!
Over the last few weeks, the measles outbreak seems to have slowed down and Mark is barely seeing any new cases at the hospital. We have been staying home from church since the beginning of the outbreak since Lucy is not old enough to be vaccinated, and whenever she is out and about with me she receives plenty of attention, love and touching from our PNG neighbours :) So we have had a couple months of family church at home in our living room in an attempt to not expose her to the illness.
However, Mark and I have each had the opportunity to take one or both of the big kids out to a bush church. Recently Mark stayed with Lucy while I took Anna and Levi to the church of a nearby orphanage. We went with another missionary family and were able to take part in leading the service. Anna helped me teach a Bible verse to the kids - "Ol sipsip bilong me i save harim maus bilong me" (John 10:27 - "My sheep know my voice") - and explain the analogy of Jesus as the Good Shepherd.
Since we're a little short on recreation/ free time options here, Mark has been developing a new hobby that makes use of one thing that IS here - the workshop. He has been learning from some of the guys on station who are responsible for maintenance and construction, and has built a porch swing, night stand and now a much-needed bookshelf for our house. Levi has been learning right along with him, and is always glad for the chance to go see (if not actually use yet) the power tools :)
On the 16th of this month, PNG celebrated the anniversary of its independence from Australia. We invited one of Mark's colleagues from the ER, Petrus, and his family to our house for lunch and were able to learn a little more about traditional celebrations and customs that mark this day. After lunch Petrus and Mark walked to his village to watch some of the local fun, while Francesca and I visited and the kids played.
So, there you have a little glimpse into what has been going on here while our more regular updates were on hold :)
If you are a regular here, you already know that I try on most days to limit my carbs and to eat healthy. I do not completely deprive myself though. Once a week (usually on Friday nights) I eat anything I want for one meal AND I also indulge in dessert. I think it's important to do that, even if you are trying to loose weight. Deprivation can totally derail your efforts because when you are feeling deprived you tend to "cheat" on your diet. I've found (at least for me) that the one "bad" meal a week doesn't undo all my hard work from the rest of the week and prevent the number on the scale from decreasing.
So earlier this week I was craving a steak and cheese sandwich, and then I remembered that I saw somewhere a picture of a steak and cheese stuffed pepper (might have been on Pinterest). I didn't go seeking to find it though. Since steak and cheese is pretty self-explanatory, I just did it my way. This was a great low-carb meal that satisfied my steak and cheese craving. Both my husband and son liked it too. I was worried my son would say "I prefer the actual sandwich" but he didn't! He still may have been thinking that, but what he actually said was that it was good - much better than he thought it would be. I'll take it ☺
Cut the sirloin as thin as you can into strips. Place into a ziplock bag and pour a little (about 1/4 cup) teriyaki sauce into bag and let it marinade in the fridge for 15-30 minutes. You can of course skip marinading the beef in the sauce - I did it because it flavors the beef just a little so it's not bland, but I only use a little because I don't want it to taste like teriyaki beef.
In a large saucepan, fill it about half full with water and bring it to a boil. Cut tops off the peppers and remove the seeds and ribs from inside. If your peppers are very large you can cut them lengthwise instead. Place in boiling water for about 4-6 minutes - you just want to soften them, but don't cook them to the point that they will break apart when you try to remove them from the water. Meanwhile, in a medium sized saute pan melt about 1 tbsp of butter, then add the sliced onion and mushrooms. Saute on med-low heat until onions are translucent and soft - about 20 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350, and spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray, Add the beef to the onions and mushrooms and cook until no longer pink, but be careful to not overcook the beef (you want it to be tender, not dried and rubbery). Spoon the beef mixture into each pepper evenly, then top with a piece of provolone cheese and place them into the baking dish. Bake in oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the cheese is slightly browned.
I saw this on Facebook. I always try to find the original source, so I looked it up on Pinterest. I found it there from a site called Recipe Newz. I clicked through to find it here and tried to pin it to Pinterest, but the only pinnable images are your blog header and profile pic. Just wanted you to know --
I'm not sure I understand exactly. I tested to "Pin it" button here and it worked fine, but thank you very much for letting me know!

Great room for being in South Beach...Wasn't expecting it to be as nice and clean. Very pleased. It was really chic and the staff was very friendly. For the location and price, I'd definitely stay there again.
I asked for two queen beds or at least 2 separate beds but I couldnt get anything but a normal regular bed.
I was very annoyed that there was a mandatory $16.95 resort fee when I registered that I did not agree to when I booked it. The fee was for breakfast, (I checked out at 5:30 am which was prior to breakfast), drinks(I do not drink) and beach facilities, towels etc( I arrived near five pm and left early in the morning at 5:30). It is outragous that I should have incured an expense that I neither agreed to when booking or that I would use the facilities it was intended to support.
No service - poor staff skills, impersonal may as well just selected a key from a vending machine . Would not recommend to anyone. Could not get breakfast as they dfo not serve prior to 8am, but as I was leaving before 8am, I requested that I get something the night before and keep in my fridge. No go on that one. No free 1-800 numbers but other Hotels in the district have that for no extra included in the fee. Ropey Wi-Fi service - poorly administered. Rating 0.5 out of 5 stars. Will never ever stay there again and am spreading the word fast to all my colleagues and friends nmot to stay there. Best Scott
No towels for two days. Front desk promised, but did not deliver. The vouchers for drinks are bogus, so is the Breakfast. However, Starbucks and other Breakfast places just around the corner. Some things are not ideal. Ac icing up, No towels. Rooms not in prime shape. Shebby corridors, relatively ok and practical rooms.
Everything else was terrible from check in through to check out. The room was poor and nothing like the images. I had to move out of an Ocean view room as the shower was broken, the receptionist at check in was so rude and unhelpful. To be fair the one when I checked out was very nice. The breakfast is basic and at $15 extra, which you have to pay for at check in, its not worth it at all. My advice would be to avoid this place.
Nice hotel. The location is excellent and I really recommend it for that. For a 3 star hotel with this location, the price is quite good. The bathroom and the towels were clean.
Localization is great! We had a great time for going to the beach, shopping or having meals around the hotel. The room space is good, bed is confortable and cleaness is ok.
the hotel was perfect for a nice long weekend getaway..close to the beach...close to shopping and excellent restaurants.

Director Pa Ranjith has broken silence on his next movie- Superstar Rajinikanth’s ‘Kabali’- in an interview to a Tamil magazine.
According to him, the ‘thalaivar’ is playing an international don, who however runs a school for children whose families are affected by the underworld. ‘Madras’ fame Kalaiarasan is the instructor of that school.
Attakathi Dinesh plays the son of another don. But he joins Rajini’s team after getting impressed by his style. Contrary to what was earlier believed, Dhansika is not playing Rajini’s daughter. Instead, she too is part of the underworld and is in the opponent’s team of Rajini.
“Dhansikaa plays a Thai-based gangster and has her own gang. She plays a brat of a daughter who has serious issues with her father,” a source from the film’s unit told.
“She sports a boy cut and plays a character that’s very different from anything she has played so far in her career,” he said.
Radhika Apte plays a worker in a farm, who marries Rajini later. A scene was shot in Goa recently, in which ‘aged romance’ between Rajiniand Radhika was captured.
“Shooting is over and post-production works are on. Teaser, trailer and music will be released very soon and the film will hit the screens soon,” Ranjith said.

Perhaps I'm feeling more cynical than usual, but I was reading the Humour Spleen yesterday and she was mentioning that worst case scenario they would get to May 8th by the February/March batch. Really? I'd LOVE to believe this, and I'd love for it to be true, but I've been burnt SO many times along this journey (as we all have). I just can't see it happening.
The Humour Spleen amuses me. Even though she says that she doesn't censor comments, mine was yesterday. It sat waiting for approval, but today it just...vanished. I'm heartbroken (not). In case you were wondering, I had the gall to question why she bothers posting the 'mid' and 'good' case scenarios anymore. ;)
So yes, boy and girls if they get to May by February/March, I will post pictures of actual monkeys flying outta my ass. :)

IInktober is almost half way through and I have been going a pretty good job of keeping up with the challenge this year. I have been committed to completing a fully inked image each day complete with background this time. I have also stuck to a theme this time. This is my third year to participate in Jake Parker's challenge of one inked drawing a day for the month of October.
Some may be wondering about the missing drawings. I have skipped two days purposefully this month because of a personal challenge I have pursued this entire year of not doing any art or art career related activities on Sundays. If I feel like it I may catch up during the month but more likely I will simply spend an extra five days of November finishing the 31 drawing project.
I have had to take a break from art from the beginning of the school year up until the Inktober challenge began. The children's book is at a great point right now but is put on hold while I focus on other things- possibly until the holiday season and first half our school year is done. Inktober has been a fun reminder of my growth with drawing skill since last year. The difference in what I am able to accomplish (in a hurry) since then and even more so- the first year I did the challenge has been an encouragement. I can definitely say that things in the house have gotten just a little bit more out of hand than they were before because I have often foregone the usual cleaning schedule in order to fit in more drawing time. As a matter of fact I am already in a crunch to start and finish one this evening. Thanks for reading.
Thanks for stopping by. I'm a published illustrator working on getting better every day. My goal for my work is for it to be charming, bright and endearing. I share my ongoing work progress online because I welcome all the encouragement and feedback I can get as I try to improve my skills. I currently have a children's book project that I am nearing the end of.

A small dry-erase board on the side of our refrigerator sat empty for a few days when we moved into the new house. I’m not one to leave things empty or blank very long. Should we use it for the grocery list? Notes to each other or reminders?
And then it hit me. I could use it for parenting and bringing us together as a family. I could use it to spur discussions about important life lessons that may otherwise feel awkward or forced to bring up. I didn’t talk with anyone about it, I simply wrote: “Word of the Week: Thankful” on the board and left it there.
We gathered around the table that Sunday night, all six of us, to eat dinner. I don’t remember what we were eating, but I do remember what came next. I asked if anyone noticed the Word of the Week and they all said yes and said “Thankful.” We talked about why it’s important to be thankful and what we are thankful for. We talked about the opposite of thankful: ungrateful or entitled.
This word had been on my mind that week and I was looking for an opportunity to bring it up with the kids, but in a conversational way and not too heavy-handed. There was a situation that happened earlier that week with a friend of one of the children. I won’t go into detail here, but after going to great lengths to include this child in a family activity, they didn’t say thank you. And I felt disappointed.
So at dinner, we specifically talked about saying thank you to people who do nice things for us. To our parents and siblings, friends, teachers, office staff at school, bus drivers, our friend’s parents… anyone and everyone who does something for you deserves to be thanked. And for us to not take it for granted. It was a good conversation. The kids asked who gets to choose the next word and, not having thought about it yet, I quickly shared that each Sunday another person could choose the next word – and we’d do it in age order. Avery piped up “starting with the youngest?!” and after we all had a good chuckle, I said, “Yes, starting with the youngest.”
The following Sunday, his word of the week turned out to not really be a word at all, but an acronym: YOLO, which stands for “You Only Live Once.” Avery asked if it would count, and I said “of course,” knowing there were great lessons we could talk about with it. It’s a popular word for kids right now – usually preceded by a hashtag. The kids even yell “YOLO” when they really want to say “I’m so cool” or “this is so cool.” So as a family we discussed what it could mean on a deeper level. What are things people want to do before they die? How can YOLO motivate you to do things in the face of fear? For Avery, he was a little afraid of going down to the basement in the new house alone. After two weeks of letting fear stop him, he was motivated enough to be able to play video games that he was willing to try going down there alone. He had fun and suddenly wasn’t afraid anymore. This was a great example of YOLO! He didn’t waste any more time being afraid and now gets to do something fun.
Alex was up to choose the third word of the week – after debating for two weeks if he would choose Happiness or Kindness, he chose happiness. I love that he was thinking about it for a long time and deliberately chose a word he wanted to share with everyone. This was an easy word for us to chat about at Sunday night dinner. We all talked about what makes us happy. As the move and the wedding were the hot topics for everyone, most of the answers surrounding us being a family now and how excited and happy we all were. This Word of the Week thing had worked for three weeks in a row! I was excited the kids were involved and really felt like we were all sharing.
The fourth week brought Gabe’s turn to choose a word. He wrote Family on the board… a fun part of the honor of selecting the Word of the Week is to write it yourself the board. We all shared what family means to us… I loved the opportunity to talk about how we’re all going through changes as we come together as a new family. And what unconditional love means and why that’s important. The newest member of our family, Ruby the mini golden doodle, had surgery the same week to be spayed and we were all working hard to take care of her with more attention than usual. Avery asked if it was okay to add “Help Ruby” to the whiteboard since we are all supposed to help her. Of course she could, but I was impressed and happy when I saw she wrote it as a hashtag: #helpruby.
Only two more weeks until we’ve all had a chance to choose the Word of the Week. My goal is to keep going throughout 2016 as a way to inspire reflection, togetherness and sharing. So far, I’m humbled and happy with how well it’s going. Do you have a similar tradition in your family? Feel free to use this idea in your home, too!

My 2 and a half year old son, is in and out of fever since Saturday night. I didn't bring him to the clinic immediately unlike when he is younger because he has no other symptom. At 1 am on Sunday he has a temperature of 39.5 degrees celsius and was crying as he was uncomfortable from the heat. I sponged him every hour or so, because I ran out of fever medicine at that time. So the next day I bought a bottle of liquid paracetamol for children 1 to 6 years of age. I mixed it into his bottle of milk because the last time I fed him medicine he vomited along with his food. Actually I meant to get medicine from the store's pharmacist but the pharmacy side of the Pharmacy is closed on weekend. So we had to get by with on the counter medicine.
He drank his milk with Strawberry paracetamol without any rejection. I also offered him water every now and then, he sipped some and refused at others. I fed him bread, rice and roti canai but he consumed only a little bit each time. And after he ate a portion he will go "Bu Tan" which means "Ibu makan." So I end up finishing most of his meals.
So today I took him to the clinic first before going to the office. Firstly the doctor measured his fever and it was 36.6 degrees which shows he isn't feverish by day. Then after a bit of prodding the we went outside. The doctor checked the usuals; eyes, heartbeat, throat (baby didn't open because he was crying - I took away my phone which he was playing games on just before the nurse called :P), and asked questions - answer; no coughs, no diarrhea, a little flu.
I didn't manage to ask the doctor nor did the doctor explain what is happening to my child. We waited for a bit and the nurse gave me his meds, a bottle of antibiotic, flu med and something med. 3 bottles of medicine I will have no idea how to feed him. This time I can't put it all in his bottle la kan.
Anyway I did a bit of googling, and his symptoms which are high temperature fevers which is mostly at night. One of the results is Roseola. But Roseola only happens to children less than 2 years old. I wrote a status about googling my baby's symptoms and a few friends shared their techniques on how to reduce his fever. I will try the asam jawa method, that sounds traditional. I think the technique is to soak asam jawa in water and use it to reduce his heat.
Actually the first night my son went down with fever I googled on how to reduce his fever but I read somewhere that fever is the body's way to fight an infection. Doctors usually prescribe meds to relieve the patient so they won't feel so uncomfortable while being sickly. Like Paracetamol, it is thought to make the body don't feel the pain so much
"However, it is now thought that it works by reducing the production of prostaglandins in the brain and spinal cord. Prostaglandins are produced by the body in response to injury and certain diseases. One of their actions is to sensitise nerve endings, so that when the injury is stimulated it causes pain (presumably to prevent us from causing further harm to the area). As paracetamol reduces the production of these nerve sensitising prostaglandins it is thought it may increase our pain threshold, so that although the injury remains, we can feel it less.
Well, it's 6 pm something and I have to get off early. My son turns feverish around this time yesterday so I better go fetch him.
ps: I am thinking of turning my blog into something profitable but I have to keep up with exciting contents, maybe you have suggestions?
When we receive your order, we first need to approve it and to make sure your website meets all of our Terms of service. We then match and check your selections on our advertising network to make sure we can supply all the amount of visitors you need. Right after that, we create a new advertising campaign for you with targeted ads and put your website into our service queue based on your selections- now your campaign is ready to start. Very soon you will begin to get targeted visitors traffic to your website all are unique targeted visitors.
We know what we do, therefore, we offer a full money back guarantee in case you do not receive 100% traffic of what you ordered. Normally, we over-deliver. Also, if the visitors you bought are not adhering to the niche and geo-targeting you chose, we can stop your campaign and refund you the pro-rated unspent credit within 24 hours. Unfortunately this guarantee is not applicable to any Google Adsense Safe Traffic. More information >>
Embed Social sharing buttons in your website – Facebook, Twitter and Google+ (yes Google+ is important) as a minimum. You may choose to add other social networks which are relevant for your specific website niche. Avoid using a 100,000 social share buttons because that increases page load time, make for a horrible user experience and will decrease instead of increase your traffic including your social media traffic.
I mean have you seen a recent downfall of EA Community Team and their post on Reddit who got 674k downvotes? It was a heavy blow to their whole company even their stocks and shareholders suffered consequences (of course not everything was related to that post but it still had an enormous impact on their sales and pre orders). My point is, ALWAYS try to find someone with whom you can consult about those things DON’T just do them on your own, it might bite you in the back.
We should warn you that we can not guarantee the improved performance of your website. How well the visitors from our traffic convert is totally dependent on your website. For starters it depends on what kind of website you have, as you might imagine, a website that sells expensive smartphones would logically have lower conversion rate than a simple online shoe store
5) Post at the right time. Let’s say you want to post in the r/Entrepreneur/ subreddit, but there’s already a post in the #1 spot with 200 upvotes, and it was posted 4 hours ago. If you post at that time, you probably won’t overtake that #1 spot, and you’ll get less traffic. However, if you wait a day, check back, and see that the new #1 spot only has 12-15 upvotes, you’ll have a golden opportunity. It will be much easier for you to hit the #1 spot and get hundreds of upvotes.
If you want to get more exposure, then take your business to offline world. When offline business entering online world to grow their business, why not online businesses go into real world. No need to invest millions to do this, you must target those people you`re in search of your service. The Easiest way that strikes my mind now is, attend seminars, and trying to meet with like-minded people. Plan for giveaways as you plan on your blog.
Once you have your list, choose an email marketing service provider that can provide design templates, send the emails for you and help you comply with CAN-SPAM and privacy regulations. Track the results of your email campaigns using analytics tools from your email marketing service provider, and update your email database regularly to ensure the addresses are still current.
The best websites have some common elements that have been proven to increase traffic (and sales): they use search engines to their advantage by crafting site content to conform to search engine optimization (SEO) rules, they use targeted search and email marketing to find customers, and they continue to attract customers with strong, interesting content.
“I believe in teaching what you do! Product creation alone is not a business plan. I believe the most actionable trainings come from people sharing their own experiences and is what I aim to continue to do. This way I am providing maximum value while allowing you, the customer, to have an extremely high success rate following along with what I do everyday!” – Shane Farrell
No, this isn’t a tool to generate traffic jams on your way to work. Instead, it’s a piece of software a lot like 1MC, designed to send hits towards a website repeatedly. This one is a quick and easy to use program, with very little in the way of customization options, but that’s okay. It’s designed to do one thing and one thing only, and it does that thing.
Figures on a free website traffic checker are never completely accurate – tests have shown there may be considerable deviations. Therefore, you should always consider the results as estimates and guidelines. The tools are more suitable for a quick traffic comparison of different websites than for determining precise key figures. Important: to ensure that the comparison is also meaningful, it is best to always use the same tool – otherwise the results can be heavily falsified.
To track website traffic you need analytics software. That anonymously logs every visitor to your site and keeps track of their actions. One of the most popular analytics apps is Google Analytics. It’s free, but there can be a learning curve in getting it set up correctly. If you don’t add your tracking code the right way, then you won’t be able to track your traffic. Consider getting an analytics expert to help you create the right setup for your website.
Why Rebels? In the exciting and sometimes frustrating world of IM, there is one constant: hype. Too much of it, The Rebels believe. Excitement is great but too much hype can mislead prospective consumers, even lead them to make poor decisions. And that has led to many people having a perception of this industry that ranges from caution to considering it a complete sham.
Guest blogging is a legitimate way to create a press mention (and link) on a credible website. It’s a powerful, but sensitive tactic that starts with empathy for the needs of the editor and their target audience. When used properly, a high-value article is published in your name on another site and potentially links back to the in-depth article on your website.
I love your post. I keep coming back because you always have great content I can use in my business as well as share. Since I own my own Digital Marketing company I guess you would be one of THE influencers in Internet Marketing field. I just started my business and because most influencers on twitter are talking about Content Marketing, that is what I have been writing about. But my site is only about a month old so I will just stay consistent in my writing. I’m also in the process of changing my navigation bar so be know how to get to what they want faster. Which would be “what is SEO”, etc. Thanks and would love any advice you can give me.

In the stamping process, once mold clamping is inflexible or even stuck, it is necessary to immediately stop production, find the cause of the card mold, and troubleshoot. Otherwise, it will expand the fault and cause damage to the mold.
The main causes of the card die are: poor mold guiding, tilting; or foreign matter between the templates, so that the template can not be flat; mold strength design is not enough or uneven force, resulting in deformation of the mold.
For example, the hardness and thickness of die holders and stencils are too small to be easily deformed by external forces; the position of the die is not installed correctly, and the positioning error of the upper and lower dies is not good enough; or the precision of the press is too bad, causing the interference of the die; the strength of the punches. Not enough, the size of the punch is too close, so that the lateral force of the mold is not balanced. At this time, the strength of the punch should be increased to enhance the guide and protection of the stripper plate.

If you’d like a home loan, then you can get one via the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. However, in case you have a different option it is better to go for it as FHA loans are not the best choice. If you make a mistake while applying for the loan it can cost you a lot. It is there is therefore important to know what the loan entails before getting one. Below are a few of the aspects you need to know about FHA loans prior to signing up for one.
FHA loans are beneficial since they give a more comfortable borrowing criteria and smaller down payment requirements as low as 3. 5%. The problem to this type of loan is that if you have a good credit rating and large down payment, then you are likely to pay more interest and fees for the loan as compared to other conventional loans. However, FHA loans may be the best option if your credit score is below 600. To determine whether you are qualified to apply for the loan, you can use an FHA affordability calculator for calculating your credit score. On the other hand, VA loan can be a better option than the FHA loan as the loan offers better terms for veterans who want to buy a house regardless of their credit score. Also the USDA loan can be a better choice for people who want to purchase rural properties or live in a farm.
Another downside to FHA loan is that their use is limited. The loan’s purpose is to buy primary residence. The loan does not cover purchasing rental properties, vacation homes, or cottages. If you buy such properties under the guise of your permanent residence and you are discovered, you will be highly penalized. The standard maximum amount of FHA loan allowed is $625, 000 as of 2016 although the calculation will factor in the locality of the house up to 115% of median home price in such an area.
Another limitation of FHA loan is that it can only be used to purchase a livable house. This means you can’t use the loan to purchase a condemned house with the expectations of fixing it. FHA loan does not finance the purchase of homes that does not meet its safety, security and livability standards. However, FHA 203(k) Rehab Mortgage can allow you to buy property which needs repairs but you must hire a general contractor to do the repairs rather than doing it yourself.
House flipping isn’t allowed as per FHA mortgage rules. You’re also required to move in the house within 60 days after closing the purchase. Financing a home via FHA loan and then renting it out is categorized as bank fraud and is punishable as per FHA rules.

I haven't posted anything in ages (terrible, I know, but I was very busy!) , so I decided to get back into the swing of things with a beauty post. This is a collab with Lily Mae, another new blogger! Make sure to check out her blog : allthingslilyblog.blogspot.com . She's super sweet and nice and her blog is also extremley lovely!<3
Okay, I've spoken about this brush before, but it's truly one of my favourite brushes and is useful for most face-related things. Definitely a must-buy if you're thinking of purchasing new brushes!
I was going to put the Collection 'Lasting Perfection' concealer, but I feel like everyone always speaks about it, so I decided to include my 2nd favorite concealer: the Maybelline fit me. This product has a really great consistency and coverage, whilst also being rather inexspensive:) (also I know I didn't include it in the photo, but I couldn't find the tube oops)
I used to have quite a bit of trouble applying until I bought this beauty blender... I guess you could say that it changed my life makeup- wise:) My skin is rather oily and acne prone, but this product helps me to get a very smooth and even base!
Although I didn't really like this mascara when I first purchased it, I ended up falling absolutely in love with it! It gives my lashes a lot of length and is great for layering.
This is seriously one of my favourite brow products, it simply works amazing! Quick mid-post brow tutorial: firstly I brush my eyebrows into place and fill them in. Afterwards I apply this to darken them and give them a nicer shape.. Also, if anyone was curious, I use the shade ' medium brown' :)
And so, we come to the end of this very-delayed blog post. I feel like my descriptions of the products were kinda awkward and not very informative, but I decided to give makeup-related posts a try.
Well.....hey. I'm brand new to blogging, so I'm not really sure how to start this off. I guess I'll introduce myself.
My name is Maya, and I'm a typical teenage girl living a typical teenage life...that sounded horribly cliche, but I don't really know how to put it any other way. I wake up, go to school,do (awfully boring) homework, eat food and then proceed to waste my life by spending hours on the internet . I've decided to start this blog so that I have a way to share my many thoughts and feelings with the world. Since this is my first ever blog post, I've decided to compile a list of (incredibly) random facts about me, so that anyone reading this can hopefully get to know me a little bit. In fact, shoutout to anyone who's reading this, although I doubt anyone is. As of now, I'm pretty much a tiny, irrelevant fish in a huge pond full of successful bloggers.
Anyway, my introduction is starting to become a little too long, so lets just get on with the facts!
1. Fashion and writing are two of my favourite things. Therefore, my dream is to become the editor-in-chief of either Vogue, Elle or any other popular fashion/beauty/lifestyle magazine. Basically, in the future I want to have a career like Anna Wintour. That would be fantastic.
2. I've lived in England my whole life and I've only ever visited three places abroad: Poland (where I go e
very year to see family!), Paris and Spain. Also,I've been to Wales twice, but I'm not sure if that counts as 'abroad'. However, I've become determined to travel more and decided that I really want to see more of the world. As a result, my mum and I have decided to go on a tour of the USA in the summer holidays, which I'm incredibly excited for! Although I haven't visited them (yet!), my dream future home is either LA or New York:)
3. I'm a huge fan of YouTube, and have been since about 2012. Some of my favourite YouTubers are: Tana Mongeau, Channon Rose, Brittany Lee Saunders, danisnotonfire and AmazingPhil. I actually plan to start my own YouTube channel sometime soon, as its been something I've wanted to do for about 3 years. However, I'm extremley camera-shy, so before I can get anywhere with YouTube, I need to sort that out!
4. I'd describe myself as someone who can be quite shy at first, but once they feel comfortable are very chatty and loud. Honestly, I wish I could shut up, as talking is always getting me into trouble. Furthermore, I'm incredibly disorganised and am practically late for every commitment ever, but I'm trying at the moment to work on it!
5.As well as fashion and writing, my hobbies include playing instruments and acting. I just recentley started taking Guitar lessons, and I'm really enjoying it so far. I used to play Violin, but quit after 4 years, because I unfortunately lost interest in it and stopped enjoying it as much as I used to. Also, I love acting and o quite a lot of drama in school. In fact, I'm auditioning soon to join an out-of-school drama club, so wish me luck! Auditions always really freak me out , so I'm currently imagining worst-case-scenarios of what could go wrong, ugh.
So, hey... that was my first ever post. It feels quite strange, but reassuring to say that. Except a lot more on fashion, lifestyle, beauty, music and just generally what's on my mind.
Anyway, I gotta get going as its 12am and I have to wake up early for school tomorrow ( and to do my Latin homework because I'm a lazy twat who spent her whole entire weekend procrastinating)
Let's start with the coarse calibration of the machine. It is now time to connect the y tray with the z axis. Turn simultaneously by hand the two motors of the z axis in order to port the nozzle at least 3 cm above the y tray.
Turn simultaneously by hand the two motors of the z axis in order to port the nozzle at least 3 cm above the y tray.
Start moving the tray back and forth by hand in order to make sure that the a distance (a) indicaded at the picture below is always the same.
Now gently move the tray fully towards to you and make sure that the tray glass barely "covers" the nozzle by eye (c).
If this not happens move the hole tray towards or backwards to you until the edge of the glass just covers the nozzle.
Once you are sure about the y axis you can screw it with the frame using 16 wood screws like the picture below.
The latest version of arduino for Prusa I3 is not needed since the project is based on Arduino MEGA 2560 board.
We have a pre-configured version of Marlin for our direct I3 Prusa 3D printer that can be downloaded from here.
I have not tested any other marlin versions other than the one preconfigured offered from this page.
Unzip the "Marlin-Marlin_v1.zip" firmware and keep the zip files since you are going to minor changes into the unzipped files.
The X/Y/Z steps should be spot on with the formulas. Very little variations should have with these three numbers.
On the other hand the Esteps is a rough estimation. It is better to start from 650 step/mm for the esteps So in your "Configuration.h" file a good starting point for the axis steps for this machine is :
The formula below helps you to select layer height in a way, that Z axis moves only by full step increments :
As we can see a layer height of 0.26mm is obdainable like is the 0.24mm but a 0.25mm value is not a valid layer height for our machine.
Also keep in mind with our nozzle (0.4 diameter) we can not print layer heights more than 0.30 mm safely.
Plug your USB cable with the RAMPS board. I suggest to leave this cable permanently in the RAMPS port since it is relatively difficult to access it.
Once plugged the printer into the PC in Windows 7 for the first time either a "Found New Hardware Wizard" Dialogue window will appear, or a dialogue baloon box "not successfully installed", either way just close the respective window.
After a short while (it could be up to a few minutes depending on your computer speed) the success message should appear, then select "Close".
If Arduino Mega is not listed at Device manager even if you have installed the drivers take a look at the official documentation of arduino here
#define DEFAULT_ACCELERATION 3000 sets the acceleration for normal axis moves during a print. Do not change
Jerk is the rate of change of acceleration or in other words is the derivative of acceleration with respect to time
If you have problems finding this old version you can download it from here (yandex disk). Download and install Repetier-Host at your PC.
If for any reason do not like repetier host or you just have problems you can try pronterface instead.
In this tutorial we will use repetier host in order to pilot our printer but you can use pronterface similarly.
Press the "Connect" button. Once successfully connected the "Connect" button should become "Disconnect"
You should have no errors by doing this. If you get problems make sure that you have oiled the M5 threaded rods and that the X axis if perfectly horizontal.
If you hear strange noises as last bet try lowering the acceleration of the z axis from 4 to 3.4 for example.
If everything is ok move another time up the z axis for 10mm this time and while the machine moves up the z axis press by hand the z-axis endstop switch. The z axis should stop.
Do the same procedure with X and Y axis. Move at most 1mm the machine when you first try. Test all three endstops by hand.
Before homing the Z axis make sure that the endstop work and it is placed at least 5cm above the glass of the tray.
Now home carefully the Z axis the nozzle should be away at least 2 cm from the glass. This is ok for now.
Loose almost fully all four screws of your headbed in order to find the fully decompressed max level.
Now start screwing all four of the screws and move down at max 5mm the bed. Do not overtight the screws.
Now move down the nozzle by moving the z endstop gradually and by using the Z-Home button from Repetier-Host. You have to place the nozzle between the fully decompressed / fully compressed levels.
Once the nozzle is between this zone secure tightly the Z-endstop. You have successfuly and permanetly fixed the Z-endstop.
Once the nozzle is between the fully decompressed / fully compressed levels now you can unscrew slightly all 4 screws in order to decrease the noozle / glass gap to 2 mm.
Once you are happy with the front regions go from the point 12 to the point 13 moving the y axis again at most 10mm at a time.
Do all the path (12,13,...23). Once you are happy with the gap at the points (12..23) go to the FL region again.
The common mistake is to calibrate the heatbed doing rectagulars (all vertices) and not triangulars.
At this point you have set up all the endstops correctly and you should have leveled the heatbed successfully.
If you are way off the 100mm take a look at the X-axis and tighten or loose the X screw of the tension belt shown in the picture below.
At this point i have to stress the fact that in all of my machines that i have made the X/Y/Z steps are 95% the times spot on.
So before changing the firmware steps specially if the numbers are way off take a look at your machine.
For example make sure that RAMPS uses 1/16 microstep mode (all three jumpers are used under each driver)
Now measure the distance. If you are way off the 100mm take a look at the y-axis and tighten or loose the y screw of the tension belt shown in the picture below.
The PID method produces more accurate results (the temperature oscilate a lot less) but needs more CPU.
We are going to use the bang bang mode for the heatbed thermistor and the PID mode for the extruder.
As you can see from the "Configuration.h" file the PIDTEMPBED is commented (has // at the beggining) meaning that we are using bang bang mode for the bed and not PID
The resistor of the extruder is rated Pextruder=40W (Infact i measured the resistor end was 3.6 Ohm . V=I*R=>I=3.33A Pextruder=12*3.33=40W)
In real life using my Prusa at max i got a Ptotal=210W this is due to the fact that Pextruder is limited by the PID.
This change is already done by default by me at the given firmware in order to protect your power supply.
Using my wattmeter my Prusa I3 with MAX_BED_POWER 200 consumes max 175Watts. (Normally 50W when it does not heat the bed which is the 85% of the time)
For gluing down ABS i have heard about a solution of acetone with ABS but as i said i have not tested anything about this.
Now run Repetier-Host and press the connect button. For security reasons bring the nozzle to a distance of 10cm from the heatbed.
Again make sure you move the nozzle to a distance of 10cm from the heatbed (z axis). As we said in this case we are going to use the PID mcontrol method.
Let's tune more these values. We are going to set a target temperature of 200ºC which is a really good starting point for printing PLA. So hit the "Toggle Log" button from the top of Repetier-Host and then hit the "Manual" tab.
Now wait for 3/4 minutes . Repetier host from the Log file will give you the Kp, Ki and Kd values that you need to insert into your firmware.
Temperature line should be stable, if not, you have to redo the PID test or make sure which thermistor do you use in reality and in the firmware.
If you hear noise (clogging) then try lowering the speed but again most of the times is a hardware problem.
Once your extruder is extruding correctly measure with your digital caliper 100.00 mm of filament from the top of the extruder port like the photo below. With a pen mark the 100.00mm distance.
As you can see 650 is really a small number for Greg's Wade extruder but is always better to start under-extruding and slowly increase the e-steps.
It is way better to under-extrude than over-extrude since you are risking breaking the small 9-teeth pulley of your extruder.
I have a Da Vinci 2.0 with two extruders and I needed to set one to 97.09 and the other to 99.0. Here are the calibration instructions I used.
#1 use a ruler to measure 15 cm from the top of the extruder tool head and use a marker to mark your filament. It doesn't matter if your ruler has a few millimeters of blank space before the actual measurement marks start.
#3 Use your mark on the filament to measure the actual distance the filament moved. You want to measure the difference away from the 15 cm mark. So if your mark is at the 6 cm line then the filament moved 9 cm. 15-6=9.
#4 If your mark is exactly on the 5 cm line then you are done and correctly calibrated. If not go to step 5.

What a fantastic trip! My little guy keeps asking to go to Paris ALL THE TIME, I don't know where the burning desire comes from but if ever the opportunity arises I'm there!
Oh those Museum Mondays are so frustrating!!! When I visit a place, I'm usually flying in on the weekend and raring to go on a Monday. I hope you made it to the Museum of Fashion at some point?
I loved Antwerp and all of Belgium, so beautiful! Really enjoying your travel pics, keep them coming!(And so jealous you had a view of the Tate Modern in London!!)
Oh, I'm so thrilled that you came to Antwerp! I love 'my' city and I'm always so proud when people feature it on their blogs :-)
so sorry that you had to miss the good stuff... i warned you a while ago and suggested to contact the boys from solarshop....
I have a funny sense of irony. Today is a beautiful, sunny, day. Springtime is here, despite the freezing weather of yesterday, and there are cherry blossoms blooming on practically every corner. And yet, my song of the day has the word "rain" in it. But when it comes to love, you're entitled to include some ideas on the far end of either spectrum. I believe in the kind of love described simply, but beautifully, in this song, "I'm gonna love you, baby come rain or shine." Dig it. ;)
I am a singer/songwriter and music lover. I believe that we live in great times in which music can be a DIY project. I love finding new ways to get involved in music since all aspects of it interest me. I hope to become an artist, own my own record label and recording studio, write a few novels and become an expressive arts therapist. All before I die. ;)

Gloria Jean Johnson, Relator, vs. Commissioner of Health, Respondent. A04-481, Court of Appeals Unpublished, November 23, 2004.
On appeal from an order disqualifying relator from providing direct-contact services because of her guilty plea to second-degree assault, relator argues that (1) the Minnesota Department of Health (DH) failed to follow the mandate of this court on a previous appeal, and in doing so the DH’s reasons and conclusions (a) were unsupported by substantial evidence, and (b) were arbitrary and capricious; (2) the DH’s decision was made upon unlawful procedure because (a) relator was not given an opportunity to participate in the decision-making process on remand, (b) the DH relied on inadmissible hearsay, and (c) the DH failed to notify relator that it had taken notice of facts outside the record. Because the DH considered all eight statutory factors and gave reasons in support of its conclusion, and because the conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, are not arbitrary and capricious, and were made employing lawful procedure under the statute, we affirm.
On June 19, 2002, relator Gloria Jean Johnson pleaded guilty to second-degree assault for stabbing her son in the leg. At the time of the conviction, relator was employed as a direct-contact service provider with three health-care organizations. Because of her conviction, however, she was disqualified from providing direct-contact services. Minn. Stat. § 245C.14, subd. 1(a)(1) (Supp. 2003).
Relator requested reconsideration of her disqualification, arguing that she did not pose a risk of harm to the patients she served.[1] The Minnesota Department of Health (DH) found that relator’s disqualification could not be set aside, and relator appealed that decision to this court. Johnson v. Comm’r of Health, 671 N.W.2d 921(Minn. App. 2003) (Johnson I). This court held that the DH applied only three of the eight required factors under Minn. Stat. § 245A.04, subd. 3b(b) (2002), and remanded the decision to the DH. Id. at 924.
On remand, the DH concluded that, based on the eight factors under Minn. Stat. § 245C.22, subd. 4 (Supp. 2003)[2], relator poses a risk of harm to clients of the three health-care organizations with which she was employed. Relator petitioned this court on a writ of certiorari on March 23, 2004.
The Minnesota Department of Human Services (DH) may permanently disqualify an individual from working as a direct-contact service provider if a background study reveals that the individual had a conviction of second-degree assault. Minn. Stat. § 245C.15, subd. 1 (Supp. 2003). The individual may then request reconsideration of the disqualification. Minn. Stat. § 245C.21 (Supp. 2003).
This court may reverse an administrative decision if it is unsupported by substantial evidence or is arbitrary and capricious. In re Excess Surplus Status of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Minn., 624 N.W.2d 264, 277 (Minn. 2001). In considering factual determinations, this court determines whether substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the commissioner’s findings. Reserve Mining Co. v. Herbst, 256 N.W.2d 808, 826 (Minn. 1977). Substantial evidence is “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.” Id. at 825.
Relator first argues that the DH failed to follow the mandate of this court. She contends that, under the first appeal, Johnson v. Comm’r of Health, 671 N.W.2d 921 (Minn. App. 2003) (Johnson I), this court mandated that the DH set aside relator’s disqualification. In Johnson I, however, this court reversed and remanded for written findings and reasons in compliance with the applicable statute. Id. at 924 (“[a]bsent written findings and reasons, and provided only with a conclusory explanation of the application of three of the eight factors, we cannot sustain the refusal to reconsider [relator’s] disqualification.”).
Next, relator argues that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence and do not support the DH’s decision not to set aside her disqualification. The applicable statute states:
The commissioner may set aside the disqualification if the commissioner finds that the individual does not pose a risk of harm to any person served by the applicant, license holder, or registrant.
(7) documentation of successful completion by the individual studied of training or rehabilitation pertinent to the event; and
Regarding the nature of the second-degree assault, which resulted in relator’s disqualification, the DH found that relator’s “actions not only caused a serious injury to [her] son but also demonstrated a lack of judgment and control during a difficult and volatile situation.” The record shows that during an argument relator tried to hit and choke her teenage son, who grabbed her hands and pushed her away. Relator then went to the dishwasher and grabbed a steak knife while her son ran into a bedroom to call 911. Relator picked up a telephone in the kitchen and spoke to the 911 operator. When her son came into the kitchen to take the telephone away, relator stabbed his leg with the steak knife.
As a consequence of this incident, the record shows that relator’s son was treated at a hospital for his injuries. Relator pleaded guilty to second-degree assault and was sentenced to four years’ probation, with the conditions that she complete a treatment plan, an anger-management program, and a psychological evaluation.
Here, substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the DH’s findings under this factor and weighs in favor of affirming the DH’s decision not to set aside relator’s disqualification.
The record supports the DH’s findings that there was only one disqualifying event. This factor does not weigh in favor of affirming the DH’s decision not to set aside relator’s disqualification.
Under this factor, the DH found that relator’s son was 15 years old at the time of the incident, was much taller and larger than relator, and was not the aggressor during the incident. The record supports these findings, but it is not clear if the DH found that relator’s son was vulnerable because he was not the aggressor. The record shows that relator and her son got into a heated argument and relator tried to hurt her son. But the record also shows that relator’s son was able to grab relator’s hands, push her down, and run away. Thus, the record is insufficient to show that relator’s son was vulnerable at the time of the event, and this factor does not weigh in favor of affirming the DH.
In previous cases in which this court has reviewed the applicable statutory factors for reconsideration of disqualification, the DH was affirmed where there was no actual harm to a victim, but the individual was disqualified because of felony drug charges. See, e.g., Dozier v. Comm’r of Human Servs., 547 N.W.2d 393, 395-96 (Minn. App. 1996) (holding disqualification of applicant was not arbitrary, capricious, or without substantial basis in fact, where applicant had pleaded guilty to fifth-degree possession of crack cocaine), review denied (Minn. July 10, 1996)
Here, the record supports the DH’s finding that relator’s son received medical treatment at a hospital for the wound on his leg and was released. Based on the prior decisions of this court where various levels of harm and potential for harm were considered in affirming the disqualification, this factor weighs in favor of affirming the disqualification.
The victim was a minor, 15-year-old child, in your custody. The programs where you wish to work . . . all serve vulnerable populations. . . . . The patients and residents in these facilities tend to include society’s most vulnerable citizens, such as sick and disabled children and senior citizens. Based on many years of . . . experience with investigating reports of maltreatment . . . [the DH] is aware that these patients and residents, particularly those with cognitive impairments such as Alzheimer’s disease, have at least as much, if not more, potential as teenagers to behave in an uncooperative and difficult manner.
Relator argues that the DH based its finding under this factor on information outside the record. When reviewing agency decisions, this court adheres to the fundamental concept that decisions of administrative agencies enjoy a presumption of correctness and defers to the agencies’ expertise and special knowledge in the field of their technical training, education, and experience. In re Universal Underwriters Life Ins. Co., 685 N.W.2d 44, 45-46 (Minn. App. 2004).
The agency decision-maker is presumed to have the expertise necessary to decide technical matters within the scope of the agency’s authority . . . , and judicial deference, rooted in the separation of powers doctrine, is extended to an agency decision-maker in the interpretation of statutes that the agency is charged with administering and enforcing.
Here, the DH based its decision on its particular expertise in the area of disqualification from providing direct-contact services. Thus, this factor weighs in favor of affirming the DH.
The record supports the DH’s finding that 22 months had elapsed since the assault and that there has not been another incident. The DH stated that, given the seriousness of the event, 22 months was not a significant lapse of time. Neither the statute nor caselaw in this area offers a guide as to an acceptable lapse of time. Thus, we defer to the DH’s expertise on this factor.
The DH found that, although there was documentation of completion of the conditions of relator’s probation, a letter from East Side Neighborhood Services indicates that relator was uncooperative for the first 16 weeks of the program and “[o]nly during the last two weeks of the session did [relator] appear to make any progress toward the goals of the program.” It is unfair to penalize an individual for behaving, for some time after beginning a rehabilitative program, in a manner consistent with the actions that resulted in the need for rehabilitation, especially if the individual begins to modify that behavior and completes the program. Thus, because the record contains sufficient documentation of successful completion of rehabilitation, this factor does not weigh in favor of affirming the DH.
Relator argues that, in making its finding under this factor, the DH improperly relied on a complaint from which no conviction resulted. “All evidence, except that privileged by law, commonly accepted by reasonable people in the conduct of their affairs as having probative value with respect to the issues shall be submitted at the hearing.” Minn. Stat. § 256.045, subd. 4(b) (2002). The evidence here is a February 2001 police report describing a domestic incident with relator and her daughter and indicating other incidents involving child-protection services. The DH found this information “relevant to reconsideration because it indicates that the incident with [relator] and her son is not an isolated incident of violence . . . .” It seems that a reasonable person in conducting his or her affairs would find this evidence probative when considering whether an individual should remain disqualified from providing direct-care services. This factor weighs in favor of affirming the DH.
A majority of the statutory factors supports affirming the DH. The DH considered all factors and gave reasons in support of its conclusions. These reasons and conclusions are supported by substantial evidence and are not arbitrary and capricious.
Relator next argues that the DH’s decision was made on unlawful procedure because the DH failed to provide a forum, relied on inadmissible hearsay, and did not provide adequate notice to relator. Regarding the forum, the applicable statute states, “[i]f the individual was disqualified based on a conviction or admission to any crimes . . . the reconsideration decision under this subdivision is the final agency determination for purposes of appeal by the disqualified individual and is not subject to a hearing . . . .” Minn. Stat. § 245C.27, subd. 1(c) (Supp. 2003). The record shows that following a hearing, the DH determined that, based on her conviction of second-degree assault, relator was permanently disqualified from providing direct-contact services. Relator appealed to the DH for reconsideration of the disqualification, then appealed that decision to this court. This court remanded for findings consistent with the statute. In accordance with Minn. Stat. § 245C.27, subd. 1(c), relator was not entitled to a new hearing. Thus, on remand the DH properly considered the record from the initial hearing and this court’s decision in Johnson I.
Relator argues that the DH relied on inadmissible hearsay in making its findings on remand from this court. Relator states specifically that the hearsay is found in the police interview with relator’s daughter regarding the stabbing incident with relator’s son. In the absence of statutory authority to do so, an administrative agency cannot, over objection, rest its findings of fact solely on hearsay evidence that is inadmissible in a judicial proceeding. State ex rel. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 276 v. Dep’t of Ed., 256 N.W.2d 619, 627 (Minn. 1977) (quotation omitted). Here, there is statutory authority that states, “[a]ll evidence, except that privileged by law, commonly accepted by reasonable people in the conduct of their affairs as having probative value with respect to the issues shall be submitted at the hearing.” Minn. Stat. § 256.045, subd. 4(b) (2002). Thus, the DH correctly relied on the relevant information in the record.
Relator also argues that the DH was required to give notice under Minn. Stat. § 14.60, subd. 4 (2002). Section 14.60 applies to evidence in contested-case proceedings. Under Minn. Stat. § 245C.28 (Supp. 2003), a public employee may request a contested-case hearing for reconsideration of disqualification. Here, relator is not a public employee, and her hearing was conducted under the fair-hearing section, Minn. Stat. § 245C.27 (Supp. 2003). This was not a contested-case proceeding, and section 14.60 does not apply. Thus, the DH’s decision was made on lawful procedure.
[1] An individual requesting reconsideration of a disqualification “must submit information showing that: (1) the information the commissioner relied upon in determining that the underlying conduct that gave rise to the disqualification is incorrect; (2) for maltreatment, the information the commissioner relied upon in determining that maltreatment was serious or recurring is incorrect; or (3) the subject of the study does not pose a risk of harm to any person . . . .” Minn. Stat. § 245C.21, subd. 3 (Supp. 2003).
[2] At the time of the DH’s previous decision, the statutory factors were listed in Minn. Stat. § 245A.04, subd. 3b (2002). In 2003, the Minnesota Legislature recodified the provisions at Minn. Stat. § 245C.21 and § 245C.22, subd. 4 (Supp. 2003). 2003 Minn. Laws ch. 15, art. 1, §§ 21, 22; 2003 Minn. Laws 1st Spec. Sess. Ch. 14, art. 6, § 6. There is no substantive difference between the original and the recodified statute.
Joellyn J. Rock-Sivak (n/k/a Rock), petitioner, Respondent, vs. Joseph James Sivak, Appellant. A04-1674, Court of Appeals Unpublished, June 7, 2005.
In this appeal from the denial of a motion to modify child-support and parenting-time provisions in a marital-dissolution judgment, Joseph Sivak challenges the district court’s failure to make findings on his current income and to address his motion on modification of parenting time. The order establishes that the district court addressed the parenting-time modification and directed Sivak’s attorney to submit a proposed order. The order does not, however, contain findings on Sivak’s income, and we reverse and remand for additional findings on the motion to modify child support.
Joseph Sivak and Joellyn Rock were married from 1994 to 1998 and are the parents of a child born in 1995. In their dissolution proceedings, Sivak and Rock agreed to joint legal and physical custody. Consistent with their agreement, they worked out a comprehensive parenting schedule that was incorporated into their 1998 marital-dissolution judgment. Under the terms of the stipulated judgment, Sivak agreed “to pay child support according to the [s]tate guidelines” irrespective of the amount of parenting time with their child. The dissolution judgment provided that Sivak, a psychiatrist with a biweekly net income of $1,950, would pay Rock child support of $1,408 each month.
Sivak changed employers twice after the marital dissolution, and his income remained essentially the same. But in June 2003, Sivak opened his own office for the private practice of psychiatry. In his affidavit in support of his motion to reduce child support and amend the parenting schedule, Sivak provided a detailed account of his earnings and expenses for April 2003 through November 2003. Sivak noted that the first three months were not representative of his monthly net income as he incurred significant, one-time, start-up expenses during that time. According to Sivak’s calculation of income from September to November 2003, his average net monthly income amounted to $1,604.37. Sivak also alleged that Rock’s net income had increased since the dissolution judgment.
Based on the financial information and calculations in his affidavit, Sivak moved to modify his child-support obligation. Sivak also moved to amend the parenting-time schedule to adopt the “present parenting-time agreement.”
The district court conducted a hearing and issued an order denying the motion to reduce child support because the court “has not been supplied with accurate evidence of [Sivak’s] actual earning power upon which the [c]ourt can make a determination of whether there has been a substantial change of circumstances making the terms of the [judgment] unreasonable and unfair.” The order stated that Rock and Sivak had agreed on the parenting-time schedule, which the court would adopt by separate order after Sivak’s attorney submitted a written copy to Rock for her approval and forwarded the proposed order to the court.
Sivak appeals from the district court’s order, arguing that the district court erred by failing to (1) make specific findings on Sivak’s income and (2) rule on the motion to modify parenting time.
A parent seeking modification of a child-support order carries the burden of showing a substantial change of circumstances that makes the existing child-support order unreasonable and unfair. Minn. Stat. § 518.64, subd. 2 (2004). Because the district court’s discretion must be exercised within the limits set by the legislature, the findings must be sufficiently specific to show that the district court considered all relevant factors. Moylan v. Moylan, 384 N.W.2d 859, 864-65 (Minn. 1986). Particularized findings on child-support issues provide the parties and their children the benefits of a careful, complete analysis of support obligations and permit reasoned appellate review. Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, 311 Minn. 76, 82, 249 N.W.2d 168, 171 (1976); Borman v. Borman, 644 N.W.2d 478, 482 (Minn. App. 2002).
The district court did not make specific findings on Sivak’s income or determine whether it had decreased. Instead the court concluded that it had “not been supplied with accurate evidence of [Sivak’s] actual earning power upon which the [c]ourt can make a determination.” We are unsure what evidence the district court believes has not been supplied. Sivak’s affidavit in support of his modification motion provides a lengthy accounting of the expenses of his private practice from its inception. He computed his monthly income of $1,604.37 based on a three-month average and stated that he expected his practice to grow. The district court found that Sivak had been earning approximately $6,000 each month from the time of dissolution until the time Sivak opened his private practice.
Sivak argues that the district court’s reference to the absence of accurate evidence on his “earning” power suggests that the court is using an incorrect standard and not applying Minn. Stat. § 518.551, subd. 5b(f) (2004), which provides that “[i]ncome from self employment is equal to gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses.” Sivak contends that the court’s invocation of the concept of earning power suggests, without evidentiary support, that Sivak has unjustifiably self-limited his income or that the information is insufficient to determine his actual income. See Minn. Stat. § 518.551, subd. 5b(d), (e) (2004) (requiring district court to impute income if court determines parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed or if information is insufficient to determine actual income).
Without further findings that justify the district court’s approach, we agree that earning power is not the standard by which a change of circumstances is determined; rather it is the “substantially increased or decreased earnings of a party.” Minn. Stat. § 518.64, subd. 2(a)(1). Even assuming the district court may have meant “earnings” when it used the term “earning power,” it stated further that it “has not been supplied with accurate evidence” of Sivak’s earnings. But the lengthy assessment of Sivak’s present receipts and expenses from his private practice provide extensive evidence, and we find no indication in the record that those figures do not represent Sivak’s current earnings.
Because the district court’s findings are insufficient to determine whether the relevant statutory factors have been addressed, we reverse and remand for express findings on earnings in light of the legislative standard and whether the findings demonstrate a change in circumstances that makes the current child-support obligation unreasonable and unfair.
In considering a motion to modify parenting time, the district court shall order modification if a change in parenting time “would serve the best interests of the child.” Minn. Stat. § 518.175, subd. 5 (2004). We review the district court’s decision on parenting-time issues under an abuse-of-discretion standard. Olson v. Olson, 534 N.W.2d 547, 550 (Minn. 1995).
Sivak’s motion requested an order “adopting the parties’ present parenting-time agreement.” The district court, in its order following the hearing on the motion, stated that “[t]he parties agreed regarding the parenting time schedule and counsel [for Sivak] agreed to submit a separate order to [Rock] and then to the [c]ourt adopting the parenting time schedule.” Sivak maintains in his brief that he seeks a “slight modification” to conform to what the parents are “actually doing” and that the “parties felt it was important enough that their agreement be included in the [dissolution judgment].”
Sivak has not provided a transcript of the evidentiary hearing, nor does the district court file or Sivak’s brief include any indication that Sivak and Rock disagree on the parenting-time modification. On the record before us, we cannot agree with Sivak that the district court failed to “address” the parenting-time motion. The record indicates that Sivak’s attorney has the responsibility to submit the proposed order, including the parenting-time modification on which Rock and Sivak agree. On this record we conclude that the district court has not abused its discretion by failing to address the modification of parenting time.
Last time, I get to know Master Tham through the recommendation of a friend. Before meeting Master Tham, the yield from my fruit trees in my plantation was very low. Everything seemed to be against my luck and life was very hard. After Feng Shui was done to my house and my plantation, the yield was high and I gained a lot of income. I found workers that are very faithful to me and I felt very thankful for that. Other than that, my children get good results in their examinations and are more filial. My family and I are living very happily and we have a really good bond with each other. I couldn’t have thank Master Tham enough. A testimonial presented to him can’t even explain how grateful I am!!!

The Garrison Center is not a 501(c)(x) institution. It neither seeks nor accepts institutional financial support and such support for its authors and administrators is not tax deductible. Center administrators and authors may benefit from site monetization, such as ad placements, "tip jars," etc.
I'm planning to run quarterly fundraisers, but see the above: If you donate, you are donating to me. There is no "Garrison Center" in any organizational sense of the word. And yes, I'll use any money you donate for whatever I want to use it for. But, here are a few of the things that I will use it for before I go out and have fancy coffee on your dime, or buy myself frilly new underwear or whatever:
So far I've written all except two of the op-eds at the Garrison Center (one op-ed written by another author has been published, the other one is coming soon). I plan to write most of the op-eds there. But I also plan to pay other authors $25 a pop for their 400-500 op-eds (including for the two already accepted/published).
If the fundraiser makes its goal, I'll put some money back into the site. I'll pay for another year or three of domain name registration. Maybe I'll hit Fiverr and get some nice graphics done up, or join a paid site to get better photos to attach to the op-eds themselves. If the site becomes popular enough to strain the resources of my current hosting account, I may move it to its own server. That kind of thing.
That's $2,000 a year for the production of op-eds that are already, in our first month, getting picked up by "mainstream and non-libertarian political media" at a rate of more than 20 per month.
If that rate holds -- and I expect it to go up, not down! -- it comes to a cost of $8 and change to put an op-ed in front of a non-libertarian audience. That sounds like pretty cost-effective outreach to me.
So, here's the button, and I'll stick a "fundraising thermometer" in the sidebar shortly (if you want to donate using Bitcoin, etc., use the sidebar widgets and just let me know using the contact form that it was for my Garrison Center work). Thanks in advance for your support!
UPDATE: The fundraiser made its goal and then some ... so I've shut down the button. Of course, ONGOING support is welcome, appreciated, and reduces the need for holding periodic fundraisers. So if you're so inclined, see the top of the sidebar for Patreon, PayPal and cryptocurrency options!
Just because I'm bored and feel like stirring some sh*t. Quoth my favorite undercover gender studies postgrad ...
Instead of checking facts or refuting statements, Buzzfeed and MSNBC decided to brand Ron Paul a racist ...
Here's a link to the Buzzfeed article. Allegations of, or even references to, racism in the article: 0.
Here's a link to the MSNBC article. Allegations of, or even references to, racism in the article: One kinda, sorta, a little bit, if you hold your sheet and hood just right ("the notion that Congressional Black Caucus members were only skeptical of wars because of food stamps is racially charged").
Maybe I paid just a little too much attention in my elementary school English classes, but my understanding of the word "brand" is that it's a pretty strong term. In order to "brand [someone] a racist," I'd need to do go a little bit beyond laying out some facts that tend to lead you to my desired conclusion. If I wanted to "brand" you a racist, I think I'd at least make the effort to say something like "[your name] is a racist," or "wow, what [your name] did/said is really racist."
Yeah, yeah ... I know, they want you to think to yourself that Ron Paul is a racist, but they also want to be able to deny they called him one. They've been up to that game for decades.
Just like Ron Paul wants you to think to yourself that black people only oppose war if there's food stamps in it for them, but also wants to be able to deny saying it. He's been up to that game for decades too.
Politics! Literature! Music! Fashion! Culture! Henways! You ask it in the comments below this post, I'll answer it in comments, on this week's podcast, or in both venues. You might even ask what the hell this is:
Would it be possible for an ISP to deny all traffic -- HTTP requests, SMTP/IMAP email to or from, etc. -- with respect to a particular top-level domain?
Because if it is, and if I ran an ISP or other service which routes/relays Internet traffic, I'd strongly consider turning off all access to anything coming from or going to ".gov" domains tomorrow when the Federal Communications Commission tries to seize control of the Internet.
And I'd probably throw in the specific domain names of all the organizations agitating for the coup d'net as well.

Among others, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight For The Future, groups that have done damn good work in the past on everything from crypto freedom to "intellectual property" to SOPA, have gone whole hog to the dark side, supporting a massive bureaucratic power grab in the name of "saving" the Internet from ... well, from something, but nobody's quite sure what.
There's no nice way to put this: Letting the Federal Communications Commission regulate the Internet in any way, shape, manner or form is a disaster for every form of freedom. It's like giving Charles Manson the key to your girlfriend's house. Or maybe just pouring gasoline all over the house and setting fire to it with her tied to a chair inside.
... and starts whacking itself right in the testicles. Best to get an early start, I guess, but at this rate they're gonna need a lot of ice packs.
They've picked "conservative" radio talking head Hugh Hewitt to host the first Republican presidential primary debate.
If you've never heard of Hugh Hewitt, that's because he's too simultaneously boring, politically inastute and thoroughly partisan to get much play in the mainstream media. Or hell, even on Fox.
In 2004, he mused that John Kerry's skin tone (it got a bit orange-ish) might become a deciding factor in the presidential election. In 2008, he took bets on when John McCain's campaign would close up shop and get out of the real contenders' way (he backed Romney -- we all know how THAT turned out in both '08 and '12).
As a debate moderator, he's nearly certain to ensure that voters come away with the following impression of the Republican field:
Twenty months out and already Reince Priebus seems to be going all-out to throw his party's third sequential presidential election. This could get fun. Or interesting, anyway.
I knew someone would ask sooner or later, but I thought it would be later. Someone (just one person) noticed that each posted op-ed at The Garrison Center now comes topped with a big photo and wondered why.
The explanation is simple: I want the Garrison Center's material to qualify for syndication via Flipboard, and one of the requirements for that is "at least one image per article, no less than 400px in width." There are other requirements that will take time to meet. A minimum of 30 articles, for example -- I'm not going to speed up op-ed production, I'm just going to make sure that as the new stuff churns out it's optimized so that when we hit 30 we're go for launch.
I'd never really paid attention to Flipboard before. It started off as an iPad app and then (I think) made the jump to Android. Now it's available on the regular old web as well. I read an article the other day (I tried to find it again to link here but couldn't) about how much additional traffic Flipboard syndication drives to sites, especially from tablet and phone users. The answer is: A lot. And I want The Garrison Center's stuff to show up in that market. So ... pictures.
The fly in the ointment is that Garrison's op-eds are published under a public domain dedication, and finding public domain pictures for every article would likely be a real pain. So I added a disclaimer about photos to the public domain notice and started looking for relevant and/or attractive graphics at rgbstock, my favorite free stock photo site. I'll use other sources as well.

The Islamic State is clearly Islamic. It bases its claims to religious authority on Muslim doctrines drawn from the Quran and from particular hadiths (Islamic prophetic traditions). Disputes concerning the validity of its interpretations are sectarian, of a piece with arguments between Christian denominations over the appropriate method of baptism and so forth.
The Islamic State is also clearly a state. From among many definitions of the word, Hans-Hermann Hoppe's should suffice here: "[A] compulsory territorial monopolist of protection and jurisdiction equipped with the power to tax without unanimous consent." The Islamic State stakes that monopolistic claim over large portions of Iraq and Syria. The people living there are taxed to support it and forced, violently as necessary, to accept its laws and its authority.
"Hardline House GOP conservatives aren't worried about a looming Department of Homeland Security shutdown," reports Cristina Marcos at The Hill. They'd rather let DHS's funding lapse than give up a provision in its new appropriation reversing president Barack Obama's recent executive orders on immigration.
Is it just me, or does this sound more like the promise of ice cream and fireworks than the threat of a spanking? I usually can't think of anything good to say about Congress, let alone its big-spending, war-mongering, Taliban-on-the-Potomac "conservative Republican" contingent, but this is one of those rare exceptions.
Before the ink had time to dry on his February 12 executive order "promoting private sector cybersecurity information sharing," US president Barack Obama launched a campaign to re-write history and make the case for trusting government to bolster network security and data privacy.
"The Snowden disclosures," Obama told Re / code’s Kara Swisher in an interview the next day, "were really harmful in terms of the trust between the government and many of these companies."
Well, no. It was the government -- Obama's administration and its predecessors -- which betrayed the trust of American enterprise, the American people and the world. Edward Snowden is mere heroic messenger, telling us what we should have already known: That any such trust was misplaced.
Article II, Section 2 of the US Constitution is clear and unequivocal: "The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."
Per the 1913 edition of Webster's, to reprieve is "[t]o delay the punishment of; to suspend the execution of sentence on ..."
Obama would be well within his constitutional powers to outright pardon every "illegal alien" residing in the United States. But he stopped well short of that, merely allowing a subset of immigrants to request postponement -- reprieve -- of deportation under specific conditions. The states' suit is without merit and deserves immediate dismissal.
Prior to 1884, printed ballots were provided to voters by political parties and candidates. Those voters were also free to write out their own ballots by hand if they didn't vote "straight party ticket." Between 1884 and 1991, the states adopted the "Australian ballot" -- a uniform ballot printed at government expense.
Standardized, one-size-fits all ballots, of course, have to come with rules. And guess who gets to make those rules? The two ruling parties, of course. Over time they have sewn up their "duopoly" with increasingly draconian restrictions.
But I occasionally find myself thinking that if a particularly vicious criminal or criminals -- for example, publicly admitted kidnapping/extortion kingpins Leslie R. Caldwell, Dana J. Boente and Andrew G. McCabe -- turned up dead at the hands of someone acting on behalf of their victims or just in defense of the public safety against the clear and present danger represented by their ongoing actions, I'd be hard pressed to work up a good cry over it, and would almost certainly make a small contribution to the legal defense fund of the hero or heroine should he or she be apprehended by the culprits' co-conspirators.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling on pro-Russian rebels to allow besieged Ukrainian troops safe passage out of the encircled town of Debaltseve in eastern Ukraine.
Speaking Tuesday in the Hungarian capital, Putin also urged the Kyiv government to allow its troops to surrender.
There's just no way to honestly get from that headline to that story, even setting aside the question of whether Debaltseve is in the Donetsk People's Republic or "eastern Ukraine."
No, I'm not "pro-Putin." If I saw him on fire in my front yard I wouldn't come outside to piss on him. But VOA's headline writers are just making shit up and broadcasting it at taxpayer expense. So much for their charter ("VOA news will be accurate, objective and comprehensive").
... because I had a message from you pointing out a missing link at Rational Review News Digest, and every time I try to reply (three times, with different content), I get an automatic message as follows:
Google tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain rtconnect.net by barracuda.vision.net. [70.33.56.49].
So I suggest you have a conversation with your ISP, since you and I both know there was nothing even a little bit like spam involved. I figure you'll notice this blog post, and hopefully soon, since I'm apparently banned from emailing you.
Second, THANK YOU. I've been wondering for a long time if I'm going crazy. I know that every once in awhile, I or another editor will forget to put the URL into an entry, but sometimes I swear that I did put one in and that it disappeared later.
You just PROVED it. The story from which the link is missing HAD the link earlier, and I can prove that to myself because the link is there in the email version. That means that for some reason, Wordpress is occasionally just somehow losing the custom fields from entries, after they've been put in correctly.
Time for the weekly "ask me anything" thread for the upcoming episode of The KN@PP Stir Podcast. Brought to you, as always, by Darryl W. Perry:
So, this thing is about what you want to know. But it's also about having a good, fun show. See if you can come up with something that I can make into a 10-minute diatribe. Ask in comments. I'll answer in comments, on the podcast, or both.
No, I wasn't there. But Mackenzie Holst was. Due to a slight comedy of errors, when she read an "open letter to Ron Paul" crafted by herself, Cory Massimino and Aaron Shelby Baca, that letter was apparently attributed (as reported by, and later corrected by, Dave Weigel at Bloomberg) to the Center for a Stateless Society, where I work and where Cory is a Fellow.
By "comedy of errors," I mean this: Cory posted the letter to C4SS's work group with a proposal that we publish it, but when it comes to such things we have an internal process that sometimes becomes an eternal process. I'm not complaining about that, by the way. I think it's good for organizations like C4SS to talk out anything that there's significant disagreement on. Without naming names other than my own, some people supported publishing the letter, some opposed it, and my opinion was, well, "meh." Not because I had any great problem with its content, but because it was (and is) my opinion that as Ron Paul fades into obscurity, it's kind of silly to give his cultists new rallying points to keep their obsession alive.
So anyway, we were still discussing the matter when the letter was read at ISFLC; while Mackenzie Holst, who neither works for nor has any past association with C4SS, was under the impression (presumably due to some kind of communications cock-up) that we had endorsed it, planned to publish it, and stood behind the public reading of it.
I understand that she's paid a personal price in terms of being dogged by Paul cultists right up to the point of deleting her social media accounts, etc. I don't like identity politics and such very much. I don't consider myself a "Social Justice Warrior" whatever that is (it's something I see "right libertarians" and conservatives posing as libertarians throw out as snark quite a bit). But even I can't help but notice how much meaner these allegedly "equal opportunity assholes" tend to get when it's a woman they're picking on (perhaps they worry slightly less that a female victim will forsake the non-aggression principle and break someone's nose by way of imparting a much-needed lesson in basic manners).
So anyway, since C4SS doesn't -- and probably shouldn't -- really have a position on the whole thing other than "no, that wasn't us," I think it behooves me to personally (but publicly) thank Mackenzie, Cory and Aaron for such outstanding work.
Since "the incident," Dave Weigel has published a second Bloomberg article which makes it sound like we left-libertarians (but I repeat myself), led by C4SS, Jeff Tucker and some poetry slammers, have all but completely taken over the "liberty movement." And we got denounced at VDARE, too, on pretty much the same grounds. Rumor has it that various Kochtopus operatives, Hoppe enthusiasts and paleo Viking re-enactors have barricaded themselves in a conference room at the convention venue for a forlorn last stand. Hopefully (OK, maybe not hopefully, but probably) they'll come out waving white flags and learn that it was a false alarm before they starve to death.
I couldn't have bought a media talk-up like that with a five-figure PR budget. And we got it for free. Thanks, you guys!
On the one hand, my first, gut response to something like "DARPA has a cool new search engine" is "well, they need to immediately make it publicly accessible and release the source code."
And in theory, at least, project manager Chris White is on the same page, saying "By inventing better methods for interacting with and sharing information, we want to improve search for everybody ..."
On the other hand, Memex seems to be all about searching, and searching for, information whose creators/curators aren't particularly interested in sharing with every Tom, Dick and Harry who might happen to be interested. So my equal and opposite reaction is "well, they need to immediately cut off law enforcement access to this thing, do a multi-pass deletion of every drive containing its code, etc." Cassius Methyl at The Anti Media seems to agree.
On the third hand (yes, I have three hands), if DARPA is developing this stuff, it can, and therefore will, be developed by others sooner or later.
So I'm back to the first hand. Unless DARPA went private-sector when I wasn't looking, this stuff is public property. Let's see it. Now.
Bob Dylan tops that list (tied with the Rolling Stones, whom I'm guessing I've missed my last shot at).
