We are better than this. As someone who trains teachers, I remind teachers (and myself) that teaching practice can ALWAYS be improved. If we don't improve our schools (and I'm saying that ONE way to do that is to eliminate high-stakes testing), we are condemning ourselves to a continuation of generational poverty - meaning we spend more and more of our taxes to augment the income of people who live below the poverty line.
I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said, “Those who can, teach. Those who can’t, pass laws about teaching.” That’s pretty much sums up my feeling about my state’s leaders.
Week 5 saw the fruition of our cross-conference mystery matchups; the mystery being that game matchups would be determined by that weeks standings. Since we were first in our conference, we were paired against the Mean Boys (who are not really mean). Despite the fact that we allowed more runs in the game than we had allowed all season to that point, we erupted for an offensive explosion (at least by our standards) to help seal a win and keep our perfect record intact. As a side note, this game featured the first player ejection in our league's three-year history. Honestly, it could have been avoided, but unfortunately folks emotions get the better of them sometimes.
Chandra’s passing has left a vacuum that cannot be filled. She was a towering figure, whose work on transitional justice and human rights, and her willingness to lend a helping hand, shaped my academic path. It was an honor to have known her, and we will truly miss her.

But over time, Sunny’s appreciation for holiday music rubbed off on me and I’ve learned to embrace — even love — Christmas music. From Thanksgiving to New Year’s, we’re pretty much ear deep in Harry Connick, Jr., Elvis, Amy Grant, Mariah Carey, and a host of other artists, ringing in the holidays. We’ve accumulated all of the classic cuts, but sometimes you get a little tired of the same songs by the same artists.
So here’s a sampling of some Christmas Alternatives, different takes on some holiday standards to liven up your iPod this holiday season. Each track has been carefully selected for uniqueness and time-tested by our expert team of holiday music critics. Enjoy!
Angels We Have Heard On High – David Crowder Band. Two minutes of foot stompin’, banjo bliss. The song’s never sounded better.
Blue Christmas – Harry Connick, Jr. Tough to top the King’s version, but Connick’s iteration takes the cake as the bluesiest version of the song ever.
The Christmas Song – Martina McBride. Martina’s Christmas album has been a staple around our home for years, but her rendition of this classic is absolutely beautiful.
The Christmas Waltz – She & Him. I love anything these two record, but their latest Christmas offering is a real winner.
Last Christmas – Taylor Swift. Tired of the synth-heavy Wham! version of this song that’s ubiquitous on Lite FM this time of year? Check out Taylor Swift’s fresh revisioning.
Holly Jolly Christmas – Michael Buble. Personally, I think he tries to hard to emulate Harry Connick, Jr., but this is one of the stronger songs on Buble’s recent Christmas album.
Joy To The World – Sufjan Stevens. Sufjan’s epic 4-disc 2006 album contains many neo-classics. This is simply one of them.
Silent Night – Johnny Cash. This sparse recording highlights Cash’s traditional baritone, which sounds tailor-made for this song.
Sleigh Ride – Los Straitjackets. Think Hawaii Five-O drum roll meets “House of the Rising Sun” guitar licks.
We Wish You a Merry Christmas – Weezer. This traditional fave gets the emo treatment, thanks to Rivers and the guys.
Winter Wonderland – The Brian Setzer Orchestra. Dean Martin recorded my favorite cut of this track, but Setzer’s swinging interpretation is pretty lively.
If I were a “Go-right-to-i-Tunes-to-download-songs” type of person, I’d be headed over to iTunes!! But I’ll just take your word for it.. 🙂 Did want to point out, though, that you had a BNL song. As we’ve previously talked about, I can’t stand live music, but I did wnat to point out that BNL is the ONLY concert I have ever bought a ticket for and gone to see. There, of course, has been the show here or there at the state fair or acts that came to Harding, but BNL is the only for-real concert I’ve ever gone to. 🙂
I think we’ve talked about that before, only briefly. You mentioned seeing them sometime in the early 90s when they were an up-and-coming band…I think you said you saw them in Michigan somewhere. Sunny and I loved their music; their concert was our last “date” prior to getting married. We even listened to a lot of their stuff while we were driving around in California on our honeymoon. Did you know they broke up? Well, I guess most of the band is still together, but one of the guys who sings lead vocals left to do some solo stuff and to teach voice in New York City or something. Kinda random.
Next time you’re in the States, you guys will have to go and see the Avett Brothers with us! I think you’d like them! That is, if you can overcome your live-music-disdain! 🙂
Check out Straight No Chaser’s version of the 12 Days of Christmas. Normally this song makes me change the channel but their version is great.
Will do. Yeah, I’m ordinarily not a fan of that song…I think Bing Crosby’s version is the only one that I’ve liked over the years…but I’ll check out the Straight No Chaser version.
I agree with Beth about Straight No Chaser’s version of the 12 Days of Christmas. Definitely on my list of favorite Christmas songs. I know I’m late to the game here, but maybe you can get an early jump for next year.
I picked it up over at iTunes a few weeks back. Really solid. As you can tell from my posts, I’m something of a Christmas music junkie…thanks to my wife!

The new generation consoles (PS3, Xbox360 and Wii) has also arrived to the Educational Centers. We want to emphasize at this point, the Nintendo Wii console, which has introduced a new way to play games with the Wiimote. This command incorporates various motion sensors, accelerometers and a camera and infrared light. The Wiimote will be one of the main elements of the touch screen used in the development of our classes. In front of this proposed system, we could get a commercial smartboard, but the cost of these smartboards are around 1200€, while the proposed system only costs 50€. Our experience is based in the software distributed by J.C. Lee (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/) and we have introduced little modifications to used in our theorical and practical lessons. The system is composed by a Wiimote, a bluetooth adapted, a computer with Windows XP, a video projector and a Whiteboard (a wall can also be used). All these components can be found in educational environments. We will only need one additional component that we will have to create. We will need a Infrared Light improved with a IR LED. If we could not find it, we would modify a LED lamp available in electronics shops, changing the White emisor LED with an infrared LED we will get a small and mobile pointer that can be used in a classroom. In the paper, we explain the process to install and configure it. At the University Miguel Hernández, some of the members who are presenting this work, teach about communication networks. Our teaching includes both classroom lectures on theory, practical classes in the laboratory of computer science. Finally, we expose how we have used this system in our practical classroom obtaining a good interaction with students without spending a big amount of money in more expensive systems like commercial smartboards.
The final day of my trip to Melbourne was a trip to the 17th Biennial Conference and Exhibition for the Australian Libraries, Technology and the Future organization, VALA. The Biodiversity Heritage Library presented a panel discussion "Scanning Locally, Collaborating Globally: Creating a Global Biodiversity Heritage Library". The panel was well received by the 48 attendees. Karen Kealy from the University of Melbourne introduced the panel: Nancy Gwinn from Smithsonian Institution Libraries, Martin Kalfatovic from BHL and the Smithsonian Institution, Connie Rinaldo from the Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Elycia Wallis from the Museum Victoria, Victoria, Australia, Anne-Lise Fourie from South African National Biodiversity Institute and BHL Africa and Jiri Frank from the National Museum, Prague and BHL Europe. Gwinn provided an overview of BHL and how it is governed. Kalfatovic provided an overview of BHL.
Rinaldo talked about the current grant projects that are adding value to BHL such as Connecting Content: a collaboration to link field notes to specimens and published literature, Purposeful gaming, to crowdsource the correction of transcriptions for handwritten or complex text in BHL, The Art of Life, designed to release millions of images from BHL by making them findable, and the latest grant which will develop ways to mine BHL data and make it accessible in new ways. Rinaldo also reviewed BHL's social marketing presence.

J. Schuberth & Co, Leipzig 1871 - Tan paper over boards; Dark brown cloth at spine; 129 pp. comprised totally of a musical score. Oversize (15 x 21.5 inches) and heavy (7.5 pounds / 3.4 kilos). The mass was composed by Franz Liszt between 1855 and 1858 for the dedication of the new part of the cathedral at Esztergom, Hungary (by Archbishop Janos Scitovszky). Liszt conducted the work, and the organist was Alexander Winterberger. The dedication concert (the work's premiere) was on August 31, 1856. The reverberation time in the cathedral is 9 seconds (Wikipedia), creating the potential for an acoustic nightmare in performing a piece of this magnitude! The performance was attended by 4,000 guests, including Emperor Franz Joseph I and other imperial majesties of Austria-Hungary, ecclesiastical dignitaries, well-known musicians, and members of the press. After the premiere, Liszt (and others) continued to make various small changes and corrections to the original score. The first publication was in 1859, by the Imperial Printing House, Vienna, followed by subsequent editions and variations (piano reductions, etc.) by J. Schuberth (1871.), G. Schirmer (1909.), etc. This particular edition/volume contains NO individual parts (violin, flute, soprano, etc.) for actual performance but IS an actual, complete copy of the entire conductor's score, meaning that it includes all the orchestral, organ, vocal soloist (SATB), and choral (SATB) parts (with vocal text) all together for a conductor to use in rehearsal or performance. This edition was published by J. Schuberth & Co. (no date), likely in Leipzig (rather than New York or Philadelphia), as the names of the instruments are listed in German, and the price on the front cover is listed in Thaler, an old German/European coinage. The work is complete: Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei, with all parts readable, even where margins are chipped. An excellent copy for the conducting student, Liszt afficionado, musical researcher, or someone interested in Hungarian/Esztergom ecclesiastical history. (For an excellent article by Morten Solvik on Liszt's writing of this work, see this link from the American Symphony Orchestra's web site.

The journey starts from Bombay and continues via Aden and Jedda before reaching Mecca and Medina. Includes interesting information about Mecca and the proceedings of the Hajj at this time.

Very scarce; as of January 2018, WorldCat locates one copy of a similar title in a North American institution, but with what appears to be one copy of each of the caricatures.

Tokyo, Japan : 須原屋茂兵衛 [Suharaya Mohei] and 須原屋伊八 [Suharaya Ihachi], Meiji 4 [1871].

[n.p.]: Printed for the Bristol & West of England Society of Women's Suffrage by the Tavistock Printing Company, 1871. First edition. Disbound and stitched at the spine; front wrapper partially detached with small paper loss to upper left corner not affecting text. Internally clean and complete, with all 23 pages unmarked and bright. A Near Fine copy of this exceptionally rare pamphlet, which does not appear in modern auction records or at any institutions according to OCLC.A suffragist rather than a more militant suffragette, Dame Millicent Fawcett employed dispassionate, rational arguments to make a case for women's rights. The lecture recorded in this pamphlet is a prime example of her methods, as the Electoral Disabilities of Women sets out and deconstructs seven common arguments against women's enfranchisement. Drawing on the philosophy of John Stuart Mill and Erasmus Darwin, Fawcett calls for logical consistency in Britain's application of disability laws, asserting that if concerns about women's intellect, emotion, or education levels are what bar them from civic participation, those same concerns must shape when and how men gain the right to vote.

Then I remembered that song “Turn it off!” from when I saw the musical “The Book of Mormon,” in Hawaii. (Squirrel* The musical was awesome! If you haven’t seen it, it’s a must! Highly recommend!). The song had the wrong words for a pick me up, but such a catchy tune! Then I started thinking…

New York: Woodhull & Claflin & Co, 1871. First Edition. Hardcover. A major work of first-wave feminism, written, not coincidentally, during the Presidential candidacy of Claflin's sister Victoria (Claflin) Woodhull. Together, the Claflin sisters formed one of the most notorious partnerships of the American Victorian era - spiritualists, free lovers, socialists, and outspoken feminists, the Claflins opened the first woman-operated stock brokerage on Wall Street, and their controversial newspaper, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, published the first appearance of Karl Marx's Communist Manifesto in America. Many of these activities were financed through Tennessee Claflin's more-or-less openly adulterous love affair with millionaire Cornelius Vanderbilt. The present work makes the fairly standard Constitutional arguments for women's rights, but also includes some rather controversial chapters on the institution of marriage (which the author characterizes as sex slavery) and dress reform. Oddly, not in Krichmar. A somewhat difficult book to find in any condition; this copy typically worn, but still serviceable and with extremely interesting provenance, bearing the ownership signature of one of the key figures of second-wave feminism. Octavo (23cm). Publisher's green cloth, ruled in blind and lettered in gilt on spine and front cover; 148pp; frontispiece portrait. Moderate rubbing and wear, with losses at spine ends and cloth worn through at corners; Good or better and internally sound. This the copy of feminist theorist and author Aileen Kraditor, with her ownership signature at bottom margin of second blank, dated 1961.
We’re all connected, like the components of a feather. Have you ever wondered about the parts of a feather? If so, you’re an inquisitive person. I’ve wondered. But it took me sixty years to ask the question, at the right time, with the right resources available to answer the correct question.
I asked the right question, finally, and was stunned by the complexity of the answer. Feathers comprise an array of “parts” that, taken collectively address the majority of the questions I raised concerning feathers.
Feathers consist of barbules, barbs, hooklets, rachis, afterfeather, downy barbs, and calamus (the hollow base). And there are many types of feathers. There are tail feathers, flight feathers, semiplumes, filoplumes, bristles, and downy feathers. Feathers, like fingernails and hair, are made of keratin. So, if my fingernails and hair are made from the same “stuff” as feathers, why can’t I fly?
Dr. Shah is one of the few sleep apnea dentists that limits his practice exclusively to the treatment of sleep apnea and snoring. As a successful cosmetic and dental surgeon, Dr. Shah realized the importance of this life-saving treatment when he first treated his own family members, and himself, with oral appliance therapy. His interest was further spurred by his on-going work with neurologists from the Stanford University School of Medicine Sleep Disorders Clinic.

The medical community has determined that there are three degrees of severity of Sleep Disordered Breathing. Snoring is an indication of the onset or existence of some type of airway obstruction. Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome is accompanied by gastroesophageal reflux, asthma, depression, and is frequently found in women.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea, complete airway obstruction, is common in older, overweight men and affects significant percentages of women and children as well. It can be fatal. The primary objective in treating Sleep Disordered Breathing is to open the airway to allow a sufficient amount of oxygen into the lungs and bloodstream. This is an interesting time to be discussing treatment. Because of recent discoveries, opinions are shifting drastically. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was thought for many years to be the “gold standard” of treatment for Sleep Disordered Breathing. The CPAP is comprised of a mask that fits over the mouth and/or nose and connects to a tube leading to an air compressor that sits next to the wearer’s bed. The compressor forces air into the tube and then into the mask—shooting air into the nose and/or mouth, forcing the airway to open with the sheer pressure of the air coming from the compressor. Another air pressure treatment, nasal continuous airway pressure (NPAP) is accomplished through nasal canulas—little tubes that sit inside the nostrils and are hooked to the same type of air compressor that sits at the bedside. This mode of treatment is best discussed with your physician. Surgery, such as tongue reduction, surgical removal of the soft tissue at the back of the throat, removal of the uvula, modification of the palate, etc., is another treatment option. Some procedures are done at hospitals, some performed by oral surgeons, and others are in-office procedures.
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine does not consider surgery an effective manner of treatment for Sleep Disordered Breathing, and surgical procedures are considered only 30 to 50% effective. Oral Appliance Therapy, however, has come to the forefront as a very viable treatment option for Sleep Disordered Breathing. The purpose of the oral appliance is to hold the jaw in a position that allows the airway to remain as patent as possible during sleep. Oral appliances are similar to athletic mouth guards, but are less bulky. They are completely non-invasive. Some patients report an increase in saliva production or minor discomfort upon awakening, but that generally subsides.

The solutions are pretty simple, from watering less to relocating the plant, but first you need to know what the symptoms mean.

The Miami Dolphins' starting quarterback has connected on more than 80 percent of his passes and has amassed 303 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. It's been a small body of work, but Tannehill is happy with the direction the offense is headed.
"It's a good start," he said this weekend, via ESPN.com's James Walker. "I think guys are getting open and making plays for me down the field and I’m making good decisions getting the ball out in the right spot."
Writes Walker: Tannehill’s accuracy has been impressive. He has just eight incompletions in 41 attempts. Tannehill’s ball placement also has improved to allow his receivers to run in stride, which is important for Miami’s offense.
Depression is a real illness that can be treated. It doesn’t mean you’re weak, and you can’t just “snap out of it.” Everyone feels sad at times; but, when that sadness won’t go away and you feel deeply sad almost every day for two weeks or more, you might be depressed. If this mood affects your daily life, it may be time to do something about it.

Oxnard California, located about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is the 21st largest city in the state with a population of 170,431, and among other things, is a major transportation hub in Southern California along with Union Pacific, Amtrak, Metrolink and Greyhound.
Oxnard is located just miles away from some of the most beautiful beaches, and is home to the California Strawberry Festival.
It doesn’t matter if you’re living or residing in Oxnard, there are always plenty of things for you to do.
One other thing to be proud of about living in the area is the fact that California is a deregulated state, which means, if you’re in the market for commercial electricity for your local business in the Oxnard area, you have the right to choose from the most affordable energy providers.
This hasn’t always been the case, because before the state became deregulated, it was up to the government to choose who residents and businesses had to sign up with for energy.
If you need any help, or have any questions in regards to your electricity, feel free to give us a call anytime at 1-800-971-8020 and one of our expert consultants will be more than happy to give you a hand with all of your energy needs.

A Court of Queen's Bench justice will be hearing arguments tomorrow in a case launched by a group of labour organizations against the sale of EPCOR's publicly-owned power generation assets.
The group includes the Alberta Federation of Labour and the City of Edmonton's two largest unions, CUPE Local 30 and CSU 52.
They argue that Edmonton City Council breached key provisions of the Municipal Government Act when it went behind closed doors to privately decide to privatize EPCOR's power generation assets.
"We are arguing that City Council had no legal authority to make the decision to privatize EPCOR's power generation," says AFL President Gil McGowan. "And if they did not have the legal right to make the decision, the decision cannot be considered valid."
Representatives of the group - including McGowan and Dave Loken from the Coalition of Edmonton Civic Unions - will be available on Friday before and after the hearing to take questions from the media about the case.
Both EPCOR and the city of Edmonton have filed extensive responses to the groups' statement of claim. The hearing is expected to take the bulk of the day.

Africa Risk-Reward Index November 2018: investment climate strengthens as continent’s growth revives despite the drag from its biggest economies
The African Union has issued a strongly worded statement condemning the use of chemical weapons in Syria and cautioning against responding without ‘incontrovertible evidence’ and compliance with international law.
The United States, Britain and France launched military air strikes on multiple government targets in Syria in the wee hours of Saturday morning in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of people last week.
Moussa Faki, Chairperson of the African Union (AU) Commission, shared the official statement of the continental body on his Twitter account.
In the face of this dire situation, the only sensible course of action is the intensification of international efforts to find a lasting political solution based solely on the interests of the Syrian people and respecting the territorial integrity of Syria.
The statement asked members of the United Nations security council to put aside their differences and pursue global peace.
‘‘In the face of this dire situation, the only sensible course of action is the intensification of international efforts to find a lasting political solution based solely on the interests of the Syrian people and respecting the territorial integrity of Syria.’‘

Inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, arrived in Syria on Saturday to investigate the site of the April 7 attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma, which killed dozens.
British prime minister, Theresa May, however told legislators sitting in an emergency debate on Syria on Monday, that the inspectors have been blocked from accessing the site by the Russians.

Big data, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence are important topics in modern society. So far, big data has produced useful results in modern society. The prospect that big data can predict the future leads to active utilization of big data. However, there are problems in using big data. Big data has been actively utilized mainly in profit-making or profit maximization. In this process, the basic philosophy for 'human being' is collapsing. Humanities are important because they provide moral sensitivity. It seems that humanities reflection and questions are needed to solve the following three problems. (1) personal information leakage and privacy invasion (2) misreading and rigging of data (3) human life and dignity. Problems arising from the use of big data should be treated seriously in terms of issues of human, life, human individuality, and dignity. People believe that big data will lead humans to the perfect future, but big data only tells the past and present. Although big data can present the direction of the future, but it is not synonymous with human - being’s bright future. If big data is used for human- being, life and future, humanistic questions should be asked. Before expecting the value created by big data, we have to ask humanistic questions about why big data exists.
In this big data era, consumers evaluate whole corporate activities through active and quick decision-making in the course of information search and opinion suggestion via social networks. So, new communication contents are needed to convey information effectively to these consumers. This study, building on previous research, analyzed types of card news shared at internet and social media as well as cases of use for marketing. As a result, the study found there were plenty of types that enhanced reliability on the given content smoothly by using images and applying storytelling to diverse information. Along the way, there was much use of advertisement types directly exposing products, services or content providers as well as PR types exposing advertisement content in between the contents. This study expects that through these findings, usability of card news contents and need for measures to use are emphasized, and further provides theoretical and practical implications for corporate marketing communication activity.
The Big Data Industry is an important industrial field that will control the future national competitiveness and is the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Especially, with the development of IT technology and rapid diffusion of the Internet, network connection is frequently made through mobile devices such as smart phones, tablet computers, wearable devices, object internet, and various sensors. As a result, we are now living in a super-connected society. The Advent of Hyper-Connected Society and big data environments have seen a surge in data volume compared to the past. And the kinds of data have been diversified so that people's behaviors as well as location information and SNS can analyze and predict people's thoughts and opinions. In other words, the 'Big Data' environment is in the process of producing large amounts of information and data that can not be measured due to the spread of the digital economy. With the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Big Data has become the basis of all industries and sources(IoT, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Self-driving Car, etc.). At this point, we need to change our perception of the use and use of personal information. In other words, I think it is time to look at personal information and data with a more flexible attitude away from the rigid system of personal information protection. In addition, there are many problems that we have to examine legally. Specifically, big data and privacy, big data and algorithm bias, big data and intellectual property rights. Therefore, in this paper, I examine what Big Data is and how it is currently being used and what are the specific problems. In order to improve this, I want to examine big data in terms of privacy protection viewpoint, algorithm regulation viewpoint, and intellectual property point of view. In addition, I think that the legislation on the technology field dealing with the Fourth Industrial Revolution is appropriate in the way of self-regulation or self-control rather than rigid legal system. Current law can not catch up with the pace of rapidly evolving technology, and it will remain a barrier to technological innovation. It is prudent to rule in the way of legislation after the fact that it operates once according to the method of self-regulation and the part where the law is weak or strong regulation is necessary. It should be noted that the form of the negative regulation or regulatory sandbox is useful for the legislation that I present.
The need for various approaches to non-face-to-face identification technology for registering and authenticating users online is being required because of the growth of online financial services and the rapid development of financial technology. In general, non-face-to-face approaches can be exposed to a greater number of threats than face-to-face approaches. Therefore, identification policies and technologies to verify users by using various factors and channels are being studied in order to complement the risks and to be more reliable non-face-to-face identification methods. One of these new approaches is to collect and verify a large number of personal information of user. Therefore, we propose a big-data based non-face-to-face Identity Proofing method that verifies identity on online based on various and large amount of information of user. The proposed method also provides an identification information management scheme that collects and verifies only the user information required for the identity verification level required by the service. In addition, we propose an identity information sharing model that can provide the information to other service providers so that user can reuse verified identity information. Finally, we prove by implementing a system that verifies and manages only the identity assurance level required by the service through the enhanced user verification in the non-face-to-face identity proofing process.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the demand for the Nuri Curriculum policies with online news from 2013 to 2016 through Big Data analysis. The data included word cloud analysis, keyword transition analysis by year, and semantic analysis by SNA There were total 58,441 articles based on the main key words, `the Nuri Curriculum`, `Early Childhood Education`, `Child Care`, `Child Care Program`, and `ECE curriculum` and the researchers selected 17,651 effective articles. The findings were as follows. First, the Word clouds analysis showed that key words showed the highest frequency in relation to the Nuri Curriculum were the Nuri Curriculum budget, central government, support, child care teacher, local education office, organization, superintendent, young children and program, etc. Second, as a result of the semantic network analysis, the Nuri Curriculum, the Nuri Curriculum budget, and the Vice-Minister of Economy were found to be the central nodes. The budgeting and metropolitan and local education offices acted as a gatekeeper that mediates the Nuri Curriculum and the Nuri Curriculum budget. The needs of the people in the Big Data were identified as the quality management of the whole of early childhood education and child care services, strengthening of publicity, and stability of the Nuri Curriculum budget.
Big data has created new technical and business environment which change organizations in many ways. It is time for organizations to cope with huge data volume as well as various data types and the speed of data production and utilization. In this context, research on data integration for solving these problems falls short of academic and industry demand. Especially academic research have not provided enough answers on effective decision making support through big data integration. By developing a big data integration framework evaluating such techniques as Hadoop, data federation, and data virtualization as well as infrastructure like parallel data warehouse, cloud systems, logical data warehouse and data lake and analyzing a public sector data integration case, the paper proposes a strategy to select appropriate big data integration approaches in various situations.
Big data revolution has changed the management of business as well as the model of business. The new business model driven by big data characterizes the differences in its value creation and profit realization, compared to traditional business models. This study analyzes Korea and US cosmetic big data business case to extract the components of big data business model which are discussed in previous literature. As a result, these cases validate the three key constructs of big data business model; data, platform, customer experience. Especially, data plays a significant role in value creation as well as profit realization. Interestingly enough, US case which has a clear profit realization method directly related to big data analysis delivers a moe concrete personalized customer experience to users.
As firms are able to setup ubiquitous computing environment and as computing devices develop, there is an accumulation of diverse and massive digital data. As technology such as cloud computing and Hadoop are available widely, firms are able to analyze data in real-time basis and able to use data that they were not able to use before. Accordingly, they are able to introduce new products and services and create and add values by expanding their business activity boundaries. Distribution of big data affects every industry, technology and society. In addition, it is forecasted that it will be one of the main technology development for the future. It will continuously grow and will create many socioeconomic values. This paper analyzes economic effects of big data distribution by reviewing preceding case studies. The paper examines economic effects of big data in analytical aspect and economic effects of big data utilization by reviewing case studies in SAS, TDWI, MIT, Mckinsey and GE. As result, it shows that there is increase in economic value of big data in analytical aspect in the case of SAS study. In the cases of TDWI and MIT, a big data helped firms to segment and target their markets more effectively and improved implementation of business strategies. In the case of McKinsey study, it shows there are economic effects such as cost reduction and increase in productivity. In the case of GE study, it also shows reduction in cost.
Process mining in big data environment utilize a number of data were generated from the business process. It generates lots of knowledge and insights regarding implementation and improvement of the process through the event log of the company`s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. In recent years, various research activities engaged with the audit work of company organizations are trying actively by using the maximum strength of the mining process. However, domestic studies on applicable sales auditing system for the process mining are insufficient under big data environment. Therefore, we propose process-mining methods that can be optimally applied to online and traditional auditing system. In advance, we propose continuous monitoring information system that can early detect and prevent the risk under the big data environment by monitoring risk factors in the organizations of enterprise. The scope of the research of this paper is to design a pre-verification system for risk factor via practical examples in sales auditing. Furthermore, realizations of preventive audit, continuous monitoring for high risk, reduction of fraud, and timely action for violation of rules are enhanced by proposed sales auditing system. According to the simulation results, avoidance of financial risks, reduction of audit period, and improvement of audit quality are represented.
His main interest is in figuring out how to receive weak OOK signals from a variety of sensors in and around the house. So first, you’ll need to extract the OOK information – it turns out that there are several ways to do this, and when you get it right, the bit patterns that come out snap into very clear-cut 0/1 groups – which can then be decoded:
Another interesting bit of research went into comparing different boards and builds to see how the setups affect reception. The good news is that the RFM69 is fairly consistent (no extreme variations between different modules).
Then, with plenty of data collection skills and tools at hand, Frank has been investigating the effect of different antennas on reception quality – which is a combination of getting the strongest signal and the lowest “noise floor”, i.e. the level of background noise that every receiver has to deal with. Here are the different antenna setups being evaluated:
Last but not least, is an article about decoding packets from the ELV Cost Control with an RFM69 and some clever tricks. These units report power consumption every 5 seconds:
Each of these articles is worth a good read, and yes… the choice of antenna geometry, its build accuracy, the quality of cabling, and the distance to the µC … they all do matter!

"Whoever is honest in small things can also be trusted with great ones, and whoever is dishonest in little matters will also be dishonest with much. So if a man has not been honest with worldly wealth, who can trust him with moral decisions? No man can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Mammon.' The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and sneered at Jesus." Luke 16:10-14

The Banks must be restrained, and the financial system reformed, with balance restored to the economy, before there can be any sustainable recovery.
"In the Incarnation the whole human race recovers the dignity of the image of God. Thereafter, any attack even on the least of men is an attack on Christ, who took on the form of man, and in his own Person restored the image of God in all. Through our relationship with the Incarnation, we recover our true humanity, and at the same time are delivered from that perverse individualism which is the consequence of sin, and recover our solidarity with all mankind." Dietrich Bonhoeffer
"A credibility trap is when the managerial functions of a society have been sufficiently compromised by corruption so that the leadership cannot reform, or even honestly address, the problems of that system without implicating a broad swath of the powerful, including themselves.
The moneyed interests and their aspirants tolerate the corruption because they have profited from it, and would like to continue to do so. Discipline is maintained by various forms of soft financial rewards and career and social coercion."

File These two plain clothes policemen caught this man redhanded stealing from persons in the bus terminal of South Parade, downtown Kingston, in September. He was arrested.
The pickpockets are busy in downtown Kingston as they try to see how many shoppers they can rob so they too can have a Merry Christmas.
However, a pickpocket was overheard this week saying, "Mi can hardly make a move" because too many police are on the streets.
A shopper said she felt very safe downtown because of the police who were out in large numbers ensuring that people were not robbed.
A policewoman explained that, at this time of the year, people have more money to shop because of preparation for Christmas. She said many Jamaicans abroad always try to send money for their relatives during the Christmas season.
"I talk to them all the time and some of them will tell you that they cannot work for minimum wage. However, they are the very ones who are ready to rob the people who go out to work for minimum wage.
"It is frightening to see how many of the young men are committing crimes because they do not want to live a productive life. If I had the power, I would scrape them up and take them out into the rural areas and give them all the idle lands to farm.
"I grew up on a farm and my parents were farmers and farming was very hard work for them," the policeman explained.
Commenting further, he said,"If they do not want to work for minimum wage, then it is not possible that they would be interested in farming."
"So many things are going very wrong in this country, and it makes our work harder to try to cut down on crime," the policeman said.
The policeman said he spent his free time helping to counsel the young men in his community and some will listen and change their ways, but others are very stubborn.
"I always tell them to get an education or learn a skill because a life of crime will only lead to an early death for them," he said.
He said last week he arrested an 18-year-old youth for stealing a chain. He said when the boy's mother heard what he had done, she collapsed. He said when he asked the youth why he stole the chain, he said he was 'hustling' to buy clothes to wear to a dance during the Christmas season.
"I want to issue a stern warning to pickpockets that if they are caught stealing and taken before the court, once they are found guilty they can be fined or jailed for the offence," the policeman said.

The opera house is where people and puppets come together for fun! Adults find our shows enjoyable, too. The opera house is home to "The Fever River Puppeteers" who perform marionette and other puppet shows seasonally. We offer occasional puppetry workshops for children and adults. The building can be rented for birthday parties or other occasions, and is wheel chair accessible. We have tables and chairs and a small kitchen with refrigerator and stove. Chuck and Sandye Voight began the Fever River Marionettes in Benton in 1993. Performances have included "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Rumpelstiltskin", and original tales like "Wolfie". Over the years the troupe included youth and adult volunteers, but currently the Voights perform as a couple. The opera house became our home in 2004. We changed our name to "The Fever River Puppeteers" to include other forms of puppetry. We are members of the Wisconsin Puppetry Guild and the Puppeteers of America and have attended national and regional puppet festivals. The opera house is located in the village of Hazel Green, one block east of Hwys 11 & 80. We are 20 minutes from Platteville, WI, Dubuque, IA, and Galena, IL.

(ep 1) As the Doctor and Peri prepare to go out onto the asteroid surface, the Doctor hits something on the console (not the door control) and heads for the door. We hear the TARDIS door sound effect, but the door doesn't open. Which is actually for the best, because Peri says something else and the Doctor turns back for a few more lines, before going back to the console and hitting the real door control.
(ep 2?) The silver computer terminal in the safe-house on Titan 3 seems to be rather prone to wobbling - an obvious example being after Peri spots the bomb ticking away outside the room, and the Doctor walks away from the terminal to have a look...
(ep 2) In the 'fight scene' between the Doctor and the Cybercontroller, the carpet on the studio floor (under the central console) gets kicked up and rather badly creased...
(ep 1) After the TARDIS breaks down, the Doctor and Peri can be seen standing over the console reading the manual, even though it is quite clearly just a book full of blank pages!
(ep 1) The Rani leaves the bath house to find the Master, and Peri sneaks in to rescue the Doctor. Note that she takes special care to bolt the door on the inside after she enters. But when the Rani and the Master return, they just walk in, the door being mysteriously unbolted...
(ep 1) When the second Doctor materializes the TARDIS on the research station, he and Jamie head for the TARDIS door, with every intention of leaving, but the door isn't open, nor has the Doctor gone to open it. He then quite conveniently remembers that he should "take the recall disk" from the control console. It was a prop needed for the story, so it wasn't just an excuse for going back to open the door (there is dialogue during this as well). He walks back to take it, and opens the door. Clever chap..
(ep 3?) When the Second Doctor is running to hail down the lorry, he slips slightly on the gravel of the roadway...
(ep 1) Watch for the moment when Maylin Renner (one of the Karfellans) accidentally pulls a slider switch from the computer console. But being a professional, he quickly reattaches it without looking at it or drawing a great deal of attention to it..
(ep 1) The Doctor says he is travelling light this time after Tekker's enquiry as to whether Peri is his only companion. But the last time he was here (as the Third Doctor), he only had Jo Grant with him - so he was travelling light then, too..
(ep 2) After the robots have attacked and there are several unconscious guards on the floor, one of them quite noticeably shuffles his legs.
(ep ?) In one scene when the Doctor and Peri (or possibly Herbert) enter the TARDIS, as the inner doors open, you can see one of them bounces off the console room wall and starts to close again..
(ep 2) When the DJ fires his ultrasonic gun the first time (to show Peri), he shatters the doors to his studio. Later, when the Daleks advance into the studio, the miraculously repaired doors open as they approach it...
(ep 2?) When those two chaps show a Dalek their security passes, you can see the head of the Dalek operator through the "neck grille".
(ep 1?) Nicola Bryant then goes on to pronounce "sterile" with a long "i", in a most un-American way.
(ep 1) At the end of this episode, a stone hits the Doctor too soon. He was supposed to be stoned for a little while before being hit, but one overzealous extra hit him too soon... (This was a blooper Colin Baker mentioned at a convention.) (sometime during Mindwarp [ep 5-8]) A bulb blows as the TARDIS dematerialises...
(ep 12) (last ep. of Terror of the Vervoids) This is very nitpicky, I know, but after the Doctor has destroyed the walking rhubarb, the camera shows a shot of him holding a leaf in his left hand... Cut to another shot, with Mel coming up beside him, and the leaf has magically moved to his right hand... (Or is that the other way round? Can't remember...)
(ep 12) When the Vervoids are dying, one of them is blatantly a person in a black sweat suit with a mask and a few leaves - You can even see the drawstrings to the pants!
(ep 9&12) (beginning & end of Terror of the Vervoids) Somebody moves the TARDIS around between these two episodes.... In episode 9, the bottom of the TARDIS is aligned with some yellow stripes on the floor of the Hyperion's cargo bay. In episode 12 however, the TARDIS is at an angle to these stripes...
(ep 14) Watch the scene where the Master and Glitz leave the Doctor in the console room of the Master's TARDIS. You'll note that Glitz and the Master distinctly leave the console room and go into another part of the TARDIS. However, the next time you see Glitz and the Master (talking about the Doctor's imminent switch into a "zombie"), they are definitely standing in front of the scanner screen in the console room. Someone didn't feel like building an extra set for another room in the Master's TARDIS!
(ep ?) One of the many times that the Doctor interrupts the Matrix's replay of events, you could hear what sounds like studio direction just before the replay begins again. Most of it is unintelligible, but "take 6" can be distinctly heard as the action fades in on the monitor screen. The question is - is this one of the technical crew, or is it simply one of the distinguished Time Lords in attendance being overly loud at the Doctor's trial? ;-)
(ep ?) The whole Trial season had quite a few sound problems... At several points in the story, the sound from earlier in the story is mixed in with the current sound. Like, there's one example I can think of later in the story where you suddenly hear, from out of nowhere, the Doctor saying, "Very good!" That was clearly from the beginning of The Mysterious Planet when Peri said something about there not being any birds or flowers or something. The Doctor then said "Very good!" to her. But, much later on in the story it shouldn't magically come back, obviously... Wonder whose fault that was?

Progressive, forward-thinking businesses are eager to cut costs, improve plant operations, and increase the effectiveness of their warehousing, packing, and shipping processes. They realize that the ability to cost-effectively manage the supply chain system, from packing through delivery, is key to remaining viable in today’s highly competitive, industrialized world market. There are many factors to consider when creating a custom shipping practice. Here are three things logistics industry leaders are putting in place now.
One quick peek behind the curtain separating you from the opulent first-class cabins at the front of the plane, and you know what you’ve been missing. You’ve been whacking your knees on an awkwardly placed tray table, eating synthetic food with plastic cutlery, and trying to sleep wedged between two overly talkative strangers in coach. But, those at the front comfortably sleep in their private cabins, digesting gourmet meals, served on fine china, prepared by master chefs. What they’re experiencing is first class service.
The safe transport of temperature-sensitive products is a billion dollar industry. ColdPharma logistics, the transporting of temperature-controlled medicines within a supply chain, has become vitally important to the healthcare industry. With the emergence of manufactured drugs that have a shorter shelf life and greater financial worth, companies must be conscious of the challenges to control, monitor, and protect the integrity of their products all along the cold chain distribution process.
There’s a lot of talk about the driver shortage in the logistics world and has been for some time. However, as a strong economy and low unemployment rate spell good news for most Americans, it’s exacerbating the shortage issue further in logistics and transportation. Let’s take a look at the driver shortage issue: how it began, why it’s still going strong, all the consumer implications, and finally, how can we solve it? Here’s a hint, it may involve a self-driving truck soon enough.
Few things touch our hearts more than the health and well-being of our animals. Vaccines are a major part of keeping them healthy and happy. When companies create an animal vaccine and subsequently develop the supporting supply chain to transfer, store, and distribute the medicine; these key processes can be discounted because these are crucial elements of keeping vaccines viable and safe for animals. From the time a vaccine leaves the manufacturer to the time it’s actively injected into an animal, there’s a lot that can happen to adulterate, inactivate or contaminate a vaccine.
The transportation industry is facing a lot of challenges, with no easy remedy. Government policies like the ELD Mandate and truck driver shortages continue to grow daily. This is forcing third-party logistics companies to have to rethink how we keep distribution flowing on time and accurately. Technology is helping to fill the gaps and create better ways to fulfill customer orders with greater speed and accuracy. Here are a few of the emerging technologies that are changing the transportation game:
Most people are aware that human vaccines need special transport, storage and handling due to maintain product efficacy. However, animal vaccines need the same amount of care and consideration. In the time between the instant a vaccine leaves the manufacturer’s plant until the moment it’s injected into an animal, there are several potential “weak links” in the distribution process where vaccines can be unintentionally contaminated or inactivated.

It’s not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination, but “Perfect Order” is back in the spotlight again as it rolls off the tongues of industry thought leaders and journalists. But why is it getting so much attention again? It could be that despite innovations in technology, only 84% of orders are considered “perfect.” It’s no wonder it’s the KPI all companies need to make a priority in 2018.

The objective of above question is to highlight a relatively less known phenomenon, akinetic mutism after a neurological insult. Due to injury to the frontal lobe, a patient does not initiate speech or movements.
In akinetic mutism, a patient is not paralyzed but lack willingness. Alertness is present and patients' eyes may follow their observer or they may respond to audio clues. There are two kinds of akinetic mutism described. 1) Frontal or hyperpathic akinetic mutism as described above 2) Mesencephalic or somnolent akinetic mutism due to damage to the midbrain, where vertical gaze palsy and ophthalmoplegia can usually be demonstrated.
This is completely a distinct phenomenon. After an event of neural insult, a careful determination should be performed to differentiate between coma, persistent vegetative state, brain death, locked-in syndrome (coma vigilante) and dementia, as they all have different management and outcomes.

If you're into great music, no matter where or when it's been recorded then you're at the right place! Grab a drink,
Ladies & gentlemen, after a few busy weeks leaving you with some CD compilations, your captain is back on duty!
Though the next flight plans will lead us to some Asian tapes we'll first celebrate the end of this year's Ramadan with a serie of high class oriental LP's featuring one of the most renowned Egyptian crooners of the sixties and seventies...
We'll start this homage serie with AN EVENING WITH ABDEL HALIM HAFEZ (Cairophon, LPCXG139 from 1973). Though the name and cover picture would let us think about a live recording this brilliant Lp is made of studio sessions. Don't worry, the next 2 weeks will focus on some of Abdel Halim Hafez (عبد الحليم حافظ) live performances.
Better than telling you about his successful career, let's read the notes from the cover and some online informations (note that Abdel Halim Hafez died only a few years after this recording).
We'll get a bunch of luxurious songs featuring wide orchestrations including occidental and oriental influences. As usual Abdel Halim Hafez combine his voice and instruments with talent, mixing modernism and tradition, incorporating various kinds of instruments: Mandolin, saxophone, electric guitar, organ, accordion, both arabian and occidental strings, piano... (not especially in today's recording but in the whole serie of recordings).
This record flirts with some "hollywoodian" (yet bollywoodian) feelings, bold Arabian style, deep love songs and a hint of sadness... It's interesting to note that Abdel Halim Hafez has been featured in many blockbuster musical movies (including the big hit Abi Foq al-Shagara) and that he was known as the "Egyptian Frank Sinatra"...
Grab a cup of tea, some dried fruits and start to whistle along with "el-Andaleeb el-Asmar" (The Black Nightingale) as his fans in all the arabian world would call him.

MANALAPAN – The music of Jerome Kern will be at the Library Headquarters, 125 Symmes dr., Wednesday, July 11 at 2 p.m. when John Ench presents a lecture and song afternoon of entertainment.
Ench, a graduate of Rutgers University, spent more than 40 years on Wall Street primarily in the Information Technology Sector. He now devotes his time to developing and presenting programs connected with the entertainment business, with an emphasis on nostalgia. A resident of Marlboro, he is an instructor at OLLI, the Orsher Lifelong Learning Institute, a program at Rutgers University. He has taught several classes focusing on entertainment and has presented the Jerome Kern program at libraries and senior centers throughout the area.
Kern, one of the nation’s foremost composers of music for both theater and screen in the early part of the 20th century, wrote more than 700 songs which were used in more than 100 different stage presentations. He also collaborated with leading lyricists of the era, including Johnny Mercer, Ira Gershwin and Oscar Hammerstein. His career, which spanned four decades before his death in 1945, created the model for later Broadway musicals. Some of his best-known works include Show Boat, Ol Man River, and Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.
No reservations are necessary for the July 11 presentation, which will include both music and a discussion of Kern’s work and life. There is no admission fee and the public is invited to attend.

The policy is interest sensitive, and if interest rates change from the assumed interest, it will effect the other two variables. If you have a Universal Life Policy, you should have it evaluated to see if you need to increase premiums based on current interest rates. A fourth variable that has not been a factor but could be in the future, and the owner should be aware of, is the cost of insurance variable. Universal Life policies are usually structured assuming current cost of insurance rates. The insurance companies reserve the right to change those rates.
A provision of a life insurance policy which continues the coverage without further premium payments if the insured becomes totally disabled.

If the company is doing well and the policies are not experiencing a higher mortality than projected, premiums are paid back to the policyholder in the form of dividends. Policyholders can use the cash from dividends in many ways. The three main uses are: It may be used to lower premiums, it may be used to purchase more insurance or it may be used to pay for term insurance.

A Medigap policy is a health insurance policy sold by private insurance companies to fill "gaps" in Original Medicare Plan coverage. Every Medigap policy must follow federal and state laws designed to protect you, and they must be clearly identified as “Medicare Supplement Insurance.” Insurance companies can sell you only a “standardized” policy identified in most states by letters A through D, F through G, and K through N. All policies offer the same basic benefits, but some offer additional benefits so you can choose which one meets your needs. In Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, Medigap policies are standardized in a different way..
The chart below shows basic information about the different benefits that Medigap policies cover. If a percentage appears, the Medigap plan covers that percentage of the benefit, and you’re responsible for the rest. Some plans may not be available in your state as indicated below.
Medicare Part A Coinsurance and hospital costs (up to an additional 365 days after Medicare benefits are used) 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100%
*Plan F also offers a high-deductible plan in some states. If you choose this option, this means you must pay for Medicare-covered costs (coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles) up to the deductible amount of $2,240 in 2018 before your policy pays anything.
**For Plans K and L, after you meet your out-of-pocket yearly limit and your yearly Part B deductible ($183 in 2018), the Medigap plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year.
***Plan N pays 100% of the Part B coinsurance, except for a copayment of up to $20 for some office visits and up to a $50 copayment for emergency room visits that don’t result in an inpatient admission.

Mary Morgan visits today to tell us about her new release, QUEST OF A WARRIOR, part of her Dragon Knights series. To celebrate this latest release, she's having a Rafflecopter giveaway - make sure to enter below. She's sharing a recipe for one of her hero's favorite dishes, and it looks delicious! Take it away, Mary!
My hero, Conn MacRoich, is an ancient Fenian Fae Warrior. He’s powerful, arrogant, and a badass Fae. There are many layers to this warrior, but I would like to share a unique one with the readers. He’s a vegetarian. This is one of Conn’s favorite meals at the Seven Swans Pub, along with a good Irish stout. Sláinte!
In a large skillet, warm 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the olive oil to the pan. Stir in the onion and cook for 5 minutes and onions are soft. Add the carrots, celery, parsley, and thyme. Cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the flour, cook for several minutes, and then add the stock and Guinness. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally for 20 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper and add the peas and remove skillet from heat.
In a large saucepan over medium heat, cook the potatoes for 12-15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash. Add the milk and butter. Stir until smooth.
Transfer the stew to a large casserole dish. Spread the mashed potatoes over the meat mixture and bake for 10-12 minutes. Preheat the broiler and sprinkle the potatoes with the grated cheese, if using. Broil until potatoes are slightly brown and cheese is bubbling.
“You met them in the Order of the Dragon Knights. Now, journey to the realm of the Fae and witness their legends!"
Fenian Warrior, Conn MacRoich has traveled the earth for thousands of years, guarding the realm between mortal and Fae. His deeds are legendary. Yet, one mistake will force him on a journey to fix a broken time-line. However, on Conn’s quest, he must face a human female who will eventually bring this ancient warrior to his knees.
When Ivy O’Callaghan inherits her uncle’s estate, she never imagines there will be more secrets to unravel, including the one she hides from the world. With the help of a mysterious stranger, she learns to trust and step out of the shadows. However, nothing prepares Ivy when she learns Conn's true identity.
As the loom of fate weaves a thread around the lovers from two different worlds, will the sacrifices they make lead them to love? Or will their secrets destroy and separate them forever?
Conn fought the bolt of desire spearing a path throughout his body. Her touch spoke volumes—an invitation to taste. Never had he longed to kiss a human like this wee lass. His heart beat loudly, and he found himself unable to move. She was a Goddess of the moonlight. It danced off her face and hair, and he trembled before her. Ivy’s fingers traced down his cheek and across his lips. He was helpless to contain the growl that escaped from his mouth.
The rush of passion overtook him, and Conn slammed the door on his mind. Grasping Ivy around the waist, he hoisted her up on top of the bridge. Her lips parted on a sigh, and he lowered his mouth to feast on something he dared not take. The first brush of her soft lips against his own ignited a hunger he could no longer contain. Taking her moan deep into him, Conn glorified in the sensation of her mouth—one filled with a honeyed sweetness.
The Fae warrior became just a man for the first time. Something primal burst within him. Emotions he had never felt left him dizzy, spiraling to a physical plane. He craved them all. His lips seared a course down her neck, to her throat, and then recaptured the velvet warmth of her mouth.
Award-winning Scottish paranormal romance author, Mary Morgan, resides in Northern California, with her own knight in shining armor. However, during her travels to Scotland, England, and Ireland, she left a part of her soul in one of these countries and vows to return.
Mary's passion for books started at an early age along with an overactive imagination. She spent far too much time daydreaming and was told quite often to remove her head from the clouds. It wasn't until the closure of Borders Books where Mary worked that she found her true calling--writing romance. Now, the worlds she created in her mind are coming to life within her stories.
They were an ancient order descended from the great Tuatha De Danann, a tribe from the Goddess Danu. Half human and half fae, each blessed with mystical powers. They were also given holy relics and guardianship over the dragons.
With the dawn of Christianity, the dragons were systematically hunted down and slain leaving only one. The Dragon Knights took her from Ireland to a land across the sea, settling in the Great Glen near Urquhart. The clan was known as the MacKay clan, descendants from the MacAoidh.
Yet, there were those who deemed the Order had too much power, and they tried to possess it for themselves. They were evil and twisted, and their plan succeeded one fateful night.

I hit this error in the lab and the fix was a new one to me so said i’d document it. The IaaS web server was failing to install and the error in the logs is below which pointed to the certs
The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. —> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. —> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.
I checked and double checked all certificates and SAN attributes of each component, checked DNS resolution forward and reverse, verified NTP etc. Then it occurred to me that the signing CA is from a different domain than the domain i was installing in so i added the root cert to the local trusted root certification store and low and behold the install completed successfully. Had to do the same on all other IaaS VMs. So even though the root and signing certs were in the personal store with the SAN certs it was not sufficient.
Hit an issue in the lab this week with vCAC/IaaS where the self signed certs had expired. Self signed certs last 12 months..note to self…setup CA! This was compounded by the expiry of the internal Solution User’s certificate. more info on that here

When you're using public spaces, the atmosphere can feel somber and impersonal, so it never hurts to add a little gentle humor to make the room, and the occasion, your own. Quotes, plays on words and puns added to banners and other signage will make people smile. Invent a creative sign for the entrance to your gathering (and make it easy to see). Try renaming the restrooms in a witty way that relates to your event or business. It's all in fun, and that's what will make it so charming.
To be honest, some days I wonder if this blog helps anyone — and if it’s anything more than a platform for me to talk about special needs cats. But every so often, I hear how the blog has made a difference in one of your lives — and I can’t tell you how amazing that feels.
A few weeks ago Brittney contacted me and said that she had found her kitty, Teddy, who’s now close to 1-year-old, through this blog. I’m honored to share her story:
“I had first heard about CH from a YouTube video about a cat named Charlie. At the time, I still had my childhood cat, Bobo. She wasn’t friendly to other cats, so adopting another cat was not an option. I made up my mind, though. When I was able to adopt another cat, I would get a CH cat.
Bobo passed away last summer from cancer, and it was so heartbreaking for me. At first, I couldn’t even think about getting another cat, but when I came across Life with CH Cats I was reminded of the wobbly kitty I saw in the video.
I went to a shelter, and told them I wanted a CH cat. They were a little surprised. They told me that they currently didn’t have any, but they told me about a cat named Dance who had been adopted, but then returned to the shelter because he had vestibular disease. Apparently, the people who adopted him were disturbed by his vertigo and newly tilted head. When I met him, I knew he had to come home with me. We also took home a silly talkative cat named Boxer, who was a life-long friend of Dance. I was not expecting to come home with two cats! I was still on the hunt for a CH kitty though!
A couple of days before Christmas, I was looking at the list of adoptable cats on Life with CH Cats. I called about a little orange kitten with mild CH. I was disappointed when they told me he was just adopted the previous day, but they told me they had another CH kitten who was also available.
A quick look at his picture and I fell in love with his sweet face. I made the drive from New York to New Jersey to get the little guy. I was told he was from a hoarding situation, and that he was about 6 months old. I later found out that he only looked like a 6-month-old, and was actually almost full grown. He was definitely the runt, and just had a rough start to life. I decided to name him Teddy, because he was cuddly like a teddy bear. He just loves to be held.
At first, Dance was upset by Teddy’s arrival. He’d hiss and growl at him, but Teddy doesn’t have an aggressive bone in his body and would only purr and cuddle with Dance. Eventually, Dance warmed up to his new baby brother. I think Teddy sensed a kindred spirit with Dance. Now, every one tells me it’s amazing how well my 3 cats get along!
Since I’ve adopted him, I’ve been trying to help him through other health problems he’s had from his life in a hoard, and a shelter. His fur has gotten softer, and he’s gotten much more lively and talkative!
I would say he’s mild. He usually takes a few spills when walking, but he gets right back up! He also has head tremors from time to time.
He makes no attempt to jump whatsoever. I imagine he tried to jump in the past, and ended up with a bad experience and never tried again. He has trouble with even small obstacles. He is also very tiny (5 lbs) and doesn’t have much muscle on him, despite being almost full grown. I think this definitely doesn’t help his mobility, but he keeps growing stronger!
Teddy sometimes loses his balance in the litter box, so we will have to wipe him down once in a while. As far as eating and drinking goes, he can handle that just fine!
What’s one funny story about him (related to CH)? Or share a story about how he figured out how to do something CH cats “can’t” do.
Teddy likes to imitate his older brothers, or at least try to. Boxer loves to stand on his hind legs and meow for food. Teddy has picked up this habit, despite being wobbly. He will slowly move his front paws up your leg until he is standing, then his back paws will fail him and he will slip! Sometimes he will grab your pants when he falls, leaving him hanging there. He doesn’t know there is anything wrong with him.
Teddy is a little trooper, and despite being knocked over from the other cats bumping him while running past, someone petting him a little too hard, or a slight breeze going by, he has never seriously hurt himself. He’s fallen from the bed a couple of times, but he’s getting better at landing on his feet now!
Teddy is a perfect angel. He’s incredibly gentle and friendly. Out of the 3 cats we have, he’s the only one that uses the scratching post exclusively. The other 2 love to scratch the couch instead. He loves to sleep under the covers, and will always purr when you pick him up. He nuzzles my nose when I’m in bed to let me know that he wants to get under the covers and snuggle. He is the sweetest cat I have ever met. He is always such a happy guy. He will always cheer you up, no matter what.
I don’t clip his claws so he can use them to help get around. We bought him a little staircase so he could climb into our bed easier.
I always try to warn house guests to be careful around him. He likes to be picked up, but you can’t put him down like other kitties!
People need to understand that just because a cat is “special needs” doesn’t mean it’s going to need ridiculous amounts of medical care, or that he or she will die sooner. When I told people the type of cat I wanted, they said things like “won’t that be expensive?” or “don’t you want a cat that will live longer?”. I was so upset by this misconception. Like I said before, my other cat Dance was returned to the shelter for his head tilt from vestibular disease. I think about poor Dance and Teddy, two wonderful cats, who were unwanted for such silly reasons, and it makes me so sad.
My least favorite thing is that I worry about him when I’m away from him. I know he’s safe in my home, but he’s my baby and I worry! My favorite part is watching him get stronger and overcoming obstacles.
Lovely story! Brittney sounds a darling! Pretty please, will you ask Brittney for a blog about Vestibular disease, either for you or me [or we could both post to get that out and about]?
I like your blog very much. I have enjoyed many articles you’ve wrote and find many of them very helpful. The story about Teddy was another good one!
A friend suggested it (cheers Tony) and I thought it would be a good idea to share my secret weapon when it comes to grooming Batman and maintaining his status as the most beautiful cat in the Universe.
It’s called “The FURminator” and it is the best grooming tool out there. If you own a long haired cat you should really check it out, it will make your life (and house) easier and cleaner. Here is an affiliate link to get The FURminator from Amazon.

I was talking to my son about the fact that 3 years of an average life is spent waiting as I mentioned in the last article. He said “What about sleep? That takes up a third of our life.” It is true that in an average life a person sleeps 24 years. Some experts say you need eight hours of sleep a night while others claim that six will get the job done. Either way we need that time to give our bodies a rest from the rigors of life. A time to relax, to escape into a dream world. There are many benefits to a good nights sleep the experts say. A rested body will perform better both mentally and physically.
I’m thinking about dreaming now. Dreams are a good thing. The body rests and the brains way of resting seems to be escaping from reality. Thinking of odd things or odd situations. Funny how our brain comes up with all of these situations in dreams. In dreams anything is possible! When the dream goes bad we usually wake up. It’s nice to be able to say “whew, glad that was only a dream!”
Unfortunately escapes from reality are not always dreams. People try to escape with booze, drugs and so many other things. Why do they want to escape? Well the answer may be that they don’t feel their life has meaning or purpose. They may be lonely or depressed. They may feel like their problems are overwhelming. Escaping from reality is a way to forget about the problems. The problem is it works for a little while. You start to forget about your problems after a drink or two. These other escapes be it drugs or what have you are not really escapes. They are just ways to not think about problems for a little while. After the drinking, drugs or other diversions are done you are still stuck with your same problems. The unfortunate part is that you have made your problems worse because you are not facing them. It did feel good to not think about the problem so you end up having your diversions more often. It’s easier and less painful living in the fantasy world and not facing reality.
One of the funnier commercials I have seen is put on by Direct TV. It goes something like this. “When you can’t get your cable channels you get depressed. You go to a seminar to make you feel better. The seminar gives you all kinds of confidence in yourself. When you have all kinds of confidence you go to Vegas. When you go to Vegas you lose everything. When you have no money you have to sell your hair to a wig company. Don’t sell your hair to a wig company, get Direct TV so you can get all of your channels!” While this commercials example is somewhat ridiculous there is a bit of truth to it. One thing always leads to another.
When you come to that fork in the road where you need to decide what world you want to live in consider this. Living in a fantasy world will never solve your problems. Like I mentioned before once the fantasy ends your problems are still there. What are you going to do? Go back again and again into the loneliness of escaping?
There is another answer and it’s so simple. You can admit that you have a problem. You can look in the mirror and decide that you would like to change. You can pray to God for help. The Bible says that God knows what you need even before you ask! He is waiting to help you with your problem. With Gods help we start dealing with problems in the real world!
I’ve heard many stories of people in jail for crimes they committed. While in jail they come to the realization that they need Christ in their life. They pray the sinners prayer and Christ comes into their lives. Does that mean that they are no longer guilty for what they did? Well the fact is many still have long prison terms to serve. The difference however is the peace they start exhibiting in their lives. Even in their bleak circumstances they can have joy in their hearts!
Your circumstances probably are not as bleak as the people in prison I mentioned. Yet even if they were the answer to your problems can be found when you humble yourself and give them to God. He knows how to handle them. The Bible says to cast all of your cares on him because he cares for you! This is not an escape from reality. This is embracing reality and turning your real situation over to the God of the Universe. Just as one thing follows another in a bad way it can also follow in a good way! As God gets bigger in your life your problems seem smaller! Now you see the same problems but your not trying to deal with them alone. You embrace the reality of God and his purpose for your life!
What are you waiting for? Christmas? Well as a little kid that is exactly what I was waiting for! Picking up wrapped presents and trying to figure out what they were was always an exciting time. Never could seem to get that right. I remember the excitement and how hard it was to get to sleep the night before! We couldn’t wait for morning to come, but it was so hard to wait! Eventually we would fall asleep, but only long enough to get a required amount. On more than one occasion my sister and I were up at the break of dawn. My sister would leave coffee and doughnuts out for Santa. She was pleased when the next morning they were gone! Good ole Santa never passed up a doughnut I guess. He wasn’t concerned about slimming down! As we looked into the living room that was still dark we could see shadows of presents Santa had left! Mom and dad would have a few presents that they didn’t wrap. They would have them sitting out. Those were the gifts that Santa brought! Nothing could start though until mom and dad got up. Luckily for us they would get up early when they heard us stirring around!
I saw someone the other day waiting around the microwave waiting for their coffee to warm up. The thought occurred to me that we spend a lot of time during a normal day just waiting. They say that if you live 70 years 3 years of it will be just waiting. Waiting for what? Graduation, an answer to your house offer or counter offer, weddings, a baby to be born, the diagnosis, an operation to get over, and someone to die are serious waits.
Then there are your normal every day waits. The bank and grocery line. Speaking of the bank line I’m reminded of the old Candid Camera episode where they made whatever line the guy was in stop. Eventually he would get in the other line and his line would stop and the line he got out of started moving swiftly. It was a very frustrating experience for the victims! We also wait for the laundry, the big game, the school day or work day to end, gas prices to lower, gas to pump, traffic signals, restaurant orders, the phone to ring, to wake up and the snooze alarm to go off again, the computer (that seems like a big one during every workday), the right time (which usually is never quite right), the weekend (funny how fast that goes by), the bus, your plane, the dreaded telephone hold (not quite as bad if they play music, the dead hold is the worst), the wait for someones busy signal to ring (when people had dial up internet this was a major problem)
Then there are the scary waits. The cop to give you a ticket (as his lights are going off and he is back there in his car), the dentist (ever notice how loud the drill is for the patient before you?)
How about the anticipation type of waits. Lets see there is New Years Eve and waiting for midnight. Waiting for the trip to end (and if you have kids you will hear the Are we there yet?)
Waits for the final bill on expensive services such as car repairs, medical bills, funeral expenses, lawyer fees, and many others.
Finally we have the long term waits. Wounds to heal, flowers to grow and bloom, grass to grow, the summer, retirement (which could be a long wait), birthdays (16, 21 and 65 are big ones), the big job call, your investment to grow (and hopefully not decrease), your tax refund (which hopefully isn’t already spent.)
With all of the waiting that we do it is easy to get into the waiting frame of mind. Instead of making decisions it is so much easier to wait. Let’s not jump into anything. Sometimes it’s a good thing to wait when people try to pressure us into things. Other times a quick decision is needed. By hesitating we lose our opportunity. The great stock tip doesn’t last forever. The guy who doesn’t share his true feelings may find his future wife has found someone else. Sometimes we become like the deer in the headlights, we freeze. There are times in life when we know what we should do, but we wait. Jesus has his gift of salvation out there and he is waiting for you to accept it. What are you waiting for? Christmas? Don’t you realize that Christmas is already here?
Leo Durocher, the famous baseball manager told a story in his book about Phil Wrigley, longtime owner of the Chicago Cubs. Mr. Wrigley would like to go into the upper deck and watch the games from there. In Leos first year as manager that was not a problem. Crowds were small and the seats were rarely taken. In his second year however, added interest in the Cubs was gained. Invariably the usher would come around and ask Mr. Wrigley for his ticket. Leo concludes that if it were him he would have lit up a cigar even though he didn’t care for cigars, just to blow out the smoke. Then he would say to the usher “it’s okay son, I own the place, keep up the good work.” Mr. Wrigley was never like that. He would get up and apologize to the usher and head to a less populated area.
To their credit bosses on the reality show Undercover Bosses never give away their cover although I’m sure sometimes it is very tempting. The show is about owners, presidents, or CEO’s of companies disguising themselves and passing themselves off as new people in the company. The camera crew is explained in various ways from two people competing for one position to doing some kind of a special documentary of a new person on the job. They try to get natural reactions and hope that the presence of the camera does not interfere with what people truly think.
Chad Hallock was raised by a single parent in Anaheim, California. He and his brothers knew that they needed to start at a young age helping with finances. Chad was working in a window covering business when he lost his job. He and his brother along with 3 other friends started Budget Blinds on $5,000 each. Today it is the largest window covering company in North America! They have over 800 Franchises all over the United States. Chad decided to be the focal point on an Undercover Boss episode so that he could get a better awareness of how their businesses are being ran with the hope of helping franchisees increase their profits! He went under cover as Tom Robbins with the story that a reality show called Second Chances would be filming him as part of a plan for a failed business person to get financial backing for a new company.
Chads first visit was to a franchisee named Keith in Morris Illinois. Keith had been in the business for 10 years and described to Chad how he started. “Someone had come over to his house to install blinds and he really liked what they were doing and the new business prospects.” He added that “the next thing he knew he was flying out to corporate headquarters and meeting Chad and his brother.” He described the brother as more flexible, more laid back. He described Chad as a rigid guy who was defensive. Chad is heard denying the charges to the camera but explained that he does take the business seriously. It was comical watching Chad as Keith thought he was talking to a new person about someone else.
Keith took Chad (Tom) on a sales call. It was obvious that the couple had no idea what they wanted but knew they needed something. Keith started pumping them with questions. “Did you want to control light? Did you want the room to feel hot or cold? Did you want casual or formal? Were you interested in white or off white?” There was this big book he had the customers thumbing through. “Take your time, we have all day”, he mentioned. Chad was saying to the camera “This is taking way too long. For two rooms this should be done in an hour. “Keith is not taking control of the situation. Keith has been in this business for ten years. Sometimes less choices is better. He needs to go in and analyze the situation and lead the customers into what would be best for the room!” Keith made the comment “Tom just sat there because he probably had never done anything like that before.”
Chad (Tom) met a franchisee named Maris in Chicago. Maris wondered what his experience was and Chad said that he was in the Iron Art business until the economy downturn hit. Maris took him on a installation appointment. Maris was very good in what she did but she found Tom (Chad) clumsy. He had a hard time drilling the holes and dropped the screw. She concluded that he was too quiet and she thought this was Toms first time working with a drill and screws. She didn’t think he was qualified to be a future Budget Blinds Franchise Owner. Chad was impressed with Maris! He called her a real go getter and liked her initiative of doing mailings to increase her business!
Later Maris shared with Chad her view that local advertising would be helpful to her business. Keith had also made the same plea but Chad had dismissed it as someone not knowing what they were talking about. When Maris made the same statement it got Chad thinking that maybe they had a point.
Typically on the show the boss learns of the personal lives of their company workers. In this case after the appointment Maris was telling Tom (Chad) that she had two sons. One of her sons, Tyler, who was 12, had a football injury. He had suffered two stingers in one season and was dealing with neurological damage. She was trying to get help for him but was finding it extremely difficult. Hearing the frustration in her voice, I could see that Chad was deeply effected.
Chad (Tom) met Pam who worked in the factory where the blinds are made in Middleton Wisconsin. Pam thought that Tom was cute but later admitted that he was like a bull in a china cabinet working this job. They worked as a team putting together individual blinds so that they could be painted. Chads comments about the job to the camera was how monotonous it was. When he asked Pam how she liked her job she said “don’t ask”. Chad found out that there was no employee recognition. Pam brought up the fact that they used to have a company picnic but it was cancelled.
Chad met a man named Dennis on his last stop in Kansas. Dennis did over 600 installs a year and Chad was interested in finding out what he was doing to make the company profitable! Dennis was an installer who was very impressive with his politeness and his attention to details on the job. His personality and kindness showed through the camera! Dennis cleaned the windows before they were done as an extra bonus! He mentioned that “he does more than he needs to, but that is what brings customers back!”
After their appointment Chad (Tom) and Dennis went to a local bar for a beer. Chad asked Dennis about his family. Dennis had 5 kids and one who they lost. When Chad questioned him Dennis said that his son was murdered and he found out by a phone call. They told him where it happened and Dennis found his son dead on the street. Once again you could tell that Chad was deeply moved.
The show concludes with the franchise owners and employees invited to corporate headquarters. I think they were given the story that they needed to be there to give their opinion of Tom and his future potential in a new business. Individually as they are sitting there Chad (Tom) comes into the room. Now he looks completely different. Instead of the casual appearance they saw before he is in a nice suit. He speaks with each one before the next is called in. After realizing that the bumbling new employee was actually the CEO of the company there is a lot of apprehension as to what they said on the job.
Chad talked to each one about the business end of what they were doing. To Keith he mentioned how he was the stiff, rigid, defensive guy. But when he got serious he talked about a local advertising fund that both he and Maris had recommended. After hearing the same complaint twice he reversed his opinion. He also mentioned how Keith needed to direct customers instead of being laid back and letting them decide things for themselves. He was going to send his brother to oversee his training since Keith liked his brother so well! Since the local advertising was a big issue with Maris, Chad mentioned to her that he was going to put $25,000 into a fund for that purpose. Pam was commended for her attention to quality control. She was very focused on putting out a good product! Chad told Dennis that of all of the people he worked with he enjoyed working with him the most. He was commended on his professionalism and the great job he was doing!
The most memorable and touching part of the show is when at corporate headquarters Chad talks about the personal lives of the people he met. He found time in his period with them to find out their stories. He gave Keith money to put his two kids through college. He gave Pam money to go on her annual Mexico vacation that she needs each year as a getaway from the job. The awards that brought tears to my eyes and Chads too were for Maris and Dennis. Maris was awarded $30,000 for expenses related to her son Tylers injury and rehabilitation. Maris, who you can tell is a very strong person and personality, broke down with gratitude! Dennis was awarded $40,000 to build an addition on to his house for gatherings of family that helps Dennis deal with his tragedy. The tears are flowing with Dennis and myself as Dennis says between sobs that “It’s the nicest thing anyone ever did for me.”
Chads comments proved this true again. His mission was originally to go out and help his company employees become better at what they do. He accomplished that mission with flying colors. He also found what his people thought about the company and how they could best be productive in the future. He was able to share the wealth of the company to meet personal needs within the company! I’m sure that he felt much more attached to the company and the franchisees after this experience! His final ending statement about the effect of this adventure on his thinking was this line:”I learned that the franchisees need to be heard. I have to be more patient, debate less and listen more.” In other words be more humble and more caring! Now that is a concept for us all to strive for!
I’m thinking of a new reality show. Maybe we could call it Outside These Doors. It would be a show similar to Undercover Boss where a representative of the church goes to a business in which a church member is working. It wouldn’t be the pastor because they would be too recognizable. It might be a random person that reports back to the pastor. Maybe the random person would be searching for the meaning of life. We could have our camera crew just like the undercover boss show. It would be interesting to see how the church operates outside of the church. How many people would lead a stranger in the sinners prayer? How many members actually take their relationship with God outside of the church and into their everyday lives? What would the attitudes of the members be like at work? I know that some people would star because of their love for God and their compassion for others! Some may make us wonder where they are hiding their light. Would this new show end up on the Christian Channel or the Comedy Channel? Or would it be canceled by CBS because the reality is more than we would want to see?
I’ve heard the question forever, “Is the glass half empty or half full?” It seems like a silly question because in reality it is both. Yet, the way you look at that glass determines if you are an encourager or a defeater.
Years ago I heard an old story. A man had arrived at a new town. As he was getting off of the train he saw a train employee. “What is this town like?”, he asked. “What is your hometown like?”, was the reply. “Well in my town everyone is out for themselves. Nobody is willing to help anyone. There is not a friendly person there. Nobody smiles much, it is a dog eat dog town”. “Well that is exactly how this town is too”, said the train employee. A day or two later a different new person to the same town arrived. He asked the same train employee the same question. “What is this town like?” “What is your hometown like?”, was again his response. “Well my hometown is the friendliest town I know. People are always helping each other with a smile on their face. If I ever needed anything somebody would always be willing to share!”, replied the new arrival. “That is exactly how this town is too!”, said the train employee.
As I walk in to the Rec Center I see them. Students all around on the exercise equipment. Conveniently many are watching TV as they exercise. Others are reading books. I always wonder how it is possible to read and comprehend anything as your body is moving on a bicycle machine? I have tried some different machines. My favorite was the rowing machine. I actually completed the time I set for myself a number of times. Each time it felt like drudgery. I’d set the thing for maybe 10 minutes. After about 2 minutes I’d be looking at the clock. Wow, I have to do another 8 minutes of this thing? It wasn’t so much how hard it was. It was more about my thinking. Too much time to think about the actual exercising that I hated to do. The TV might help for a minute. After that it was still 7 more minutes to go!
We met while he was working on the third floor. He had heard that I had loaned out my book and he was interested in seeing it. That was my initial introduction to Kahler. I had been playing racquetball with a group that was better than me and in far better shape also. I asked Kahler if he played racquetball? I think his answer was he hadn’t played seriously in a long time. We made a time and started meeting at least once a week on the racquetball court!
I could tell when we first played that Kahler had a lot of potential! He hit the ball very hard and could make great shots! One other thing that stood out was Kahler would actually dive after a ball if it was almost out of reach! That extra effort won him a number of points! One night I was hitting one of my tricky serves and Kahler was having a terrible time returning it. I could see what his problem was and after the game I mentioned it. This particular serve was going to his backhand at a quick pace and angling toward the corner. Kahler was trying to backhand the ball at that angle and he wasn’t able to get the good part of his racquet on it if he hit it at all. Finally I mentioned what he might try. It was a lesson I probably learned while getting schooled by those better players. Sometimes when you offer advice to people they turn you off. “Just play your game and I’ll play mine”, they might say. Not so with Kahler. He was open for new ideas to improve his game! “If you turn your body and follow the ball around the corner you can hit it off of the back wall with your forehand”, I offered. With that piece of advice Kahler very rarely got tricked on that serve again. Why did I offer that advice to my opponent? I can truly say that I wanted to see him get better. I knew that he would probably take that little piece of advice and use it to beat me. Yet, that was better than getting 4 or 5 points handed to me in a game without effort. As time went by Kahler has said things that have improved my game and encouraged me also!
You’ve heard the saying hundred of times I’m sure. There are two types of people, givers and takers. The biggest giver that I have ever known is Gary. I met Gary when I was 12 years old. He was a member of the church I was attending. My regular Sunday School teacher was not there one day. Gary was filling in because that is what Gary was about, helping where needed!
He asked if any of us would be interested in playing softball for the church team. Naturally I was very interested! That started a lifelong friendship with Gary! He used to be my ride to all of the games. Over the years I have seen that guy give away his money, time, and advice to anyone without ever asking for anything in return. He would consistently pay the softball leagues team entry fee out of his own funds so his team could get in. We are talking a few hundred dollars here. He never asked for anything in return. Many times he would read about some high school player or coach that did something good in some way. Gary would make the effort to go to a game and actually tried to meet the person and shake their hand. He is always thinking of others and is the most giving encouraging person I have ever known! Gary came over and helped me paint my house that I would be moving into a few days later after I got married. He never asked for anything. He did it as a gift to me. It was a gift long remembered after the other gifts were forgotten. Yet, for everything Gary has given away I have never seen him needy. He has friends from all over. It is still very hard to pay for anything with Gary around. He is such a giving person it is almost hurtful for him not to be giving all of the time!
I have played slow pitch softball for years and years. There are always players who think entirely of themselves. Forgetting all about that it is a team game these players draw all of the attention to their individual failures. I remember one particular player and believe me there are hundreds like him. If he had a good hit all was well! He was up and everyone followed his lead. But when he didn’t hit the ball the way he felt he should look out. First of all he would not even run the ball out. If he hit it in the air he would walk back to the dugout with his bat. A few times the other team actually dropped the ball but this guy was almost back to to the dugout with his head down and was an easy out. Shuffling around with his head down was his calling card. If there was a bat around he would kick it. He would also be known to throw a bat or two. The other players would try to encourage him, but he would have none of it. It would take an inning or two to get his head back in the game. If he had a bad at bat the next time it was the same story. After awhile it was hard for the other members of the team to keep trying to lift this guys spirits up. The wasted energy that his act had on the team was devastating. The best thing to do was to let him stew alone on the bench while encouraging the rest of the team.
I’ve seen other players who realize that not being successful all of the time is just part of the game. They didn’t stop hustling though! On the worst hits you could imagine they took off like they were shot out of a cannon. When they were called out they trotted back to the dugout with their heads high. Instead of taking the game so seriously you could actually hear them laughing about their futility. “I sure hit that one a mile”, they would say after topping the ball to the pitcher. Then they would start yelling encouragement for the next batter! That is the type of teammate that I always liked to play with!
When Kahler and I are playing racquetball we forget about the time. All we are concerned with is how to beat the other guy. Since we are both very similar in skills the games are always very competitive. We always play two games. When either one of us loses the first game we know that we can redeem ourselves the next. Most of the time we split the games. Sometimes one or the other wins both. Either way after every game we shake hands knowing that we both did our best! We know that we gave each other something far more important than who happened to win the games that day. We feel more energized and healthy after the games are over! There’s not the drudgery of exercising on a machine. We get our exercise in a fun way! After the time has flown by and we are leaving the court in our sweat drenched shirts we talk about the games. Kahler is always quick to recognize some of the shots that were successful for me! I commend him on his good games and plays he had! Sometimes when one or both of us are not up to standard we laugh about it. Instead of making excuses though, it usually goes something like this: “I may not have made some shots but the way you were playing probably was effecting that!” If both of us play especially bad there is laughter as we admit our failures. If one of us happens to lose both games one week there is a little extra motivation! We start thinking about things we might try differently for the next weeks games. We have both seen the level of our individual games dramatically increase and we both have each other to thank! By encouraging each other we have reaped the benefits of health, friendship, and racquetball skills!
When God looks down from heaven which person does he see in you? As Christians we should be the most positive, generous, friendly, and encouraging people on earth. However, within the church we see teammates that always need encouragement. We see teammates with a constant smirk on their faces. We see teammates that are always complaining. Instead of listening to sound advice they have decided that they like the constant attention to their problems. Living the Christian life has become a boring exercise in ritual that is a drudgery they must endure each day! Does any of these descriptions describe you? With everything that God has given us how can we not be givers back? How can we just think of ourselves when there is a world out there that needs our help? How can we refuse to shine our light in a world of darkness? There was an old baseball umpire who was trying to decide if the runner was out or safe on a close play at the plate. The catcher looked back at the umpire who was slow to signal. “Well what was he?”, the catcher quipped. The umpire stood straight up and looked the catcher in the eye. “He ain’t nothing til I call it and when I call it that’s what he is”, he barked. That is how it is with us too. We decide how we want to look at the world! We decide how we care to look at our problems! What is your hometown like? Be careful how you answer because your answer describes how this town is too. When you are looking at the glass that is filled half way add some love, compassion, forgiveness, encouragement, generosity and unselfishness water to the glass. Then you will clearly see it is much more full than empty!
Years ago when I was a senior in high school I got a job in a mens clothing department at a popular department store.. This was before they were doing the scanning like they do today. The stock number of the item purchased was carefully put into the cash register. The manager would get a long computer printout once a month. He would let each employee know how many bad numbers they were responsible for. The computer cash register at the time would take most of the numbers entered. If the number was entered wrong it appeared on his end of the month list. We also entered the customer’s credit cards on the computer cash register. Sometimes the credit department number would show up on the screen after we entered their number. At that point we called upstairs and a person actually talked to the customer.
In my corresponding high school class our teacher taught us the skill of counting back money. The cash register would tell us how much to give the customer back, but we were trained to count the money back to them. Suppose the amount was $6.65 and the customer gave me a twenty dollar bill. I would say 6.65 out of 20. They put their hand out and I counted back the change first. $6.75 as I handed them a dime, $7.00 with a quarter. Then the bills 8, 9, 10 as one by one I gave them dollar bills and finally and 20 as I finished the counting with a ten dollar bill. The customer was always glad to have the money counted back. It was a friendly service that took a little bit more time but made them feel like they were appreciated. It also left a good feeling with them that they got back what they were supposed to.
Customer service is a lost art today. Your change is normally slammed back to you. “Your change is $13.62 and clump you have all of it change and everything. Sometimes a machine will kick out your coin change while the cashier is hands you a pile of bills. I guess it’s right. Her cash register said so. Off you go with your purchases and a quite impersonal transaction. I went to an auto parts store last week. I was looking for one particular item. I walked up and down most of the aisles and not a soul was there to help me. The day before Easter I called the bank. I just wanted to see if they were open and for how long? Instead of a person who could answer my question in a second I got the dreaded machine. The first thing it wanted to know was my account number. When I didn’t comply it tried to get other information. I thought I would just not say anything and maybe the machine would switch me to a real person. Not so, the machine actually hung up on me. This is a sample of high tech customer service we receive today.
Many companies confuse customer service with high tech service today. As credit and debit cards abound these days it is so much easier to leave the cash behind. Swiping a card is so much easier and convenient. It’s also less painful. There is something about giving that money away even if you are receiving things. You think about how much you are spending. With a credit card you just swipe and presto. It is like in the casinos when you buy chips. You start spending chips and forget that those chips are actually money.
Credit cards offer convenience, simplicity, and speed. Other cards that we carry may help us with our memberships, health care, and discounts. I received a discount offer from a national convenience store that sells gas. If I didn’t use my card to pay for gas and paid cash I would get 5 cents per gallon off. I had to decline the offer because the bank was paying me 3% in rewards to use my credit card. At $4.00 per gallon that comes to 12 cents. Convenience and savings, isn’t that what it’s all about?
Years ago I wrote a poem called Bless Me Lord. It symbolizes the card swipe attitude we have in our world today. Now the symbolic card is used in our relationship with God. It is impersonal, speedy, and convenient. Somehow we are surprised when our card doesn’t work.
It used to be that the Easter holiday was talked about openly. We used the word Easter just as we used the word Christmas. “Have a nice Easter”, we offered. In the politically correct world that we live in now, someone might take offense to us wishing them a nice Easter. Someone may not like being told to have a nice Christmas. Now we have to say have a nice holiday or just have a nice weekend. Speaking of Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny seems to be okay as long as we don’t bring Jesus Christ into the equation. The rules have changed but are we better off?
The score was 19-14 in favor of the Chicago Bears on this September 12, 2010 game with the Detroit Lions. Shaun Hill, the Lions backup quarterback was leading his team down the field. With 31 seconds left and the ball on the Bears 25, Hill went back to throw. A looping pass was thrown into the end zone of which Calvin Johnson, the Lions wide receiver, out-jumped Zack Bowman of the Bears for an apparent touchdown! Johnson caught the ball came down rolled on the ground holding the ball in the air and appeared to be ready to spike the ball. At that moment the ball came out of his hands. Touchdown ruled one of the officials. The other official ruled incomplete pass. There was a controversy and the replay was reviewed. The announcer and the commentator were both sure that the decision would be overruled and the Lions would be ahead in mere moments. The decision came back, incomplete pass; and after 2 more plays the game was over. Apparently the controversy came about because of a new rule. Players used to be able to dive after balls and catch them in the air over the goal line for touchdowns. Many times the player would hit the ground and the ball was dislodged. Touchdown was the ruling because the ball was over the goal line and the player had possession. The new rule stated that the player had to complete the process and control the ball all the way through the play. Because of this new rule which was made because of these diving plays, Johnson’s touchdown was disallowed.
Recently we had our taxes prepared. As always there was an accounting of everything we did financially for the 2011 year. It is an interesting process. Sometimes things need to be accounted for that we had forgotten about. Other times we remember some item and hope that it doesn’t have a major effect. We do our best to have all of the information with us, so that the accounting goes easier. Our information was almost the same for 2010 as it was for 2011. However, we found out that there was a tax rules change which resulted in a big difference in a negative way to our bottom line.
I want to skip forward to another proposed rule change. It was suggested years ago in a song by former Beatle John Lennon. In his song Imagine, he suggested that we “imagine there’s no heaven.” He goes on…”It’s easy if you try, no hell below us, above us only sky…Imagine all the people, living for today.” The chorus to the song goes, “You may think that I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. I hope someday you’ll join us, and the world will be as one.” I would like to take a little bit of time to analyze the words he chose. “Imagine there’s no heaven” Okay if we have no heaven we have no God. Because the Bible tells us that God lives in Heaven. There is no Jesus because he is sitting on the right hand of God in heaven. There are no angels since they also reside in heaven. There is no eternal life since that was promised in a place called heaven. There is no salvation because if Jesus never existed he didn’t die for our sins. After we die it’s all over which is exactly what he suggested as we can see by the words “imagine all the people living for today”. There is no right or wrong because we have eliminated evil and good. We might as well eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we will die. Would you really want to live in a world where people were just living for today without any consequences for tomorrow?
I remember first hearing about the concept in a 9th grade biology class. The theory of evolution was being taught in the schools at that time even though some of us were opposed to it. I wrote an article in the schools newspaper against what was being taught. Obviously it didn’t help because the theory has continued in our schools. When asked for equal time for the creation theory the teacher just said, “well the creation theory is that God created everything.” Then he would start again on the evolution way of thinking. Sometimes so called truth was thrown into the equation. Well the earth is millions or billions of years old. Oh really? Who said? I googled how long man has been on earth and someone said scientists believed 90 million years. According to the Bible man has only been here around 6,000 years. Since living to 100 years is a long long time for any of us nobody can rightfully answer my question.
I’m going to present a case for creationism and I’ll ask you to imagine also. Imagine that you went into the woods and you noticed a beautiful painting. You don’t see any brushes or art tools around. What you can’t get your eyes off of, however, is how beautiful this painting is! It is a detailed picture of a sunset, or a brook, or the mountains — whatever you can imagine. You analyze the situation. You could conclude that somehow someway all of these colors and beautiful expressions of talent had miraculously just came about. Somehow maybe there was some paint around and the wind blew and amazingly it found it’s way on the canvas. That would take a lot more faith than anyone could truly have. Since only a fool would believe such a wild conclusion, you dismiss this thought in a second. How did this beautiful work get here? You can only come to one clear solution — Someone has taken a lot of time and carefully painted this picture.
The Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. People can find Christ today just like they did hundreds of years ago. We don’t have to worry about God changing the rules and making it harder. As for the painting, we all come across this painting every day of our lives. It is the beauty of the earth and all of the creatures on it. Can anyone truthfully say that you really believe that this beautiful world we live in just came together? I didn’t think so! My hope is that these words will strengthen your faith as you celebrate Easter. If you don’t celebrate Easter my prayer is my version of Lennon’s misguided song “I hope you all will join us, so we can live in Him as one!”
The stores know what they are doing. As I walk in I’m trained to look for a cart. Yes, the shopping cart which will make my experience so much easier. We are sold on the convenience. It is so much easier to use a cart than carry the groceries ourselves. The reasoning makes perfect sense for the customer right? It also makes perfect sense for the marketing of products. It has been proven over and over how much more people buy because they have a cart. You may go in with just a few things on your list, but if they can get you to push a cart extra things end up in it! For our convenience they make the cart nice and big too. They wouldn’t want us running out of room in our cart. They think of us by putting a rack down by the wheels. So convenient when we need an extra place for the pop or the beer. The cart also has a kids seat. How handy is that when you have a kid along?
You hear it all of the time in the store. It’s the voices of kids who may be riding in that little seat. The stores know what they are doing. By having that seat in the cart they have made a convenient way to add another customer. Although this customer usually doesn’t have any money, they are a big influence on extra things that get into that cart!
I’m walking through the store and I hear a familiar voice. It’s the voice of a kid and the words are pretty much the same. “Mom, mom”…sometimes the mom ignores them knowing from past experience what is going on. Other times the parent is patient..”no honey, we don’t want that today”. Other times there is a little anger “put that back now”! It is usually the same story. The kid has grabbed something going by or they are trying to reach it. If they can’t reach the item they start in with the “Mommy”. Sometimes the parents give in which is the marketers delight! Often there is a reaction to the no answer. That is when the tears start coming and the loud crying that echos throughout the store. Sometimes the parents discipline their children right in the store which leads to really loud crying.
One of the favorite things that kids want is candy! They must remember that great sweet taste from the past and hey, there it is again! Suddenly it is in the cart until it is discovered. Sometimes it may be a toy or any other object that catches their eye. Smart parents know when to say no. We have been around long enough to know what is good for them!
We could go in the opposite direction. “Sure honey, take all of the candy you want”! “Let me help you put it in the cart”. When they get older we can say “stay out as late as you want, it’s okay with me”! “Sure, you can do drugs, no problem”, “make sure you have a gun with you”. “I won’t be around for hours when you get home, so do whatever you want”. “Whatever you want you can have”. You tell me, which parent loves their kids more? Is it the one that gives them all that they want and doesn’t care what they do?
I’m sure that if you are a responsible loving parent you can see my points. You may even wonder why I am bringing up such obvious things. Yet, there are so many of us that beg God for things and wonder why he doesn’t give them to us. James 4:3 says “When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with the wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your own pleasures. Kind of sounds like that kid in the grocery store doesn’t it?
Is there someone in your life who comes around only when they need something? Hello, Joe How are you? It has been a long time! What’s new? “I was hoping you could help me out”, Joe begins. Oh no, what now?, you think. As Joe continues about the mess he is in and invariably asks you for money or some other favor it gets annoying. You start thinking, this guy only wants to use me and doesn’t care about me at all, except when he needs something.
Sometimes we get into this lottery like prayer. Lord bless me with this or that. We need to realize that living every day is a blessing! Do you have a roof over your head? Do you have enough food and clothing? I’m sure that God looks down and says like a father to his kid “No, you don’t need that today”. Matthew Chapter 6 verse 33 states “Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all of these things will be given to you as well.”
My former pastor had a beautiful story that illustrated how God thinks. He had a daughter and she would call him. “Daddy”, she would say, “I just called to tell you how much I love you”. “I want you to know that I am so blessed to have you and mom for parents. I am so thankful that you have always looked out for what was best for me! I am so blessed”. When he got off of the phone, he would invariably ask his wife, “Is there anything that she needs?” I can assure you that your heavenly father feels the same way. When you come to him and tell him how much you love him and mean it there is not a good thing he wouldn’t give you. He looks at the heart and the motives. He knows when you are sincere.
So my question to you today is Who is God to you? Is he that father in the sky who you expect to give you whatever you want? Or is he the loving father who says no sometimes because he knows what is good for you? Are you someone who only comes around when you need something? Or do you make it a point to enter his presence just to say I love you?

Homeopathic medicine, like naturopathic medicine, is based on the philosophy that the body has the innate ability to heal itself. Infinitesimal amounts of substances derived from plant, mineral and animal sources are used to stimulate that healing ability. A remedy is chosen based on the totality of each person�s symptom picture, taking into account physical, mental, emotional and spiritual factors. A very detailed history is taken on the first visit to gather as much information as possible. These individual characteristics make it possible to prescribe exactly the correct substance for that person. It is important to emphasize that a remedy is not prescribed for asthma or anxiety or eczema or depression. It is prescribed for the person with those conditions. Only one remedy is prescribed, which will address all of that person�s concerns, rather than prescribing something different for each complaint.
The remedy is called the 'simillimum' because it most matches the symptom picture of the person. In fact, homeopathy, which means 'the study of similars' is based on a philosophy of 'like cures like'. In other words, a substance that produces symptoms in a healthy person may be used to treat those same symptoms in a sick person.
Another important feature of homeopathic remedies is that they are administered in very dilute forms, thus having an energetic rather than a pharmacological effect. This allows them to act very deeply and without interaction with other medications.
Homeopathy is medicine that is safe, effective and inexpensive. It can be used safely in pregnant women, infants, children, pets, the elderly and those who are sensitive to any substance they ingest. Homeopathy acts gently and deeply to restore balance in all areas that may be out of balance, and has the potential to effect a deep and powerful cure.

These are two of the smaller basins on the planet. It would take at least eight of these maps to reproduce the Highlands on this scale.
These basins are one to a geologist. Norbin is not very deep for this latitude and for that reason is somewhat seasonal. All of the Norbin basin gets frost in the winter and a lot of it gets it in the summer also. The Kshoned basin is somewhat lower but frost is possible in the winter in some areas. This meant that before the Energy Age most settlement was in the lower Kshoned valley where onions could be grown.
The prairies at higher altitudes are home to large herds of grazers and the carnivores that go with them. The theirops to the north of the basin are particularly large and vicious. The winter darks are bitter cold on the prairies and there are no permanent human settlements. The Kshoned basin has extensive rain forests along the shore of the Tuidain swamp today, but that area was much drier before the wildhull covered the sea. There are hyadunes and blike (a carnivorous chuff) in those forests.
The northern third of the Kshoned basin is a seasonal high desert with some tundra in the west and far north. The temperature extremes make it impractical for human habitation. There are lots of scamps in the region however and a type of mlak that is adapted to the extreme cold of the tundra winter dark.
The Kshoned River would be one of the longest on Earth and third longest on Centorin, but it does not make the top twenty five on Kassidor. It's watershed is nearly the whole of both basins and well into the Yclel-vi.
The basins are fertile at all altitudes, and the population is dense. They are small as basins go, about the size of India and Mexico, and there is a little over a billion people between them. The Norbin basin is rolling hills, The Kshoned is a little lower and flatter except for the mountains near the coast.
Only along the lower Kshoned River is heat really a problem. It is not life threatening if one has access to water and as the region is a rain forest, it is likely. The river is free of really dangerous predators, but there are a few spheelunges that get cranky enough to take humans as prey, so three or four are lost per year.
In the jungle-clad mountains of the coast it gets hot closer to the Tuidain, but in most parts of those hills, the climate is rather pleasant, if a trifle wet. The mountains are not particularly high and do not cut the basin off from moisture from the Tuidain. A low-level air current is sucked up the basin by the winds off the very steep rise of the Norbin Mountains that are just inside the North Durlegar Waste.
This basin was largely unsettled until modern times because the climate will not allow onions. Until then it was the hinterland of the Kshoned basin. Kassidorians who know of this basin know it as the site of the mad industrialists who split with the founders of the Kassikan.
Norbin was one of the first basins settled by the Highland Elves. The founders of the city had a falling out with leaders of the Kassikan very soon after the rediscovery of the cure for aging. In 651bc they reached the site of the original city and began the foundations of a dam and university of their own. The population of the region was light at the time. They brought the hardy onion with them, so population was still concentrated in the lower basin.
The founders planned on a single-city basin from the beginning and strove to keep production in their own factories ahead of demand as the basin was settled. From the beginning selling products down the river into the Kshoned basin was important in Norbin's economy.
The pioneers who came to this land settled the midlands to the south of the city. Their crops all float down the Kshoned or it's tributaries to the city. There are freezes every winter in this region, but the earliest hardy onions were able to live there. For most of the light the climate is nice. Only summer Afternoondays are actually hot. Relative prosperity was common, except for one issue.
The founders of Norbin thought the cure for aging should be reserved for the affluent and conspired to keep it's cost above market rates. That only worked for a few generations while the geneticists of the Kshoned Basin caught up and under bid them. Still, there was some trouble about it in Norbin and several businesses were burned and two of the founders of the city were assassinated within six Earth years of each other. There are still a very few of the snootiest in town who have some vestige of that belief.
The founder's plan of keeping it a one-city basin failed before the Instinct arrived. The first other big city to develop was Tarsitar (Citything City), and within a century it was larger than the original Norbin. Dinreaal and Nrejda are agricultural centers, but Tarsitar and Yoonasil had water power of their own and were soon rivaling Norbin in industrial output. The result of this was that in the mid to late forties the basin had the lowest priced consumer goods on the planet.
Most of the competition came from other dams and locks just a few miles upstream or downstream of Norbin itself. Each of these cities had it's own business council and each competed directly with Norbin for the trade along the river. Norbin itself was in danger of becoming the university town in the area while those educated in the university were moving to other cities just a day's travel away.
Norbin continued to be the cultural center, because of the university and because of the old neighborhoods that had been built centuries before the newer cities up and down the river. Until the Instinct, Norbin continued to have the largest military and used military action twice during the forties on the factories of rivals that they alleged had broken treaties. There were records burned in several cities, most in Norbin itself, so knowing the truth of these events is difficult.
From the arrival of the Instinct on, relations with the Highlands have improved and the city of Yclel-vi grew up on the trek between the two basins. The tube that has recently reached Kugenzglaw is planned to reach Yclel-vi, Norbin and even Kshoned within the next century. For now it is three local years on river boats and coaches.
Norbin became the overwhelmingly largest city in the basin (but still not as big as Kshoned) once again when the urban areas of all the cities along the Kshoned River breaks merged so it is one contiguous city. It took two more Kassidorian centuries, from 1271ad to 1715ad, for them to adopt a unified merchants code.
Since 2000ad there is very little evidence of the old animosities in the urban area. It has become a lot like the Highlands in modern times, but not a copy. Much more different from the Yakhan than Yclel-vi or Korsto.
The Norbin Basin never lost its Highland Elf heritage completely. They have tried to shake it and a few traditions of their own have developed, but it will not seem unfamiliar to you. You will know you've passed from the Yclel-vi basin to the Norbin basin when you get to Tarsitar and see it on the map. You might notice a difference in the accent in the city of Tarsitar itself.
Most of the land is covered with smallholds of an acre or less. In the countryside most are living in hangleaves and they keep them trimmed back almost as much as in the Bordzvek Basin. Few live underground in the Norbin countryside. There are villages every mile or two and small cities every twenty five to fifty and larger cites every few hundred. Kedas are common and the wagons are built the same way as in the Highlands, with planks but factory made wheels, bearings and fittings. The coaches are closed, unlike the Highlands, and many run thru the dark, unlike the Highlands.
You'll find a lot of the same things on the menu, but not as much diddle as you see all over the Highlands. The breads are hearty and they make sandwiches even bigger than Bordzvek. Cold cuts are an art form and scientists at universities do research into developing ever tastier and safer brines. Even so, some of the same eatery franchises from the Yakhan are found in some places.
Data service is available in almost every village and screens are available in every village, sometimes more than one. Small cities have every modern convenience except private tube stations.
The inns are clean and comfortable, but may be a little rowdy in the countryside. They are often where the locals come to drink, people know everyone and they drink as much ale as yaag. They will include you if you let them. Most people have heard of Centorin, but some might not be sure they believe in it.
A custom many find interesting is that the local women may entertain the local men by undressing to the tune of whatever music is playing, usually at an outdoor plaza near any convenient body of water. Occasionally a man will undress on the stage to entertain the women, but it's about five sixth's female. It's a lot like striptease except they're not employees, there's no g-strings, they don't take money and they usually know everyone watching. This is usually about 'who's picking me for the sleep' but sometimes she's just doing it for pure entertainment of the viewers. When the girl is especially desirable it gets rowdy. The ones that leave the room quiet are still from a culture that has used genetic control to enhance their beauty for four thousand years.
There's great hunting on the prairie a few weeks north of the city. There are safaris you can get on, as anywhere on Kassidor don't go out alone or without a guide. Most here will use supply wagons and keda teams. They will make sure you are competent with any weapon you bring before they will let you join.
Playing mish is more of a big deal than in the Highlands. One's racquet is a status symbol, climbing the ranks is a big deal for a lot of the population. Like all Elves, men and women compete on the same leagues. There are professional players and their matches draw thousands. The atmosphere is somewhat refined, and the fans seldom get rowdy. People mingle and there are sex rooms under the grandstands.
The atmosphere of privilege and status lingers among some of the population, but even with Centorin money, you won't be warmly welcomed among them. Most of them are the original founders and settlers. They have lost control of the city and its merchant's council, but they continue to enjoy outrageous wealth and the trappings that go with it. Most of them live in closed communities of imposing stonework in the old city. You may see their fancy carriages and entourages from time to time.
They are disdained by the remainder of the population, and none of the class divisions remain among the vast majority of the population. In fact many go out of their way to demonstrate that they are not class conscious when in the presence of foreigners. There is a bit of cultural shame over the events of the basin's history.
This is often called the women's basin, though the culture is such that Centorin women may be put off by it. Today it exists somewhat in the shadow of the Norbin basin though they are nearly the same size and the population of the city of Kshoned is considerably larger.
In prehistoric times there was a population here that fossil evidence indicates was of the Yondurian race. They did not develop a high civilization, but knew agriculture and built villages of worked stone at least as far back as 10,000bc. They settled mainly in the lower river valley. The climate of the time was a few degrees cooler and that was the only place onions could be grown at all during prehistoric times.
This basin, as the Norbin basin, was passed by during the Energy Age. There can be no doubt that explorers knew of it, but no trackway was built into the area and no military outposts were built here. There seems to be no better reason for it than the commander of the region didn't want to bother. It is suspected there were personal issues involved, but of course no written record remains of that. The extermination of tallgrains during the fall had an effect on the area anyway, starvation was rampant and the culture deteriorated to nearly the paleolithic level before recovering.
In the Troubled Times this area was invaded by the Fmak. While the invasion of the Ydlontrostl basin found mainly empty space and more or less peaceful colonization was set up, and the invasion of the Edniktar basin brought little resistance, the struggle to conquer the Kshoned basin was long and bloody. The major campaign consumed four generations of Fmak emperors and cost over five million lives. More lives were lost than in the Wars of Magic, a much larger area was involved and the time scale was hundreds of times longer. Because this area has not contributed to Elven folklore, nor had a gifted chronicler to tell the story, the struggle is not as well known.
The Fmak were especially brutal in imposing their rule on this area, and very determined to alter the culture to bring it in line with the Fmak way of life. This was particularly intensive regarding the role of women. In the Fmak culture of the time, women were domestic animals, beasts of burden with no rights and lives of slavery and childbirth. Few lived to old age. Most were in large harems of the dominant males.
The Yondurian race was second only to the Elves in the equality of their women in ancient times. The dimorphism in size and strength was not as great as in the Fmak race. The greater size and strength of the local women made subduing them a feat of great status for a Fmak chieftain and the colonial forces set about it with a vengeance.
Nearly all the local men were eventually exterminated and the women subjected to brutal treatment in the harems of the invader. Their children were raised as Fmak, and any males were sent back to the motherland. This condition went on for generations.
Those that escaped lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers in the jungles. If they settled anywhere they would be found, but as nomads they could stay ahead of Fmak forces. With nearly 200,000 square miles to hide in, few were found. So many men were lost in battle that women were the majority of the population, and thus the majority in these tribes of fugitives in the jungles.
It is not known if the Fmak rulers became soft. The legends of the time say they did not, but the events that followed seem a bit improbable without that. By this time the population was as much Fmak as Yondurian genetically, which meant the women should have been somewhat slight and delicate.
The legend of Shiloah, liberator of the Kshoned basin, says that she killed dozens of Fmak soldiers single handedly in a single sleep and inspired the remainder of the population to rise up and throw off the invader. Pictures of her show her as a mighty warrior with wild hair, muscular arms, shining armor and a broadsword. Most history scholars rejected this tale as being grossly embellished, but in the 51st century (1302ad) a skeleton was exhumed from the ruins of an ancient temple of a female who stood over six feet tall, was heavily muscled and lived around 1200bc, about the right time frame for these events. Such a giantess would have been more than a match for the Fmak soldiers of the time if properly trained and armed.
The records in the Fmak empire state that the colony was lost due to incompetent leadership and an invading army of Trolls. It is genetically possible for a Troll woman to grow to that size and strength at the time. However, no other Troll remains have been discovered in the entire Kshoned and Norbin basins until modern times.
After that, the population was in serious trouble because of lack of males. We can only assume that what males there were, were kept very busy, because the population soon recovered. From then until the modern age, women had the upper hand in the basin. All rulers were female until governments dissipated. The rules of inheritance became matriarchal. All property was owned by women.
The culture has eerie echos of that of cats. The clans were run by sisterhoods, males came and went at their whim. The lower ranking members of the clan were field workers and servants. Males could rise as high as overseer if they pleased one or more of the sisters well enough. Males often left the house to wander where they might meet a woman of a clan and apply to be taken in. There were elaborate courtship rituals and labors they were put thru, many of them extremely sexual. A couple stories of this age have made it into underground literature.
During the mid to late Troubled Times, (1000bc - 0) the merchants of Kshoned built large sailing ships and while the Fmak went into decline, Kshoned was the major power center on the Tuidain Sea. The ships were large square riggers and could make the crossing to Ydlontrostl in as little as three weeks. The best lakerunners in the Highlands today can only cut one week off of the time to go that distance.
When the modern age arrived, equality was restored, but the culture that has developed is still female centric and to some extent has stayed that way into the present age. Now that there is no age, the same women from the end of the Troubled Times run most clans and the same women run most companies.
This has lead to some stagnation. In recent times the industries of Norbin have dominated those of Kshoned. Though their music is different, most gear is from Norbin. The material standard of living is not as high in this basin as in Norbin's. That is softened quite a bit because of the clan living.
Today almost all cultures of Kassidor have complete sexual equality. There is still some vestige of male dominance in the Lumpral and Fmak basins and among the Goblins, but it cannot be enforced except by social pressure. In the Kshoned basin today there is nominal equality, and no real way to enforce female dominance. In spite of that, a lot of the old culture lives on. Most property is still owned by women. Women tend to run most businesses. They are the leading people in the arts, science and even sports.
The racial type has been more heavily modified by genetic science than in most basins, sometimes into wildly exotic forms. In parts of the culture, there is a heavy preponderance of females in the population because the science to select the sex of offspring is available and widely used. In those sub-cultures, there is usually one male per clan estate. Many, but not the majority, of women today try to model themselves after Shiloah. Women in this culture will generally not be attracted to men who are bigger or stronger than they are. Males who are not comfortable being dainty and cute usually wind up leaving the basin. In the mainstream of the city itself, the difference is slight and both sexes are of pretty much equal stature.
The average person in the basin today, if you can find such, is light skinned with dark hair that is not as curly as Yondurians. Though the women are usually stronger, they are not unattractive with good figures and pretty faces with sensuous lips and large dark eyes. The males are extremely similar with thicker waists and male genitals. Both sexes have soft, smooth skin that is a dusky off-white. Both sexes have the size and strength of Troll women. Their clothing is as flamboyant as in Yondure but of different style. Men wear tail coats and hats except when working at manual labor or on midsummer Afternoondays when it is too hot. Women wear elaborate gowns of most unusual cut.
In the countryside, people tend to live in groups on large estates. Agriculture is efficient and productive. The cities have a lot of light industry, but the industrial might of Norbin has overtaken most of the heavy industry in the basin.
The material standard of living is only slightly above the Kassidorian average, but income distribution is quite uneven. Most of the very poor are urban, but most of the very wealthy are urban also. Gas lanterns are common among the affluent. Plumbing is comfortable for almost everyone, but the homes of the poor may have nothing but an all-in-one as in the poorer cities of the planet. Most housing is now grown using archwood, but a lot of stone built structures still survive.
Cuisine is heavy on casseroles, cream sauces, curries and all manner of extensively prepared dishes. Because the climate is quite seasonal, menus are quite seasonal also. Yaag is not as strong as in the average basin. Green's are available, but enhanced yaag is just about unknown. Boost and other accelerants are pretty common. Beer is light but distilled alcohol is an art form exceeded only in Dos.
The most unique thing about the culture is that the vulva is to this culture what the penis is to Borlunth. They are displayed proudly and often, usually in the aroused state. Genetic enhancements are very common and some of them are extreme, as in wrap-the-male's-whole-pelvis extreme. Showing them off is not done in rowdy bars as the penis is in Borlunth, but in stylish fashion shows and judged competitions with hushed commentary and photographers. High fashion gowns always show them and playing in them is de-rigeur at most social events.
So, if you are into that, Kshoned is the place to go. The clubs in the canyons of the Yakhan don't even come close (but are years closer). You almost can't meet a companion in this basin without pleasing her lips. If you are not into that, you'll probably sleep alone while you are here.
Other than that quirk, travel is comfortable in the basin. The scenery along the Tuidain slope has an eerie beauty, but the heat can get oppressive on summer Afternoondays. To the north there are great limestone cliffs and the largest natural cave systems on Kassidor, with hundreds of miles of galleries. There are some with marked trails, but you have to bring your own lantern. The only big game hunting in the basin is to the west along the Tuidain, the heat can be too much for a normal person and the danger is not worth the prize. There are few guides going into the area and any you find will be women who will demand sexual favors as part of the bargain.
The city of Kshoned is over fifty million people. It is not spread and open like Norbin, but concentrated like Zhlindu. The river is slow down here, but some intrusive rocks give a little elevation, and like Zhlindu, the elevation is welcome on summer Afternoondays. Unlike Zhlindu, there are fourteen hills that the Kshoned winds thru with forty one locks linking the harbors. Unlike Zhlindu, the city is ancient. The halfway point of settlement here is when the Fmak first arrived around 2300bc.
There are ruins under everything, and older ones under that. Like in Borlunth, the poor dig them out. Also like Borlunth, there are mammoth archwood towers above them today. The climate is nothing like Borlunth, Kshoned is only two miles below sea level, the sky is blue and Dawnsleep can be quite brisk. The street pattern of Kshoned is even more haphazard than Borlunth, partly because of the rugged little hills it's built on. Along all the docks and waterways there are multiple levels of streets with cargo at the bottom, streetcars next and two or three levels of pedestrian. They are often the first third, fourth and tenth floors. There are no streets fifty stories up like the Yakhan, Bordzvek, the Trenst Ring or Zhlindu.
The average person lives in a clan, the clan will usually own a single archwood. The common areas will be very ornate and plush. The leading members have lavish chambers, but everyone else has a small room and shares a bath. Clans may be together for dozens of generations and some members are there by 'marriage' though there is really no such thing. The clan usually has a business and it's usually in the lower floors of the same archwood. About half the clan members work in their own business and half as hired hands in another. The more urban the area, the larger the clan and the bigger the archwood holding them.
The members of the clan may not be closely related, if it wasn't for that, there could be a dangerous amount of incest going on within many of them. On average, one in ten sex acts performed in the city of Kshoned is between members of different clans, nine of ten are performed between members of the same clan. That still leaves over two million women looking for someone outside their clan on the average evening.
They are found at millions of little cultural events. Kshoned has managed to make everything into an art form and have shows of it. Anything a human can do can be considered performance and if refreshments are served, it might draw a crowd. There are real musicians, though the music tends to sound like Broadway and movie music meets Spanish opera. Marching bands and animal shows draw crowds, as do book signings and historical lectures. Poetry readings get banners hung from balconies and book 3000 seat halls.
Whatever the occasion, there are buffet tables, casks, cups for rent or sale. There will be little quiet spots where one can still see or hear the 'attraction' but it will not intrude. People do most of their mingling at the buffet table and there needs to be a whole separate guide published detailing what foods she talks about and what that means between you. Of course people read those books and change their behavior to thwart those who thought they were in the know. Just try and look charming and she'll bring you to her table and then home.
The only disadvantage to going home with her is she probably shares a bathroom with three other clan members and one current live-in. There's no telling how they get along. Usually fine with normal sisterly kidding and friction, but sometimes it can get uncomfortable. If she's open to staying with you at the inn, her place might be a horror story full of whining, bawling and slamming doors.
Getting around the city can be a pain. It's hard to find a decent map, everything curves around. You have to change streetcars more often than in crossing the New Midlands and a lot of times once you get to the part of the city you're looking for you'll find the names you were given aren't used any more.
There is no talk of a tube system in Kshoned. Different parts of the city want to be hard to get to for all but the produce farmers. It is second only to Lumpral in social fragmentation. The people of the area know it is all one city, but they are partial to their part of it and often go to events to applaud politely for their neighborhood smiling team.

In a cross between urban and natural scenery, where there are infinite possibilities for variations created by pairing these two opposites, the intervention of light, projecting a play of shadows and reflections, transform regular architecture into irregular elements. Exquisite embroideries that, over time, have characterised the Armani image, are transformed into textures that are now seen in the home collection. Hence a sophisticated tailored design is created, giving each piece a new type of classical air.
A perfect fusion of Armani fashion aesthetic and philosophy of decor, the Armani/Casa exclusive textiles by Rubelli collection speaks of the deep bond between fashion and furniture. The collection features textures inspired by exquisite embroideries that characterised the designer’s style. A few stronger colours such as ruby red, jade green and sapphire blue pair with more subdued smoky gold and smoky grey. Dreamy Japanese landscapes decorate the collection, based on the design of a fabric from the Rubelli archive.

JMSC students faced challenges including keeping up with Aung San Suu Kyi during a walkabout, audio dubbing the voice of Hong Kong Chief Executive CY Leung, and paragliding high above a valley in Nepal during their winter internship placements this year.
Over 50 Master of Journalism (MJ) students completed workplace internships with leading media organisations during the winter break in their studies.
Aung San Suu Kyi appearing in public for the first time after the recent elections in Myanmar, taken by Shen Zhefan during his internship in the country.
In addition to placements at companies including CNN, Forbes, Thomson Reuters and The Financial Times in Hong Kong and mainland China, this year students also joined media organisations in Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar.
Ariel Zhong Wenxin and Harry Shen Zhefan undertook their internships at Mizzima, Myanmar, where assignments included covering Aung San Suu Kyi’s first public appearance after the recent elections, and the opening of the Yangon Stock Exchange.
Shen Zhefan said: ‘At Mizzima, interns get the same opportunities and practice as reporters. The editors encouraged us to cover whichever stories we were interested in, and gave us their contacts, sources and suggestions. Very helpful.’
Vicky Liang Siran and Xu Xiaotong spent a month at the Nepali Times. They reported on Chinese tourists making the dangerous journey along the trans-Himalayan road into Nepal, and an abandoned town in the wake of last year’s earthquake. They also experienced paragliding for another assignment, and visited the printing office to see the next edition of the newspaper coming off the press.
Other students stayed in Hong Kong for their internships but found their experiences nonetheless rewarding.
Coming from a non-journalistic background in fashion, Peg-Yoc Hui Valdez relished the chance to gain experience of working in a newsroom for the first time at Forbes: ‘It has been fun to be part of the work that goes behind putting together a Forbes Billionaires list. I’ve worked very closely with the Asia Online Editor, who has given me a lot of knowledge in very little time.’
Interning with CNN, Kevin Lui got hands-on experience with online journalism and also television news production as he shadowed the team that produces News Stream. His web reports included the latest toy trends at HK’s annual Toys and Games Fair and a story about the world’s most photogenic potato.
Kevin was also asked to do the audio dubbing for the English translation of HK leader CY Leung’s speech in this report about local film ‘Ten Years’.
Learning how to tackle China’s Great Firewall was a key challenge for students who crossed the border to join mainland news organisations.
The LA Times’ office in Beijing, Caixin Media and travel website GoKunming were amongst the destinations in China this year, with students noting the importance of being able to tailor reports to survive censorship by authorities in the country.
This theme was also highlighted by students who interned at those Hong Kong-based media organisations which are increasingly targeting mainland audiences with their Chinese-language reporting.
Interns with companies such as Initium Media and Phoenix TV explained how they quickly began to understand the importance of knowing not just the news value of a story in China, but also the ‘sensitivity value’. Another quipped: ‘Being blocked is an honour!’
The JMSC has an extensive internship network with leading international media organisations and the majority of MJ students complete internships as part of the programme, giving them an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge they have developed in the classroom.

Okay, obviously the French impressionist painter but we’re going more of the urban dictionary route here. You know. The Clueless definition.
To directly quote Cher, it’s something that “from far away [looks] okay, but up close it’s a big old mess”.
So like Cher with Tai, I put them in a pretty new pistachio-infused dress, added a few drops of lemon, and all of a sudden they’re getting catcalled left and right.
The true test, of course, is that first bite and let me tell you, something magical happens when you ground up pistachios to a fine powder and throw them into the corn muffin mix. All of a sudden what was once a plain Jane breakfast good is now a total Betty. Decadent, rich, and absolutely worthy of your morning indulgence. Dare I say, even the girls of Beverly Hills High School would approve.
Two years ago…Unstuffed Cabbage with Chickpeas, Zucchini, Swiss Chard and Bulgur, Whole Wheat Zucchini Chocolate Chip Banana Bread
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add in the greek yogurt, lemon juice, lemon zest, and butter. Whisk until combined. Set aside.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, pulverized pistachios, salt and baking powder. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients into it. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined.
Fill each muffin cup about ¾ full. Sprinkle the tops with the coarsely chopped pistachios. Tap the bottom of the pan against a flat surface (counter or table) to make sure the batter is level and there are no air pockets. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Let cool for 10-15 minutes before removing from tin.
I adore pistachios – love the addition of them to these cornmeal muffins! Any chance you could ship one really quickly to Boston? It’s time for breakfast 🙂
These really do sound amazing Joanne! I love that the recipe is so healthy and I wonder how the addition of pistachios taste?! Beautiful photos as well!
These muffins are calling my name! Lemon, cornmeal, and pistachio all sound so delightful together. Thanks for the recipe!
Yum. I actually “made” cornbread last night (from the TJ’s mix). I’ve definitely had a corn muffin in my day that was dry and crumbly so I can see where you’re coming from. Love your fancy update though!
I’ve been looking for a good corn muffin recipe for a LONG time – i totally agree they are totally lackluster, or worse, dry. Ick ALLL OVER. these look lovely though, and, honestly, doesnt a bi of lemon make everything a little better?
Pistachios do make everything more festive, don’t they. I actually like regular plain old corn muffins – something about the grainy texture appeals to me. Don’t ask.
i have never had cornmeal muffins before but anything with pistachio will be good 🙂 love your references:)
I love these light, lemony muffins! The saltiness of the pistachios must really bring out the sweetness, too! Yummy.
I’d definitely take this dressed up version over the regular and pistachios just happen to be my favorite!!
I just watched Clueless again recently and laughed so hard all over again. Now if I would have had THESE beauties to munch on while watching it, that would have been way cooler!
These guys sounds totally delightful! I will admit that I’ve never thought to combine pistachios with corn in any capacity, but now? I MUST HAVE IT. 🙂
I’ve had cornbread on the brain lately, so I’m all over your sweet and breakfast-appropriate version here! I wouldn’t have thought of adding pistachios into the equation, but now that I see it, it makes perfectly delicious sense. Since my mom loves cornbread and my dad loves pistachios, I think the whole family might even be able to enjoy this one.
Oh my gosh, I love that movie and all your references to it (totally forgot about “total Betty!”) made me so nostalgic. I just sold my copy of the DVD at our garage sale but I suppose it’s probably available on Netflix if I get really sentimental about it. haha! You certainly dressed these muffins up proper girl!
These are great looking muffins. What a great combo, pistachios and cornmeal, who would have thought!!
What lovely looking muffins. I think muffins made with yoghurt have great texture and are always moist xx
I actually don’t think I’ve ever had cornmeal muffins! I’m not sure if they’re just not very big in Australia or if I’ve been living under a rock…but I definitely want to try your version.
Love this updated version of a corn muffin. Will definitely try these out and exclaim “Ugh, as if!” while eating to channel my inner Cher.
yes, ohyesyesysyes. I’ve been mildly obsessed with pistachios lately, dreaming up some sort of pistachio-cardamom ice cream blend. THIS recipe with lemon and cornmeal, I’m adding it to my list for sure!!
As IF I could pass this one by! Coincidently, Clueless was on MTV this morning so obviously it was the background to my entire morning, and I’m loving how you Cher’d this one up. These look fantastic!
These look amazing. I am sitting here without breakfast in front of me and wish these would magically appear!
Grinding some of the pistachios sounds like a great addition! I would happily eat one of these for breakfast! Plus, I just watched Clueless this morning 🙂 Never get tired of that movie.
I have never tried anything cornmeal before. I couldn’t find it for the longest time in grocery stores. Now that I have, I would definitely want to try this!
These muffins look great, I’d love to have one for breakfast! Also I love Clueless, a big part of my youth! 🙂
Lemon and pistachio in a corn muffin sounds divine! And you made it beautifully Joanne. Well done! 🙂
Oh my! How lovely! The combinations that come out of your recipes have just the right amount of familiar feeling, but are so new and innovative. You have such a fresh voice for food – love it!
oh girl, you know how I am with anything involving lemons. and adding pistachios to the mix? making these asap!
As I browsed through your past week’s worth of recipes my other favorite in the zucchini and basil recipe. I should be having baby zucchini growing soon and with fresh basil from my herb pots these will be served here soon.
I’m probably in the minority, but I love a plain old corn muffin 🙂 We eat them a ton (probably too much) in the colder months! That said, your upgrade looks wonderful!!
Haha, I actually really like corn muffins! But I do agree that there are lots of bad ones out there. I can only imagine that the pistachio addition would make them even better!
ha ha ha ha! I just watched Clueless a couple of weeks ago (it was on tv)…so I knew immediately what you meant. I gotta say, these look amazing…and sound even better!
I’ve seen that movie like a hundred times so I know exactly what your talking about! Such a perfect comparison. These rock! As far as corn muffins go these put all others to shame.
What a great make over you’ve done. I love your version of lemon pistachio cornmeal muffins! I don’t make corn muffins often, but when I do, I know I want to make your recipe for sure. 😉
I have everything to make these right now except for pistachios. This needs to change immediately, they look so good!
I’ve just spent the last 10 minutes reading Clueless quotes because of your post 🙂 those look great – Cher would so choose something pistachio-coloured.
I love your addition of lemon, greek yogurt and ground up pistachios to these muffins! I haven’t been much a fan of corn meal muffins, or bread, but this recipe definitely makes cornmeal appealing! yum!
Oh holy cow, you’re killing me with these. Lemon poppyseed is one of my favourite muffin flavours, cornbread muffins are a close second, and I love all things pistachio. You’ve managed to combine all three!

And being joined by my helpful nephew Callum, I have all the ingredients for the sweetest Valentine’s Day EVER!!
I’ve been planning this ever since my Random Act of Christmas Kindness. One of my favourite kindness acts so far, I loved choosing what to put inside my festive goodie bags and it gave me such pleasure leaving them on car windscreens at my doctor’s surgery.
But most of all I was incredibly moved by a response I received from a lovely lady who received one of these bags (see the comments section if you’d like to read it).
And I’m over-the-moon that my seven-year-old nephew Callum wants to help me. I love what a big heart he has and how his teacher is always commenting on how kind and helpful he is.
So earlier this morning we spread our loot across my bed, and had fun packing our 20 kindness goodie bags.
We wrote kindness messages on my Kindness Cards. Callum carefully writing: You are amazing, and adding his name and age on a few. So sweet. And we also included a ‘You Are Loved’ card I’d made using one of my favourite nature photos I took last year, with a little explanation about our Random Act of Kindness on the reverse.
Although it was freezing, our hearts were warmed as together we placed our kindness bags on the car windscreens.
We even had the chance to give someone one of our kindness bags face-to-face: we spotted a lady heading into the hospital and ran across to hand-deliver a goodie bag. She seemed really happy to receive it.
We hope that when the owner/s returned to their cars after their appointment or visit or work-shift, they will be surprised.
And we really hope our little act of kindness will make a few people smile and feel happy, especially on this love-filled day.
Last week, I told the Nottingham Post about our little Valentine’s adventure, and we were interviewed and snapped by our city’s newspaper while in the midst of our good deed. Once the feature goes out, I will post the link here:
What really warms my heart is that Callum wants to take a kindness goodie bag with him into school next week for his ‘show and tell’. My heart is so happy to think that this small act of kindness may help inspire this younger generation to continue the ripple effect of kindness.
Now back home, I’m shaking with exhaustion and about to switch-off and have a long soak in a yummy Epsom salt bath.
So with this in mind, my happy for today is being kind by leaving love-filled goodie bags on car windscreens in the hospital car park.
ps if you have received one of our Valentine’s Day Kindness Goodie Bags, we’d really LOVE to hear from you in the comments below. If you’d prefer me not to publish your comment on the blog, please let me know.

Yay to Callum getting involved! How great it will ripple out in show & tell too. Well done to you both, the smiles you created today will be felt for a long time xॐx
He was, and is, such a little superstar ☆ It made the kindness so much sweeter to have him helping Xxx
Each season Nails Inc do a fabulous job at creating great colours that match the trends and sometimes a stand out nail colour can make a huge difference with the way your outfit will look. Clockwise from the top are: Covent Garden Place, New Oxford Street, Baker Street and St Johns Wood. I’m absolutely loving Covent Garden Place right now, I’m back into my bright nail colours after the gloomy weather London has had recently, it’s nice to have a pop of colour. Hop over to my Instagram if you want to see the shade on my nails @MakeupLoveerBlog. The Gel Effect range is one of my favourite polish ranges, you get such a glossy and long lasting finish but it also conceals any imperfections that your nails might have it really plump’s up the nail. I can see myself wearing all three colours, though Covent Garden Place and Baker Street are my favourite out of them all. You can’t beat a bright pop of pink or a shocking blue to transform a plain outfit. St Johns Wood is part of Nails Inc’s newer line NailKale which is formulated with ‘supercharged kale extract‘ to deeply nourish and protect the nail from any breakage and splitting. Kale is known for containing high amount of vitamins A, C and K which stimulate advanced keratin production, that will help to make nails stronger, brighter and more nourished. NailKale is a great range if you want to have fashion forward colours on your nails whilst also still treating them, to ensure you have strong and healthy nails.

When a person continues to use/abuse alcohol or other drugs regardless of negative behaviors this person is most likely in need of assistance as is his family.
Inpatient treatment, provided in special units of hospitals or medical clinics, detoxification and rehabilitation services. Often times, this form of treatment is used for the assessment process.
Residential programs provide a living environment with treatment services. Several models of residential treatment exist. Treatment is residential programs last from one month, to one year and possibly more.
Partial hospitalization or day treatment programs may be provided in hospitals or free standing clinics. In these programs, the person attends treatment for to 8 hours per day but lives at home. These programs typically last 3 months and work best for people who have a stable, supportive home environment with family members willing to be a part of the treatment regimen.
Outpatient and intensive outpatient programs provide treatment at a program site but the person lives elsewhere (usually at home). Many of these programs are able to operate in the evenings and on weekends so participants may stay in school or continue traditional work schedules.
Methadone clinic or opioid treatment programs offer medication assisted outpatient treatment for people who are dependent on opiod drugs (such as heroin, OxyContin or drugs like vicodin).
An assessment of the individual is necessary to determine the best avenue for treatment. Any of the KKDF coordinators can identify services in their areas or at www.fadaa.org you can look up the directory of statewide treatment options. There are “public” and “private” programs.
The basic elements of treatment are similar throughout most programs. Programs include; Assessment, Medical Care, A Treatment Plan, Individual and Group Counseling, Education, Life Skills Review/Training, Relapse Prevention Education, Self Help support and other related services.

As we said, on its own, green tea will only help you lose about one pound per month. You also need to make sure that you are eating sensibly and exercising regularly. As a bonus, you ll get even more fat burning results from green tea when you combine it with regular exercise.
Studies have shown that drinking three to four cups of green tea per day will boost your exercise endurance by causing your body to burn fat instead of carbohydrates during your workouts.
Burning the carbs stored in your muscles causes the buildup of lactic acid which leads to fatigue and sore muscles. But green tea causes your muscles to burn more fat instead of carbs, which delays your fatigue and increases your endurance.

One feature I've always wanted to have in BioNames is a timeline of taxonomic names. ION has one (see here), but I wanted a way to go from the timeline to the actual publications. In other words, if, say, there were approximately 99 bird names published in 2012, I want to see the papers that published those names.
The data is incomplete (I'm still processing and indexing the data) but you get a sense that the number of bird names being coined each year is fairly small. Actually, I was surprised it was as high as it is, but remember these are not the number of new species described each year. It does include new species (many of them are fossils in this case), but also higher taxa and nomenclatural changes (e.g., replacement names for homonyms, etc.). The timeline also only shows names that are "new" (i.e., not the new combinations that result when a species gets moved to a new genus), and only those names linked to a publication.
The timeline graphs are clickable, so you can click on a year and get a list of publications for that taxon for that year (sometimes this can take a while). You can click on the publications for more details, sometimes you can also view the full text.
The timeline page also shows a treemap of the taxonomic groups recognised by the ION database (the example below is for birds):
That huge spike on the far right? That's due to hundreds of names published by "Snake Man" Raymond Hoser (his activities have been the subject of an impassioned debate on TAXACOM).
The timeline for insects shows a major dip in new names that corresponds to the Second World War, followed by a big jump in the late sixties.
Smaller taxa, such as Teuthida, show a more episodic pattern where a single monograph can result in a prominent spike in the numbers in any one year (again, you can click on the spikes to see the actual publications):
Still a daunting mount of cleaning and linking to do, but it's one more way to explore the efforts of generations of taxonomists to discover and make sense of the diversity of animal life on the planet.
Bill Plott mailed me a couple of notebooks recently to further add to our research of high school football teams across the state. The first book contained the schools from Blount, Cullman and Walker Counties.
It has always been a goal of mine to complete every team back through the 1950 season. With the new research from Mr. Plott we can check off another nine teams on our list from these three counties. Carbon Hill, Cold Springs, Fairview, Holly Pond, Cullman, Oakman, Oneonta, West Point and Vinemont were all completed from 1950-2014.
A total of twenty-five teams were included and all were nearly completed back to when they first fielded a football team. These include:
Our sincere appreciation goes out to Bill and his sharing with us his research of past years. I know how much effort went into this over so many years and will always be grateful to him for the time he spent in front of a microfilm machine and thumbing through old newspapers.
We do maintain an obscure page of our progress on the teams from 1950-2015 which shows where we are with every team that played football during this time. It can be found at the link below or from the frontpage of the website in the right column under "Our Progress". Check it out to see if you can be of assistance in helping us complete every team back to 1950.
We currently have completed 336 of the 613 team we are tracking during this time. According to the latest count there have been about 128,000 games played since 1950 and we are still missing scores for about 2,800 games. That sounds like a lot of missing scores but look at it this way. We are 97.9% complete. Not bad.
Luverne 'Toad' Wise was the first female football player in Alabama and may have been the first in the country. She was a kicker for the Escambia County Blue Devils in 1939-40.

I am trying to decide which version of Lover, You Should’ve Come Over, Jeff Buckley or Natalie Maines.
Neither one holds me and so I tear through more songs trying to find one that scratches an itch I can’t quite get at.
Thing is I am in an Institutionalized, Sabotage or Firestarter place and trying hard to get to an If I Can Dream mindset.
It makes me extra grumpy and thoughts of going to battle float through my mind because I might as well take the energy from the bad news and put it to good use.
Our despot-in-training the dumber than a box of rocks and twice as mean as a mean with 98 kidney stones consistently manages to shock people and that is saying something.
Can’t tell you if it is more disturbing how many people buy his bullshit or that his dementia has become so bad he believes everything he says.
I am not going to panic because he is bereft of a moral compass, is ignorant of history and has a penchant for making facts up.
And I am going to remind myself that House Of Cards is fiction and this man isn’t smart enough to imitate Frank Underwood, no matter how good his advisors are.
Some people have said I ought to temper my words here and elsewhere because some of my friends are going to be hurt or offended by my comments about the candidate they voted into office.
If they are a good friend they know I have always said a vote for him would hurt the US and that he would be ineffective.
I don’t need everyone to agree with me and am comfortable with different opinions. And I’ll add that knowing they think he has made multiple mistakes and aren’t mindless drones who praise everything he does is important to me.
He really is that bad but I don’t want every post to be about how damaging and dangerous this dummy is.
Part of the reason for my good humor is I am dealing with a few situations that are particularly challenging and the people involved make me want to scream.
This isn’t the kind of thing I can sit back and accept and I can’t make anyone change who they are so I am beginning to wonder if this is going to lead to a dead end.
It frustrates me because communication is a strength and it is rare that I run into a situation where I can’t paint a picture that is clear and easily understood.
Consistent failure has sent me back to the drawing board to see if there is a different way to do things.
It has made me engage in serious introspection to determine if it is me and each time I have come to the conclusion I am not the one with the problem.
I have a problem because they fail to understand but their failure to understand is starting to look as if it is either willful blindness or utter stupidity.
Every countertop, regardless of its material, must not only appeal in form but must also achieve its function. Thus, every little detail requires careful planning before making a final decision on the design. Finding the right countertop for your home may look easy at first, but it becomes increasingly overwhelming once you consider all the details.
The kitchen, being the contemporary centerpiece of every home, requires a countertop which (1.) meets the functional needs of daily cooking preparations and (2.) complements the beauty of the entire area.
Often an overlooked feature, the Edge Profile is a subtle detail which makes a huge statement. It is a design element which affects the appearance and functionality of the countertop, as well as the whole kitchen itself.

Once upon a time there was a woman, and she baked five pies. And when they came out of the oven, they were that overbaked the crusts were too hard to eat. So she says to her daughter:
“Darter,” says she, “put you them there pies on the shelf, and leave ’em there a little, and they’ll come again." –She meant, you know, the crust would get soft.
But the girl, she says to herself: “Well, if they’ll come again, I’ll eat ’em now.” And she set to work and ate ’em all, first and last.
Well, come supper-time the woman said: “Go you, and get one o’ them there pies. I dare say they’ve come again now.”
The girl went and she looked, and there was nothing but the dishes. So back she came and says she: “Noo, they ain’t come again.”
Well, the woman she was done, and she took her spinning to the door to spin, and as she span she sang:
The king was coming down the street, and he heard her sing, but what she sang he couldn’t hear, so he stopped and said:
The woman was ashamed to let him hear what her daughter had been doing, so she sang, instead of that:
Then he said: “Look you here, I want a wife, and I’ll marry your daughter. But look you here,” says he, “eleven months out of the year she shall have all she likes to eat, and all the gowns she likes to get, and all the company she likes to keep; but the last month of the year she’ll have to spin five skeins every day, and if she don’t I shall kill her.”
“All right,” says the woman; for she thought what a grand marriage that was. And as for the five skeins, when the time came, there’d be plenty of ways of getting out of it, and likeliest, he’d have forgotten all about it.
Well, so they were married. And for eleven months the girl had all she liked to eat, and all the gowns she liked to get, and all the company she liked to keep.
But when the time was getting over, she began to think about the skeins and to wonder if he had ’em in mind. But not one word did he say about ’em, and she thought he’d wholly forgotten ’em.
However, the last day of the last month he takes her to a room she’d never set eyes on before. There was nothing in it but a spinning-wheel and a stool. And says he: “Now, my dear, here you’ll be shut in to- morrow with some victuals and some flax, and if you haven’t spun five skeins by the night, your head’ll go off.”
Well, she was that frightened, she’d always been such a gatless girl, that she didn’t so much as know how to spin, and what was she to do to-morrow with no one to come nigh her to help her? She sat down on a stool in the kitchen, and law! how she did cry!

I hate when I think I’m buying organic vegetables and when I get home I discover they’re just regular donuts 😠🍩
I have two moods: 1. Worrying about every little detail 2. Yolo . . .👓 FLY available IN STORES #JimmyFairly #Eyeglasses
I walk around like everything is fine but, deep down, inside my shoe, my sock is sliding off #mondaymood 🧦🙄
A few days ago, I left work around dusk. As I climbed the hill beside the hospital, I noticed two people on the sidewalk, walking arm-in-arm, their long white canes swishing before them. I had a twinge of concern: I tend to think of blind people as perhaps a bit more vulnerable than us sighted folk, and here it was getting dark. How would they find their way around? After all, they’re blind.
A beat later, I realized that, whether it’s day or nighttime, what helps these folks get around is not the presence of daylight, but rather those trusty canes. It didn’t matter that it was getting dark. They’d navigate Portland just as easily as they had before the sun went down.
It is isn’t it, its almost like getting blood back to an limb thats fallen asleep, or reading a good book, the world seems fresher somehow, more active.
A growing number of smartphones are shipping with NFC, or Near Field Communication technology. This lets you send information between devices by tapping them together. For example you can share a photo with a friend or make a mobile payment from a digital wallet app.
But a team of researchers is showing off a way you can transmit more than just data — you can also transmit power.
For instance, you could pair a low-power E Ink display with your smartphone and send across pictures and enough power to flip through a few of those images.
This lets you use the E Ink screen as a secondary, low-power display for your smartphone. E Ink only uses power when you refresh the screen, so you only need a tiny bit of power to display an image and then it will can be displayed indefinitely without any additional power.
So if you have directions, a map, phone number, or a photo that you want to be able to look at continuously without running down your smartphone battery, you can tap the phone against the E Ink screen to quickly charge the secondary display and then transfer a screenshot. Then you can slide your phone back in your pocket while the phone number, address, or other data stays on the screen.
You can’t transmit a lot of energy over an NFC connection this way, so you’re not exactly going to wirelessly charge your iPod touch using this kind of setup. But it’s an interesting demo of how NFC, E Ink, and smartphones can work together.
The demo is courtesy of a team at Intel, the University of Massachussetts and the University of Washington.

Here's a news article entitled "Teen felt ‘degraded' after teacher backed aikido student's request to avoid touching females on religious grounds" which highlights a situation in Halifax, Canada where an aikido teacher "followed provincial human rights law and accommodated a male student's religious request not to touch his female classmates."
From the article: "Lisa Teryl, a lawyer for the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, was unable to comment on the aikido case specifically, but acknowledged the stickiness of weighing the "competing rights" of gender equity versus religious beliefs.
"In the fabric of Canadian society, [gender segregation] isn't something that, in a secular sense, we support … we generally see it as a bad thing," she said. At the same time, she said, the law requires reasonable accommodation of religious views, which are generally given much higher consideration than mere matters of personal preference. "If it doesn't cost us to the point of undue hardship, then we need to try to … support them, and not have them feel persecuted for their deeply-held belief," she said."
I know this might be a sensitive topic, so please conduct your discussion in a respectful manner, and please explicitly maintain a connection to the topic of aikido in the discussion.
**DISCLAIMER: This is strictly my opinion, and doesn't represent the views of my teachers, fellow students, or anyone else for that matter.
1) The method by which the male student was accommodated. Segregating the entire class robs everyone of the opportunity to practice with all sizes, shapes, and genders. This variety, in my view, is a key component of aikido practice. There was a much simpler way to accommodate the male student: Ask one or two of the other male students if they would be willing to practice with this fellow exclusively during the class. It would be an inconvenience for the students, but the "pain" could be spread around by asking different students each class.
2) Allowing the distribution of religious tracts. To be blunt, I don't think that has any place in the dojo, regardless of what the flyer says. In particular, the tracts being distributed in this situation supposedly advocate some pretty terrible views, certainly not in keeping with ideas like "love" and "harmony".
I sincerely hope for a positive outcome to this situation, and that it doesn't lead to a knee-jerk reaction in the opposite direction (ie. a reduction in tolerance for differing religious beliefs).
Most of my earlier comments on this topic surrounded setting an expectation and then meeting that expectation. As a real example, it sounds like this instructor conceded to the student what I would consider to be an extreme request. That is, the request to specifically avoid contact [with a female student] in a contact sport. In doing so, I believe the instructor set an expectation in the dojo that other students (specifically the offended student) found to be unacceptable. The fact is the instructor now has the problem of continuing to meet that expectation as long as the student in question continues to train, while the offended student need only leave and find a new dojo. I am guessing that instructor is hoping the new student is a millionaire and wants to train for the rest of his life...
One of the things I did not previously mention is that at some point when there is a conflict (say, Yankees fans and Red Sox fans who have to train at the same dojo), there is such a thing as affirmation by non-action. That is, by letting the Red Sox fans train (an affirmation of activity) in all of their antagonistic glory (pin-striped gis, red belts, etc.) the instructor may not be specifically be an advocate of Boston, but she is effectively not supporting the Yankees fans training at the dojo who are offended by the activity. In this example, the common solution would be to say the dojo does not permit paraphernalia (of any kind) on the mat out of respect for all individuals who train, even the sad, sad Chicago Cubs fans.
The thing that bothered me most in the article was the aikido instructor sought to project the responsibility of the decision onto other agencies and minimize the harm caused to the dojo. As a student, what would resonate with me from that message is, "This new student is more important than you, but I don't want you to think that I don't support you so I got some other people to say what I am doing isn't wrong. If you are offended, I hope that you are not offended enough to leave."
The good news is that the offended student has probably been given a glimpse of what eventually would become more transparent as a flaw in the leadership of the dojo. She has the opportunity to find a new place that will include her in training and better reflect her interests in the leadership decisions of the dojo.
And to be fair, I am firm believer that all dojos are not for everyone. We should align our training with communities that share our interests, beliefs and goals. Students' decisions to leave a dojo are more commonly influenced by other factors such as quality, location, schedule, organization and so on. Our dojo is patently prejudiced towards the needs of the dads that we train with... classes start after dinner and bed time and our wives could care less what we do once the kids are in bed... But we have turned away students because our schedule is not attractive to anyone with a life. Or, who live in the sticks (Seiser, I'm looking at you)
If this man's religion doesn't allow him to be in physical contact with women, then *why* train in a touchy-feely martial art like Aikido? I faced a similar situation at my dojo several years ago. A Muslim male trained at the dojo, but did not train with the women. He didn't make eye contact with us either. I didn't know what was going on, until the situation was explained to me. But unlike this other Aikido sensei in the article, my sensei did *not* segregate the class for the benefit of this one man.
I understand that martial art schools have a responsibility to *not* discriminate against potential students because of religion. However, I have a big problem when the entire structure of the school is changed to accommodate *one* person's beliefs. What about the rest of the students? Should their rights to train with *anyone* they choose be violated to accommodate one person?
I would also draw the line at passing around religious literature at a MARTIAL ART SCHOOL. The sensei in the article should *not* have condoned the man proselytizing his current students. That would have been the perfect reason to show him the door.
Why did they have to segregate the class entirely? The only thing I can think of is that he didn't simply not want to train with women, but he perhaps complained about accidental contact with women if they trained too close.
Having a person refuse to bow or ask for something specific I could kind of see...but personally I wouldn't take such a student. Sorry, you gotta follow the etiquette.
"Teen felt ‘degraded' after teacher backed aikido student's request to avoid touching females on religious grounds."
If it were my school - I would have not let him join. I have come across more than a few Muslim students over the years and there has never been a problem. In fact, I remember some Christian guy had a problem once - thought it was against god or something so he quit.
I know my wife was asked if she would teach a group of muslim women, as they were uncomfortable in a class run by men. I have my doubts if this is a valid approach to self defence, but for Aikido and exercise, fine. I have also had students whose religion does not let them bow to anyone but God - I am okay with this. I am not Shinto. They show respect anyway, and I bow anyway.
As a nurse, I have had male nursing students tell me they are not comfortable seeing any woman but their wife. There is no area in nursing that allows for an all male patient population, and no way this man could write the national exams to be a nurse with ignorance on half the population of the world. I told him to figure it out or quit. The whole time, I knew there are areas with all female staff including physicians and I cannot be used to chaparone a male doctor with a female patient.
If I had a female Aikido student who had been beatened or raped or was just uncomfortable being around men in general, I would not have any man work with her at first, nor would I demand it. I might have to ask for a special class of women only and set up a separate day and time, and I might have to admit I could not accomodate this request. If this was a woman saying she didn't want to have contact with a man, most people would expect this would be accomodated.
For religious grounds for a brand new student - I would be concerned that I might be asked to accede to other demands, and I would be clear about how far I was willing to go. As a former Canadian student in the only dojo in an entire province, I understand trying to work with a potential new student despite some odd requests up front. In a smaller town, this student might also be friends with a landlord, or someone else I might need to keep happy. At least one Nova Scotia dojo sets up in a church.
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms in Canada does not apply to a dojo environment. If this isn't workable, time to let it go.
Many good points being made here. Personally, I respect people who act according to their beliefs or the dictates of their conscience...but I don't think that excuses them from consequences. You're a white person who doesn't want to sit at the same lunch counter with a person of color? Find yourself another place to eat (and be prepared to keep moving on). You're a pharmacist who doesn't want to dispense a legal and prescribed medication? Find another line of work where you don't have to do that. In the United States, conscientious objectors have been excused from taking up arms in military service, but they weren't excused from service period, and many have served at great risk and with great distinction. I think the same reasoning applies here. You don't want to train with women? You get to be the last one picked, not the first. Others are willing to train with everyone in the dojo: after they have all paired up, if there's a man left who's willing to work with you, all righty. If not...you get to sit out.
It also occurs to me, much as I share Jon's dislike at the sensei's failure to take responsibility, is that this may have been the death of a thousand cuts: that the guy came in with no stated issues, and as time went on, "Oh I can't do this, it's against my religion" "Oh I can't do that, it's against my religion". That's the way some people foist their issues on others.
Perhaps the most delicious irony is that here we have a student who is willing to disrupt an entire community for his own asserted values, no matter what level of discomfort, inconvenience or sense of threat threat that he might cause. That is real commitment! He does so in the name of his asserted religious values--values identical to those of 10's of millions of people, fwiw.
He passes out a religious tract that "also authorizes husbands to administer a "light strike" to their wives in cases of "serious moral misconduct." Well, thank God he is in an aikido class, because, the non-violent martial art that it is, this is the perfect place to learn those "light strikes."
Therefore, when this man who can't touch non-related women by his religion, but can hit related women (these are HIS assertions of what his religion is) goes home and when his wife or sister exhibits 'serious moral misconduct' (like talking to a Christian man or in the latter, going out with him, or in many such homes, wearing a dress that's too short, or refusing to wear the 'proper' head covering), he can use the shihonage he learned in class (whooops, that 'light' chastisement ended up in a torn ligament or a head injury) or one of those atemi that aikido is reportedly 99% of to put her back in line.
In other words, this flaccid instructor is morally culpable for any injuries or violence this man commits, given that the instructor has made him more able to commit it.
I am reminded of H.G. Wells - the Morlocks and Eloi. And lest, in my disgust, anyone throws out the usual accusations of what I might mean--I am talking about the relational dynamic between a forceful ideology that is sure of itself - committed - opposes to a liberal ideology that values only not giving offense (which it defines as anyone asserting offense based on their own values).
And yes, this directly concerns aikido. If one is teaching a martial art, one must take responsibility for what one teaches and who one teaches. And one must embody integrity in the process. This instructor has failed on all counts. (as has the social system which supports such policies as described in the article).
For the dojo however this isn't about religious beliefs. This is about not allowing outside influences, whatever they are, to negatively affect the dojo's learning environment.
Also, if this male student is allowed to distribute his literature, unimpeded by the dojo/instructor then by default the dojo/instructor agrees and promotes the same material, thoughts, and beliefs.
As an instructor I have not encountered this specific issue but have encountered several students whos agenda was disruptive to the general harmony of the environment. In all of these situations it was explained that their behavior was unacceptable. With the one or two that would try to argue their point I simply stated that my dojo wasn't the place they were looking for.
Society today is driven by consumerism. I'm paying you so you have to do what I say attitude. What they do not realize is that their money affords them the comfort of a building that protects them from the elements and mats that ease the fall. The knowledge that is shared with them is purely at the instructor's discretion. If as the instructor I allow a student to dictate the classroom environment in the ways mentioned in the article I have failed to provide a suitable learning environment for all of my students.
Perhaps I am that freak who really believes in freedom of thought and expression. Perhaps I believe in the gentle empathy and compassion of blending-with rather than resisting.
Perhaps an individual has a right to train with whomever they feel comfortable with based on whatever criteria. Forcing them to violated their belief system seems rather un-Aikido-ish. Perhaps with time and mindful compassion, they will change that view. Either way, its their belief and its about them. I have people I tend not to train with. Don't you?
If an instructor chooses in their own school to honor (or not honor) a student's request is their choice and shows their perspective. Its about the instructor.
If another person chooses to take offense/degraded because some one has a different belief, or some one chooses to honor/respect that belief/request - then that's about them, not the other person's belief system.
We all tend to want freedom of belief and expression/choice for what we believe/agree-with. Doesn't that also extend to the beliefs and expression of others, even if we do not agree with them?
If a student feels uncomfortable for any reason being touched by (or touching) another student, I would tend to respect what that student is telling me about themselves even if I do not personally agree with that perspective and position. It may about their fear and ignorance (or traumatic history). I do not expect people to come in with the empathy and compassion (in all three directions in this scenario) that I hope they will leave with.
This may be an unpopular and politically-incorrect stance, but hey, I am that freak who believes in freedom of belief and expression even if its different from my own.
We do not rise to the level of our expectations, but fall to the level of our training. Train well. KWATZ!
Perhaps an individual has a right to train with whomever they feel comfortable with based on whatever criteria.
That's a freedom of association argument, and it's valid up to a point. This case goes far beyond that point. IANAL, so here's my amateur take on what freedom of association means in the United States (and granted, we're already far afield because this case didn't happen in the US). It means that you can not be prohibited from associating yourself with those whose company you choose, nor can you be forced to associate with those whose company you do not wish. It does not mean that you may deny others access to a public accommodation on the grounds that you do not wish to associate with them. A dojo that is open to the public to join is a public accommodation. You may not avail yourself of a public accommodation and then deny others the right to do the same.
Great discussion! Lynn, I want to add to what you just said. I have had female students, who because of past abuse or experiences, were uncomfortable being touched by men. I didn't make a big deal of it--just let them choose their own partners. I always make the announcement, "All partners are good partners. You have something to learn from everybody. Try to work with as many different people as you can." Eventually these students grew more comfortable and expanded their pool of partners. People putting their hands on you can be disconcerting at first. When I began, I had problems with that issue myself. I chose female partners when possible. However, segregating a class because of my discomfort would have been unfair to all involved, including myself. Eventually I realized I was in a safe, respectful place, and I learned to work with everyone, just as my students learn to do.
1. To Ellis' point, I think this is largely a problem with committing to a flaccid position. In attempt to not offend anyone, the position actually emboldens bully behavior and frustrates those who capitulate to the authority. This is not action of leadership, nor what I would desire in leaders within my dojo. I have many martial arts friends who openly express disdain for the martial functionality of aikido; they believe the art in BS but they appreciate my commitment and decisions and respect what we do because we have a direction.
2. On interview, instructors are charged with several serious tasks in evaluating new students. For me, the top 3 are: 1. protect the interests of the students, 2. protect the interests of the dojo, 3. assume the responsibility of instruction. I like Ellis' points at the interview level of decision which asks, "if this individual advocates assault, I am empowering him to better execute assault?"
3. To Lynn's point, I think many of us have worked with victims of abuse or assault. Sometimes these students have special needs in their training and we work to re-integrate them into class. For me, this approach often has two strings: 1. the students recognizes the special need and compromises to find an acceptable solution (such as private instruction or limited training opportunities), 2. the is an end when the student integrates into class.
My original criticism about the role the instructor played in this decision was to recognize the complications created by what I perceive to be a flaw in the leadership of the instructor. We all have 'em and we all make mistakes, so my contribution was intended to share where I perceived the flaw to be. In elaborating on this general observation, I would advocate that as instructors we should be a secure dojo where our students are confident in themselves and confident the instructor is working in their interest. I want to be able to have a conversation with a student that goes something like, "Hey, I know this new guy is frustrating because he holds a view of women that is offensive to you. But we should give him an opportunity to prove he came to the dojo to change. I need your help... You don't need his approval for your self-confidence and I need you to be above this while we wait to see if this guy is serious about changing." But I do not think you can have that conversation with a student unless she trusts you and trusts your integrity to follow through with your promises. At some point, the student either needs to get with the program or leave.
To my other point about dojo cultures, I can appreciate the alienation this student must feel training in a dojo where everyone shares a different perspective that he does. Back to terrible sports rivalry, can you imagine the alienation a Packer fan feels when they go into a bar full of Bears fans? You either need to learn to personalize yourself to the Bears fans or find a new bar. Maybe you were adopted by Packers fans and you don't know better, maybe you were going through a phase of rebellion and the Packers represented the extreme-opposite perspective of your sensible Bears-loving parents, maybe the Bears let you down when Ditka left and you vowed never to let the Bears hurt you again. Back to the article, I think it shows something that when presented with the opportunity to change, the student instead distributed flyers about how the dojo could change...
I'm ok with an instructor making accomodations on occasion for people so if the student can't touch females then let him work with the male students. However, like most others I believe the complete segregation of male and female is wrong and unnecessary (based on what I have read).
It's the instructor's dojo so wheter we agree or now he is basically free do conduct classes as he wishes and if he wants to let someone hand out religous literature then that is his choice. If students disagree with how things are going at the dojo I think that all they can really do is one the following:
2. Discuss the situation with the instructor and see if a compromise/solution can be found for both sides.
That's a freedom of association argument, and it's valid up to a point. This case goes far beyond that point..
Individual freedom of thoughts and expression was presented in three points-of-views vantage-points in this specific scenario: (1) the male student requesting religious consideration, (2) the instructor consider the dojo context, personalities, and politics, and (3) the female student who took it personally and took offense on possible sexist issues.
Perhaps all are correct given their own personal perspective. No matter what decision the instructor makes, he loses some one. He made a personal judgment call to respect a religious request. That is between them. The offense taken is between the instructor and that student.
Perhaps if freedom of thought and expression means I have to limit my association (touch) with certain people, right or wrong (just meaning you agree or don't) according to others (or me), isn't that within their right as long as it does not cause harm to others?
Who caused the offense taken, the student's request to have his religious beliefs respected, the instructor who respected the request, or the student who took some one's religious request as a personal statement about them?
"Up to a point"? Absolutely!!! If he came in and requested to touch/workout with only young girls or women - well we would be having a whole different discussion if I were the Sensei.
It did not sound to me like her was changing the dojo politics by segregating all the students and classes. Yet, perhaps since its his school, it his choice and it may be useful. (We often let the children train with the adults, where other schools/dojos do not.)
Perhaps this discussion points out the exclusion adversarial duality of our problem-formation and problem-solution processes and patterns?
This is a thought stimulating scenario. I am glad no one (that I currently know of) is making value judgments about every decision I make. LOL
Eventually I realized I was in a safe, respectful place, and I learned to work with everyone, just as my students learn to do.
I have encountered people who were certainly training with a different intensity and intent than I wanted. I didn't ask permission or discuss it, I just did not choose to train with them. When they asked my why, I was honest about owning by own reasons.
If they have already learned the lessons, they would not be entering the dojo and asking for instruction.
Guess I didn't know I would be judged harshly for acting on what I believed was in our mutual best interest.
Reading both articles, my take-away was that yes he WAS segregating the students and classes by gender. As instructor he made a decision to fundamentally change the entire dojo culture and depriving all students of ability to train cross-gender in order to accommodate one new student.
I am thrilled to be training in a dojo that is very inclusive. That inclusivity in practice does not mean changing everything about how a class is conducted. It means those of us with experience and willingness tend to partner with newer folks who come in with issues (be they physical or emotional) rather than turning them loose with, say, another newer student who might not be a good match and lead to somebody getting hurt or escalating.
And Lynn I am not advocating having him not train....my own approach would be to suggest that any male students who wished to train with him would do so. And if not enough did, well that's how it goes.
"Perhaps an individual has a right to train with whomever they feel comfortable with based on whatever criteria." Emphasis mine. That is exactly a freedom of association argument, whether you use those words or not.
Lynn sensei, are you talking about some abstract concept of "freedom", or are you talking about legal rights? Please, let's not veer off into the weeds and start arguing about "freedom of thoughts": there is no credible argument that anyone's "freedom of thoughts" can possibly be infringed upon. Nor was the discussion about freedom of expression. It was about a person wanting a consideration that would deprive others of their full access to a public accommodation. You made a freedom of association argument in favor of somehow granting this consideration -- you didn't call it "freedom of association", but that is what it was. Now, back to my previous post: there is nothing compelling this individual to grapple with women. He can choose not to do so at any time he wishes. He just can't (in the United States) use freedom of association to compel a public accommodation to limit the access of others with whom he does not which to associate, any more than you, as a white person, can walk up to a lunch counter and demand that all people of color leave because you're not comfortable with their presence.
I disagree. I disagree with the assertion that no matter what, the instructor "loses some one". You have one student. Another individual wishes to become your student, but only under conditions that restrict the student you now have. You can only lose the student you have, not the one you don't have.
I disagree that it's "between them". The instructor's actions affect others in the dojo, most especially the female members. For the record, I am personally of the opinion that the attitude of those Muslims who believe in no contact between unrelated women and men is better described as "it's complicated" than as straight-up misogynistic...but when people come to a dojo requesting that the instructor grant a consideration that in any way restricts the training of others, I feel that there's a real bright line and it's not to be crossed.
"Freedom of thought" is a red herring. Freedom of expression is a separate issue and does not relate to this case. And, with respect, you seem unclear on what freedom of association is. As I said before, freedom of association means that you can not be prohibited from associating yourself with those whose company you choose, nor can you be forced to associate with those whose company you do not wish. This individual is being in no way forced to touch anyone he does not want to touch. His option is to stay outside the dojo. He has no more right to come into the dojo and demand that others not touch him (where "touch" means normal and acceptable aikido practice, not mugging in the hallway), based on ANY criteria, than you have to walk up to that lunch counter and demand that the people of color clear out.
Why are you playing the blame game? Why do you care? If you find out the answer to your questions, what good will it do you? One could argue, especially the neutral-to-positive phrasing you use in reference to the would-be student and the sensei above and the negative phrasing you keep using in reference to the female student, that it would make you most happy if the female student were to simply be a "good girl" and let others push her into a corner. Their emotional comfort is more important than her access to training, and that's ok because she's female?
Here's another point you should consider: the sincerity of your belief does not legitimize the trespasses you commit in its service. You, a white person, may sincerely believe that people of color are your inferiors and that their presence at the same table pollutes you. You may believe it with every fiber in your being. But the fervor of your belief does not grant you the smallest, most tenuous right to infringe upon their legitimate and legal rights. Fervent believers frequently need that fool notion knocked out of their heads, and an even marginally just society is generally willing to oblige them.
Well, that's good to know that you draw the line at fondling the women of the dojo. Are there any lesser lines that you're not willing to cross? What if he came in and requested that no women be on the mat while he was training? What if he wanted to be able to sashay into any class he wanted, at any time, and any women who came to train in that class would simply have to leave? Or perhaps it would be better if all female students simply had to resign their dojo membership, and no more female members would be allowed to join -- would that be sufficient?
Reading both articles, my take-away was that yes he WAS segregating the students and classes by gender..
I too am grateful for inclusive classes. I have learned a great deal from the women and children in Aikido, than from most adult males.
It does bring up another issue. In many businesses I see a sign that says they reserve the right to refuse services, or have a dress code, etc. If its your business, even open to the public, don't you have any rights to decide who to teach and how to structure your teaching? Coming up through the arts I have been to many dojos that did not mix classes and have been refused training because I was white. And you know, IMHO, they have that right too. There are many organizations that would not have me for a member (the Groucho Marx syndrome) without me feeling degraded.
I just don't personally believe that my individual rights should have to be accommodated by everyone else. I have never found that world - and hopefully never will. I can accept other's differences without having to agree, understand, condone, accommodate or be tolerant of them. Nor do I expect other to accommodate mine.
While I certainly would not have made this specific request or segregate and school I belonged to or taught it, I simply do not believe that I am the most important person here or necessarily the one in charge. And this I know many others agree that I am not that all important.

There seems to be a bit of confusion about the term "Correct Feeling." It is just a term that we learned from Shuji Maruyama, Sensei. If you have any question about him having the "goods" go check him out.
Ron has his own way of talking about "correct feeling" that comes from his 35 years of experience in this art. Correct feeling is a very meaningful way of expressing how we train to us.
If you have any other questions about our view point check out Ron's Blog. He talks about correct feeling more eloquently than I ever could.
Let's really work toward an openness in discussion rather disparaging one person's terms to make our own way the BEST.
My apologies if it came across harsh. I stated clearly that is has no meaning as a teaching tool to me as it is highly personal. As I said, and I should have placed a wink next to it; "What do you under even more stress to fix a student- tell him to get even more correct feeling?"
If you think that the feeling that seems effortless to you is your own and it is different for everyone else, I would argue you were wrong. I would argue that that there are known and established ways for connecting to an uke that make their weight and force go away. They have been written down. You can use certain visualization tools to get there by teaching or by happenstance in discovery. That does not invalidate them, but neither does it mean they are fully realized or ever will be because if you don't define how to get there, you cannot define what is wrong, or how to make it better or add to it.
Apparently and wisely you enjoy correct feeling. I would just betcha there are ways to make your correct feeling... better. In other words there are known and established ways your brothers and sisters in budo, for generations have taught each other to establish correct feeling.
Following one teacher's view is up to you, have fun and God bless. Just don't be surprised if your own teacher met a certain other method and dumped what he was doing for it....it's happening all the time. Then hopefully he will not look at you and say "This is even more more correct, correct feeling", but will actually use human words to tell you how to do it every time without fail.
It's like telling someone "Move inside." It doesn't help when there are any number of ways to grab that guy's people and actually help them discover and know WHAT...to move inside.
Mary, I was in no way trying to disparage your use of the phrase but to explain that I thought that, in fact, it was your shorthand for a whole lot of pretty specific stuff....which is pretty much what you have just said yourself.
My reasoning was based on coming from a dojo in Tohei Sensei's lineage - I came to view his 4 principles as a shorthand for a whole lot of specific body/brain things that can be specifically taught and practiced, whereas I have seen that merely telling the 4 principles to beginners doesn't give them anything they can use.
IMHO, I often think that when I can feel the technique, I am probably not doing it correctly. When I do not feel like I am doing it, I probably am doing it correctly. Therefore, perhaps the correct feeling is feeling the least amount of effort to get the maximum amount of effect. (Or, perhaps my uke is just being too nice to me.)
Correct feeling is meaningless without awareness. Like Lynn said, perhaps aite is not as sharp as he/she should be. When aite poses the attack with true intend and is keen on using possible openings on your side during the technique and you still feel free in your movement and aite cannot find openings you are on to something.
But... What's "correct"? I don't share the other person's nervous system, so I can't know what anyone else is feeling as "correct".
I can experience what it feels like to me when someone who has "correct feeling" does whatever it is they're doing - to me, but I still have to figure out for myself if I'm approximating whatever it is that the other person "feels" as "correct"....
These days people expect more from an instructor, something tangible with a process in place to achieve it.
You're right. Correct feeling encapsulates what we are training to achieve and strengthen. Correct feeling an end-state of sorts, not an instruction given to students. Our training methodology is designed to cultivate mind/body coordination which is the source of correct feeling.
1. Correct feeling as in subscribing to a method of movement which is precise and absolute... Delivering the most pound to inches power generation/annullatiom.
My opinion being no1 would perhaps be the most advantageous to learn and operate under if you want to train as an effective warrior within the shortest timescale. No one can deny your ability when it is tried and tested through generations of students who could repeat it under any given circumstances. You have created a powerful warrior caste.
No 2. Harder to consistently achieve and transmit and worst, master. Yet it also operates in an even more broader range of situations. A feeling that could be applied in situations of any random variables. A methodology that has no coerciveness in it's teachings, it's mastery and it's application.
Walter, I can't feel what another person feels yet I know when te interaction between us is as correct as it can be. When I am impatient I can really feel it...can you it when you are?
My uke may seem clunky or stiff or some other way my ego might want to describe them ...yet it is really just me being impatient, again.
Correct feeling can be restored when I accept uke as they are at that moment and blend with what is.
I understand what you're getting at, but - even though I've been doing this since 1993; even though people tell me I have pretty good movements; and even though I can tell when something goes very well, easily, smoothly and uke is helpless to do anything other than take ukemi (take taking? hmmm) I still don't know if what seems to be working for me is "correct" in the eyes of the sensei or shihan who may be observing me...
Even more simple than that I would say Ahmad. The result of doing things correctly. This may take time and effort but there at the end of it is correct feeling.
So first is to recognise that feeling. Next would be to recognise it can be there all the time but is dependent on us being in total harmony with what we are doing which takes a lot of learning and practice.
I would personally say that thereafter it would actually show us what to do almost like saying your Ki has already done whats necessary but are we aware of it.
As a beginner, I do not understand. What is correct feeling? I went and read a few of Ron's blog as you suggested and it appears to be an end point, a goal. However, I don't understand what it is. Perhaps this is because I have yet to feel it. But if and when I do how will I know?
Correct (several definitions but I think you mean): conforming to an approved or conventional standard
So there is an approved or conventional sensation that I am looking for? Can you explain what that sensation is? What are it's hallmarks? What am I supposed to feel?
Please understand this isn't a critique or criticism. It is just that I do not understand. How do I identify an incorrect feeling versus a correct feeling?
Hum there are a lot of ways to think about correct feeling, from how my own body feels for things like quality of my structure, how relaxed I am, how I feel the connection to my partner or attacker, as well as how much of their structure and center I can feel.
I have found that expecially for beginners the link below on "Aikido from the Inside Out - The principals" gives a good initial perspective on all those components of correct feeling as I understand them
Correct feeling is relaxed, connected and on balance. When you throw it feels like your uke falls effortlessly. You are not pushing uke or pulling uke...they get to go the way they are headed with a little guidance from you.
When I first started training with Ikeda Sensei he would move (okay I didn't see the motion) and then say "Understand?" And I would say "no". He would gently connect to my center, "Unity" and then disconnect and say "No Unity".
The tricky thing with determining what correct feeling is the biased analysis (us as nage) that comes with it.
When you're doing a technique for example, you're thinking to yourself that you are relaxed, calm and doing the technique correctly. Yet when you ask your ukes or sensei, they would beg to differ. For them, you are still stiff, muscling through and forcing the technique. So what is "relaxed" to you, others would disagree. It leaves you confused and disillusioned. I still struggle with the concept of relaxation but have just started to understand how it works.
The simplest analogy I can think of is that the body is like a line of falling dominoes with one end of the line as a body extremity (eg wrists, head, etc) and the other extremity as the center or hara. As with the falling dominoes game, you should not have broken links in the line otherwise, the end tile won't topple. A technique is similar to the game of falling dominoes where the challenge is to "connect" a body extremity to the hara. Any broken link in the technique will make it useless.
Nage's objective is the connection generated from his hara to the extremity when initiating the technique. On the other hand nage is also trying to connect with uke from uke's attacking extremity to the hara (uke). You need to complete the "circuit" to make the technique work, hara to hara.
Although the concept of relaxation is still vague to me, the above is my guiding principle. I will therefore not be "relaxed" if there are "broken links/broken circuit" in the technique. We may have been told a million times not to use the shoulder since this will force the technique. This is because we need to initiate movement from the center first which is the broken link. What this means is that we initiate the technique from the shoulder when it should be from the hara. What's comforting is that broken links do manifest themselves in nage and uke's responses to the techniques so its easier to analyze. So probably understanding correct feeling is to understand the "circuit" by observing uke's responses.
Probably a strong evidence for you getting "correct feeling" is if you can do the technique with almost any body morphology getting the same response from ukes, from the strongest, tall, short, sturdy, flimsy to the clumsiest but it will take a lot of time to validate this. If you can do this you are starting to make progress IMHO.
When you take ukemi for a 7th or above dan shihan, that is correct feeling imho. that is why 1) you need train and to take ukemi from these people as much as possible to feel their techniques 2) mimic their techniques.
Correct feeling is an end point, of sorts. That is, you never reach a point where you can say, "ah ha I have correct feeling, now what?" Developing and strengthening correct feeling is an ongoing process. We have specific exercises, most of which were handed down to us by Maruyama sensei from Tohei sensei, some we have developed on our own, designed to teach the student how to develop coordination of mind and body (the source of correct feeling). From repeated practice of the exercises and being tested the student learns to identify correct feeling based on results.
Many Aikido people believe that the exclusive practice of technique over a period of time will engender the type of internal organization that we'd define as correct feeling. Since I have never trained in that manner, I've always mixed Ki development with technique training, I can't voice an informed opinion in that regard.
My blog, being as it is, a personal recollection of my own training and not a how to manual, does contain some specific exercises you can do on your own or with a partner to get an idea of what correct feeling is.
Perhaps looking for the "correct feeling" as a kinesthetic sense in movement and execution is like a zen koan that focuses the training in the direction of the search?
Through training, introspection, and feedback we eventually (will someday) find the answer and be able to drop the question.
Meaning, it inspires us to pay attention to how we're feeling in our training, and not just in what we're doing (i.e., throwing uke)?
Maruyama-sensei was Tohei's student as far back as Hombu and through the formation of Ki Society before Maruyama spun off Kokikai. We still have the Four Principles with one difference - at some point, Maruyama changed the wording of the fourth one from "Extend Ki" to "Develop your positive mind". He believed these meant pretty much the same thing but the altered version was a clarification. His formative experience partly involved being one of the early teachers in the USA, where people were less inclined to accept things on authority alone.
I wish I could find the article again to link to, but there was a college paper that quoted Maruyama-sensei speaking at a Fall Camp some years ago, where he expressed the opinion that ki was "correct feeling". We don't use the term in class here, but explaining it that way made sense to me from the student perspective.
Bear in mind: I'm an extremely secular person. I look with suspicion and disdain on anything that smacks of magic or mysticism. I don't find "ki" to be a useful term for me as a student because it seems no one can agree on what it means. What I can understand are thought processes and body mechanics, and when someone at my dojo speaks of "extending ki" I can translate it into this context.
But to try to tie it all together, ki test 101: unbendable arm. Positive mind: your body will follow your attention, your focus, your imagination. I am relaxed, but not floppy. I focus on imagining the "firehose" feeling, and the muscles respond in the correct way - one day someone will do all the biomechanics research to establish exactly what's happening, but it's enough for me to know that I can do it easily, reliably, and that it's not a trick. The thought process is positive mind, and the result is correct feeling.
Of course if this were all to it, we wouldn't need the dojo. You learn, gradually, how unbendable arm, ki exercise warmups and all those other things apply to the rest of Aikido. It's one thing to have correct feeling, or keeping focus on one point, when sitting or standing comfortably, and a very different thing to maintain it when throwing or being thrown. That's what practice, and the other principles are for.
That's my interpretation, subject to evolve with experience. I know others will disagree and I've seen the fights that break out on the subject, something I'd rather avoid. But I hope it was clear enough to be understandable.
At a recent aikido seminar (Kokikai Fall Camp, 1995, Arizona State University), Kokikai aikido founder Sensei Shuji Maruyama continually stressed that ki should be approached as simply "a feeling." In aikido, a feeling of correctness, good posture--a natural, relaxed yet active state(17 )-- not a mysterious magical element. He demonstrated the absurdity of "magical ki" in several ways: once by pretending to exert an invisible force through his hand to stop an attacker, and another by mimicking a person desperately worrying about an aikido test, hoping for divine intervention through ki power.
Thanks for the reminder, Jamie. One of the things I loved that Maruyama Sensei said was, "Ueshiba could, Tohei could, I can and so can you.
Maruyama stopped talking about Ki after Tohei started getting really, what Maruyama called "out there". He wasn't feeling The "Ki stones" and stuff. Gotta love everybody's process...we are all human after all.

Louie Simmons can make you strong, but how he does it can be a bit of a mystery. Louie, however, doesn’t keep any secrets and shares his techniques with the CrossFit community at Powerlifting Certs.
One of the most integral parts to understanding the Westside Barbell method is to know that velocity is critical. While Simmons and crew work towards new PRs by lifting max weights on some days, they also use weights just over 50 percent of their 1RM to emphasize speed on other days.
Bands and chains are used to provide additional resistance and change the dynamics of the lift, and Simmons will use all sorts of variations to add pounds to a standard competition bench press: wide grips, narrow grips, JM presses, cambered bars, football bars, a floor press or two  .
In this three-part interview, Simmons shares a number of his strength-building nuggets as they relate to speed on the bench press. Grab a pen and paper to take some notes and maybe knock a few seconds off your next Linda.
Part 1: Lower weight, faster reps. How to set up speed work on sub-maximal days with bands and chains. 8min 30sec
“A pyramid is only as tall as it’s base, mathematically,” Louie Simmons says in answering a question about the age-appropriateness of the conjugate system.
HQ trainers Adrian (Boz) Bozman and Jesse Ward were at the first CrossFit Powerlifting Cert at Westside Barbell late in 2009, while HQ trainer and 2008 CrossFit Games Champion… Continue Reading
Train the same way for too long and you’ll experience accommodation, which will reveal itself in poor performance. For Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell, the conjugate system offers a way to avoid… Continue Reading
Louie Simmons of Westside Barbell has produced a host of world- and national-champion powerlifters, and the top lifters at his gym in Columbus, Ohio rival the top lifters in any country. He’s one of… Continue Reading
Louie never ceases to impress me with his knowledge of bio-mechanics. he definitely knows how to make people strong, and that looked like a pretty loaded audience he had.
I am all about listening to his methods because he has some great ways of thinking, but I just watched "Bigger Stronger Faster" and it featured Louie. Louie not only said that he has used anabolic steroids for 36 years and also that you can get strong but why not get even stronger with steroids. Crossfit focuses on functional movements and good nutrition eating "real" food, I have trouble seeing where someone with his views on steroids fits into this model.
Tim, it's because of the knowledge he possesses. This topic has come up in just about every article with him in it, and the outcome is always that he knows what he is talking about. He uses steroids, yet as so many other CFers that have used his training methods will tell you, he will make you stronger, steroids or not.
Tim you are "all about listening to his methods because he has some great ways of thinking". So I'm having trouble seeing where you are having trouble with where he fits in? Didn't you answer that yourself with your first statement? Filter out what you do not want to absorb and keep the rest...then move on. No reason to judge the man and determine he "doesn't belong with us".
I am in the military and a large portion of the Crossfit community is military or LEO. Louie openly claims to use a drug that is illegal by federal law and the UCMJ. I wouldnt have a problem if it was just an interview but now he is conducting the official Crossfit Powerlifting Cert. Every video that gets posted on the mainsite gets critiqued to the gnats ass detail because of range of motion standards or some other quality standard, but somehow critique to a strength and powerlifting coach that openly advocates illegal drugs cannot be critiqued. i will never say that he "doesn't belong with us" but I will feel free to openly disagree with his advocacy of illegal substances.
The choice is simple, Tim; absorb what is useful, discard what is not -- or remain totally ignorant to the man's training methods.
Tim, if you watched all of "Bigger, Stronger, Faster", you would know what a crock it is that steriods are illegal. All for the sanctity of baseball records, really. But you are right, they are illegal. Regardless, Louie isn't preaching the use of steroids to the Crossfit community, he is teaching them how to increase their strength, which is a lesson many of the community could take to heart. I agree with all of the above posters - what Louie gives is a tool, same as anything else offered by Crossfit. If it works for you, use it, if not, then don't.
Alright, now that I got my santimoniousnous out of the way, I love what Louie says about triceps. In high school, when my heavy bench would crap out, I would work my triceps harder, particularly the medial head. People thought I was crazy, but my bench jumped considerably as a result, and I actually had decent numbers for my weight, being drug free in the 80's. I've had the same result recently with my press and push press by doing heavy tricep work. Listen to Louie, he speaks the truth.
The only thing I don't like about the Louie vids is that they are multiple parts and I have to wait for each part!!
Even if Louie takes steroids and maybe some lifters at WSB take steroids, so what? I believe the whole point of the videos of Louie and WSB is to promote proper technique on the bench, squat, and deadlift. Just because he may take steroids doesn't mean his vast knowledge of these three movements should be disregarded. Even if you don't take steroids, mastering the techniques Louie promotes can add hundreds of pounds to your total, just because of the change of form.
CF Isn't telling people to use sterioids, they're telling people this man knows how to get people strong in the powerlifts. That's without any illegal supplementation, something the Westside methods have proved time and time again.
As Michael says, someone raises this every single time a video with Louie in it is posted and every time the same rebuttal is posted in reply.
For those of us who've been around through all of it, could the people complaining about Louie please go to his first video and just say "ditto" or something?
Jesus christ already... stop being so naive and listen to the man. "It illegal", "its wrong"... well in his world its part of the game and you better bet your ass in "your" world there are plenty who use as well...
Kindly don't use your being in the military as some platform to espouse personal ethics. I have known a LOT of military people who have used all sorts of illegal substances.
Louie doesn't advocate steroid use in the certs, he advocates proper training and lets me address nutrition. I can tell you with 100% certainty that his training methods for strength and strength endurance are as good as it gets. I GUARANTEE you can learn something if you will overcome your bias and listen to what he has to say.
By the way, yes, the group at that cert was STACKED with some studs and studettes! There were some serious athletes there.
Description This report presents the results from the 2006 annual omnibus survey of the opinions held by Idahoans on public affairs issues.
A part of Preservation Idaho, Idaho Modern was founded in 2010 to promote the appreciation and awareness of mid-century, modernist, and recent past architecture and design in Idaho through education and advocacy.
In 1995 Jonathan Reich he began his research on Troutner. Reich gave a lecture on Art Troutner for the Modernism Sumposium that took place in 2008. This paper was prepared at the time and it also is a chapter in the book The Green Braid: Towards an Architecture of Ecology, Economy, & Equity (ACSA Education Series).
Di and Drich Bowler founded Snake River Pottery and also ran the Antique theater out of their home between Bliss and Hagerman. They left the big city and bright lights of New Your for the pleasures of the west in 1946. They chose Art Troutner to design their home. This is Di's account of their western bliss. Bill Bowler of Moscow, Idaho shared this article with us. He is the nephew of Di and Drich.

UPDATE!! When I will be at the party will be different depending on your location! See below for your time!
Come and join me for a Happy New Year book release party. It will be going on ALL day for the release of B. E. McLaughlin's new book, Languish. McLaughlin's book is a mystery thriller.
When Cressida is kidnapped from her school, her parents go mad with grief and desperation to find their daughter. Luckily—as some believe, for the Clef's—one mother's celebrity status allows her tight-knit connections to the media. But as Chandra tries to fight off her wife's social explosion, her no nonsense attitude quickly turns to rage and fear when she realizes that the kidnapper is closer to her than she first expected.
Watching as everything starts to unravel before her eyes, Chandra risks the physical, mental, and social standing that she has to find her only daughter, her lifeline to the world. The lengths that one woman goes to protect her daughter test the bounds of a mother’s love and strength of mind.
I will be giving away a paperback copy of Conquering Your Goliaths: A Parable of the Five Stones AND The Feast: A Parable of the Ring on New Year's Day between 4 and 5 PM EST (2-3 P.M. MST). So please come on over and see what the party has in store for you!

About now you might be finding your purse strings a little tight. If so, consider giving a thoughtful letter instead of a carefully wrapped gift.
There is something about receiving a homemade gift (even if it doesn't exactly fit, or fit in with your color scheme),or receiving a service or a homemade card. Whether the giver has the money to spend or not, there's something truly magical to be said for the gift that comes completely from the heart.
I remember the year one of my daughters made me an ornament for the Christmas tree. She'd spent hours sewing the star together. She had just divorced her husband and had little money to spend. The star goes up every year on our Christmas tree, and I remember (every year) her thoughtful gesture.
Another year I got letters from my parents, plus some of stuff I no longer remember. I have saved the letters and re-read them.
Yet another year, a year when I had little children running around the house, we bought most of our gifts for each other from the thrift store. My favorite? An old doll house which my husband and I fixed up and gave to our children. The cost? Five dollars.
Maybe not having enough money sometimes is a good thing. It causes us to be creative, to think deeper than the bills in our wallet or our plastic credit card.
So if you're finding things a bit tight this year, and even if you're not, write a letter, (at least one) to a special someone in your life.
Unbelievably I finished all of the shopping last week. Though I still find myself purchasing small things here and there, I'm done, so to speak.
This week, the last few days before Christmas, is a little like finishing that long winded race; the race that was enjoyable at times, painful at others. When I see Christmas before me like a lit Christmas tree, I am ready to take the winnings in!
I reflect on the hugs from family and friends. The well wishes for a Merry Christmas. I reflect on neighbors coming to the door with gifts of candy, cookies and more. In a nutshell, these last few days as Christmas approaches I tend to think more on the Savior, more on his love and sacrifice for me a recipient (an ofttimes unworthy recipient) of his gift of sacrifice.
I do a little. But most of my time is spent doing other things. I find it more than a little difficult to work on my writing projects. At times I just want to sit and take it all in.

One of the real struggles of being a writer is finding the time to write, especially if you already have a full-time job away from it.
But the truth is, for every human being on this planet there are opportunities, free time if you will, to do what you are really interested in. And if it's writing, there should be plenty of time to do it.
One of the amazing things I discovered early on when it came to writing was that whenever I replaced television watching for writing, I'd spend far too much time away from what I loved the most. The same was true when I had Words with Friends on my cellphone. There simply wasn't enough time to write.
So I have shut off the tube more and have gotten rid of Words with Friends. I liked both pursuits, but found that much of my writing time was wasted when I substituted something I liked for something I loved.
Another issue with writing time comes in the form of distractions. These distractions (including again the two listed above) are those things that you find yourself doing simply because they occur on a given day.
Your mother calls you and speaks for an hour. Your friend drops by and you both decide to go to lunch. You have a terribly messy house and it needs to get cleaned sometime. Besides, cleaning will give you a chance to think about what your next book's going to be about.
But I have found that if I don't schedule a time for myself, say, 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. without distraction, meaning I don't pick up the phone, respond to a text, or even answer the door between those hours. And guess what? I will finally have time to get a little writing done.
I'm not suggesting for a minute that we aren't friendly, that we, as writers, become total hermits. Because, quite frankly, getting out does something wonderful for our souls, and we may just gather in some new elements for our latest book. What I am saying is that we both take our writing seriously enough to make it a priority.
Getting the most out of your writing time means choosing writing over something else that may be equally enjoyable. If you have little time to write as I do, you know that finding the time means taking it seriously enough to schedule it, just like you'd do a dentist appointment or lunch with a
May I make another suggestion? Talk to those close to you in your life and let them know when you'll be away from the phone or door because you're writing. If they are a true friend they will appreciate your honesty and dedication to your craft.
Wednesday, December 17, 2014 character interview , Matthew o duncan , the warrior's stone No comments
1 If you don't think interviews with particular characters can get a little, shall we say, interesting, check this one out:
Tell me a little about yourself (where you live, who you are, what you look like, what you hope to achieve, etc.
My name is Lt. Com Roy O'Hara. Currently I’m stationed aboard the T.S.S. Phoenix, the Command Ship for the first fleet. As a squadron leader I’m reasonable for training and leading 18 pilots on tactical and defensive missions against the enemy. Most of the men and woman in my command are about half my age. I’m 38 now. I had retired a few years ago, but with the war continuing we need every able bodied person on the line.
Spare time? We kind of don’t get a lot of down time. Haven’t had shore leave in, I don’t know, two years now. Spare time? You see we’re on call 24/7 so most of our time is spent on training, physical maintenance, analyzing recent engagements and reviewing repairs on our birds. But there are times when I don’t have duties that are pressing. I tend to us that time to eat, read a book, I like philosophy books and hit the rack for a few hours of shut eye.
The Serkin have no respect for life. Their goal is to kill or enslave us all. I would rather die than let
What or who means the most to you in your life? What, if anything, would you do to keep him/her/it in your life?
What one thing would you like readers to know about you that may not be spelled out in the book in which you inhabit?
Family is very important to me, but the war took that away from me and now all that is left for me is duty.
If you could tell your writer (creator) anything about yourself that might turn the direction of the plot, what would it be?
Look, no offence, but after twenty years of fighting and killing, I don’t really believe in a creator any more, at least not one who I would care to know.
Getting ready for Christmas is a grand feat, one not to be taken lightly, but as I said in a previous post, one to make some special one-on-one time for.
Imagine a few hours with the Lord without any distraction. Imagine to yourself the journey, the feelings in your heart, the memories.
If you haven't, as yet, sat down with the Lord this year reading his word, listening to his voice, here's one last nudge from me that you do so.
I’d always loved to read and write as a child, but it wasn't until I was in my twenties, living in London and working for an advertising agency that I decided to really go for it. Prior to moving to the UK I had been living in New Zealand where my parents had emigrated to from Los Angeles during my senior year in high school. One day I was walking down Regent Street and out of the blue I ran into one of my friends from my University of Auckland days. I couldn't believe it—neither could I believe that she had just married the New Zealand sci-fi and fantasy writer, Hugh Cook. We immediately picked up our friendship from where we’d left off, and Hugh, who had also been at the university with us, was very encouraging and helpful about my desire to write professionally. I don’t think I would ever have had the confidence or knowledge to pursue writing if it wasn't for his invaluable advice and interest. Sadly, Hugh passed away several years ago, but I will always remember him with sincere gratitude for his help.
During the week I mainly write at work—I know that sounds weird, but I have a very flexible schedule and find my office is the perfect location to come in early or stay late to get some writing done. I also write there during lunch and other breaks. On the weekends I love to go to coffee shops or museum cafes to write. I write my first drafts either by hand with a fountain pen, or on my Alphasmart. I always use the Alphasmart for second and subsequent drafts.
I love discovery drafts. I’m a panster all the way, but once that initial draft is finished I then impose a plot, strengthen my characters’ goals and motivations, and write a serious outline so that I can re-arrange and rewrite everything to follow a coherent storyline. My most disliked part of writing is the whole synopsis-thing in all its 1-page, 2-page, etc. formats.
I use a lot of visual references from magazines and other sources which I then turn into collages before I write. As I put the pictures together the characters and plots appear like magic—they tell me their stories, and I take dictation. I feel that when I hear them speak I am also meeting them for the first time as a reader, so if I enjoy what my characters have to tell me, someone reading about them might feel the same way too.
I have a website and a blog, and I’m fairly active on Twitter and Pinterest. My favorite social media site is Polyvore.com. I meet a lot of imaginative and creative people there who take an interest in my work. I've also found the best marketing is what I can do in person: teach a class or workshop, volunteer at a conference, or sell books at a local book fair.
My schedule can be very erratic, so I've learned to take advantage of whatever free time I can get. It’s one of the reasons I write by hand—it allows me to write absolutely anywhere: the car, waiting rooms, laundromats, hotel lobbies, and restaurants. I do write every day without fail—just not at the same time every day.
Starting next year I’ll be submitting my new novel, The Abyssal Plain for publication, as well as a nonfiction manuscript, A Pet Owner’s Book of Days, and a picture book manuscript. At the same time I’ll be working on the second draft of yet another novel.
I have several unpublished collections of poetry and short stories that I’m always tinkering with. My absolute dream is to illustrate them and publish them as art books.
First I would say that “talent” is in the eye of the beholder. What does it really mean? I've met hundreds of very talented writers who refuse to commit to the writing process, or finish a manuscript, or submit a manuscript for publication. So what does their “talent” give them except maybe a topic for conversation? The most important thing a writer needs is discipline (to both write and finish what he or she is writing) and perseverance. Keep writing, keep submitting. And read, read, read as widely as possible.
Yes, today I'm sharing one of my favorite book trailers; one that most folks also consider their favorite. If you have a book trailer to share, please let me know! I will post it here in one of the next coming Friday's!
I don't know about you, but about this time I start feeling a bit thirsty for some well needed Christmas. I'm not talking about more shopping, or decorating, or even caroling, I'm speaking of the stuff that comes when you take a breather and just let the Christmas season sink in.
Because in-between all of the sparkling lights and new hose for the upcoming Christmas party, there yet remains those moments to savor; those when we are with Christ--alone, for a time, quenching that thirst.
And I thought this morning, as I got up to exercise and begin another day; boy, I'm glad I took the time to drink in all of the goodness of the Lord.
I'm never discouraged about that. Never. I never wake up and wish I'd spent the time doing something else like watching a show on television. Never.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 character interview , literary gothic , overtaken , sarah elliott bergsen No comments
Tell me a little about yourself (where you live, who you are, what you look like, what you hope to achieve, etc.). I’m 32 years old, a professional artist living in London, and I’m also a newlywed. I was raised all over the world, thanks to my parents who were sound engineers working for various documentary film makers. Prior to my marriage I rarely paid much attention to my appearance, but since meeting my husband I've taken a new interest in beautiful, dramatic—and expensive—clothing. My dream is to be a highly-regarded portrait painter worthy of the National Portrait Gallery.
2. What do you like to do in your spare time? I don’t have a lot of spare time. I’m always working, but I do like to try out new mediums and supplies and go on sketching trips whenever I can.
3. What is your favorite color and why? My favorite color is Payne’s Grey. I love its ability to add depth and shadow to any color it touches. I also love the way it enhances negative space, which in many ways is one of the most important and interesting parts of a painting.
What is your favorite food? Why is it your favorite? Tapas. Small plates. Cheese, olives, fresh breads. I’m a vegetarian so I love anything salad-y and light.
5. What would you say is your biggest quirk? I fantasize the worst possible outcome of any situation. I worry. I’m insecure about absolutely everything.
6. What is it about your antagonist that irks you the most, and why? I have several antagonists and the thing that infuriates me about them is their inability to ever tell me the truth.
7. What or who means the most to you in your life? What, if anything, would you do to keep him/her/it in your life? My husband means the most to me of anything in my life. I would give up money, fame, reputation, even my ability to paint if it meant not losing him.
8. What one thing would you like readers to know about you that may not be spelled out in the book in which you inhabit? My childhood frightened me. I knew something was wrong, but I couldn't identify or describe it.
9. If you could tell your writer (creator) anything about yourself that might turn the direction of the plot, what would it be? I would love to have a child. I want to give someone the childhood I didn't have.
Ask me any question. I've always wanted to know what a character thinks about writers like myself. I'll answer the question at the end of this interview. They say many books and stories are autobiographical or based in some way on the author’s life, but does it ever work the other way? For instance, how much do we as characters change your life as an author? Do you ever take on any of our characteristics, hopes, and dreams and make them your own, or wish you were more like us?
I I love this question. In most of my books there is an inkling (or more) of me and a bit of what I wish I could be. There are times I want more than who I am and I find that through a character I've created I begin to see things a bit differently, and (dare I say it) even more clearly than when I first began the book. I may even decide to take a particular characteristic, hope or dream, on.
In high school I fell in love with Theater. Stepping out onto the stage and delivering a line that made over 200 people all laugh at once was the greatest feeling I had ever known. An odd path for someone who was normally quiet and shy, but the theater bug had bit and I was hooked. I chose to go to Northern Arizona University for college as it was far enough from home to be completely independent, but still a state school that wouldn't bankrupt by parent.
My major was Theater and my goal was to hone my acting craft and take Hollywood by storm. Then I went to my first college theater audition. Reality checks can be a cruel friend. Despite NAU being a small college, the talent amongst the small group of actors was overwhelmingly good. I never felt so out of my league. Somehow, I got a small part in that first show, but I could not see myself being successful in the face of such great talent. And if I couldn't compete on the college level, I would never make it in Hollywood or New York. Sadly I realized that acting was off the table, but I still loved Theater, so I stuck with it hoping I could find skill as a Director or Tech.
Back stage during the rehearsals for that show I was in, Bill, a senior, the lead in the show, and the most talented actor I had ever met, asked me where I got the monologue I used in the audition. I told him I had written it. “Really?” he said, “it was good. You should consider making it into a full play.”
Wow! This guy who I thought was 100 times more talented than me had just given me an unsolicited complement on something I had created. I had dabbled in writing before, getting encouragement from family and teachers, but never thought of it as a something I had a gift for.
The encouragement from the upperclassman who everyone looked up to was enough to keep kick start the project, but it was the words on the page that kept me going. I fell in love with the creative aspect of the work and had a complete one act play in just a couple of weeks. Now I’m not one of those writers that says, “I write for myself and don’t care if anyone likes it.”
To me that foolish. It’s like a poet who only read their work in a closet so no one can hear. So I needed to find something to do with my play. Fortunately every year the school held a play-writing contest open to all students. The interesting thing about it was that it was a blind competition. A group of professors would evaluate each entry, but would not know the name of the writers, since most would be students from their classes. My freshman year, going up against lower and upperclassman, I won. I won a contest that was completely based on my work and was not enhanced or limited on anyone’s opinion of me. I had found something that I was truly talented at and I loved it. A few months I received my prize, a black-box production of my play. To see my work come to life was better than being on stage and getting the laughs and tears myself. A world that I had created was brought to life before my eyes...
As time passed I kept writing on the side as a hobby and hoped I would find that inspiration to write a Broadway quality show, but as a career it was a very distant dream. Then I met this beautiful red head named Carleesa.
One of the first things she told me was that she liked a man who was as comfortable in a kilt as he was in a suit. She loved art, theater and anything creative. On our first date I told her my best theater and Disney stories as well as all about my plays. She hung on every word and I got lost in the joy found in her eyes. As you may have guessed we fell in love, got married, had two wonderful sons and…, well were still trying to live happily ever after. Our love for each other is stronger than ever, but life has not been that easy.
As we settled down I moved up into retail management and eventually became a store manager making a decent living. She had a career in non-profits as a charity campaign manager. Yet when the economy took a nose dive I got let go and couldn't find work for nearly a year, and once I did find work it only paid a quarter of what I was making. My spirits were crushed and I was feeling very lost. That year, when it was so bad we nearly lost our house; Carleesa never once blamed me or did anything to make me feel like I had failed in any way. Instead, on my birthday she gave me a copy of The Writers Market. A book I used to buy myself every year that would list all the publishers, agents and contest where you could submit writing. She included a message that said, “No matter how bad things get, I never want you to give up on your dreams.”
I picked back up the pen that day. There were a couple of ideas for plays I started, but there wasn't enough inspiration to finish them. Yet there was an idea for a couple of sci-fi characters that I had been thinking about for a very long time, but never had a story for. A space fighter pilot in the future meeting and falling in love with a beautiful, red headed, medieval woman who could do magic. Giving it more thought I considered it might make a good movie, but I needed to outline a story first. So I started writing out a short story, just so I could get it clear in my mind. Within a week I had over 42 pages and had hardly reached what would have been scene three. I was writing a novel and I was loving it.
Every day I couldn't wait to get some free time to write because, like a reader, I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. That’s how I write. With only a vague idea of where the story is going, I let my imagination flow out onto the page and discover it as I write. Each day my passion for the book grew and after five months of lunch hour and late night scribing I had completed the first draft. I presented it to my wife for her blessing. That sounds extreme, but it is because I trust her with not just my love, but with my life. She would never say an unkind word to me, but she would also never let me do anything that would lead to embarrassment or shame. So as a critic she is kind, but honest. When she read the book she told me that she loved the story and then discussed what could make it better.
One of the first lessons I learned was that I had habits of a playwright that I needed to get rid of, such as brief descriptions and relying on dialogue to tell the story. At that point I became a student of other writers, reading classic as well as contemporary books from the best sellers list. Studying entire series from a few authors to see how they progressed and listening to audio books to understand the pattern and timing in successful writing; all the while working on rewriting the book based on notes found on practically every page.
It took me an additional two years and ten drafts to finish the book The Warrior’s Stone. It is something that I am proud to put my name on and to list my Carleesa as my muse on the inside page.
I write the way people read. The idea for a story might be a character or situation, but I never know what’s going to happen until I write it. So my inspiration is to find out what is going to happen next. My lease favorite part of writing is going through the work and fixing all the typos and spelling errors that my editor has pointed out. Even though I have improved a lot, I still make a lot more mistakes than I should. One thing that I do to catch and fix them before I show the work to anyone is to have the computer read the text. It’s the difference between knowing what is supposed to be on the page and hearing what is really there that the eye didn't see.
It depends on the story. More often than not the main male character is an idealized version of myself. Not who I think I am, but who I wish I could be. The character of Roy, in the Warrior’s Stone, is brave, honest, very analytical, smart, cleaver, but also deals with deep emotional scars that make him cold and distant until he meets a woman who he can’t help but fall in love with.
My personal narrative has some similarities, but is not nearly as dramatic or interesting as Roy’s story. The main female character of Katreena beings with my wife, in her kindness, a need to be helpful to others and her ability to make those around her feel loved. Yet as I develop the story, that characters take on a life of their own. I don’t know what they are going to say or do until it happens. As I get to the end of the book, they have evolved into something different than what I started with, so I often have to go back to the beginning and rework parts to keep them true and consistent.
As an independent writer I don’t have the backing of a big publishing house, so I’m on my own for everything, from the book covers to the press. So most of what I do in on the internet; Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Authors web page, participating on book blogs, doing my own blog, and posting on any site that will let me. I also put together a couple of book trailers on YouTube, paid for some advertising on Google and Facebook (I don’t recommend) and paid for a press release. Yet in the end the best results have been from people I gave the book to and had them read it. So far everyone has loved it, recommended it to their friends and written great reviews on web pages like Amazon and Goodreads.
I’m finishing the rewrites and edits on book two of the New Terra Series, the sequel to the Warrior’s Stone and then will go back to book three. I actually started both book two and three at the same time and had planned on the other one to be the second book, but about five chapters in I decided the time line worked better to have that book come third.
Book two in the series should be out early 2015 and the third one out early 2016, so long as I can get all the rewrites and editing done. It’s hard for me to all a book done. I always feel like I can do better and put myself through another draft, which then requires proofing, editing and reviewing. So we will see.
Go to the library and check out three best selling writers in the genre that you want to write in. Here is what you will find. 1. They don’t use any magic words. The most popular writers don’t write like Shakespeare. They use everyday language they you and I do. 2. Read the work with a critical ear. Here is what I mean. As you read, listen to the voice in your head and break down the pattern and sounds as if you were listening to music. This is where you find the subtleties in successful writing. You will find that the best writers have learned to not over use words, unless it is in dialogue that fits the character, and they string their words together to keep the reader interested, even when the story drags. 3. Find someone you trust to read your work and give CONSTRUCTIVE feedback. This should be someone who loves to read and cares about you enough not to discourage you from writing. 4. Keep writing. No one ever wins their first race.

Here we are, days before this year ends and another begins. What do you do to prepare for the next year? Do you prepare? I do!
I begin preparing by reflecting on the last twelve months. My journal pages fill as I ask, “What have I accomplished and completed this year?” and “Who have I been?” I write for days and one thought leads into the next as my list grows. You see, when I begin, I often think that very little has actually been accomplished. Every day is busy and full. I find it is easy to forget once I’ve finished a project or accomplished a goal and I am already onto the next adventure. Allowing myself time to reflect is like looking at a photograph or into the woods. At first, I look at the whole scene, take in its feeling without the details. The longer I look more and more details emerge that I hadn’t seen on the first look. Nuances of color, wildlife pausing in camouflage, a bird perched on a branch watching me, a fallen tree that I didn’t see in the initial looking. There is always more to see as my focus changes and deepens. The details are both in the scene and in me, my own inner landscape in response to the outer landscape.
Reflecting back over my year requires that I take time to allow details to emerge — those details I’ve forgotten. Looking at the whole I can see and feel an experience (even the sense of non-accomplishment). My initial list is simple — drawn from the whole. As I stay with the list and begin to focus on parts (month by month or day by day) details emerge and I remember — listing the details. After a week my list has grown and I am both surprised and happy that I’ve done so much. I am grateful that most of my intentions, written a year ago, have been fulfilled. And there were many pleasant surprises as well. I always love the adventures I didn’t count on yet were an outgrowth of my intentions.
From the list of the last year, a new list begins to form. I have a new question, “What is in me that wants expressing this next year?” My new years list has begun with events already planned — workshops, writing, travel, etc.
Another question I ask is, “Who do I want to be this next year?” These are my inner intentions — equally important for these create the environment for many surprises. For example, I wish to be even more of my Best Self this coming year — appreciative, curious, open to new possibilities, and living more fully into the spirit of giving and loving.
Long ago, I dispensed with resolutions — those actions inspired by what I haven’t done. You know them — join the gym, eat better, write that book, finish that list of projects, etc. These nearly always end in the trash bin of unfulfilled hopes that I can later use to berate myself. Resolutions don’t grow from my Best Self. They grow from thoughts of not being good enough. Not good enough isn’t a firm foundation for growth, success, or surprise.
What provides a firm grounding for awe, curiosity, and positive growth come from my Best Self. For example, one of last years intentions was to remember what I deeply love about yoga, hiking, and the sweet surprises that I am grateful for every day. Looking back, I did remember what I love which led me to more varied hiking, appreciating the yoga retreat I just went on (that I hadn’t planned for) and every day was full of moments of gratitude. Looking back and reflecting, I am in awe of all I’ve done and experienced in 2016. This is my foundation built on what worked.
Beginning with 2017, my foundation is being my Best Self, allowing nature to be my mentor for living in trust and giving, and honoring community whether near or far. I’ve ended 2016 with a new appreciation of the importance of community. I intend to carry that forward in 2017. I’ve remembered and learned that all my relationships need nurturing just as my gardens need tending in order to assist in the best harvest possible. Some practices I will continue — gratitude, living from my strengths, my yoga, my daily writing practice, and my journeys into nature. These form my firm foundation for the next cycle of intentions. Some intentions already forming are taking action over inaction, allowing room for my voice to inform my actions. I’ve learned that action creates momentum and upward movement while inaction creates stagnation and downward motion. I like the upward spiral into positivity even if inaction is sometimes the familiar and easy way ‘out’. Action always leads me somewhere — adventure, new community, resilience, and fresh perspectives.
I invite you to reflect and plan for your next year. Begin with listing what was done last year as a foundation for the coming year. Write them down (if writing works for you), share them with someone you trust, create a work of art expression, and then appreciate all you’ve done.
7. What intentions will begin 2017 for you? Consider both specific plans and broader experiences in your intentions — leave room for surprises and opportunities yet to be discovered.
As we prepare to say good-bye to 2016, let’s go forward into the next year open to sweet surprises and fulfilled intentions in the most positive way.
There is a park I stop at every time I go to Cape May, New Jersey. This park is very close to my destination and is my last opportunity to let my dog have a walk before our arrival. It is the only park that is not connected to a food and gas rest stop. I have walked around this picnic area park every month for the past few years and, only recently, did I notice a holly tree surrounded with a small fence and a sign telling the story of the tree.
On reading the sign, I learned that the Holly Tree is over three hundred years old and is now surrounded by a grove of many younger holly trees. This particular holly tree was on the original landowners property before the Garden State Parkway was constructed. What I find most interesting is that, rather than cut down the tree which is too often the way, the people who bought the property for the Garden State Parkway decided to honor this tree that has grown there for so many years and reroute construction around the tree and create a picnic area for travelers to enjoy!
Each time I stop at that picnic area, I stop to see and honor that tree. I am in awe that one tree was the reason the Parkway was constructed with a picnic area in the middle of almost nowhere and without a food court or gas station! That holly tree and all it’s surrounding offspring continue to grow, are cared for by someone, and provide an area to enjoy nature as the traffic continues on. I wonder how many people who travel the parkway are aware that this park exists because of a tree that has survived over three hundred years? I wonder what history has surrounded this tree in those many years — who were the people who originally enjoyed the shade of that tree?
Of course, this has raised another, more current question for me. If one tree has been preserved and a major highway rerouted around it can happen, why can’t the pipeline contractors at Standing Rock find another route for their pipeline in order to honor and preserve the history of our country and it’s indigenous people and their sacred lands? Those lands have been sacred land for far longer than three hundred years. Have we not taken enough from our indigenous people?
It saddens me to realize that this holly tree preservation is such a rare happening. What would it take to reroute other plans in order to preserve our history, our environment, and honor the people who live on that land?
I am inspired by the ancient holly tree that continues to stand because someone decided to honor its existence and find a way to keep it standing. I want to be inspired by the goodness in people everywhere to find ways to respect one another, be kind to one another, and care for our history — its people and the land.
I am a worrier. Yes, I can be a serious hand-wringer when something happens and uncertainty ensues or unexpected change is in the works. I consider myself an expert at worrying. I have often thought if there were a way to advertise, “Let me worry for you”, I would be a millionaire twice over! I am good at imagining the worst-case scenarios just to be sure my worry is worthwhile. I used to think that considering the worst that could happen was somehow preparing me for what was coming and if I could live with the worst, then all would be okay.
I was also taught that “God never gives us more than we can handle.” On some deep level, I think I still believe that along with flushing out worst-case scenarios even though both leave too much room for worry…
I am in a worry session now which has had me struggling about how to write a positive blog post (honestly, my blog is called ‘Happy, Healthy, and The Prepared Mind,’ implying positivity). My truth right now is worry over happy… I have numerous tools to use that could ease my angst and I find my mind a blank slate for even one practice that could pull me in an upward trajectory. Meditation, positivity practices like gratitude or kindness, even permission to be human (all my go to practices) aren’t helping. My other practices that usually work — yoga and nature walks — seem only to open space for more worry.
Ever have one of those days? or a string of those days? I hear myself asking, “What can I do?” or “What’s a solution?” And then I continue worrying because I have no immediate or helpful answer, no immediate (or positive) solutions.
Even in this current state I continue my routine practices and hope that my mind will move to calmness when ready. During my meditations my mind often finds calm from worry and clarity arrives if only in a momentary glimpse. I continue to hope.
Then, I arise from meditation with the question, “What can I do?” Answer: What I always do. Take action. Immediate action.
For today, I picked up my knitting as my action to keep my hands and mind busy. Do I need another scarf, pillow, or blanket? It doesn’t really matter — just knit. I knit or, more accurately, I create. Keeping my hands, mind, and body busy with creative action always helps me focus. I need action that is engaging to my senses — creating something does just that, engages more of my senses, provides a sense of purpose (even if for a brief while), and I appreciate the respite from my worry.
As I settle into knitting my shoulders relax as my hands are busy with the process of knit/purl, my mind is engaged with counting stitches to track my design, my senses are further engaged with the steady sound of the knitting needles, and I am taking action, moving forward.
Is this action toward a solution to my worry? Yes and no. There is not a direct solution to the topic of my worry, however, there is forward motion engaging in something I love to do. I hear my mind repeating my personal mantra adapted from Dory in “Finding Nemo”, ‘just keep knitting, just keep knitting.’ I continue to be absorbed in the task of knit and purl and, as I do, I notice a gradual redirect from my angst and fresh ideas begin to pop into my thoughts between stitches.
Staying with it, my mind and body move into a flow state where there is only the action at hand while all else fades into the background. Much research on flow has been done by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi where he presents the importance of flow states for wellbeing and a sense of purpose. Once I emerge from my flow states, I feel calmer, full of ideas, and I am aware of more space in and around me. This open space allows more positivity, relief, and room to explore solutions to the topic of my worry. I feel a glimmer of upward motion and a deep breath into the space that is so much more than my angst.
Action that leads me into a flow state is my recipe for changing my trajectory to a more positive and meaningful direction. Some people clean, organize, and throw things away as their focus action. I know many who create something, anything. Through action, any focused creation, appropriate action and solutions can present themselves. I trust that.
Being human means navigating change, unexpected as well as planned change. For me, worry has been and continues to be my default setting. What’s yours? Worry, though oh so familiar, always circles the drain downward. Taking action helps me spiral upward into a more resourceful state where solutions reside.
I do give space to my worry, angst, fear, and anger. I try to embrace the feelings that are painfully present. In other words, I give myself space to allow the feelings to be as they are without trying to make them go away. I also set a time limit on my wallowing or ruminating time so I don’t get sucked into too much darkness and despair.
Mindfulness is another practice in positive psychology as well as in many spiritual practices. Ellen Langer, a leading positive psychologist, refers to mindfulness as being actively aware. Through mindfulness I learn about myself so that I can change if and when necessary. Being mindful of my worry, listening to my minds story about a situation, and drawing on past practices of what I know works to change direction or course, I can begin to return to my upward spiral.
After my allotted two days of commendable worrying (I do give 110% to that time) and action through knitting (and some cleaning), I woke this morning with renewed energy. The world is more colorful again and a song is in my heart and mind. I am grateful for my worry, for my action, flow states, mindfulness, and trust in my process.
On a final note, taking action doesn’t necessarily mean action related to the topic of concern. My actions were focused in three tracks: 1. knitting to enter my flow state; 2. cleaning and accomplishing three things at home to clear space; and 3. wrote in my journal by telling the story that held me in angst in as much detail as possible. After several writing sessions listening to the running inner dialogue, I began a more meaningful conversation with myself, began a more positive story, and discovered solutions in a hopeful direction. All these actions quelled my concerns and helped me refocus on what is positive.
This year has rushed by, and I can see why with being as busy as I have been with school and work. First-year terms are coming to an end. They finish up on May 13th leaving me with two years and two terms to go before acquiring that Bachelor degree. Microeconomics is not one of my favorite subjects. Economics, in general, are not a favorite either. I haven’t struggled this hard since taking Principles of Finance though I sure I’m going to pass.
I discovered a couple of good buys this weekend on Amazon dot com. One of which was the book, Writing Romances – A Handbook by the Romance Writers of America. I picked the book up the used book for $6. It turned out to be a sweet find. I plan on reading a minimum of one chapter a day. So far it has taught me about the functions of an agent, and now I’m learning about the duties of a publishing house editor. This book holds the nuts and bolts about publishing.
The other book I found in the used book section is the Chicago Manual of Style 15th edition that I picked up for $10. The 17th edition is about to release, but the used version will suffice for now, which is better than going without any edition.
I love stumbling across things, especially great deals. So what if the RWA book was published back in 1996 even though so much has changed in the publishing world, some things never change that drastically like what editors do or what agents do. Yes, we have moved into an electronic era, but print books are making a comeback. I have found electronics to be hard on the eyes, and there is still that something about being able to hold a physical book in your hands. If I have to have that book, it will be a print edition, but if I’m not sure whether or not I will like the book, I tend to go with the electronic version. Why waste a tree on paper if the book is not worth reading?
I will return to them in time. Ideas are beginning to flow, and I can feel a story brewing in the back of my mind. I should be journaling every day. That won’t happen. The next 12 weeks will be hectic with school. I will have two back to back crash courses that will contain eight weeks of work to be completed in 6 weeks each. – My summer school. What I do to try and get ahead in life all because my story ideas seemed so lame at the time. Now I barely have enough time to post to my blog.
Interviews – I could not only host questions and answers with writers but what about professionals in every neck of the woods. Hmm… what a thought.
I wonder which of these will find their way to the surface the most, who knows what the coming year will bring besides being one more year closer to getting that degree.

Insurance companies are programmed to assume most insureds filing for disability are either faking or exaggerating their inability to sustain work. It is presumed between 15-20 percent of disability applications received are fraudulent and shouldn’t be paid, therefore, the majority of insureds and claimants endure aggressive risk management so that insurers can locate the minority of claims that are submitted fraudulently. But, it’s more than that.
Disability policies contain provisional language limiting benefits to 24 months at the discretion of insurers. This means all disability insurers can deny claims based on internal medical reviews stating claims are “mental and nervous”; the impairment is “somaticized (all in your head); or due to “self-reported” symptoms. All it takes is an insurance internal review stating primary diagnoses are listed in the DSM-IV (or V), or “self-reported.”
Mental and Nervous disorders as defined for disability claims purposes are mental impairments listed in the DSM-IV(V), Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is my understanding that although CFS and FMS were not listed specifically as mental disorders in the DSM-IV, they are now listed in the DSM-V as “somaticized” mental disorders. This is why insurers are now denying FMS and CFS under the 24-month mental and nervous provisions of the policy.
The word “somatic” means made-up, exaggerated, or “all in your head.” “Conversion disorder” is a good example of a somaticized disorder that can cause epileptic-like seizures, fainting spells, and even paralysis without any direct physical cause. In general, any disorder listed in the DSM-IV except Alzheimer’s and organic brain disease is accepted as qualifying for limited benefits in most STD/LTD policies. LTD policies now refer directly to the DSM-IV as reference to impairments for which limited benefits are paid.
Alleging various impairments are “self-reported” is the area in which most claim abuse occurs. By definition, self-reported impairments are those that cannot be backed up by objective evidence confirming what patients and physicians diagnose is actually true. For example, headaches, pain, depression, and Lyme disease are most often characterized as self-reported.
A “severe headache” for one person may not be for someone else.What is painful to one person might not be painful at all to another. Therefore, while most disability polices DO NOT contain wording requiring the “objective evidence standard”, self-reported provisions require objective evidence through the back door so to speak. (If there is no objective evidence, then it must be self-reported.)
Insurance companies also have the view insureds and claimants can “make-up” or fake bad headaches so they can go out on disability, and exaggerate pain to higher levels for the same reason, or to solicit higher doses of pain medication. Some people are able to continue working with rather high levels of pain, others cannot. As a former claims specialist I can tell you there ARE claimants who DO exaggerate symptoms in order to go out on disability or remain on disability longer.
While most insureds and claimants are honest, there are always those who use the opportunity of disability to stay disabled as long as they possibly can instead of going back to work. Those who are legitimately disabled pay a huge price because of those who abuse the system. It actually takes a very serious impairment to last to age 65 or qualify for SSDI.
Mental and nervous provisions limit insurers’ liability for claims beyond 24 months because of the subjective nature of attempting to verify impairments for which there is no objective proof of existence. Insurers are paranoid about obtaining actual psychotherapy notes in an effort to objectify mental illness, but once obtained information is “snatched’ at the expense of the insured to further limit benefits to even shorter payment periods.
Bottom line? Disability policies pay for mental illness and self-reported claims for limited periods of time. Policies are not intended to pay beyond 24 months for mental and nervous disorders. Although most Individual Disability Income policies (non-ERISA) omit mental and nervous limitations, self-reported disabilities are aggressively risk managed with psychological IMEs, neuropsychological evaluations and patient records requests.
Most insurers presume depression claims with appropriate therapy and medication management should be resolved within 12 months. More serious mental impairments such as Bipolar I&II and Personality disorders are paid for longer periods of time although they, too, are aggressively risk managed.
Those who are legitimately disabled due to mental and nervous conditions should apply immediately for SSDI so that when disability benefits end after 24 months, there is additional income available to support financial needs. It’s not a wise idea to depend on disability insurers to pay claims long-term for mental and nervous or self-reported disabilities. There’s just too much abuse built into the process.

Red Gold is a midseason maturity potato with pink-red skin and a bright yellow flesh. It is characterized by having a high set per plant of medium-small sized tubers. Marketable yields in Ontario, Canada are similar to or slightly less than Conestoga, Yukon Gold, and Superior. Boiling, baking, and field chip quality are acceptable with medium specific gravities (1.070–1.080). Short tuber dormancy makes this variety well adapted for whole seed tuber production for fall export markets. Red Gold has performed well in trials in Uruguay. Red Gold is moderately resistant to scab, field resistant to virus Y and leafroll, and susceptible to mild mosaic.
Named after the Red River, which runs through Manitoba and between North Dakota and Minnesota, and for its yellow flesh colour.

It appears that, at the time the Antichrist is killed and his deadly wound is healed, a spirit will come up out of the bottomless pit to occupy the body of the Antichrist. This spirit was once alive before this was written, in approximately 96 or 97 A.D. (once WAS), but was dead at the time this was written (now IS NOT), and "shall come up out of the bottomless pit" at some future date (SHALL ASCEND). Nevertheless, the Antichrist will ultimately go into "perdition" (or destruction)-ref Rev 17:8,11 KJV, NIV. The people of the earth, who will ultimately perish, shall be astonished when they see the Antichrist that was in the past (before 96 A.D.) and yet is before them during the Tribulation.
It is written, THE BEAST (which, in this case, is the Antichrist) THAT THOU SAWEST (once) WAS, AND (now) IS NOT; AND SHALL ASCEND (or come up) OUT OF THE BOTTOMLESS PIT (or Abyss), AND GO INTO PERDITION (or he goes to destruction)-Rev 17:11.
AND THEY (the inhabitants) THAT DWELL ON THE EARTH SHALL WONDER, WHOSE NAMES WERE NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE FROM THE FOUNDATION (or founding, or creation) OF THE WORLD (or will be astonished), WHEN THEY BEHOLD (or see) THE BEAST THAT (once) WAS, AND (now) IS NOT, AND YET IS (to appear or will come)-Rev 17:8.
There is much speculation who this person (that appears to have lived either during the time of Christ or before) might be. Some believe it is Nebuchadnezzar. Some believe it could be Judas, because the Antichrist is called the "son of perdition" in 2 Thes 2:3, and Judas was also called the "son of perdition" in Jn 17:12. Some believe it is Satan; others think it may be Antiochus Epiphanes. At this point in time, we do not know who it is.
AND HERE IS THE MIND WHICH HATH WISDOM (or this calls for a mind with wisdom-NIV). THE SEVEN HEADS (which were mentioned back in Rev 17:3), ARE SEVEN MOUNTAINS (or hills), ON WHICH THE WOMAN (or city) SITTETH-Rev 17:9. Rome sits on seven hills or mountains. It is reported that ancient Babylon sat on a plain, not on mountains.
AND THERE ARE SEVEN KINGS: FIVE ARE FALLEN, AND ONE IS (living now), AND THE OTHER IS NOT YET COME (the Antichrist); AND WHEN HE COMETH, HE MUST CONTINUE A SHORT SPACE (or a little while)-Rev 17:10. Seven kings are mentioned here. The date that the Revelation was written was around 96 or 97 A.D. This verse speaks of five kings that "are fallen." These represent five kings, or possibly kingdoms, that fell prior to this being written. The one "that is," refers to a king that existed at the time this was written. The other that "is not yet come" is referring to the Antichrist. The Antichrist must continue a short space (or a short time) after he comes. He will reign in Jerusalem for three and a half years.
Some believe that the seven represent seven emperors of the Roman Empire. Five were dead, one existed at the time this was written, and another was yet to come. Others believe that the seven represent seven forms of government in the Roman Empire.
AND THE BEAST THAT (once) WAS, AND (now) IS NOT, EVEN HE IS THE EIGHTH (king), AND IS OF (or comes from) THE SEVEN. The Antichrist is the eighth king, but comes from one of the seven AND GOETH INTO PERDITION (or is on its way, or going to his destruction)-Rev 17:11. Dan 9:26 shows that the Antichrist shall be of the people that would come and destroy Jerusalem; this happened approximately 70 A.D. Those that came were of the Roman Empire.
It might be noted that the first beast (the Antichrist) came out of the sea-ref Rev 13:1. This may denote the nations. He may have been born and raised in a place other than Israel. His rise to power seems to come through the EEC. He comes from the old Roman Empire nations, yet he is probably a Jew. It would seem impossible for the Jews to accept any person as their Messiah, if he were not from the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As a result of this supernatural event of the Antichrist rising from the dead, THEY WORSHIPED THE DRAGON (or Satan) WHICH GAVE POWER UNTO THE BEAST (which is the Antichrist) (or because he had given his authority to the beast-JNT62): AND THEY WORSHIPED THE BEAST (which is the Antichrist), SAYING, WHO IS LIKE UNTO THE BEAST? WHO IS ABLE TO MAKE WAR (or fight) WITH HIM?-Rev 13:4. AND ALL (or everyone, or all inhabitants) THAT DWELL UPON THE EARTH SHALL WORSHIP HIM (the beast), (all) WHOSE NAMES ARE NOT WRITTEN IN THE BOOK OF LIFE OF THE LAMB SLAIN (or slaughtered) FROM THE FOUNDATION (or creation) OF THE WORLD. IF ANY MAN HAVE AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR-Rev 13:8,9. All the world, except those whose names are in the book of life, will submit to the Antichrist. They will worship him.
Jesus had said, I AM COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME, AND YE RECEIVE ME NOT: IF ANOTHER (the Antichrist) SHALL COME IN HIS OWN NAME, HIM YE WILL RECEIVE-Jn 5:43.
Satan craves worship. He said, I WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH-Isa 14:14. The devil told Jesus that he would give Him all the kingdoms of the world, if He would fall down and worship him-ref Mt 4:9. Jesus told the devil, IT IS WRITTEN, THOU SHALT WORSHIP THE LORD THY GOD, AND HIM ONLY SHALT THOU SERVE-Mt 4:10. He refused. However, the Antichrist, which is the great counterfeit, will accept this invitation. Satan will give him ALL the kingdoms of the world; however, his rule will only last 1260 days. Satan seeks to receive the worship that is only reserved for God the Father.
NEITHER SHALL HE (the Antichrist) REGARD THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS-Dan 11:37. This may indicate he is a Jew from one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The "God of his fathers" may be talking about the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
As God the Father gave His only begotten Son authority from heaven, so Satan has given the Antichrist HIS POWER, AND HIS SEAT, AND GREAT AUTHORITY-Rev 13:2.
During the first part of the Tribulation, a temple will be built in Jerusalem. Sacrifices and oblations will begin as in olden times. However, in the midst of the week, the Antichrist shall be killed, but then returns to life. He moves into the temple in Jerusalem and stops the sacrifices and oblations.
It is written, IN THE MIDST OF THE WEEK (which is the Tribulation) HE (the Antichrist) SHALL CAUSE THE SACRIFICE AND THE OBLATION (or offering) TO CEASE (or end)-Dan 9:27.
God tells Israel, regarding the covenant with the Antichrist, AND YOUR COVENANT WITH DEATH SHALL BE DISANNULLED (or canceled), AND YOUR AGREEMENT (or pact) WITH HELL (or the grave) SHALL NOT STAND; WHEN THE OVERFLOWING (or overwhelming) SCOURGE SHALL PASS THROUGH (or sweeps by), THEN YE SHALL BE TRODDEN (or beaten) DOWN BY IT (you become its trampling place-NASB). The very agreement that Israel thought would be their protection is now going to be their downfall. FROM THE TIME THAT IT GOETH FORTH (or as often as it passes through-NASB) IT SHALL TAKE (or seize) YOU (or carry you away): FOR MORNING BY MORNING SHALL IT PASS OVER (or sweep through), BY DAY AND BY NIGHT: AND IT SHALL BE A VEXATION (or sheer terror) ONLY TO UNDERSTAND THE REPORT (or message) (to understand what it means-NASB)-Isa 28:18,19. For those that can understand what has happened, for those that can understand the report (or message), it will bring sheer terror. The fulfillment of this prophecy appears to happen at this point.
FOR THE BED IS SHORTER THAN THAT A MAN CAN STRETCH HIMSELF ON IT (the bed is too short-NASB): AND THE COVERING (or blanket) NARROWER (or too small) THAN THAT HE CAN WRAP HIMSELF IN IT-Isa 28:20. The Antichrist and the covenant represent the bed. The bed is too short. It will not accomplish the purpose that Israel thought it would. It will not save them. It cannot protect them. The covering that is supplied by the Antichrist is too narrow. A person cannot wrap himself in it for protection. The only true protection a person can really have is Jesus. All other beds are too short, and all other coverings are too narrow. All other coverings will pass away.
AND THROUGH HIS POLICY ALSO (or shrewdness) (or through what he does, or decrees) HE SHALL CAUSE CRAFT (or deceit) TO PROSPER (or succeed) IN HIS HAND (or by his influence). This can also denote the powers of the darkness. Supernatural powers will be manifested and will prosper. AND BY PEACE (or while they are at ease-NASB) (the Antichrist) SHALL DESTROY MANY-Dan 8:25.
It appears this man of sin will be a diplomat of sorts that will bring forth great wisdom and knowledge. The world will welcome this evil person.
AND (the Antichrist) SHALL PROSPER (or be successful). During "his" time (the Tribulation), the Antichrist shall succeed. His success will continue, TILL THE INDIGNATION (or time of wrath, which is the Tribulation) BE ACCOMPLISHED (or completed, or finished)-Dan 11:36.
Neither does the Antichrist have THE DESIRE OF WOMEN-Dan 11:37. The wording in some other translations appears slightly different. This could indicate he does not desire women. He may be single. We can expect him to try to duplicate many of the scriptures pertaining to Jesus.
The Antichrist, once he moves into the temple, will continue in power a short time. He will continue for forty-two months, until the end that is determined for him to reign. He will continue until the time of wrath is completed. The saints shall be given into his hand for 3 ½ years.
It is written, AND WHEN HE (the Antichrist) COMETH, HE MUST CONTINUE A SHORT SPACE (or a little while)-Rev 17:10.
AND POWER (or authority) WAS GIVEN UNTO HIM TO CONTINUE (or exercise his authority for) FORTY AND TWO MONTHS-Rev 13:5.
EVEN UNTIL THE CONSUMMATION (or end)-Dan 9:27. The Antichrist shall reign for 3 1/2 years, or 42 months, or 1260 days, until the end of the time that is determined for him to reign.
The Antichrist originally comes forth as a result of the working of Satan. It is through Satan that he has his power, position, and authority. He has power to work all kinds of false miracles. He is able to do things that are beyond human ingenuity and ability. He is able to do supernatural feats. His power will be mighty. People will be amazed. Through these miracles, people will be fully persuaded that he really is God.
It is written, EVEN HIM (this man, the lawless one) (which is the Antichrist), WHOSE COMING IS AFTER (or in accordance with) THE WORKING OF SATAN WITH ALL POWER (to work all kinds of false miracles-JNT63) AND SIGNS AND LYING WONDERS-2 Thes 2:9. These are to persuade or deceive people into believing that the Antichrist is really God and is speaking the truth.
AND HIS (the Antichrist's) POWER SHALL BE MIGHTY (or very strong), BUT NOT BY HIS OWN POWER-Dan 8:24.
It is written, AND POWER (or authority) WAS GIVEN HIM OVER ALL KINDREDS (or every tribe, or people), AND TONGUES (or language), AND NATIONS-Rev 13:7.
The Antichrist shall speak proud or arrogant words. He can be expected to accuse God of all manner of things. He will blaspheme and speak great things against the God of heaven that have never been heard. He will slander His name, His tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.
The Antichrist shall honor the god of forces. He will honor Satan with gold, silver, precious stones, and costly gifts. He will glorify the devil.
It is written, BUT IN HIS ESTATE (or instead of them) SHALL HE HONOR THE GOD OF FORCES (or fortresses): AND A GOD WHOM HIS FATHERS KNEW NOT (which is Satan)-Dan 11:38.
In Dan 11:37, it reads, "THE GOD OF HIS FATHERS." Here the words appear, a god whom "his fathers" knew not. This could reinforce the possibility that the Antichrist is a Jew. The false god here is the Dragon, which is Satan-ref Rev 13:2,4; 20:2. He is called a "strange god" in Dan 11:39.
This "strange god" SHALL HE HONOR WITH GOLD, AND SILVER, AND WITH PRECIOUS STONES, AND PLEASANT (or costly) THINGS (or gifts)-Dan 11:38. The Antichrist shall honor Satan; the world will also worship the Dragon, which is Satan-Rev 13:3,4.
The Antichrist will be given power and authority to make war against the saints of God, to overcome or prevail against them. The saints will have no power to defeat the Antichrist. For 3 ½ years he shall greatly oppress those that have been born-again until Jesus returns. The saints will have to flee for their lives. Many of those that do flee will be betrayed by their closest friends or relatives. Many can expect to be caught, greatly persecuted, humiliated, beaten, tortured, and then beheaded. Many will turn from their faith under this immense pressure. A remnant will escape and repopulate the earth during the Millennium. For those misled people that think there shall be no Rapture before the Tribulation, these verses should have a terrifying effect. The only power the saints will have to overcome the Antichrist will be, THEY LOVED NOT THEIR LIVES UNTO THE DEATH-Rev 12:11. Satan shall also destroy the "holy" people.
It is written, AND IT WAS GIVEN (or allowed) UNTO HIM (the Antichrist) TO MAKE WAR WITH THE SAINTS (or God's holy people), AND TO OVERCOME (or conquer, or defeat) THEM-Rev 13:7.
I BEHELD (or watched), AND THE SAME HORN (this is the Antichrist) MADE (or was waging) WAR WITH (or against) THE SAINTS. The Antichrist wishes to abolish all Christianity. All that follow Jesus, he wants to kill. AND PREVAILED AGAINST THEM (defeating them)-Dan 7:21. UNTIL THE ANCIENT OF DAYS CAME-Dan 7:22. This is Jesus returning.
AND (the Antichrist) SHALL WEAR OUT (or oppress) THE SAINTS OF THE MOST HIGH…AND THEY (the saints) SHALL BE GIVEN INTO HIS HAND (or handed over to him) UNTIL A TIME (one year) AND TIMES (two years) AND THE DIVIDING OF TIME (½ year), which equals 3 ½ years-Dan 7:25.
There was a war in heaven: Satan and his angels, fought against the archangel Michael and his angels. The devil and his angels are defeated. They are cast out of heaven. Satan, which deceiveth the whole world and accused the brethren day and night, has fallen from heaven. There is rejoicing in heaven; however, it is very bad news for the people of the earth. The devil is now among the inhabitants of the earth. He is furious and has great wrath. He is like a wild, raging animal with great power. He understands, at this time, that his days are numbered. He knows that he has only a short time left, which is 3 ½ years. He goes forth to utterly destroy anyone upon the face of the earth that follows Jesus.
It is written, AND THERE APPEARED ANOTHER WONDER (or sign) IN HEAVEN; AND BEHOLD (there was) A GREAT (or enormous) RED DRAGON (which is Satan). The word "great" denotes something of importance and power. The word "red" may depict that he is a murderer, a shedder of blood. It may signify the incredible amount of the saint’s blood that will be shed during the Tribulation. This term "red dragon" is used only in the Revelation denoting Satan. The word "dragon" denotes "a fabulous winged monster, a fierce person," reference The New Webster’s Dictionary. The word "serpent," as is often applied to Satan, indicates great deceptive powers and can also denote being wise or wisdom-ref Mt 10:16.
Satan is portrayed as HAVING SEVEN HEADS AND TEN HORNS, AND SEVEN (royal) CROWNS UPON HIS HEADS-Rev 12:3. The number seven often refers to completeness.
* The seven heads are seven mountains, and there are seven kings. Also see Rev 17:3,9,10; 13:1. There is debate, if the seven kings apply here or not.
* The ten horns are ten kings (or kingdoms) during the Tribulation. Also see Rev 17:3,12; Dan 7:7,20,24. They are also referred to as the ten toes of Dan 2:40-45. The ten horns can also symbolize power.
* The seven crowns may represent seven kings, which represent seven empires. Also see Rev 17:10. They may also stand for Satan’s authority during the Tribulation. Note, in Rev 13:1, the description of the beast is nearly identical to the description of Satan in this verse.
AND THERE WAS WAR (or a battle) IN HEAVEN. When the war began is not stated; however, the culmination of the war should take place at approximately the midst of the Tribulation. MICHAEL AND HIS ANGELS FOUGHT AGAINST THE DRAGON (which is Satan); AND THE DRAGON (which is Satan) FOUGHT (back) AND HIS ANGELS-Rev 12:7. It may be noted that Satan has angels that follow him.
(A note of interest). The angel, Michael, is mentioned as ONE OF THE CHIEF PRINCES. He came to assist Daniel and to help him know certain things-ref Dan 10:13,14. Also note Dan 10:20. Michael is, also, mentioned as THE GREAT PRINCE WHICH STANDETH FOR THE CHILDREN OF THY PEOPLE (Israel)-Dan 12:1. Michael is called THE ARCHANGEL. He contended WITH THE DEVIL HE DISPUTED ABOUT THE BODY OF MOSES, but he did not BRING AGAINST HIM A RAILING ACCUSATION, BUT SAID, THE LORD REBUKE THEE-Jude 9. In the Revelation, Michael is shown to have angels. He fought against Satan and his angels. Michael won, Hallelujah! It appears he will be present at the Rapture-ref 1 Thes 4:16. The name Michael means, "Who is like God?"
AND (Satan) PREVAILED NOT (he was not strong enough-NIV) (to win); NEITHER WAS THEIR PLACE FOUND ANY MORE IN HEAVEN (they lost their place in heaven-NIV)-Rev 12:8. Satan's access to heaven, from this time, is forever cut off. Up to this time, Satan has had access to heaven; as it is written, NOW THERE WAS A DAY WHEN THE SONS OF GOD CAME TO PRESENT THEMSELVES BEFORE THE LORD, AND SATAN CAME ALSO AMONG THEM. AND THE LORD SAID UNTO SATAN, WHENCE COMEST THOU? THEN SATAN ANSWERED THE LORD, AND SAID, FROM GOING TO AND FRO IN THE EARTH, AND FROM WALKING UP AND DOWN IN IT-Job 1:6,7. THE ACCUSER OF OUR BROTHERS, WHO ACCUSES THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT, HAS BEEN HURLED DOWN-Rev 12:10 NIV.
AND I HEARD A LOUD VOICE SAYING IN HEAVEN, NOW IS COME SALVATION (or God's victory), AND STRENGTH (or power), AND THE KINGDOM OF OUR GOD (or kingship), AND THE POWER (or authority) OF HIS CHRIST (or Messiah): FOR THE ACCUSER OF OUR BRETHREN (or brothers) IS CAST (or thrown, or hurled) DOWN-Rev 12:10. The saints in heaven are rejoicing. Satan has, once and for all, been cast out of heaven. Verses 10 through 12 are taking place in heaven. The devil has been cast down; this occurs at the approximate time of the midst of the Tribulation. This gives us the timing of these three verses.
The verse continues, WHICH ACCUSED THEM BEFORE OUR GOD DAY AND NIGHT-Rev 12:10. Satan had accused the brethren before God, day and night. The saints of all ages have undergone the slander and abusive accusations of the devil. However, Jesus our High Priest sits at the right hand of God, making intercession for the saints. Because of their faith in Jesus and through His shed blood, no accusation against the saints can reach God. For Jesus is the propitiation for the sins of the saints. As it is written, AND HE IS THE PROPITIATION FOR OUR SINS: AND NOT FOR OURS ONLY, BUT ALSO FOR THE SINS OF THE WHOLE WORLD-1 Jn 2:2. THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION TO THEM WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS, WHO WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH, BUT AFTER THE SPIRIT. FOR THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS HATH MADE ME FREE FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND DEATH-Ro 8:1,2. The saints are justified by the blood of the Lamb-ref Ro 5:9.
THEREFORE REJOICE, YE HEAVENS, AND YE THAT DWELL (or live) IN THEM-Rev 12:12. There is rejoicing, because Satan has been cast down.
Verse 12 now continues with the same thought as v.9. (But) WOE TO THE INHABITERS OF THE EARTH AND OF THE SEA! FOR THE DEVIL (the adversary) IS COME DOWN UNTO YOU, HAVING GREAT WRATH (he is very angry), BECAUSE HE KNOWETH THAT HE HATH BUT A SHORT TIME (he knows that his time is short!-JNT64). God is giving the inhabitants of the earth and the sea a stern warning. "Woe." This is because the devil has been cast out of heaven. It appears he is now confined to the earth. He is very angry. He might be compared to a raging, wild animal with enormous power. He goes forth in great fury to destroy anyone that follows Jesus and rejects the Antichrist. Once Satan is cast down, he then understands that he has a short time left. That short time is approximately three and a half years. It would appear that he understands, at this point, that his imprisonment in the pit is only about twelve hundred and sixty days away. The demons also appear to know of their allotted time, as they asked Jesus, ART THOU COME HITHER TO TORMENT US BEFORE THE TIME?-Mt 8:29. The greatest slaughter of Christians, in the history of the church, is about to begin.
It is written, AND THERE WAS GIVEN ME A REED LIKE UNTO A (measuring) ROD: AND THE ANGEL STOOD, SAYING, RISE, AND MEASURE THE TEMPLE OF GOD, AND THE ALTAR, AND (count) THEM THAT WORSHIP THEREIN-Rev 11:1. Israel has not had a temple since approximately 70 A.D. However, sometime during the first part of the Tribulation a temple will be built and sacrifices reinstituted. During the midst of the Tribulation, these sacrifices will be stopped-ref Dan 9:27, as the Antichrist will proclaim himself to be God and will move in. As it is written, HE (the Antichrist)…SITTETH IN THE TEMPLE OF GOD, SHEWING HIMSELF THAT HE IS GOD-2 Thes 2:4. John is given a measuring instrument and told to measure the temple and the altar and to count those that worship therein. "Those that worship therein" may be representing some godly Jews.
BUT THE COURT WHICH IS WITHOUT (or outside) THE TEMPLE LEAVE OUT, AND MEASURE IT NOT; FOR IT IS GIVEN UNTO THE GENTILES-Rev 11:2. John is told not to measure the court outside the temple, for it has been given to the Gentiles. Since the temple, itself, is measured, this could be yet another indication that the Antichrist will not be a Gentile.
THE GENTILES (or Goyim, or nations): AND THE HOLY CITY SHALL THEY TREAD (or trample) UNDER FOOT FORTY AND TWO MONTHS-Rev 11:2. John is told that the Gentiles shall trample the holy city (Jerusalem) for 42 months, which represents the second part of the Tribulation. The court without and the city is given to the Gentiles or the ungodly.
A false prophet comes forth. He is the third person of Satan's trinity. Exactly when he first appears does not seem clear in the Scriptures. He seems to first be mentioned at the midst of the Tribulation. He is portrayed as having horns like a lamb, as being innocent and harmless, but he speaks as the Antichrist does. He has all the power or authority of the Antichrist and causes people to worship the Antichrist, much as the Holy Spirit glorifies Jesus. The false prophet does great miracles or miraculous signs and makes fire to come down from heaven. Through these miracles, he deceives the people of the earth.
It is written, AND I BEHELD ANOTHER BEAST COMING UP OUT OF THE EARTH (or land)-Rev 13:11. Some believe that "coming out of the earth" means that he comes from the land of Israel. It is possible he may be a Jew. The second beast is called a false prophet in Rev 16:13; 19:20; and 20:10. His spirit is the spirit of a devil in Rev 16:14. There is no mention of this false prophet prior to the Antichrist being killed and having his deadly wound healed. It may be said, he masquerades as light, but he is darkness. During the approximate time of the midst of the Tribulation, the Antichrist moves into the temple. This being the case, it would appear that the entire known ministry of the false prophet will be in Israel.
The second beast, HE HAD TWO HORNS LIKE A LAMB-Rev 13:11. One would think of a lamb as being harmless. The Scriptures warn of such as this; as it is written, BEWARE OF FALSE PROPHETS, WHICH COME TO YOU IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING, BUT INWARDLY THEY ARE RAVENING WOLVES-Mt 7:15. This false prophet seemingly has the outward appearance of purity and great power, of meekness and humility as a lamb. There are varied opinions of the meaning of the two horns.
John the Baptist said of Jesus, BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD-Jn 1:29. However, while this beast (or false prophet) may take on the appearance of a lamb, HE SPAKE AS A DRAGON-Rev 13:11. He speaks as the Antichrist. He is a counterfeit of the Holy Spirit. He is an actual person.
AND HE EXERCISETH ALL THE POWER (or authority) OF THE FIRST BEAST (which is the Antichrist) BEFORE HIM (or in its presence, or on his behalf), AND CAUSETH (or makes) THE EARTH AND THEM WHICH DWELL THEREIN (or its inhabitants) TO WORSHIP THE FIRST BEAST, WHOSE DEADLY (or fatal) WOUND WAS HEALED-Rev 13:12. The false prophet brings glory to the Antichrist. He causes the people of the world to worship the Antichrist. He is the third person of Satan's trinity.
In verse 12, once again, the deadly wound of the Antichrist is mentioned; this causes the world to be amazed. As a result, people worship the Antichrist and Satan-ref Rev 13:3,4. AND HE (the false prophet) DOETH GREAT WONDERS (or miracles, or miraculous signs), SO THAT HE MAKETH (or causing) FIRE (to) COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN ON THE EARTH IN THE SIGHT OF MEN (or as people watch, in full view of men-NIV)-Rev 13:13.
Elijah also called down fire from heaven in the Old Testament. He also did many miracles. The Jews look for the coming of Elijah, prior to the coming of the Messiah, as a seat is left vacant for him at the Passover feast. The false prophet may also be some sort of a counterfeit Elijah or John the Baptist. John the Baptist was filled with the Spirit of God from the womb.
Jesus did great miracles. As a result, many believed on Him. The Antichrist will do great wonders as will the false prophet. Because of these miracles, many will be deceived and will believe that the Antichrist is the real Christ.
The event of the "abomination of desolation," for the Jew that is born-again, can mean life or death. The Antichrist, the son of Satan, moves into the temple. Some form of an abomination is set up on a wing of the temple. It may be that the image to the beast could be placed there. People will be required to worship it or be put to death-ref Rev 13:14,15.
Daniel mentions the sanctuary and then the ABOMINATION THAT MAKETH DESOLATE-Dan 11:31; 12:11. The ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION is also mentioned in Mt 24:15 and Mk 13:14. The Antichrist moving into the temple is certainly an abomination. However, setting up an image of the beast, which has Satan in it, and causing the people to worship it in the temple, God forbid! This is an abomination!
The abomination of desolation is referred to in Dan 9:27. "AND FOR THE OVERSPREADING OF ABOMINATIONS," because of the abominations being spread (or placed) in the temple, "HE (the Antichrist) SHALL MAKE IT (the temple) DESOLATE" (or on a wing [of the temple] he will set up an abomination that causes desolation-NIV)-ref Dan 9:27; ref Mt 24:15 NIV. A different NIV translation states, AND ONE WHO CAUSES DESOLATION WILL PLACE ABOMINATIONS ON A WING OF THE TEMPLE. (Note part 5B, Dan 9:27.) This is also called the "abomination of desolation" in Mt 24:15. The temple is defiled. As it is written, THE DAILY SACRIFICE SHALL BE TAKEN AWAY, AND THE ABOMINATION THAT MAKETH DESOLATE SET UP-Dan 12:11.
The false prophet shall say TO THEM (he ordered them) THAT DWELL ON THE EARTH, THAT THEY (the people) SHOULD MAKE AN IMAGE TO THE BEAST (honoring the beast). The false prophet orders the people to make some type of an image honoring the Antichrist. No description of the image is given. Some believe it might resemble the image that Nebuchadnezzar saw in his dream. However, it is more likely to resemble the Antichrist himself.
The verse continues, WHICH HAD THE WOUND BY A SWORD, AND (yet) DID LIVE (or that was struck by the sword but came alive again-JNT65)-Rev 13:14. This is the third time the wound is mentioned.
AND HE (the false prophet) HAD POWER TO GIVE LIFE (or breath) UNTO (or into) THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST-Rev 13:15. At this point, it appears, the image of the beast is completed. The false prophet had the power of Satan to actually give "life, breath, or spirit" to the image. The image of the Antichrist comes alive. The power of Satan will be invoked through the false prophet.
Some believe this image is some form of a computerized robot that can speak. There is no great power or miracle needed, in this generation, to make such an object. Such things already exist.
Nevertheless, when the Scripture tells us that the false prophet gives the image "life," it means exactly what it says. It is a supernatural event, and supernatural power is involved.
The Antichrist is killed. People are amazed when he comes back to life. People are amazed at the great wonders and signs that are done by the false prophet. We might anticipate that people will be further terrified, amazed, and even awestruck at the image of the beast receiving life and by the awesome powers they see. Undoubtedly, they will think that this is the great power of God. They will believe that Satan is the true God and the Antichrist is the real Christ.
The word "life" is from the Greek word "pneuma." This word means "a current of air, such as breath, even spirit; or demon, life, spirit." It is written, the false prophet HAD POWER TO GIVE LIFE UNTO THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST, THAT THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST (that is the image of the Antichrist) SHOULD (or even) BOTH SPEAK, AND CAUSE THAT AS MANY AS WOULD NOT WORSHIP THE IMAGE OF THE BEAST SHOULD BE KILLED (or put to death)-Rev 13:15.
The image comes alive and is able to speak. Note carefully, the image causes those that would not worship the image to be put to death. The image causes people to worship itself. The image has life. It craves worship. It desires worship so much that anyone who refuses to worship it is put to death.
Satan craves worship. Satan is a spirit. Remember the trinity of Satan? Satan, the Antichrist, and the false prophet-ref Rev 16:13. The false prophet is directing worship to the Antichrist. The Antichrist honors Satan. The spirit of Satan appears to enter the image of the beast. The image receives life and speaks. Thus, when the verse says the image causes people to be put to death, it seems to be saying that Satan is causing the people to be put to death, because they refuse to worship him. Again, the spirit of Satan appears to occupy the image of the beast. We may say, the image itself is Satan. How it will be possible for the vast number of the world’s population to be able to worship the image, during this time, is not stated.
By worshiping the beast and his image, the people seem to be attributing the work of God (the creation) to the devil. They appear to be acknowledging that the devil is deity.
The term "Great Tribulation" is used in Mt 24:21; Rev 2:22; and 7:14. The term "affliction" (or worst trouble) is used in Mk 13:19.
This term seems to be referring to the second part of the Tribulation, that is, the part beginning at the "midst" of the Tribulation, the last 3 ½ years.
Daniel 9:27 outlines the Tribulation as being seven years long. It is further shown to be divided into parts. The dividing point, evidently, is the sacrifices being stopped at the temple in Jerusalem and the abomination of desolation occurring. From this point on, the Tribulation is also called the "Great" Tribulation. The first part of the Tribulation saw at least one-fourth of the world’s population killed. The second part will see one-third or more of the remaining world’s population killed. In addition, famines or starvation, pestilences or horrible diseases, earthquakes, and many other things will continue to increase as the birth pains of a woman get worse and worse. The world conditions will be so bad that, since the beginning of the creation, there has not been such a horrible time.
This horrible time of God’s wrath upon the earth and against the unbelievers, coupled with the furious and uncontrollable wrath of Satan against both Jewish and Gentile believers, makes this last 1260 days unparalleled since the creation. Never again, will there be such a time of both natural and supernatural plagues upon the world, terror, brutal beatings, persecutions, and martyrdom. Just how dreadful and how terrifying this time will be may be difficult to comprehend.
God tells the born-again Jews to pray that their flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath Day.
The elect of Israel, born-again Jews, are told that when they see the "abomination of desolation" that they are to flee without any hesitation of any kind. They are to flee to the mountains. They are warned not to turn back from the field. They are not to go into their house for anything. It may be cold, but they are not to even go and get a jacket. The message is clear. They are to obey God and not their emotions or desires.
It may be said that those who are totally obedient in fleeing without hesitation, will be rewarded by being provided some method to quickly flee or fly to the place God has for them in the wilderness. They will escape and, ultimately, be protected by God for the last 42 months of the Tribulation. Those that hesitate can expect to be caught and executed unless they renounce their faith by worshiping the image. Obedience is better than sacrifice. How they shall be able to "see" the "abomination" is not covered in the Scriptures.
Those that have children will be in a very difficult situation. If they go and get their child, they may be caught and executed. In addition, when they are fleeing, the child may slow them down, which can result in their capture. If they leave their child, they may escape with their life, but what will happen to their child?
Consider a pregnant woman. Can she "flee" or run? And what of the husband, or wife, or person who attempts to notify someone else before they flee? They may be caught, because they delayed.
These verses seem to imply that when the "abomination of desolation" occurs, at that very instant, there may already be police and soldiers approaching the houses of the followers of Jesus to arrest them. If a person even stops for a few minutes to consider what to do, they may be captured and destroyed. They need to understand this. They need to obey.
This event seems to happen at the "midst" of the Tribulation. From this point on, there will be 3 1/2 years, or 42 months, or 1260 days left in the Tribulation. Persecution against the Jews and Gentiles, who follow Jesus, will be beyond anything the world has ever seen. Death lies ahead for many, as Satan will go forth in great fury to utterly destroy all the followers of Jesus.
Again, it needs to be emphasized that the abomination of desolation seems to come as a surprise, taking place sooner than expected. It may not be possible for a person to count 1260 days from the covenant between the Antichrist and Israel and others (which begins the Tribulation).
God answers prayer. The converted Jews are to pray that, when the time comes that they are to "flee or escape," it will not be in the winter or on the Sabbath Day. The cold of the winter could make it very difficult for them. It can also be a rainy season; rivers can rise.
Anyone running for their life on the Sabbath could easily be spotted, because there may be very few people out and very few vehicles moving. Travel on the Sabbath can be restricted.
(WHOSO READETH, LET HIM UNDERSTAND)-Mt 24:15. Note the word, "readeth." It did not say, "whoso heareth." There will be no true church during the Tribulation. Reading the Bibles that already exist will be one way a person can learn; however, anyone caught having a Bible might be arrested or even killed. It can be surmised that Bibles will be destroyed when found by those following the Antichrist. God is telling the Jew, to "understand."
Again, the message is repeated in Mark's Gospel. BUT WHEN YE SHALL SEE THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION (or that causes desolation), SPOKEN OF BY DANIEL THE PROPHET, STANDING WHERE IT OUGHT NOT, (LET HIM THAT READETH UNDERSTAND)-Mk 13:14. Once more, the words "readeth" and "understand" are used rather than "hearing," signifying that open preaching regarding these things may not exist at this time.
The Scriptures seem to indicate that when this happens it will come as a surprise to the people. They will not be expecting it to happen when it does, or else they could have left a few days earlier and would not have had to "flee" for their lives. There seems to be no way for them to determine the number of days from the covenant of Dan 9:27, so that they would know when this event was to take place.
IN THAT DAY, HE WHICH SHALL BE UPON THE HOUSETOP, AND HIS STUFF (or belongings) IN THE HOUSE, LET HIM NOT COME DOWN TO TAKE IT AWAY: AND HE THAT IS IN THE FIELD, LET HIM LIKEWISE NOT RETURN BACK (for anything). REMEMBER LOT’S WIFE. Lot’s wife hesitated. She looked back and died. WHOSOEVER SHALL SEEK (or tries) TO SAVE HIS LIFE SHALL LOSE IT. A person may seek to save his own life, but, in doing so, he disobeys God in some way. That hesitation or disobedience to God, by trying to save his own life, may cause him to lose his life. AND WHOSOEVER SHALL LOSE HIS LIFE SHALL PRESERVE IT-Lk 17:31-33. The person that loses his life for Jesus shall keep it for eternity. It may also be said, who ever will "die" to his own desires, or deny himself, shall preserve his life for eternity.
AND WOE (or how dreadful it will be-NIV) UNTO THEM THAT ARE WITH CHILD (or for pregnant women), AND TO THEM THAT GIVE SUCK (or nursing mothers) IN THOSE DAYS!-Mt 24:19.
Consider the other group. This is the group that has a thought or hears a voice such as, "Surely, there will be no harm to delay just one minute to grab a coat, or a pair of shoes, or a quick snack. It will only take a few seconds." But that short delay will, undoubtedly, cost them their lives. They grab a shirt and then flee. However, they are just a bit behind the faithful and obedient group. When the special way comes from God that enables the obedient group to fly into the wilderness, this group is just a bit too late—they miss the flight.
It is like the person that knows their airplane is about to leave, but they run down to the bathroom just for a moment. They then run back to the airplane, only to find that the door has been closed, and it is pulling out. They may have been only a few seconds too late.
Satan is cast to the earth. He is enraged. The abomination of desolation occurs. Those in Judea are told to flee into the mountains. The elect flee for their lives.
At the time that the obedient elect flee, a series of events begin to take place. The Bible does not specify where they will ultimately be going. Some speculate that it will be Petra.
God enables them to flee fast; this appears to be symbolized by the "TWO WINGS OF A GREAT EAGLE"-Rev 12:14. As they flee, Satan evidently speaks, and a flood of water rushes after those fleeing, so that they might be carried away and killed by the flood. However, God opens up the earth, and the flood is swallowed up. The elect escape to the wilderness where God has a place prepared for them. For the next 1260 days, God will feed and sustain them. The length of time God will take care of them seems to correspond with the length of time the Antichrist is allowed to continue.
Satan is absolutely infuriated that these escaped. He goes forth to destroy those who did not escape, those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
AND WHEN THE DRAGON (which is Satan) SAW THAT HE WAS CAST (or hurled) UNTO THE EARTH, HE PERSECUTED THE WOMAN (or he pursued the woman-NIV, which is Israel) WHICH BROUGHT FORTH THE MAN CHILD (Jesus)-Rev 12:13. Satan pursues and persecutes Israel.
As Israel is fleeing for her life, THE SERPENT (which is Satan) CAST (or spewed) OUT OF HIS MOUTH WATER AS A FLOOD (or river) AFTER (or to overtake) THE WOMAN, THAT HE MIGHT CAUSE HER TO BE CARRIED (or sweep her) AWAY OF THE FLOOD (or torrent)-Rev 12:15. A flood is mentioned, and then the kind of flood is actually specified. It is a flood of water. How it comes forth is also stated. The flood and water, here, are not believed to be symbolic but an actual flood of water. Satan speaks the words that a flood of water should come forth to swallow up and drown those fleeing. This is what it means when it says that Satan should "cast out of his mouth water." It is even as when Elijah called down fire from heaven. The words came out of his mouth, and the fire came down.
There may be an army also trying to catch the fleeing Jews, which will be close behind them. Those that disobeyed God and went to get some things, first, can expect to be caught.
AND THE EARTH HELPED THE WOMAN (or the land came to her rescue-JNT69), AND THE EARTH OPENED HER MOUTH, AND SWALLOWED UP THE FLOOD (or river) WHICH THE DRAGON (which is Satan) CAST (or spewed) OUT OF HIS MOUTH-Rev 12:16. Satan caused the flood of water to come forth to drown the fleeing Israelis. However, as the water was about to overtake them, the earth opened up, and the flood of water went down into the earth or it was swallowed up. Thus, the remnant of Israel that obeyed God and ran as He had commanded them escape to the place that God had ordained; there they will be under the protection of God for the last 1260 days. Such a miracle as the earth opening up also happened in the days of Moses. It is written, AND THE EARTH OPENED HER MOUTH, AND SWALLOWED THEM UP-Num 16:32; ref Num 16:27-35.
As already mentioned, some believe the place they will flee to will be Petra. Petra, located in Edom, is a fortress which has buildings built into the rock cliffs. It has a narrow entrance way that opens up into a large canyon. Some believe the flood that will come to carry them away will be from the Jordan River, which is east of Jerusalem. Jordan lies on the other side, and Petra is in Jordan. Scriptures do seem to indicate that this is possible; however, Petra is not specifically mentioned as the place that God will lead them to. Only the Lord knows for sure.
Israel is commanded to flee fast. AND TO THE WOMAN WERE GIVEN TWO WINGS OF A GREAT EAGLE, THAT SHE MIGHT FLY INTO THE WILDERNESS, INTO "HER PLACE" (to the place prepared for her in the desert-NIV)-Rev 12:14. The wings of a great eagle would be symbolic of something large and would also indicate speed. In some manner, which is not made clear, God is going to enable those of Israel that keep the commandments of God to quickly escape or even fly to the place which God has for her. Through God's divine intervention, those that have the testimony of Jesus Christ will sense, or somehow know, in which direction to go. They have been forewarned by God's Word when to flee. As it is written in Mt 24:15-WHOSO READETH, LET HIM UNDERSTAND.
THE WOMAN (which is Israel) FLED INTO THE WILDERNESS (or desert), WHERE SHE HATH A PLACE PREPARED OF GOD, THAT THEY SHOULD FEED HER THERE (or where she might be taken care of-NIV) (for) A THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THREESCORE DAYS (or 1260 days)-Rev 12:6. Thus, Israel goes to her place, WHERE SHE IS NOURISHED (or taken care of) FOR A TIME, AND TIMES, AND HALF A TIME (or for a season and two seasons and half a season-JNT,70 or 3 ½ years), FROM THE FACE OF THE SERPENT (or out of the serpent's reach-NIV)-Rev 12:14. The term "time" means one year. The term "times" means two years. The term "half a time" means one-half of a year. Thus, 1 year + 2 years + 1/2 a year equals 3 1/2 years. Three interchangeable terms are used in the Scriptures denoting the last part of the Tribulation. They are 3 ½ years, 1260 days, or 42 months.
It is written, THE THIRD SHALL BE LEFT THEREIN-Zech 13:8; ref verse 9. We might expect that the number which will escape could be one-third of Israel.
AND THE DRAGON (which is Satan) WAS WROTH (or infuriated, or enraged, or we might say, insanely mad) WITH THE WOMAN (which is Israel), AND WENT TO MAKE WAR (or fight) WITH THE REMNANT (or the rest) OF HER SEED (or children, or offspring), WHICH KEEP (or obey) THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD, AND HAVE (or hold to) THE TESTIMONY (or bear witness) OF JESUS CHRIST (or Yeshua)-Rev 12:17.
The false prophet causes all people to receive a mark, or the name of the Antichrist, or the number of the Antichrist's name, in or on their right hand or forehead. Anyone that refuses to take the mark will not be able to buy or sell. It appears that people will not be able to trade or make any kind of a financial transaction.
What a temptation it will be as the people come face to face with choosing either death or worshiping the image of the beast. What a temptation it will be to have a newborn baby starving in the mother's arms. The mother cannot buy or sell. Will the mother watch her baby slowly starve to death or give in and take the mark?
Consider, people will not be able to buy food for themselves or their families, neither gasoline, clothes, or anything. They may not be able to make payments of any kind. This may include their taxes, mortgage or rent on their house, electric, utilities, and auto payments. They will not be able to trade, buy, or sell anything. A person might not be able to receive his wages without the mark.
This number has been calculated by many Bible scholars. Apparently, the Holy Spirit has not yet given us the understanding of who "666" (or 600 60 6) is.
Those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life will get the victory over HIS MARK, AND OVER THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME-Rev 15:2.
The purpose of the mark is THAT NO MAN MIGHT BUY OR SELL (or preventing anyone from buying or selling-JNT72), SAVE (or unless) HE THAT HAD
Three items are mentioned here. However, some translations appear to limit it to two items by saying that the "mark" is the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Rev 15:2 mentions two, as it is written, HIS MARK, AND…THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME. It is possible there could be two or three types of a mark. If so, each could have a particular purpose. Remember, the Scriptures have said that the Antichrist comes in his own name.
A system that could be used for such a thing is already partially in place in many areas. As of the time this book is written, many stores use scanners to ring up purchases. On most items a person may buy, there is a bar code. This Universal Products Code contains the number 6-6-6. At the time this book is being written, the center bars and two end bars represent the number 6. Even in India and Africa, these bar codes appear on products. It can be expected that even the remote market places in Africa will come under this system during the Tribulation.
Some believe that many transactions may, in some way, go through a giant computer. Such computers do exist today. The speed and amount of information that computers are able to process seems to be increasing at an incredible rate. Indeed, technology is advancing rapidly.
It is possible that the world will come under a global money or credit system and the use of money, as we know it today, may disappear. It may be that all financial transactions will be done by some other method, which is related to the mark. Various forms of computer chips and other types of marks are already being experimented with that can go on top of the skin or even implanted beneath the skin.
It is possible that when a person goes to buy something, their right hand or forehead will be scanned with a special scanner, then the transaction can take place. The EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer) system is operational in many places. Such organizations as the Trilateral Commission are already at work. The number of things leading to this one-world system, which are unknown to most people, is incredible.
Exactly how this will all come about is not made clear by God's Word. What is clear is, if a person does not take the mark, they cannot buy or sell anything. This system will continue for approximately 3 1/2 years, through the end of the Tribulation.
There will be a one-world economic system. Even while these things are being written, as we watch world events, this is the direction that the world is heading in these latter days.
The reward for being deceived, and taking the mark, and worshiping the image is as follows. The person can buy and sell during the second part of the Tribulation. The person will not be persecuted, ridiculed, beaten, or put in prison for following Jesus. The person will not have to flee to keep from being beheaded.
However, even taking the mark and worshiping the image will not keep many of these people from being killed as the end of the Tribulation approaches. This is because one-third of the world's population will be killed. Neither will it protect them when the multitude of plagues come upon the earth. The end result of being deceived, taking the mark, and worshiping the image is the eternal lake of fire.
The 144,000 male, virgin Jews should be warning people, in advance, about taking the mark and worshiping the image during the first part of the Tribulation.
The two witnesses of God should be warning the people about taking the mark and worshiping the image during the second part of the Tribulation.
Those that read God's Word should be warned about taking the mark and worshiping the image from the Book of the Revelation. In addition, there will be other ways that people can expect to be warned.
The warnings are terrifying. For those that receive the mark and worship the image, God's wrath will be upon them. Ultimately, they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone for eternity. They will never have any rest from their suffering. There will never be any hope of escape. There will never be any parole. Their loved ones that are in heaven will not remember them, but it appears they will remember all things. The smoke of their torment will ascend up for ever and ever.
Those who choose to ignore God's warning, God is clearly and loudly telling them, His full wrath (or fury) shall be poured into the cup of His rage (or wrath). Then these people will have to drink of the full, undiluted contents of this cup.
These people SHALL BE TORMENTED WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE (or sulfur)-Rev 14:10. Regarding the degrees or severity of punishment for eternity, these can be expected to receive the most severe punishment possible. These should receive the same punishment as the Antichrist, false prophet, and Satan himself.
Consider, the loud voice seems to indicate that every person will know this message, before he worships the beast and his image and receives the mark. The false prophet will deceive the world by his miracles. However, the two prophets of God will prove they are the true ones of God, as no one, including the false prophet and the Antichrist, will be able to stop or overcome them until their ministry is finished (after 1260 days).
It may be compared to Moses and Aaron in Egypt. AARON CAST DOWN HIS ROD BEFORE PHARAOH...IT BECAME A SERPENT. THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT, THEY ALSO DID IN LIKE MANNER-Ex 7:10,11. From this, the people might have wondered who was really of God. But then, AARON'S ROD SWALLOWED UP THEIR RODS-Ex 7:12. This left no doubt that Moses and Aaron were of God, and the magicians were not. Yet they still did not believe.
Thus, verses 9 and 10, serve as both an example and a vital warning. However, during the Tribulation, when the Lord sends forth an unmistakably clear warning, most of the earth will choose to ignore and not believe what He says. Though they choose not to believe, God’s Word does, indeed, come to pass—just as it is written. During the Tribulation, this is the unpardonable sin.
Those that refuse to take the mark will not be able to buy or sell. It will be almost impossible for them to survive during the second part of the Tribulation.
Those that refuse to worship the image of the beast will, undoubtedly, have to flee for their lives. If they are caught, they can expect to be persecuted, beaten, and ultimately beheaded. Many will be betrayed by their close friends, their relatives, even their own children or parents. In being killed, however, they will get the victory. They shall have eternal life with Jesus. They shall return with Jesus, at the time of Armageddon, in their new spiritual bodies and shall reign and rule with Jesus for one thousand years. They will forever be with the Lord. They will never have any more tears.
A few will manage to escape, by the grace of God, and will survive. These will go into the Millennium and will begin to repopulate the earth.
NEITHER HAD RECEIVED HIS MARK UPON THEIR FOREHEADS, OR IN (or on) THEIR HANDS; AND THEY LIVED AND REIGNED WITH CHRIST A THOUSAND YEARS. These were killed, but they had gotten the victory.
The second part of the Tribulation begins with the temple sacrifices being stopped and the abomination of desolation occurring.
Many events will be going on at the same time. Satan is infuriated that he was cast down to the earth and the elect Jews escaped. He, the Antichrist, and the false prophet have one mind. They wish to exterminate every living Christian, both Jew and Gentile, from the face of the earth. Throughout the earth, all that refuse to take the mark can no longer buy or sell. All that will not worship the image of the beast are to be beheaded. Persecutions, beatings, imprisonment, and martyrdom await most, who profess that Jesus is the Christ. A great multitude will be slaughtered for their faith in Jesus. However, many will renounce their faith when persecuted and beaten. Many will turn from their faith when they are starving. Many will renounce their faith when their children are starving or being tortured in order to save them. Many will give in and worship the Antichrist rather than lose their head.
It may be said, when people are about to be beheaded, they could be facing upward, looking at the guillotine before the blade comes down. Why might this be? Satan and the Antichrist want their worship. They want them to give in and forsake their faith in Jesus. They can be expected to do everything possible to deceive the people or, if necessary, to force them to acknowledge that the Antichrist is really God.
Brother will betray brother and children will betray their parents, even causing them to be put to death. Parents will betray their children. Relatives and friends will betray each other.
The two witnesses of God go forth to shut off the rain so that it does not rain during the 1260 days of their ministry. They bring all sorts of plagues upon the earth as God's wrath is poured out.
As the end of the Tribulation approaches, the outpouring of the last seven vials of God's wrath are about to begin.
The Jews that hesitated in fleeing, when they saw the abomination of desolation, may now be caught. Satan makes war with them. They will be persecuted and beaten; should they refuse to worship the image of the beast, they can expect to be killed by having their head removed. All who profess Jesus as their Lord and Savior shall suffer. The Antichrist sets out to destroy the mighty and the holy people.
It is written, AND THE DRAGON (which is Satan) WAS WROTH (or infuriated, or enraged, or we might say, insanely mad) WITH THE WOMAN (which is Israel), AND WENT TO MAKE WAR (or fight) WITH THE REMNANT (or the rest) OF HER SEED (or children, or offspring), WHICH KEEP (or obey) THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD, AND HAVE (or hold to) THE TESTIMONY (or bear witness) OF JESUS CHRIST (or Yeshua)-Rev 12:17.
AND HE (the Antichrist)…SHALL DESTROY THE MIGHTY (men) AND THE HOLY PEOPLE (which is Israel)-Dan 8:24.
This falling away from the faith, or departing from the faith, continues as birth pains throughout the Tribulation. During the Tribulation, many will come to faith in Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, many will turn away from Jesus because of fear, or offenses, or deception, or the threat of persecutions, beatings, imprisonment, or other such devices that Satan uses—including death.
It is written, AND THEN SHALL MANY BE OFFENDED (or trapped) (at that time many will turn away from the faith-NIV)-Mt 24:10.
Those that persevere, resist the temptations to worship the image or the beast, resist the mark or the number of his name, hold firm in the faith, endure to the end, keep the faith, stand steadfast, finish the race, and die in faith, will ultimately be with Jesus.
Those that choose to follow Jesus will not be able to trust anyone. Betrayal shall become a common occurrence. A person may think they are safe hiding out with a brother or friend, but are not. A parent may think their children will not betray them, but they shall. Hate will abound-ref Mt 24:9,10. These verses apply to the first part of the Tribulation; however, as birth pains, they will progressively get worse into the second part of the Tribulation.
Placebo by Howard Pittman - Donation $5.00 - This author had a life after death experience and was given visions of both hell and the demonic forces at work. He was also given the revelation of Placebo: a medication prescribed more for the mental relief of a patient than for the actual effect on his disorder. The question Pittman raises is 'What is the Church's Dope?' Through sugar-coating, the apostate doctor (Satan) is preventing a great number of Christians and Churches from experiencing the power of God to truly change their lives.

  Robert Chambers (10 July 1802 – 17 March 1871), Scottish author and publisher, was born in Peebles.
He was sent to the local schools, and gave evidence of unusual literary taste and ability. A small circulating library in the town, and a copy of the Encyclopædia Britannica which his father had purchased, furnished him with stores of reading of which he eagerly availed himself. Long afterwards he wrote of his early years--"Books, not playthings, filled my hands in childhood. At twelve I was deep, not only in poetry and fiction, but in encyclopaedias." Robert had been destined for the church, but this design had to be abandoned for lack of means. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1813, and in 1818 Robert began business as a bookstall-keeper in Leith Walk. He was then only sixteen, and his whole stock consisted of a few old books belonging to his father.
In 1819 his elder brother William had begun a similar business, and the two eventually united as partners in the publishing firm of W. & R. Chambers. Robert Chambers showed an enthusiastic interest in the history and antiquities of Edinburgh, and found a most congenial task in his Traditions of Edinburgh (2 vols., 1824), which secured for him the approval and the personal friendship of Sir Walter Scott. A History of the Rebellions in Scotland from 1638 to 1745 (5 vols., 1828) and numerous other works followed.
In the beginning of 1832 William Chambers started a weekly publication under the title of Chambers's Edinburgh Journal (known since 1854 as Chambers's Journal of Literature, Science and Arts), which speedily attained a large circulation. Robert was at first only a contributor. After fourteen numbers had appeared, however, he was associated with his brother as joint editor, and his collaboration contributed more perhaps than anything else to the success of the Journal.
Among the other numerous works of which Robert was in whole or in part the author, the Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen (4 vols., Glasgow, 1832–1835), the Cyclopaedia of English Literature (1844), the Life and Works of Robert Burns (4 vols., 1851), Ancient Sea Margins (1848), the Domestic Annals of Scotland (1859–1861) and the Book of Days (2 vols., 1862–1864) were the most important.
Chambers's Encyclopaedia (1859–1868), with Dr Andrew Findlater as editor, was carried out under the superintendence of the brothers. The Cyclopaedia of English Literature contains a series of admirably selected extracts from the best authors of every period, "set in a biographical and critical history of the literature itself." For the Life of Burns he made diligent and laborious original investigations, gathering many hitherto unrecorded facts from the poet's sister, Mrs Begg, to whose benefit the whole profits of the work were generously devoted.
Robert Chambers was a scientific geologist, and availed himself of tours in Scandinavia and Canada for the purpose of geological exploration. The results of his travels were embodied in Tracings of the North of Europe (1851) and Tracings in Iceland and the Faroe Islands (1856). His knowledge of geology was one of the principal grounds on which the authorship of the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (2 vols., 1843–1846), was eventually assigned to him. The book was published anonymously, and daringly set out ideas of Lamarckian evolution. Robert Chambers was aware of the storm that would probably be raised at the time by a rational treatment of the subject, and did not wish to involve his firm in the discredit that a charge of heterodoxy would bring with it. The arrangements for publication were made through Alexander Ireland of Manchester, and the secret was so well kept that such different names as those of Prince Albert and Sir Charles Lyell were coupled with the book.
The book was a sensation, quickly becoming a best-seller and going into new editions. Charles Darwin admired its prose, but wrote that the "geology strikes me as bad, & his zoology far worse". By implying that God might not actively sustain the natural and social hierarchies, it threatened the social order and could provide ammunition to Chartists and revolutionaries. Anglican clergymen / naturalists attacked the book, with the geologist Adam Sedgwick predicting "ruin and confusion in such a creed" which if taken up by the working classes "will undermine the whole moral and social fabric" bringing "discord and deadly mischief in its train." The book was liked by many Quakers and Unitarians. The Unitarian physiologist William Carpenter called it "a very beautiful and a very interesting book", and helped Chambers with correcting later editions. Critics thanked God that the author began "in ignorance and presumption", for the revised versions "would have been much more dangerous". Vestiges brought widespread discussion of evolution which had previously been seen as a dangerous doctrine of street radicals, and hence paved the way for the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection more than a decade later.
Chambers gave a talk on ancient beaches at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Oxford in May 1847. An observer at the meeting reported that Chambers "pushed his conclusions to a most unwarrantable length and got roughly handled on account of it by Buckland, De la Beche, Sedgwick, Murchison, and Lyell. The last told me afterwards that he did so purposely that [Chambers] might see that reasonings in the style of the author of the Vestiges would not be tolerated among scientific men." On the Sunday Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, used his sermon at St. Mary's Church on "the wrong way of doing science" to deliver a stinging attack obviously aimed at Chambers. The church "crowded to suffocation" with geologists, astronomers and zoologists heard jibes about the "half-learned" seduced by the "foul temptation" of speculation looking for a self-sustaining universe in a "mocking spirit of unbelief", showing a failure to understand the "modes of the Creator's acting" or to meet the responsibilities of a gentleman. Chambers denounced this as an attempt to stifle progressive opinion, but others thought he must have gone home "with the feeling of a martyr".
In 1851 Chambers was one of a group of writers who joined the publisher John Chapman in reinvigorating the Westminster Review as a flagship of freethought and reform, spreading the ideas of evolutionism.
Ireland in 1884 issued a 12th edition of Vestiges, with a preface giving an account of its authorship, which there was no longer any reason for concealing.
The Book of Days was Chambers's last publication, and perhaps his most elaborate. It was a miscellany of popular antiquities in connection with the calendar, and it is supposed that his excessive labour in connexion with this book hastened his death. Two years before, the university of St Andrews had conferred upon him the degree of doctor of laws, and he was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club in London. It is his highest claim to distinction that he did so much to give a healthy tone to the cheap popular literature which has become so important a factor in modern civilization.

Chlorella Pyrenoidosa is a 4 billion year old strain of green algae, making it one of the oldest foods on the planet. Chlorella is thought to be the most thoroughly researched food in history and is recognized as having the highest chlorophyll content of all known plants. It is a fresh water, single-cell green algae that is renowned for its health giving properties such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, nucleic acids, amino acids, enzymes, CGF (Chlorella Growth Factor) and other beneficial nutrients. Our Chlorella is produced in Asia by the world's largest producers of Chlorella Pyrenoidosa. This algae has been utilized for thousands of generations, which insures the integrity of the strain's purity will stay intact without degenerating. Many other producers of Chlorella do not pay close enough attention to their strains and experience "drift" in the purity of their algae. This problem is very much overlooked by many algae producers worldwide.
Chlorella gets its name from the high amounts of chlorophyll it possesses, the highest of any plant known. Chlorophyll cells are nearly identical to hemoglobin (red blood cells) with one exception: Chlorophyll has a Magnesium molecule at that center of it; hemoglobin has an Iron molecule at the center of it. This is important because Magnesium is essential for the heart to function properly. Every time our heart beats, it is utilizing magnesium to do so. Chlorella contains enzymes such as chlorophyllase and pepsin, which are digestive enzymes. Enzymes perform a myriad of functions in the body. In fact, you can not even blink without the presence of enzymes. Chlorella has many different types of enzymes that our bodies need. It is essential that any algae you take is NOT freeze-dried or pasteurized. If it is, then you have lost the crucial benefit of enzymes such as these.
Chlorella's indigestible cell wall needs to be ruptured to allow access to its nutrients and a variety of methods are used by other companies, some of which damage the nutrients. The method used by our Chlorella Producer ensures the highest quality, which is confirmed by an annual independent analysis by the Japan Food Research Laboratory. Japan is the only country that has strict standards and importation controls over heavy metals and bacterial content in Chlorella. The digestibility of our Chlorella is confirmed by the Japan Government's Ministry of Health to be between 76% and 79%, the highest on the market. Most brands claim to have broken the Chlorella cell wall so its nutrients can be adsorbed by the body. Our Chlorella was analyzed by Dr L. Lewis, Doctor of Physiology at Duke University in 1992. Using a Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), two samples of Chlorella were examined, ours and a competitor's brand. Both were deemed to be free of contamination, however, our Chlorella was the only one to demonstrate that the cell wall had been broken in the SEM examination. The cell wall of our competitor's Chlorella had collapsed but remained unbroken and was only 40% digestible.
Most producers use a "continuous-harvest" method drawing quantities of raw algae from the growing ponds as required. This method is certainly economically efficient, but it also presents a very real risk of breeding competing toxic organisms and bacteria. In the manufacturing of Chlorella, a complex separation system is used with micro-filter centrifuges allowing them to separate the cells without the use of chemicals.

Adv Ramakant Khalap is former Chairman of the Goa State Law Commission. Being a veteran politician of Goa, he has served the political arena as the union law minister as well as Goa’s deputy chief minister and the opposition leader in the past. He also takes keen interest in literature and cultural activities while heading several institutions, especially in the field of Marathi literature.
When you study in a school like Don Bosco, you can’t help but be influenced by priests who guide, counsel, chide and teach you and then gently set you free into the big bad world, with the hope that all those moral lessons will hold you in good stead as you trudge along on life’s uncertain highways.
The twinkling and witty Fr. Peter Ghatti, the disciplinarian Fr. Bonny; the dear friend Bro. Avil; the near saintly Fr. Benedict Furtado; and many others influenced us in unobtrusive, subtle and non-confrontational ways always leading by example and never hesitating to teach us to always face up to the truth, however inconvenient.
And oh yes, none of the priests I knew ever spoke or dealt with “forced conversions” or any conversions whatsoever, as the mighty Hindutva brigade have us constantly and maliciously believe.
They were simple guys leading simple lives, doing simple things to help out simple people solve their complex problems. I’ll concede that God’s way is always so simple. It is the life of an agnostic that is so exasperatingly complicated. Darn! Darn! Darn!
My only enduring grudge against the “padres” of our time was when they used to push me in to myriad sporting activities. I’m such a lazy lout. A tortoise would be ashamed to be in my company. Running, jumping cart w-heeling was something I abhorred and still do. But then who said staying fit was a simple option of life?
I do question many of the teachings of the church however specially its dogma of treating a condom as the world’s biggest sin object. In this era of AIDS and a population explosion, this remains a completely counter reproductive logic. But that the Don Bosco School has moulded me in to everything I am today is indisputable. I'm proud of it. Very proud !
So, when you have a genuine, fond affection for padres (as much as for many decent, sensible mullahs and Hindu priests who happen to be my patients). How do you react to the news of Fr. Bismarque Dias having catapulted himself in to the hurly burly of Goan politics??
I fleetingly know Fr. Dias during my accidental activism days. And whatever little I know of him, there can be no doubt about his passion, integrity and almost insane love for this land. By any account he is a true blue, green activist prepared to confront the truth and importantly walk the talk.
And I think he believes that activism can take you only thus far. How many times can you storm the TCP office? How many more agitations? How many more editorials and columns? How many more frustrations and heart breaks?.
So he’s going for broke. Seize power to wield the stick on a system that sucks. Is that romantically idealistic? I don’t know but then you can’t sit forever under the tree for that apple to fall on your head. Can you?
Having said that, Fr. Bismarque and many other green activists who have declared their candidacy need to answer the following questions as plainly as possible, to another wise gullible electorate.
(i) If elected, by some divine fluke, who will they ally with? The much reviled Congress or the dangerous Saffron agenda? Remember they have to seize power to wield the stick.
(ii) What is their economic agenda for Goa? The reason the Vishwajeets, the Babushes and the Churchills are near unbeatable is because they create jobs, jobs and more jobs by hook or by crook – mostly by crook !!!
(iii) Is their political ideology aligned exclusively for the Goan? What is their position on the much maligned, migrant non Goan specially those who reside in slums who many constitutional ideologues claim are the ones tarnishing Goa’s legendary “ beauty ?”
And specifically to Fr. Bismarque, an important question that needs to be asked. Is he in this as an independent or as a “church” candidate? Because to the best of my knowledge, the church as an institution does not allow priests to contest an election and that diktat must be followed by every priest. Alternatively he can choose to go it alone disassociating himself from the church.
Conversely it must also be said that there are a handful of priests who do not hesitate to surreptitiously canvas for, sanctify, bless and beatify certified criminals in Goa’s electoral arena. And this is also against the church diktat.
That green activists have taken a political plunge is a welcome sign. It broadens the scope of debate in the corridors of power and any forceful articulation on the sustainable growth agenda is a desperate necessity for Goa. It must be persuasively argued at the highest levels of governance – Constantly, Consistently, Convincingly !
To all the cynics and nay Sayers who’ll have no qualms in running down these green activist. Let’s acknowledge this one fact. “At least they had the GUTS”!!!
Now if they get sucked in to the black hole of the Congress or get suffocated by the saffron pseudo love of the BJP or they remain truly green – only time and History will tell.
Dr Oscar Rebello is one of the leading social activist of Goa and a practicing doctor. He led the historic peoples’ movement in 2006-07 to get the anti-Goa Regional Plan scrapped and save Goa from total destruction of Goa’s ecology and natural beauty. He is a Goa-based leader of Aam Aadmi Party. He is also a columnist.
since you have been such an inspiration for Goans, you must come forward and support the candidature of Bismarque on ground. There is tons of energy surrounding him, and there are people all over the world who are working hard to try and ensure that he wins.
And even if he doesn't, his forthright style will hold him in good stead as he goes about with his message of awakening goans across the state. This is where the real success of Bismarque will be.
Very importantly, people like you and Remo are important. All of us are important, and let us not lose this opportunity of pitchforking a truly good Goan right up there.
Looking forward to hearing from you. I am involved with the campaign too, and there are some very interesting professionals from all fields who are actively working with this ideal.

Russia’s interest for the East can be dated back to the aftermath of the 2008/09 global economic and financial crisis. The effects of the crisis revealed Russia’s dramatic exposure to Western developments. Until then the economic potential of fast growing China had been neglected. Developments in 2013–14 were crucial, since Russia finally turned to the East when international tensions linked to conflicts in Ukraine erupted, making her weak- oil price-dependent—economic recovery even more problematic. Building a new Sino-Russian partnership, however, entails risks, since competitive pressures could derail a mutually profitable venture. The challenge for Russia and China is to strengthen their cooperation through dialogue.

It wasn’t until I started playing Paddle Tennis in L.A. that I realized there are actually two sports by the same name. There’s Paddle Tennis, which is popular in Los Angeles among many other beach cities in the world, and then there’s Platform Tennis, a similar sport, that many people call paddle—and is popular in the Midwest and on the East Coast. The differences are small and include court size and whether one may play the ball off the caged fence, but mostly the difference lies in the season. Platform Tennis is a winter sport played on a heated platform and often accompanied by hot cocoa, and Paddle Tennis is more of a sunny summer sport. Both games can be super fast and a great work out, but I have to say Paddle Tennis has become my most favorite sport. I play once a week in West Hollywood at Plummer Park(there’s only one court there, so don’t tell anyone), but the best public courts in L.A. are definitely at Venice Beach where you can watch some crazy games. I combed through a bunch of the history of the two sports and the best thing I came across was this quote from an old article from the USPTA:
“Unlike tennis players, paddle-tennis players like to dress down, perhaps because of the beach’s influence on the game. And the strict etiquette that is required in tennis is almost completely ignored. [Players] are renowned for screaming—at teammates—during matches. Tournaments get nasty—players have been known to purposely smash overhands at opponents’ torsoes from point-blank range.”
Maybe that’s the reason John McEnroe likes paddle? Do you guys play paddle? If so what kind and where?

The relationship of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities suggestive of esophageal motility disorders with electrocardiographic (ECG) alterations and seroreactivity to Trypanosoma cruzi was studied in a defined population in a rural area endemic for Chagas&apos; disease in Bahia, Brazil. Between January and June 1981, 680 individuals 5 years of age or older were examined with serologic tests, ECGs and questionnaires for esophageal motility disorder. Of these, 39.9% were seropositive for Chagas&apos; disease. Symptoms of dysphagia occurred 2.5 times more frequently among seropositive individuals than among seronegative individuals. Radiographic esophageal abnormalities were 3.6 times more frequent among seropositive individuals than among seronegative individuals in the symptomatic group. Symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were more common in men than in women although this was not statistically significant. Among seropositive individuals the percentage with symptoms of dysphagia increased with age, with a peak prevalence rate of 23.9% in the 45- to 64-year-old age group. Also, in the seropositive group, 41.7% with X-ray abnormalities of the esophagus and 26.3% with symptoms of dysphagia presented an abnormal ECG.

A blog about Lamb Island in Moreton Bay, Queensland – a unique little paradise under forty kilometres as the seagull flies from Brisbane CBD.
Not being nautically erudite, I’m not sure how to describe this craft going past Lamb Island a few days ago. It’s a canoe, right? Except its sail could qualify it as a sailboat. Except the outrigger-style floats each side potentially make it a trimaran. Except, as far as I could tell, the guy in it was pedalling, which means it’s a second-cousin to those pedal boats they hire out. Whatever.
Lamb Island is one of four islands (Russell, Macleay, Lamb and Karragarra) collectively known as the Southern Moreton Bay Islands. Just off Redland Bay, and in the lee of North Stradbroke Island, they’re less than forty kilometres and just over an hour's all-up travelling time from Brisbane CBD. (There’s a map at the bottom of this blog.)
And yes, in case it needs to be said, the islands have mains power, land-line phone (including broadband) and town water connected, plus a weekly council garbage collection.
Surrounded by the tranquil waters of Moreton Bay, these islands offer what is arguably the last relatively unspoilt coastal residential environment in South-East Queensland, and still something of a secret even to Brisbane people, let alone the rest of Australia.
All four islands are serviced by fast modern twin-hull 'waterbuses' which run more-or-less half-hourly during the day and hourly at night to and from Redland Bay from 4.45am till 10pm (11pm on Thursday, and midnight on Friday and Saturday nights). Inter-island travel is free. The trip between Lamb Island and Redland Bay takes around twenty minutes. Mainland bus services to a variety of destinations including Brisbane CBD run from the Redland Bay jetty in conjunction with the waterbus timetables. Vehicular barges also service the islands from Redland Bay every two hours or so.
The islands are also serviced by islands-based paramedics, with an ambulance permanently stationed on each island, and a dedicated ambulance boat for transfers to the mainland. Urgent cases are transported by helicopter, which makes the trip to hospital as fast as from many Brisbane suburbs.
The Redland City Council maintains a free parking area as well as a paid card-entry parking compound adjacent to the mainland jetty, and many islanders leave 'mainland cars' there and use cheaper cars for getting around on their islands – although Lamb Island is small enough for many residents to choose to just walk or cycle.
On Lamb Island, you'll find a welcoming easy-going community, fresh air, open vistas, and a balmy climate that's usually a couple of degrees cooler than Brisbane in Summer, and as warm again in Winter.
At just two kilometres long and at its widest only one kilometre across, Lamb Island is home to around four hundred residents, and is arguably the most lifestyle-friendly island of the four. It's not 'suburbia' like Macleay and Russell Islands, but it offers amenities that Karragarra lacks.
Lamb Island has a small general store we call the 'kiosk', and a licensed recreation club. There's also a community hall, public tennis court, and a first-aid facility.
Just a three-minute free waterbus ride away, Macleay Island offers supermarket shopping, a pharmacy, medical surgery, restaurants, hotel, golf course, bowls club, a thriving arts and crafts centre, and more. There’s also a primary school on Macleay Island, with a supervised bus to transport the Lamb Island kids to and from the Macleay jetty. (High school students go to the mainland, where special buses meet them.)
Russell Island, just five minutes in the other direction, has a huge IGA supermarket, bottleshop, etc, all within a hundred-or-so metres of the jetty – or a quick barge trip if you want to take your car over.
Redland Bay offers comprehensive shopping facilities a kilometre from the mainland jetty. Victoria Point (just a few minutes drive further or via regular bus services) is a booming regional shopping centre with everything one could need including cinemas, restaurants, and a council library.
From Redland Bay, Brisbane CBD is within a 45 minute drive outside peak hour (but closer to an hour during peak times), while the Gold Coast is about 45 minutes via easy access to the Pacific Motorway.
Living on Lamb Island is like enjoying a permanent holiday in a small unspoilt coastal town that's still the way it was back before the rest of the world went crazy.
Obviously, if you're into boating and/or fishing, this is the perfect place for you. But for most residents Lamb Island's major appeal is the very real sense of peace and contentment that comes from living in such a natural environment and its small-scale community where everyone's friendly and laidback, primarily interested in enjoying life on their own terms rather than trying to keep up with the people next door.
There's also the security factor. Lamb Island's relative isolation and its small size combine to make it something like a 'gated community' – for the most part only the local residents or their visitors come here, and because everyone knows each other at least by sight, anyone who doesn't belong soon gets noticed.
At the same time, despite all the lifestyle positives and recreational opportunities, living here isn't for everyone (which is a big part of what makes it so appealing to those who do).
While property prices may be relatively low, accessing the mainland costs money, which adds to the real cost of living here. Teenagers and young adults find it a hassle having to go to the mainland for their entertainment and social activities, and then having to come home by midnight.
And in practical terms, week-to-week living requires a certain amount of planning. To begin with, the only 'shopping experience' on the island is the kiosk. And while it carries a surprisingly wide range of basic needs, most locals shop off-island for meat, liquor, groceries, and so on, bringing them home on the waterbus (with specially dedicated areas for passengers' personal 'freight'). Others take the barge to do a major shop every so often, fill the car, then scurry back to the relative peace of the island. Alternatively, Woolworths home-deliver online orders to Lamb Island once a week.
Whatever the choice, most of us happily consider any extra effort a more-than-fair trade-off for the advantages of living such a natural and laidback island lifestyle – free of pollution, traffic, noise, crime, hustle-and-bustle, and angst.
In fact, there's an attitude that inevitably takes over Lamb Island residents, one that’s heard time and time again as locals get off the waterbus after a trip to the mainland (which we refer to as 'Australia') and it usually goes something like:

We just had the most amazing time with over 50 children from Father's House in Kiev, Ukraine going to McDonalds. This event was paid for by Ed Dickson, from Loads of Love in connection with his famous event each year called McJoyful Christmas. Ed joined us with his family and gave a wonderful little talk to the children about being special. He shared that they came from the Heavenly Father God, through their parents to serve here on earth in the special way that God had in mind for them. Wow. One litte boy came up to Ed after the event and thanked him for saying those words.
It was a very exciting time for the children and staff from Father's House. Praise God for you all - our sponsors in prayer and financial resources. None of us could do this without you....

Finding your true calling in life is the job of every human being. I mean if we did not know our true calling, then what’s the point of us being here in this world? Fortunately, everybody got their own unique calling which is the easy part while the hard part is finding it. Like Mark Twain once said, “The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.”
The sad thing is some of us still does not found it until now because they choose to play it safe and settle down. Because of that, their life is somehow unhappy. For this reason, I want to put an end to it, because I want all of you to have a good life and live your life to the fullest. Steve jobs had once said that , “The only way to do a great job is to love what you do, if you haven’t found it yet, keep looking.Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it“.
For this blog post, I am here for exactly for that. To help you find out your true calling. Proceed your reading below my friends.
First of all, ask yourself about how much do you love about your current profession. On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate your love working as engineer? or as an accountant? or as a secretary? and something like that. You get the point. Is it going to be high as 8 to 10 or below 5? And then ask yourself, “are you happy with the current job that you have?”. If the answer for this is yes, then you are on the right track. If not, proceed to second point below.
Yes, of course it is s a good thing to have a plan for your future but what you do in the present is what you are going to be in the future right? So you have to keep on trying out new thing or do a little bit experimenting about what you love. For starters, you can with your hobbies such as running, helping other people, writing and whatever you love to do. And then, find out if you can generate some cash from the hobbies. Still not enough? Then proceed to the third point.
In other words, find the needs that other people are not satisfied with and ask yourself “can i do it better?” or “can i solve this problem better than anyone else?”. If yes, try it out and if you do not know the answer, sometimes you can only find you after you try it out. So, be mentally prepare for failure if things go south. Remember, finding out your true calling is not going to be easy, sometime you can found out on a random moments and some are found through experimenting life. Also, finding out what benefits other is the another way that you do to explore the needs of the society.
Because life is too short to live on other people dreams. Just because your parents want or think that you should be a doctor does not mean you should become one. Sometimes it is, but mostly it isn’t. Following someone else dreams is not a good way to have a good life. Remember, you cannot please everyone, but if you do what YOU think you should, at least you’ll be able to sleep at night. Also, if you follow someone else dreams, who wants to follow your dreams? Be yourself and be originals.
Alternatively (or additionally), if you still my blog post is still enough to feed your needs to find your ONE true calling then i suggest you to proceed your readings at my two recommended readings below. These two books were the one that had save me the time and money while finding my one true calling.
If you ask me to describe how great this book is, it would be “Fantastic“. Because the books tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of his own worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago’s journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts (our calling), of recognizing opportunity (needs) and learning to read the omens strewn along life’s path (opportunity), and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.
Why this book? Simple enough because Jeff Goins (the author) will explains to you how to abandon the status quo and live a life that matters with true passion and purpose. In fact, the path to your life’s work is difficult and risky, even scary, which is why few finish the journey. This is a book about discovering your life’s work, that treasure of immeasurable worth we all longing for. It’s about the task you were born to do.
Moreover, life seldom turns out to be what we had hoped and planned for. The twist of fate, setbacks and surprises had left us with no choice but to play it safe. But what if you can turn all of this around? This books will tell you how!
The journey is not going to be easy. We have to prepare as much as we can especially mentally. Also, you only live one time in this world, so make the most of it. Do not settle down. Find out what you were born to do. I end this post with a reminder question at the heart of that famous line from poet Mary Oliver: “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”
It’s Time To Believe In Your Dreams Sometime or someday when you you are working on you dream and things started to get super hard. This is the time when you have to give extra focus to ...

Prashanth Selvaraj has a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Master's degree in Fluid Mechanics from Ecole Polytechnique, Paris, France. During his Ph.D., he studied the dynamics of epileptic seizures that form in the human cortex using a phsyiologically relevant mathematical model of cortical dynamics. Additionally, he proposed the use of optogenetics, which involves light sensitive ion channels expressed by certain cell types in the cortex, to inhibit the spread of seizures before they are fully formed using closed loop control methods. After his Ph.D., Prashanth worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, as part of the DARPA SUBNETS initiative. He investigated the underlying meso-scale networks in the brain that contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders like PTSD and depression, and worked on a closed loop method of electrical stimulation to disrupt the function of these networks alleviating symptoms of these disorders. As part of the research team at IDM, Prashanth works on calibrating mathematical models of disease spread and control to the dynamics of malaria in different regions around the world.
Aw, this was a very nice post. In thought I want to put in writing like this additionally – taking time and actual effort to make a very good article… but what can I say… I procrastinate alot and by no means appear to get something done.
There are some attention-grabbing cut-off dates in this article however I don’t know if I see all of them middle to heart. There may be some validity but I’ll take hold opinion till I look into it further. Good article , thanks and we wish extra! Added to FeedBurner as nicely
Can I simply say what a reduction to search out someone who truly knows what theyre talking about on the internet. You positively know the way to bring an issue to gentle and make it important. More people have to read this and perceive this side of the story. I cant consider youre not more popular because you positively have the gift.
I’d need to examine with you here. Which isn’t something I normally do! I take pleasure in studying a post that can make people think. Also, thanks for allowing me to comment!
We are able to offer a UN certified version for the transport of hazardous materials in cylindrical tin containers. The UN certification is obtained through a special adhesive compound that is applied in the TT ring of the tin container. This sticks the lid even firmer onto the paint tin than normal.
In principle, the cylindrical tin containers can be closed by hand. A lid shutting unit can relatively easily be integrated into the filling line at greater filling speeds. The smaller sizes (up to 1 litre) generally have RL closing. In this closing, the lid falls onto the inside of the ring and closes there as well. Some 500 ml and 750 ml tin containers have a TT closing. A TT closing has a double shape in the top of the ring, and the lid falls into the ring. The TT closing is particularly suited to adding colour to paints and lacquers (colour mixing system), because resealing is easiest and the quality of the reseal is highest. The car paintwork industry often works with a mixing lid. These generally connect best to TT closings.
In absolute terms of airtightness, the RL closing is a tighter closing than the TT closing. However, both varieties are very suitable for the packaging of paints and lacquers.

You know how important it is to get this thing done, because it’s going to have such a huge impact on your life or business. You’ve tried it a bunch of different ways, but you just can’t seem to make it happen for some reason.
The only way to see the results that you want so much, is to actually do the thing. You’re the one that has to take action and make it happen. And you’re sick of trying to figure how. What are you going to lose out on if it doesn’t happen? You’ve waited long enough to get this thing done.
– You had a strong sense of focus and control over what you’re working on, instead of constantly wondering how you’re going to make it happen.
– I know for certain that you can follow through, finish that project and accomplish exactly what you want.
– There is a perfect process and system that’s going to allow you get those important projects started and (finally) done.
– You don’t need to struggle and can make starting and finishing projects a habit – it will become second nature for you and “getting stuff done” will be your middle name.
– It is possible for you to create whatever impact you want in your business. You’ve got business goals, vision and purpose and there’s no reason you can’t make them a reality!
– A clear and easy to implement plan of action that allows you to get started on that important project right away.
– I’ll show you a proven step-by-step strategy that you can follow to see your project through to completion within 30 days.
– Guidance and support that’s going to set you up for success and show you exactly what you need to do.
When you’re truly productive, you’ll become even more creative and innovative. Not having a plan is actually suppressing your creative juices, because your mind is too busy jumping between tasks and trying to figure out what to do next. Freeing your mind with a solid plan will help your creativity flow more freely.
The Plan Your Next 30 Days package involves just 2 hours of 1-on-1 coaching (that’s less than 1% of your time over the entire month). Intentionally setting aside time to plan and strategize is going to save you tons of time in the long run, because you’ll now be able to take action, follow through and get stuff done quickly and easily. And (bonus!) you can apply what you learn in productivity coaching throughout the rest of your life.
Take a moment and think about what else you spend your money on. The cost of productivity coaching is equivalent to one meal eaten out each day, or a couple of cocktails with friends, or an Uber ride. How much do you value your time? Time is a limited resource and we can’t get more of it. Investing in better management of your time will give you the two things most commonly linked to happiness and satisfaction: freedom and experiences. Not to mention a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
“I’ll keep trying myself to find a system and strategy that works. Maybe I’ll come back to this later.”
How much time have you already spent trying to get things done? How many different hacks, tricks, apps and ideas have you tried? How have they worked out for you? Since you’re reading this website, I’m guessing not so good. And if you just keep trying the same strategies, why would the results change? Ask yourself what you’re gaining or losing out on by not taking action today. When you don’t take action, nothing changes, and everything stays the same. Plus, you already wear so many hats as an entrepreneur – give yourself permission to work with a productivity coach, so you can focus on your own area of expertise.
Productivity Coaching can help you plan anything and everything you’re working on: event planning, writing a book, blogging, creating digital products, creating physical products. You name it! It all needs to get done, so it all needs a plan.
You wouldn’t want to spend time and effort trying to repair your plumbing, or fixing a broken computer. You’d call in the experts to save you the hassle! Hiring a Productivity Coach is the same thing. Don’t leave it to chance, and don’t just hope for the best. Bring someone in that knows this productivity stuff inside out. Someone who can give you an outside perspective, and a fresh start, so you can get out of your head and see the results you want so much easier and quicker. My clients have gone from lost and confused, to focused and intentional. Others have shifted from a mindset of “I never do what I say I will, so why bother trying?” to “Yes this is so possible for me!” (and then actually getting it done). One woman I worked with said my coaching made her feel more empowered to meet her goals. These could be your stories.
– It starts with a 90 minute 1-on-1 Productivity Coaching session (via Zoom video call). We’ll deep dive into your project, the challenges, and what you want to accomplish most. You’ll walk away with a personalized plan of action that works perfectly for you, you’re schedule and what you need to get done.
– Two weeks later, we’ll have a 30 minute check-in session. We’ll talk about the progress you’ve made so far, and address any roadblocks that come up. We’ll make sure your plan of action is having an impact, and that you’re starting to see the progress you want.
– You’ll have unlimited access to me for one whole month! Just send me a quick me message on Voxer (it’s super easy and free to use). Questions, thoughts and uncertainty will inevitably come up for you – Voxer is a great way to pick my brain so you can keep moving forward, instead of waiting for your check-in session when you get stuck.
– Worksheets to help solidify your newfound plans. Getting it all out on paper will make them more real and motivate you to take action. It also frees up you mind from distraction, allowing you more space to be creative and efficient with your time.
– A written summary of everything we discuss at your coaching sessions. Don’t worry, I’m not here to overwhelm you even more – I’ll keep notes so you’ll always have them as reference.
– Your very own private and customized Client Portal. This gives you easy access to all of your documents in one place (client contract, invoice, coaching notes, worksheets, and more)!
– Click “Schedule Event” and you’re all set! Congrats on taking this big step towards a more productive you!
We’ll have a quick 20-30 minute heart to heart about your challenges and struggles with getting sh** done, achieving your goals and that never ending to-do list. You’ll discover what exactly you can do to find more time in your schedule for those things that matter most to you (psssst: it is possible!)
“Before working with Jodi, I felt like I was spinning my wheels. Every time I started to make progress, I would lose momentum and then would have to play catch up to gain traction again. I didn’t feel as if I was getting anywhere and it was causing a lot of frustration… and not helping my motivation level!
Once I had my productivity coaching session with Jodi, I felt much less scattered and a renewed motivation to keep going on the projects that I wanted to tackle. I had a much clearer idea of what to work on rather than jumping from project to project and not feeling like I’m seeing any progress towards the end goals.
She helped me determine my priorities and a clear plan to accomplish them. I can honestly say that my productivity has increased, and I’ve already seen measurable progress towards my goals. Thank you Jodi!”
“Jodi gave me great ideas on how to dramatically cut back my admin time. She questioned my schedule and helped me to see that I can cut back the amount of time I spend on certain things.
She helped me to tackle large projects that had daunted me beforehand. Now I’m looking forward to getting into them! She gave me a ton of tips, ideas and encouragement that I wouldn’t have found on my own. What a relief!
Jodi is a good listener, and she instantly had great ideas which I could put into practice straight away. She’s not a scary uber-productive coach; she has down-to-earth tips and picks you up where you are.”
“As an entrepreneur there is always so much to do and working with Jodi helped me to think about what I need to prioritize. I learned not to do everything at once and not to over work.
I knew what I wanted to achieve, and having accountability and support made it easier for me to accomplish. And because we planned my time out well, I stuck to it.
I would say if you have a one- off task or project to get done in a limited amount of time call Jodi! She’s an entrepreneurs best friend. As entrepreneurs we tend to try and take on too much alone. Even a coach needs a coach!”
“I’m a person with tons of ideas, and like to juggle several things at the same time. After speaking with Jodi, I was able to prioritize the many projects I’m working on, and she gave me actionable advice about how to simplify my to do list. This has changed everything for me!
Now that I can identify my most important tasks, I’m able to get them done first. And I know that I will still have time for all my other creative projects.
“I was having difficulty managing and finishing all of my projects – I felt overwhelmed and a lack of progress towards my goals.
My productivity coaching has allowed me to see how I can use my time most effectively, and my schedule is now planned out. This has removed distractions and my sense of overwhelm.
Jodi was able to help me focus on what my main priorities are, and to turn my goals into achievable actions. I have come away from my time with Jodi feeling much more motivated and empowered to achieve my goals.”
“I continually frustrate myself by not following through with what I say I will do. I have tried setting goals and using a calendar, but when the day starts and I skip the first thing on my list, the rest of the day follows in that same vein. I have big goals for myself and my business, and I know that if I don’t complete what I say I will do, I will never achieve what I want to.
I believe when you have a business, investing time in your goals, to-do list and calendar is vital. Jodi’s productivity coaching really helped me focus and gave me tools that have made things totally achievable and, dare I say, easy! I am for sure less overwhelmed by my to-do list – I now know I will show up and do the work and I know how much impact that is going to have on my business.
Jodi is an absolute delight. All the information I received was relatable, informative and very tailored to my own goals, issues and struggles. Her advice and service was excellent and the tools invaluable.
“I was struggling with how to decide what to work on, and when. Juggling everything in my life means I’m super busy and never know how to make things work.
My productivity coaching with Jodi has allowed me to make better use of my time. I managed to get social media work done and felt great about the growth I made happen in a short time.
The experience has been extremely helpful for getting my mind focused. I say don’t wait, get help now, and start off without all the stress and confusion.”

Canopy, marque, pavilion, and tent. These are all terms that are used to describe much the same items – canopy tents. While they may differ in terms of sizes, portability, and intended usage, they are essentially the same thing. In other words, they are all multi-purpose shelters that act as devise to keep heat, insects, the rain and wind for us while we sit outside, enjoy a party, read, vegetate or sell things.
Canopy tents are different. They do come in various sizes. You can shop online or visit a specialty store and buy or rent these temporary structures. You may consider purchasing any of the following:
While the uses and types may overlap, while many models may look identical, this gives you the chance to make a statement. You can look at canopy tents and accept them for what they are, or you can trick them up.
There is a variety of ways you can take a simple canopy tent and make it unique or at least a little different. An essential way of accomplishing starts with your decision to go with either a peaked or squared top. When you have decided, opt for a color that will make, it stand out. Stripes are standard, but, if you own it, consider dying it or tying strips of ribbons to add a flourish. This works particularly well with a peaked top. You can add odd sized pieces of colors or applique different patterns, colors or objects or even use special paint on it. This, of course, is not acceptable if your tent is part of a juried craft show or particular craft fairs. For such events, canopy tents must conform to a particular color and style.
Even if you leave the colors for the top as is, consider what you can do with the sidewalls. Many canopy tents do not come with these. They are often sold separately. If such is the case, jazz them up. Make them colorful. Give them that little extra that says they are not only practical but also attractive.
Some of the side walls even have faux windows. Consider adding tinted or patterned glass/plastic to give them an original look. Experiment with other ideas to make the overall look inside and out, truly unique and memorable. Hang flowers – if the structure is sturdy enough or trains ivy or other climbing plants to weave their way up the walls and supports outside. As for furniture – use what is suitable for the occasion, but have it reflect a genuine, intriguing look at life and events. Do more than make chairs, tables and couches fancy. Make them stand out as unforgettable pieces in an art performance.
Canopy tents give you a somewhat rare chance to combine the practical with the memorable. The structure and its various accessories allow you to provide shelter fending off the elements and insects. At the same time, you can take the sometimes plain canvas (pun intended) and add to it your flourishes and flashes. In this manner, you can quickly turn the most average of canopy tents into unique and appealing statements.
Canopy Tents provide the ideal covering for many different types of events. At Canopy Mart, we provide our customers with a vast variety of high-quality recreational covers and canopy products. With customer service next to one in excellence, it is not hard to see why we have customers returning again and again.

Hmm… some of you may be wondering if Flash Lite 3 available on Linux! Well, you can come to Adobe distrobutor like California Software Labs (the company I work for that is
The problem with porting to an OS like Linux is that there is no ’standard’ distribution like Windows. Every developer has its own way of creating a kernel, and adding libraries and packages on top of that. This makes the OS very versatile, but can create headache when it comes to porting Flash player.
Add to that mix the choice of hardware- CPU, RAM, graphics cards, io devices- you are looking at almost unique port for each device.
Having said that, there are certain common things that can be re-used (gnu tool chain for example). Linux in a typical enterprise environment could be more or less same.
The ports done by California Software Labs are meant to be generic, and I’ll post more information on their availability as they are ready.
Welcome to Embeddedflash.com. Its 2014 and the landscape in multimedia world has changed quite a bit HTML5 standard is complete and Flash is no longer existent on mobile.

There were a few ‘brief’ demos shown at CES of Fash Lite running on Windows Mobile, according to an article in Tech Radar.

I came accross this post on mobiletechaddicts.com. It says that the Flash Lite plugin is available for Xperia X1 and works well with Opera. I have not seen X1 in action yet (and I don’t think its available with any carrier in US yet), but it looks like a cool device. X1 has dual ARM core running at 528 MHz and is running Windows Mobile 6. With 128 MB RAM, I think it has enough juice to run Flash content even from youtube. The post does talk about a ‘lag’ in youtube content, which may even come from slow network. ......continue reading
According to a recent analysis in DSP Designline , the main CPU is getting more powerful everyday and the media processor that handeled much of video processing functionality will no longer be needed in future handsets. The article sites research by Portelligent that there are no new media applications on the horizon that’ll drive need for the second ‘video processing’ chip.The use of a secondary processor in high-end smart phones could fall to just 20 percent of new designs by 2010, according to Portelligent. The company sites ths trend that cameraphones are no longer moving to higher resolution like they have been in the past. For example. the cameraphone resolution is expected to increase to 2.5 MP in the near future, from crurrent 2 MP. The report says that the baseband processor will get better at handeling this resolution and therefore the need for secondary media processor will decrease. ......continue reading

Time to vote in another federal election. I have to say, I couldn’t care less who ran the country, just so long as they get something done. There seems to be a lot of confusion in Parliament as to exactly what their job is. It would seem they think that their job is to form a majority government and get all their entire platform passed, no matter what. Seems that they are wrong; what their job really entails is running the country, debating what’s best for the people of Canada and then following through. Today the public are going to speak again, and it doesn’t look like the Liberals are going to have as strong a voice this time round. So I say to which ever party gains the most seats, don’t waste your time as the Liberals did, get something done.

Even for historians – and there were four of us in our little group – it is difficult to conceive the sweep of changes that had taken place over the past half century in the area of civil rights law. Not only African Americans (who heard the word “Negro” on Wednesday more than at any time in the past four decades) but women, the disabled, LGBT, immigrants and others could hardly have imagined the multiple ways America would alter its laws and views on the rights of Americans to equal opportunity in the years following the original March. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and others stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and exhorted the country to embrace change, none could have foreseen the force of the transformations and tragedies about to engulf us in the ‘60s and beyond: church bombing, Goodman-Schwerner-Cheney, multiple assassinations, Vietnam, Watts, Chicago, Watergate – a few of the words whose impacts changed our lives dramatically in the months and years to come. Certainly none could imagine that the President addressing the Anniversary March would be the offspring of a union that was, at the time of the original demonstration, illegal in many states.
Wednesday’s celebration of the 1963 March was an instructive example of the value of a nation’s historic sense of itself. In the coverage of the March, particularly the press and media stories describing the America of mid-1963, we were reminded of a seemingly antiquated world that existed well within the lifetimes of tens of millions of Americans, the remnants of which are persistent reminders that the struggle is far from complete.
One of the stunning reminders was the rebroadcast of the Meet the Press program of Sunday, August 25, 1963 in which a panel of white, male reporters questioned and challenged the guests, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Roy Wilkins. The two guests were among the leaders of the imminent March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and were not yet recognized as the transformational leaders we now recognize them to have been. The interview was a revealing look into the anxieties of most of white America, with many of the questions focused (politely, for the most part) on the suspicions of Communist influence in the ranks of civil rights leaders, and suggestions that the pace of change endorsed by March organizers was too hurried.
King and Wilkins, of course, were having none of that, and gently but unwaveringly reminded the reporters, and the Nation, that appeals for moderation in defense of Constitutional rights was unlikely to find much sympathy among millions of black Americans who, having suffered slavery, violence, discrimination and denial for three and a half centuries, had found their voice and their footing. If anyone needs reminding of the courage it took for black people to challenge a racist legal system and indifferent power structure in 1963, you need not look to the billy clubs and dogs of Birmingham but to the atmosphere in the NBC studio that Sunday morning.
The absence of Republicans from the events on Wednesday was a stark reminder of the party’s deep indifference to those still struggling for equality and opportunity. Actually, “indifference” is a generous term for a party that is aggressively engaged in rolling back some of the basic achievements of the civil rights era, particularly voting rights. Republicans have also reverted to the antebellum principle of Nullification, either by statute or by defunding mechanisms, to defy and undermine lawfully enacted statutes with which they disagree. A party that tolerates and encourages efforts to deny citizens the right to vote has abandoned any credible claim to leadership, not to mention signing its own electoral death warrant in multiple swing states where minority and youth voters cannot comprehend the politics of exclusion.
As incomprehensible as such behavior is in the states, things are no better in Congress. Just this week, a Democratic congressman told me that his effort to add a non-controversial civil rights amendment to a House bill was rejected by his committee chairman despite the acquiescence of the Republican subcommittee chair. The reason: no amendments would be allowed. No discussion needed.
Hopefully, this utter indifference to the needs and demands of millions of our fellow citizens is rooted only in misguided political calculations rather than some deeper-seated mentality, not that it makes any practical difference. Of course, it is also egregiously self-defeating since you do not need a Ph.D. in statistics to chart the changing electoral demographics in states like Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia and Ohio, and several more. If one or two of those states becomes reliably Democratic in presidential and Senate elections due to the rapidly rising numbers of new voters, Republicans face a daunting challenge to find 270 electoral votes. Little wonder Republican legislators believe their only, and perhaps last, line of defense is to keep these citizens from voting, but that doesn’t sound like a strategy destined for success. And while they may be able to retain a disproportionate number of House seats thanks to gerrymandering that dilutes minority voting strength in these same states, they will face retribution on that front as well in 2020, if not sooner.
One of the reasons that 50 year old Meet the Press program was so powerful was because it so starkly reminded us that in the America of 1963, the struggle for civil rights was anything was easy. People risked, and lost, their lives challenging the very biases so evident in the questioning of those skeptical reporters. What many now remember as a national moment of coming together on the Mall was, in fact, a severe challenge to the status-quo in a country that still widely embraced legal segregation.
The issues that flowed from the basic victory of the civil rights movement – an end to legal discrimination based on race – were complicated, and more difficult to address than we had hoped: economic opportunity, equality of education and health services, inequity in prison sentencing, housing, persistent poverty, many of the issues which President Obama and other speakers referenced on Wednesday. But on the basic issue, the equality of all Americans under the Constitution, there is far less disagreement than there was in 1963, and that is an achievement in and of itself. In 50 years, we have ventured far from the 350 years of systematized brutality and exploitation that preceded it, thanks to citizen activism and a willingness to challenge the powers that be. It shouldn’t be this hard, and it shouldn’t require unrelenting struggle, but as the song advised us, “we shall overcome someday.”
For millions of Americans, the greatest controversy involving raisins is how many are in a box of cereal or bag of trail mix. Even the maddening marketing of the little dried grapes as dancing entertainers a generation ago failed to capture the public’s imagination for long. So I admit it is chancy, at best, to write about raisins.
Except that raisins are so much more than dried grapes, especially now, when they have become central players in an ongoing debate about the allocation of power, money and water, that most vital of all resources.
There is some history to my fascination to the raisin revolt launched by an unlikely revolutionary, Marvin Horn. Horn is the California raisin rancher who has chosen to defy the dictates of the Raisin Administrative Committee, a 64-year old federally-sanctioned, industry run board that decides how many raisins Mr. Horn can legally sell.
“What!” you cry. “Somebody is telling a hardworking, salt-of-the-Earth raisin farmer that he can’t take his shriveled little grapes to market and sell them?” What is this – one more example of left-wing, Obama-style socialism intruding into the private marketplace and dictating the supply of essential commodities? First health care, now raisins!
Well, actually no. I have no inside knowledge, but I am going to go out on a vine here and bet President Obama has never really focused on the details of Marketing Order 989. In any event, he has no culpability in the raisin revolt that I am aware of.
The conspirators who are manipulating the raisin crop are none other than raisin growers themselves, authorized by a New Deal era federal agricultural law to organize their industry, manipulate the crop, maximize profits, and control the flow of fruit to market — all, of course, in the name of “protecting the consumer.” (There is one consumer among the 47 members on the Raisin Administrative Committee.) To accomplish their mission of consumer protection, they are challenging one of their own, Horn, who has insisted that other growers, i.e., his competitors, should not be empowered to restrict his ability to market the crop he produced.
I have seen this movie before. Back in the very early 1980s, I was chief of staff for Congressman George Miller of California, who has made a career of fighting for the modernization of federal water policy. Since a hugely disproportionate amount of the heavily subsidized water impounded, transported and sold by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in California goes to support irrigated agriculture, often to grow crops that are water-consumptive, subsidized or surplus, Miller has earned the enmity of much of the state’s farm community, especially in the bountiful Central Valley.
So it happened that Miller’s office received a call one day from a small, Harvard-educated orange grower named Carl “Skip” Pescosolido – not a grower of small oranges (which might have been a relevant issue as the story unfolded) but a fairly small player in the world dominated by the Sunkist and Pure Gold cooperatives. Pescosolido was being bullied by the Navel Orange Administrative Committee, which was sanctioned by the same federal law allowing certain producers of food to create government-sanctioned cartels which would determine the quantity product that could be sold on the open market. In The Grapes of Wrath, published half a century earlier, John Steinbeck had described how millions of pounds of oranges had been kept rotting in warehouses to keep prices up, even as people were starving.
The orange powers warned Pescosolido not to sell a substantial portion of his crop; tons of good quality fruit had to be diverted, allegedly to ensure the quality and volume of those that found their way onto the grocers’ shelves. Also to keep prices artificially high, which the orange board admitted was one of its goals.
Pescosolido was not a predictable ally of Miller, a devout environmentalist despised by the farm community of which Pescosolido was a proud member. In fact, Pescosolido was a conservative Republican, a free marketer who was furious that anyone – let alone his competitors – could dictate how he ran his business. Miller was only too happy to link arms with Pescosolido, and as Miller’s water policy wonk, I shortly found myself standing alongside Skip out in the broiling California sun looking at mountains – and I am not exaggerating in the use of that term – of oranges left to rot in the desert on orders of the orange cartel. Including Skip’s oranges.
I also visited the offices of the offices of the Navel Orange Administrative Committee where I learned that Pescosolido had it all wrong: oranges were being kept off the market because they were too small, or damaged, or otherwise unsuitable for sale. Some were diverted to be crushed into juice, some were fed to cattle. But one thing was for certain, according to the orange bosses: they were unsuited to human consumption. Which was interesting because when we had Pescosolido box up some of his prohibited fruit and send it to Washington, where Miller served it to unsuspecting legislators in the Members Dining Room, we didn’t have a single complaint. Until we announced what we had done, which brought angry denunciations from the orange directorate.
These flow-to-market restrictions were supposed to be modified following the war of the oranges, but as so often seems to be the case with agriculture policy, the big farm interests flexed their muscles to prevent congressional and administrative reforms. In 1983, flow to market restrictions from the lemon bosses resulted in 20 million cartons being destroyed or abandoned. In fact, more lemons were diverted from the market that year than sold, forcing the importation of foreign lemons.
So, over 30 years later, here is Marvin Horn and the raisin revolt. According to the reports on NPR, the raisin politburo is not taking Marvin’s protest lying down; they’ve gone to war with him, hiring detectives to spy on his activities, and hauled him into federal court.
Unless you are an aficionado of the dried grape, perhaps you think this entire issue has no relevance to you. You would be wrong, and not only because such practices limit consumer choices and artificially plump up prices.
Miller asked the General Accounting Office in 1981 to study whether any of the oranges being kept from consumers might have been grown with federally supplied irrigation water. That water is heavily subsidized by the same taxpaying consumers who were thoughtfully being protected from orange oversupply. While neither GAO nor the Bureau of Reclamation (which runs the Central Valley Project) could identify which oranges in the box were the progeny of federal irrigation water, GAO concluded that of the 83,000 tons of oranges in the 1980-1981 year diverted to cattle feed, 72,000 tons of that total were grown on trees irrigated with taxpayer subsidized water. That’s nearly 90%.
So, taxpayer money was being spent to subsidize water that was used to irrigate farms, the yield of which was destroyed or diverted so that fruit prices for consumers would be higher. That, in a nutshell (or orange rind) describes our misguided farm and water policies.
Now the reason this is highly relevant is not just because of Farmer Marvin’s ongoing battle with the raisin mavens, but because the West is going through a massive drought that is going to become chronic thanks to of climate change. The aforementioned Bureau of Reclamation just announced the deepest reductions in releases from Lake Powell in history. Those who are addicted to the federally supplied subsidies are demanding that taxpayers pretend this is 1935 or 1955, when interest-free money was flowing like water for public works projects, and build – get ready – tens of billions of dollars in new water projects to deliver more subsidized water to continue to grow not only vital food and fiber, but also crops we are subsidizing others to grow, that are surplus, or that farmers won’t be allowed to sell.
There are many proven and cost-effective alternatives to building dams, canals, diversion tunnels and the like including recycling, conservation (including improvement of aging water infrastructure), waste water reuse and groundwater replenishment. Some areas, like urban areas in southern California, see the likelihood of huge new projects evaporating and are embracing more modern water management strategies, but there is still massive resistance in agriculture (which uses more than 70% of water in California) and water bureaucracies like the Bureau of Reclamation. Congress shares a big part of the blame, failing to use longstanding authority to fund water recycling projects that could reduce the need for costly and controversial storage and transportation facilities which, in any event, face decades of delays because of financial, environmental and legal complications.
Hopefully Marvin Horn and the raisin revolution will once again focus attention on the need for serious reform of agriculture and water policies, reforms that will focus on the legitimate needs taxpayers and consumers instead of mainly catering to the implausible demands of special interests. Perhaps those fiscal conservatives running the House of Representatives, the ones who can’t figure out how to pass a farm bill without lavishing subsidies on farmers and denying food to hungry Americans, will end once and for all the right of special interest cartels to dictate how private farmers market their crops. Maybe, but don’t count on it. Two years after Miller’s revelations about the navel orange marketing order, Congress by law prohibited the Office of Management and Budget from examining the impact of marketing orders. That was one year after Skip Pescosolido had died in a car accident. He was 55.
Occasionally, an idea emanates from the hallowed halls of Congress that is so boneheaded, so insulting, and so at odds with the concept of democratic government that even a thick-skinned Capitol Hill veteran has to gape in amazement. Surely, no more inane idea has appeared in recent memory (and that is saying a lot) than the Senate Finance Committee’s scheme for developing a “reformed” tax code.
Here’s a word of advice to the uninitiated, fashioned from 38 years on Capitol Hill: when Members of Congress profess that secrecy will enhance the quality of a legislative product, pay careful attention. If that legislation relates to tax policy, be particularly forewarned: evil is threading its way through the corridors of power like the smoky Angel of Death through the Hebrew slave camp in The Ten Commandments.
By all reports, the Congress is working on changing the tax code (I say “changing” rather than “reforming” because, as an historian, the term “reform” typically connotes an intention to making politics more open and equitable). Several weeks ago, Chairman Max Baucus and senior Republican Orrin Hatch announced their intention to scrap the entire tax code and require senators (and others) to make an affirmative case for adding back specific tax breaks and other expenditures.
There may never have been a better plan for ensuring that senators will be able to vacuum up crates of campaign money. This aspect of the Baucus-Hatch strategy means that every single interest must now worm its way into Senate offices to reassert the value of whatever provision of the tax code it cherishes. I can’t imagine how they might help pry open the doors to those Senate offices, or which interests will find it easier to schedule appointments.
But that wasn’t good enough for Baucus and Hatch, who recently proposed that senators’ specific recommendations for deductions, credits, loopholes and giveaways be kept secret. For 50 years. Buried in the National Archives, with each special interest-generated loophole given its own identification number and locked away in tightly restricted servers and impregnable safes.
No chance for special interests to influence the lawmaking process there! No way constituents or the press could be kept from knowing if a senator is trading off tax proposals for contributors or cronies. All we need to do is wait until 2064 and hold the rascals accountable.
The author of this plan, Max Baucus, incidentally is the same senator who held up passage of the Fiscal Cliff law last New Year’s Eve by insisting, at the last stages of the negotiations, on a massive and unjustified giveaway for a handful of immensely wealthy constituents. While most Democrats were content to rescind the Bush tax cut for the wealthy and extend the cuts for the rest of Americans, Baucus demanded that the $10 million threshold for the estate tax not only be continued, but indexed for inflation. So each year, those with estates worth $10 million will enjoy a cost of living bump in the level at which taxes kick in. (Incidentally, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi’s effort to secure an identical inflation adjustment for poor, working families claiming the Child Tax Credit was summarily rejected.)
To Baucus and Hatch’s credit, they did not keep their proposal as secret as senators’ tax proposals will be. A Committee aide sent a memo noting that Baucus and Hatch are going out of their way to “assure their colleagues they will keep the submissions in confidence.”
That same aide reportedly justified the clandestine tax cuts plan by asserting that such a process is “standard operating procedure for sensitive materials, including investigation materials.” No it isn’t! I served as staff director for two committees of the House, for a total of nearly 13 years, and I do not recall a single instance where we invoked any such protection for Members offering amendments. A material’s “sensitive” nature typically relates to its implications for national security or law enforcement, not because its disclosure might embarrass legislators who are fronting for special interests.
In fact, the records of committees, unlike those of personal offices, are considered official public records and are the property of the Archives, not the chairman or individual members of the committee. This distinction highlights the need for the public to be able to scrutinize the files and correspondence of committees to evaluate how particular provisions of law were fashioned. The Baucus-Hatch secrecy arrangement would frustrate this goal by disguising the authors of policy recommendations.
According to The Hill newspaper, Baucus has implied that those senators who participate in the secretive process will have “greater influence” in the design of tax legislation. Senators, I suppose, should be on notice that those who insist upon offering their amendments publicly, and justifying them to constituents, may incur the wrath, or at least indifference, of the powerful committee chair. Of course, if some senators do conduct themselves with transparency, as virtually every other committee must, those who choose to take the clandestine route may be judged more skeptically by the public, and with good reason.
To his enormous credit, Sen. Harry Reid, the Majority Leader, has said he will not participate in the surreptitious Baucus/Hatch scheme. “I’m not going to do it,” Reid declared. “I’m not even going to consider it.”
Let’s be clear: tax breaks (or loopholes, to be more pejorative) constitute spending just like appropriations or entitlements. In all, the tax code contains a trillion dollars worth of tax breaks, some unquestionably good because they reward constructive behavior, many bad because they were enacted as the price some legislator (like Baucus) extracted for a vote on a crucial issue. In a perfect world, we would start from a completely blank slate and build up the exemptions and breaks from scratch. Capitol Hill is not quite perfect, however, and this approach creates an opportunity to milk lobbyists and contributors desperate to retain their provision in the code. Add the secrecy overlay Baucus and Hatch propose and you have an almost perfect congressional Petri dish for misbehavior to flourish.
The proposal is especially revealing in what it says about the senators’ view of their constituents right to know. A quick reading of the historical literature will demonstrate that the Founders believed that the elected representatives of the people should actually be accountable to those they purport to represent. Voters should be able to evaluate the performance of officeholders based on their votes, on the bills they submit, and the amendments they offer. A process that is devised to keep knowledge of a legislator’s specific policy proposals and recommendations secret from the electorate is completely antithetical to the concept of representative government.
Transparency is especially important in dealing with tax policy, where provisions confer millions and billions of dollars in benefits, often with little fanfare. Tax writers and lobbyists long ago became adept at writing provisions to camouflage the beneficiaries of a credit or deduction, sometimes referencing only the date on which an unnamed company was incorporated as creating eligibility for a particular benefit. Tax language, which is designed to be indecipherable to a non-expert, can easily serve the very narrow and lucrative interests of a particular beneficiary, providing windfall benefits or an unfair competitive advantage. Add Baucus and Hatch’s special sauce – secrecy – and you have one of the best opportunities for inequity and infamy ever conceived, with a total absence of accountability.
So if this “no fingerprints” process is such a stupid idea, where did it come from? According to one report, the secrecy process was created “to alleviate the concerns of senators.” There’s a surprise: senators don’t want to be held accountable for the tax breaks they promote, or fail to promote. From such secrecy, we are supposed to believe, will come better, more taxpayer-friendly laws.
It goes without saying that legislators would love to live in a world where they did not suffer consequences for the votes they cast or the legislation they propose, but such a scheme is simply inconsistent with the most basic concepts of good government. If you can’t cast an unpopular vote, explain your rationale, and live with the consequences without cringing before an disapproving electorate, you probably are in the wrong business. Voters cannot make intelligent decisions about candidates if they are kept in the dark about the policies advocated by their representatives.
At least give Baucus and Hatch credit: they have found one way to restore bipartisanship in an age of intemperate interparty conflict. Not surprisingly, the two senators found common ground with a plan that insulates all senators, enables special interests, and insults taxpayers. Maybe they think it is necessary to destroy democracy in order to save it.

Perennial blowhard Rush Limbaugh bewails the state of American democracy, given its recent re-election of a moderately liberal black man—a deplorable state of affairs due, in Mr. Limbaugh’s view, to the empty-headed hordes of “low information voters.” These poor saps are, by right wing definition, liberal voters, or even those with middle-of-the-road political dispositions. Certainly any Obama voter must ipso facto be low information, and almost any supporter of a Democrat. But Limbaugh is wrong forty-two percent of the time, and he lies fifty-eight percent of the time, which means that his caterwauling should be ignored one hundred percent of the time. A more accurate definition of a low information voter is the modern descendant of a species discovered by H. L. Mencken: the knuckle-dragging boobus americanus, who, squatting beside the radio, listens raptly to Limbaugh’s mummery and mistakes the sputum dribbling from his mouth as actual reality. This pitiable cretin bears, as Mencken once noted in a slightly different context, “all the stigmata of inferiority—moral certainty, cruelty, suspicion of ideas, fear.” In other words, the true low information voter is the Limbaugh fan, first cousin to Faulkner’s Flem Snopes, but even further debauched. In addition to the stigmata, and since reality is an insufficient explanation for the menacing forces presumed to be surrounding him, Rush’s typical listener leaps to conspiracy theories, filters out any tincture of rationality, and sees himself as the hapless and innocent victim of the vast and bellicose armies of radical leftists seeking to dispossess him of his guns and his lesser constitutional freedoms. Not that he has ever read the Constitution or would actually agree with any of its sentiments, other than the second amendment. In short, he is as ignorant as a housefly. This constellation of unenviable traits makes him the perfect gull for Rush, who has slopped at the trough of public stupidity and paranoia for years and made a fine living at it. Rush’s overriding message is akin to a gigantic, engorged, suppurating boil on the end of his nose waiting for the scalpel, and when its blade pricks, the fetid ejecta splatters over all of those within earshot, anointing them with his imbecilities and lies, and leaving them feeling as if they have been bathed by John the Baptist himself. But in truth, their low information status has just been lowered into negative digits, their fragile hold on reality further loosened, their panic heightened, and their fact-free anger stoked. They rush, so to speak, headlong into the darkness, girded for the Apocalypse, oblivious.

Once upon a time, in #Denmark in the beginning of the twenty-first century, ambitious young men took on new and strange habits. One politician had had remarkable success with a very simple two-pronged strategy: 1) he never spoke his own words or thoughts, but only those of a committee of Machiavellian schemers, written down, memorized and repeated ad infinitum and - 2) he never, ever blinked, even if you were to throw a stone at his face.
In my #father's opinion the world should have been a silent place indeed: in so much as you did not have a wise or new thought to express, you should remain silent.
I remember the amount as huge. I was sixteen years old and about to play my first professional concert. All right, you probably have guessed the truth: it was not really a concert, but a reception. We were to play for an hour while the guests stood and talked and ate and drank. And we were to get paid for it.
I wrote a blog the other day about easing the pressure on parents: let them do their best without intimations of any original, Freudian sin. You can read it HERE. I tried to suggest that guilt could be suspended, the pressure could be lightened on parents of all ages and generations.
Mechanisms. Machines. A light case of mechanophilia. That is what they said: symptoms of budding fascism. You men. All alike. Always falling in love with them. And I who thought of myself as super liberal - or at least the Clark Kent of super liberals.
The door to the supermarket opened and shut and opened and shut. The young mother waited patiently as the old man hovered on the little ramp, taking a step forward and then a half-step back. He had on a dark, green overcoat and tied under his chin a fur hat with earmuffs. She was clothed perfunctorily; she lived almost next door to the store. But it was cold waiting behind her baby carriage for the old man to move on.
I am very grateful to Christine for the nomination, undeserving as I undoubtedly am. Let me second Christine's own nomination. Radiance suits her well indeed.

I just read a blog by a young Danish mother. She was getting tired of implied criticism suggesting that parents often pacify their children by letting them play with an ipad or watch television.
"Ding! Ding! Dong!" Down the lane he comes, good old M.M. His little truck of frozen goods rolls slowly past the homes of the busy commuters. "Recollection Services Limited" reads the sign on the little white van. "We collect and store what you discard."
The little boat plugged its way through the emerald, azure water of the #Adriatic sea. The incoming waves slapped the sides of our little vessel with the menacing innocence of bullying boys snapping wet towels. We were chugging along the edge of the island, against the current, the tide, and the wind, to get a closer look at the sparkling grottoes that dotted the coast. Our skipper managed to steer against the waves, through the rocks, defying fate with one hand on the wheel and the other on his constantly refilled glass of #Ouzo.
It is my blog's anniversary! Let us take stock after this first year. I started publishing here on May 4, 2013. The idea was to stimulate interest in my work, and thus in my book, "Pieces: A Life in Eight Movements and a Prelude" (WiDo Publishing).

As you may experienced already, Joomla 1.7 has simplified much of the Joomla content work-flow, making things easier and faster to do. However, one of the things that has gotten slightly more complicated is finding and emptying the trash.
In Joomla 1.5 the article trash can be easily managed and emptied by selecting Content > Article Trash from the main menu. In Joomla 1.7, that menu item is gone but the trash feature is still there.
In the article manager, an article can be trashed by selecting its checkbox (to the left of the title) and clicking "Trash" from the row of icons at the top right. That is the same as in Joomla 1.5.
Let's say that you want to restore an article, delete an article permanently or just view the items. This is done by using the Status select box. If you click the Status select box in the row of filtering options you will see "Trashed" as one of the options. Click that.
Now you're in the Trash Manager and can empty the trash or restore articles by checking the item and choosing "Empty trash" or "Publish" respectively.

Hope to see everyone at the Microsoft Calgary Launch 2005 event on November 24th ( http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/Event ... ture=en-CA ) I am one of the 'Ask the Experts' folks and was also at the Launch event in Edmonton where I answered questions on Microsoft's new offerings.
There are still a couple of outstanding issues which I sent to Netgear pertaining to logging issues within the FVS318v3 but I think I'm ready to start the public beta so if your interested send an email to FVS318v3@LinkLogger.com and I'll add you to the beta tester list.
As I am waiting on the couch for my ride to get here, my phone beeps. It is not the friend who is supposed to have picked me up ten minutes ago (and to clarify, if we’d been going to any other movie, I probably wouldn’t have been so on edge) but another friend who is going to a different session at the same time. “There are so many Harry Potter freaks here, lol” she says. I look down at the robes I borrowed from my boyfriend’s sister and suddenly feel a little ill.
At the cinema there are many more dressed like me, or worse, but it’s hard to see them because Hoyts has us all sitting in the foyer and it looks like they’ve tried to cram the 300 Spartans into that tiny space. The whole room smells a bit funky. On the opposite side of the room to where my friends are, there are some girls dressed as house elfs, although I’m not sure the word ‘dressed’ applies here. There are also quite a lot of Luna Lovegoods. You can tell who is dressed as Luna because they mostly have Dame Edna glasses on. From where I’m standing, I spot several people in robes like mine, but a little better even because they have a crest. I join my friends, but the one who texted me is absent. And then we wait.
In fact, we’ve been waiting about a decade for this, so a couple of hours in a lobby shouldn’t be much. I got my first Harry Potter book in ’97, as a reward for going to the orthodontist to talk about getting two plates for my killer overbite. We’d gone to the clinic, and then gone to Dymocks before I went back to school. Dymocks looked different back then. The top ten section was on a different wall, and the carpets were oh so very nineties. It was the era of awkward clothing, and glasses that wouldn’t have looked out of place on Professor Trelawney. My mother still had a ponytail, I think. The book I got that day was The Chamber of Secrets. It was shiny and blue and sat on that top ten wall innocently unsurrounded by all the hoopla that now follows it everywhere. All I saw were two boys in a car, and an owl and some bags. And my mum said she’d heard the book was good on the radio. So we bought it. And then I went back to school. I didn’t touch the book for a while, not until after I’d been given the first one by Santa later that year.
From that moment, I’d been hooked. I remember ordering The Goblet of Fire through the bookstore at the uni where mum worked. I remember reading all the letters from fans printed inside the back of Chamber of Secrets. I remember getting to school the Monday after book five came out and hating this girl in the year below me for blabbing that Sirius had died. Likewise arriving the day after The Half Blood Prince came out, and those two friends of mine who never stopped talking Harry Potter spilling the beans on Snape and Dumbledore. Vowing never again. Taking the day off work when The Deathly Hallows came out, and leaving my friend’s sleepover just before eleven to go and pick up my preordered copy, so that I could spend the rest of the day in bed. I barely stirred to go to the bathroom. Mum brought me an emergency ham and cheese toastie at one point because I hadn’t eaten, and she was worried. But I finished it. I was triumphant.
I’ve always been more of a reader than a movie buff, but the Harry Potter movies became, for me and many others, somewhat of a tradition. Those same two diehard Harry Potter fans who gave away the ending to Book Six have become some of my oldest friends simply by being around every time a new movie in the series comes out. (And in one of my old journals, I have an essay that one of them wrote about why she couldn’t believe Snape was evil. So I’d like to say publically to her, you were right.) I don’t remember going to the first few movies, but I do remember huddling on the couch at my old house with the other one of these girls watching the first three movies. That was the first time I saw Prisoner of Azkaban. Playing the clinker game while we watched, asking “Will Harry marry Ginny?” and getting a green clinker for no; asking “Will Ron marry Hermione?” and getting a yellow clinker for maybe. Asking “Will Ron marry Ginny then?” in a fit of giggles and the clinker being pink, for yes.
The first time going to the film was a big to do would have been around June of Year nine. Eleven of us went to The Goblet of Fire for my clinker-eating friend’s birthday. I remember we went to the film on a Thursday night, thinking we were obviously very grown up, and then walking through the shopping centre connected just before nine to pick up the friend who’d been working. Going back to Clinker-girl’s for a sleepover. Positing what would come next.
The next big milestone for me was movie six. We went for the Snape-Essay friend’s birthday this time, totally on a whim, during the day on the first day it was out. We saw someone from our school there, and hid in the big crowd to not have to sit with him.
It wasn’t the best costume in the world: dumpy old school shoes, knee high socks, a black skirt, a blouse and a vest. I looked a little more like a badly made-up Gossip Girl character than a Hogwarts student. My friends all had scarves in house colours and things like that. We arrived early and sat in a line that snaked down past all the cinemas. Someone was dressed as a Golden Snitch and a boy dressed as Harry put a broom between his legs and chased her up and down the corridor while we all laughed and cheered. The manager had to tell us all to behave. I wished I’d brought cards.
Perhaps I will never again don a silly costume and wait around in a cinema lobby talking about Horcruxes and House-Elves. Perhaps I will never again see a movie at midnight. But it is the future generations that I feel sorry for, the kids who won’t get to grow older with Harry Potter, waiting for his next adventure to be published. The kids who won’t be disappointed when their Hogwarts letter doesn’t come on their eleventh birthday. The kids who won’t whisper lumos into the end of a torch as they read under the covers past midnight because they’re terrified of snakes and the basilisk has Ginny and their mum said time out but they’re so wired they can’t close their eyes because they just know they’ll have a nightmare... anyone else? No? Just me? There will be future generations of Harry Potter lovers, but only mine will be the true Harry Potter freaks.
You just described my relationship with Harry Potter. I was so disappointed that I didn't get m letter from Hogwarts and I also locked myself away from society and technology until I had completed the 6th and 7th book as it came out. When the 5th book came out I remember reading it on the bus, in class (especially science) and then heading for the library at lunch.
Wading into potential blindspots so God can do some (often scary) work there is a significant part of following Jesus. I believe that God’s Word is the best place to go when you can’t quite sift through what is true and what feels true. Lots of times we really want to go to the Bible so that it can confirm what feels true, not to challenge it – but often, challenge our comfortable is exactly what it does! This can make reading the Bible feel like a verbal beating – if you don’t understand that its words are meant for healing not beating.
I’m reading the New Testament with my church this year. We started in Matthew on January 1st, and Matthew has always been one of my favorite books. I never can put my finger on exactly why, maybe because its every word shouts “Jesus was really, real – and His words are really true!” But this time – y’all – Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount. Phew. It’s all sorts of bringing the hurt – and also the healing.
I’m not going to tell you about all of it because I’m still wading through a lot of stuff that comes with a year like our family has had, stuff that I can’t quite tell yet what should be shared and what shouldn’t. I’ve found that the best policy when that happens is just to sit quietly. But as I was reading in Matthew 6 and 7 today, I noticed that Chapter 6 begins with a lot of business about what not to do loudly or publicly, about “Do not worry,” and “Don’t be a Judgey-von-holier-than-thou,” and such. While it does certainly sound like a lot of “Do not’s,” Jesus flows right into this tender and empowering moment of – “Sweet friends, just ask for what you need. When you feel like you are not good enough, instead of making a performance out of our relationship, just ask me for what you need. You are enough in me. When you feel like you don’t or won’t have enough, just ask me for what you need. You have enough in me. God is wildly in love with you – do you really think He won’t give you everything He knows you need and more?”
“Something about the ability to say who we are and whose we are causes humility to come out of us. We can get on our knees and say our junk and do the humble, lowly task because we have nothing to prove and nothing protect. When you have nothing to protect and nothing to prove, you get so dangerous! When you have nothing to protect and nothing to prove, you will taste freedom for the first time in your life. If you wanna be free, stop trying so hard. See, the idea of the Christian life is, ‘I’m going to invite myself into your life. I’m going to exchange me for you.’ Honey, you’ve got nothin’ left to prove.”
She’s right. When you are all wrapped up in Jesus, you don’t need to perform or worry or judge because He really is enough.
A little bit secluded from the beach, but services were impeccable. Reception was extremely helpful with booking tours and giving our group of eight discounts as well as providing free shuttles to the beach area. The rooms are spacious and clean with a big comfortable bed. The hotel is more like a serviced apartment than a resort. Free internet is also a plus, but signals come in and out at certain areas of the room. Note: there are no elevators but they will help carry your luggage to your rooms!

A wildfire ignited Saturday afternoon in the Big Red Park area, ten miles north of Clark in Routt County. The fire is burning on steep terrain in beetle killed timber, near the area of the “500 Fire” which occurred a couple of years ago. No structures are currently threatened by the blaze. Due to the location, the Forest Service is monitoring the fire. If conditions change, the situation will be re-assessed and tactics adjusted. Rain in the forecast this week should help keep the fire in check. The 10 acre fire remains under investigation but early indications are that it was started by lightning. Photos of the fire courtesy of the North Routt Fire Protection District’s Facebook page, click to enlarge.

The AMA Foundation is our fundraising section that focuses on raising money for medical education and research.
The Medical Scholars Fund is the one that we may designate donations through to a specific medical school for deserving students as scholarships and grants. This year, a presentation of $18,572.26 was made to the University of Kansas School of Medicine for assistance to the medical students. This money was raised by Kansas physicians and spouses and is, of course, split between the two campuses as designated by the donors.
The Fund for Better Health is one of two new segments to which Foundation funds may also be given. It will be used for programs that benefit the health of the public, such as the SAVE initiative or anti-tobacco programs, and violence prevention initiatives. Alliances and other medical organizations whose programs benefit the health of the public can submit proposals to receive funding. The Health Literacy Program is part of this fund and was created to educate the physician to discern whether the patient understands his diagnosis, treatment and medicines.
The Development Fund is the other new fund that was created this year. Donations received by this fund will provide unrestricted support to enable the Foundation to continue its mission of service.
The AMA Foundation funds several grants that our medical community might chose to take advantage of. Since they are intended for Health Promotion, you will find them discussed there.
KMSA supports the holiday sharing card opportunity to raise money for the AMA Foundation by supplying counties with appropriately decorated AMA Foundation cards. For details on how to do a sharing card in your area, go to the KMSA Project Bank.
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of POSIX.1-2008 defers to the ISO C standard. The <fenv.h> header shall define the following data types through typedef:
Represents the entire floating-point environment. The floating-point environment refers collectively to any floating-point status flags and control modes supported by the implementation.
Represents the floating-point status flags collectively, including any status the implementation associates with the flags. A floating-point status flag is a system variable whose value is set (but never cleared) when a floating-point exception is raised, which occurs as a side-effect of exceptional floating-point arithmetic to provide auxiliary information. A floating-point control mode is a system variable whose value may be set by the user to affect the subsequent behavior of floating-point arithmetic. The <fenv.h> header shall define each of the following macros if and only if the implementation supports the floating-point exception by means of the floating-point functions feclearexcept(), fegetexceptflag(), feraiseexcept(), fesetexceptflag(), and fetestexcept(). The defined macros shall expand to integer constant expressions with values that are bitwise-distinct.
If the implementation supports the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, all five macros shall be defined. Additional implementation-defined floating-point exceptions with macros beginning with FE_ and an uppercase letter may also be specified by the implementation. The <fenv.h> header shall define the macro FE_ALL_EXCEPT as the bitwise-inclusive OR of all floating-point exception macros defined by the implementation, if any. If no such macros are defined, then the macro FE_ALL_EXCEPT shall be defined as zero. The <fenv.h> header shall define each of the following macros if and only if the implementation supports getting and setting the represented rounding direction by means of the fegetround() and fesetround() functions. The defined macros shall expand to integer constant expressions whose values are distinct non-negative values.
If the implementation supports the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, all four macros shall be defined. Additional implementation-defined rounding directions with macros beginning with FE_ and an uppercase letter may also be specified by the implementation. The <fenv.h> header shall define the following macro, which represents the default floating-point environment (that is, the one installed at program startup) and has type pointer to const-qualified fenv_t. It can be used as an argument to the functions within the <fenv.h> header that manage the floating-point environment.
The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implementation when an application might access the floating-point environment to test floating-point status flags or run under non-default floating-point control modes. The pragma shall occur either outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements inside a compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or until the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within a nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at the end of a compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is undefined. If part of an application tests floating-point status flags, sets floating-point control modes, or runs under non-default mode settings, but was translated with the state for the FENV_ACCESS pragma off, the behavior is undefined. The default state (on or off) for the pragma is implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part of the application translated with FENV_ACCESS off to a part translated with FENV_ACCESS on, the state of the floating-point status flags is unspecified and the floating-point control modes have their default settings.)
This header is designed to support the floating-point exception status flags and directed-rounding control modes required by the IEC 60559:1989 standard, and other similar floating-point state information. Also it is designed to facilitate code portability among all systems. Certain application programming conventions support the intended model of use for the floating-point environment:
A function call does not alter its caller's floating-point control modes, clear its caller's floating-point status flags, nor depend on the state of its caller's floating-point status flags unless the function is so documented.
A function call is assumed to have the potential for raising floating-point exceptions, unless its documentation promises otherwise. With these conventions, an application can safely assume default floating-point control modes (or be unaware of them). The responsibilities associated with accessing the floating-point environment fall on the application that does so explicitly. Even though the rounding direction macros may expand to constants corresponding to the values of FLT_ROUNDS, they are not required to do so. For example:
If the function g() might depend on status flags set as a side-effect of the first x+1, or if the second x+1 might depend on control modes set as a side-effect of the call to function g(), then the application shall contain an appropriately placed invocation as follows:
fexcept_t does not have to be an integer type. Its values must be obtained by a call to fegetexceptflag(), and cannot be created by logical operations from the exception macros. An implementation might simply implement fexcept_t as an int and use the representations reflected by the exception macros, but is not required to; other representations might contain extra information about the exceptions. fexcept_t might be a struct with a member for each exception (that might hold the address of the first or last floating-point instruction that caused that exception). The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard makes no claims about the internals of an fexcept_t, and so the user cannot inspect it.
Macros corresponding to unsupported modes and rounding directions are not defined by the implementation and must not be defined by the application. An application might use #ifdef to test for this.

Education of Translators and Interpreters as a Determinant of Access to Court - A European and Polish Perspective | Osiejewicz | European and Comparative Law Journal
Education of Translators and Interpreters as a Determinant of Access to Court - A European and Polish Perspective
The right to a court is a subjective right focused on an entity, which is the basic guarantee of the realization of other rights. It implies an obligation of the state to organize the judiciary in order to ensure effective legal protection. In the case of persons who do not speak the language of the proceedings that they participate in, the key element for the realization of their access to a court is a properly qualified translator or interpreter providing good quality assistance.
This article aims to discuss European legal regulations concerning the right to a court as well as respective regulations of the Polish national law, to present the role of an interpreter as a guarantor of this right. Next, on the basis of the guidelines of corpus-based translation, this paper proposes a new method of training court translators and interpreters. The application of the new method may optimize court interpreter training process in terms of time efficiency and quality.
Steam has given it’s users something they’ve been asking about for a long time now: sharing their game library. With the beta coming soon, people will soon be able to share their library with friends and family members to play. There are a few stipulations to this as you’d expect. Namely: Two accounts can’t use a single library at the same time. If I’m playing Portal 2 and my friend who I’ve shared my library with wants to play Awesomenauts, he’ll have to wait. Likewise if he’s playing Awesomenauts via my shared library and I decide to play Portal 2, he will be given notification that he has a few minutes to either purchase the game or quit playing.
It’s really a great feature and with up to 10 devices allowed access to your shared library at a time, I don’t forsee any issues with it not being enough unless you’re trying to share your library with your entire clan or entire guild – in which case you’ve missed the point of “friends and family.”
There’s currently a topic in the forums discussing this upcoming feature. Be sure to check out the official Steam Family Sharing page.
Inspired by the Warhammer Fantasy world, Blood Bowl is an ultra-violent combination of strategy and sports games. I’ve been playing this game a bit and it’s definitely a thinking man’s game. It’s got 23 races to choose from and is based loosely on American Football (should be obvious). It’s played between two teams fielding 11 at a time and the objective is to score more touchdowns than the other team – or by literally eliminating the other team’s players. You can play in real-time or more of a turn-based strategy mode.
Blood Bowl is no doubt hard at first and requires some hours of practice, a lot of reading and understanding of rules and dice rolls to get good at it. It’s a bit slow paced but like many other strategy games its fun and rewarding in many ways. The possibilities of online league play are similar to a Madden game. In addition to just playing it and enjoying the game itself, coaching and growing your own team can be rewarding as well. Check it out here on Steam.
Today’s the first day in Steam’s Holiday Sale for 2012. It lasts until January 5th and just in case the world ends tomorrow you may want to look at the games that are on sale today!
In addition to these “daily” sales there will be flash sales that last for a matter of hours, so keep checking back! Apologize to your wallets for me.

This is from Revolutions 01, according to my iPod, and from memory, I think that's a cover CD that came out with long-defunct music magazine Select many years ago. (Select was great. Why can't we have a magazine like that today? I'd buy it.)
Automator is, of course, Dan the Automator, who was involved in the first Gorillaz album and made the fabulous Deltron 3030 album, as well as a whole load of other records I don't own because hip hop's not really my genre. There's a load of random stuff which I only added to this thing to liven up the Shuffle playlist, and to be honest, I think this is one of them. But it's a damned good record, this. I should get more of Dan the Automator's records. I've liked everything I've heard from him. (Oh, except that Handsome Boy Modelling School project, which didn't do much for me. Forgot about that.)
- Fox cancels The O.C. I haven't watched it in over a year, and apparently I'm not the only one. It's a classic example of a show that would probably have been remembered more fondly if it had been cancelled after two seasons, or maybe even one. The O.C. was basically a return to the escapist wouldn't-it-be-great-to-be-rich-in-a-nice-climate shows that they used to make in the eighties, except with a slightly improved social conscience, a scaling back of the bling compared with Dynasty (villains excepted), and better taste in music.
The show ran into problems in two ways. First, they'd somehow ended up with Ryan and Marissa as their lead characters, even though neither was an especially compelling performer, and both were regularly acted off the screen by the B-characters - especially Rachel Bilson, who was fantastic playing the stock "shallow cheerleader with hidden heart of gold" character, and actually made her multi-dimensional. Hell, Peter Gallagher was a more watchable screen presence than Mischa Barton half the time.
Second, they completely ran out of stories. They'd already done all their key romance plots in season one and found themselves with nowhere to go, except breaking up and repeating the cycle. (Season two of Green Wing had the same problem, but tried to pass it off as experimental comedy by being incredibly blatant about it and hoping that people would think it was ironic.) The O.C. must be the only show ever to do a lesbian angle primarily because they desperately needed to find some new pairings.
But it was a great little show for a season and a half, and it could probably have lasted a lot longer if they hadn't paid off all the main storylines so quickly. Shame, really.
Owner of Malibu Stone, David Charvet has always wanted to have a truck that he could use for work at Malibu Stone, but also be able to pick up his kids at school, so he went to his friend Beau Boeckmann at Galpin Ford in Van Nuys and his team helped him picked out a solid truck as the base of his idea. They had a huge selection of trucks and every color you could think of, but decided on the big Ford F350 Super Duty Dullay. With it’s big towing capabilities and huge interior room for the kids, it would be perfect for what Mr. Charvet needed. From there, they went across the street to their customization center Galpin Auto Sports (GAS), who were the famous custom car builders from the MTV show “Pimp My Ride” to really take it to the next level! He got to sit with the team at GAS and they were able to help Mr. Charvet figure out the best things they could add to make the truck a one of a kind vehicle. Here’s part 1 of Mr. Charvet’s experience! If you’re ever looking for a great truck or car, Galpin Ford should be the first stop on your list. The guys were really helpful and made it easy to find exactly what you’re looking for.

The JBI works closely with the office of the Commissioner of Mines in ensuring that land disturbed for bauxite mining is satisfactorily restored and certified. The ultimate responsibility for bauxite land reclamation rests with the Commissioner of Mines, in accordance with the country’s Mining Regulations.
The Bauxite Lands Division of the JBI implements planning and research programmes to facilitate the optimal utilization of mined-out bauxite lands. The JBI’s objectives regarding reclamation and the use of mined out lands include:
Making mined out lands available to meet the high demand for housing and other non-agricultural uses.
Bauxite in Jamaica occurs primarily in the parishes of St. Elizabeth, Manchester, Clarendon, St. Ann and St. Catherine. Approximately thirteen million tonnes are mined each year.
As part of its mandate, the JBI manages the use of bauxite land in both the pre-mining and post-mining stage and together with the Commissioner of Mines ensures that pre-mining, mining and post-mining activities take place in sync with consistent environmental management practices.
In 2004 the Regulations of the Mining Act were amended to encourage timely restoration of mined-out bauxite lands. These changes include the introduction of a time frame of two years by which reclamation exercises must be completed and an increase in the penalty fees of US$25,000 per hectare if the mined-out area is not reclaimed within two years. The companies have schedules for restoration in keeping with the new regulation and are required to reclaim any backlog they may have by 2011.
BCDP projects are reflective of the needs of the communities in which they are located. All project ideas and proposals are developed at the level of the Joint Community Councils or they are implemented on the recommendation of the Member of Parliament after vetting by the Community Council. Projects are selected on the basis of their viability, the extent to which they will be effective in improving the quality of life of the affected communities, and their compatibility with the socio-economic environment in which they are being implemented.
To properly carry out its objectives, the Institute relies on the expertise of various agencies referred to as implementing agencies. These agencies include the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture, the Rural Agricultural Development Agency, Parish Councils, the Postal Corporation of Jamaica, the National Water Commission, the H.E.A.R.T. Trust/NTA, the Ministry of Education, and the Jamaica Public Service Company.

Penny moves back to Miami to start her new job. She must start on Monday, so she has a list of things to accomplish.
C: Reconnect with old high school friends. There was her best friend, Sandra, the dramatic Eva, the dark Michael, her half-brother Wyatt, and her old high school crush Jay.
Jay had never looked twice at her except as a partner in math league, but at least these people respected her.
Jay spots Penny immediately and sets a plan in action. He needs her to pretend to be his date this week. She’s practical minded and stable, which is what he needs his investors to see in him.
Penny’s caught in a whirlwind of plots. Her gold digging mother, Jay’s, Jay’s mother whose out to stop him, and her own plans are being thrown off course. Worst of it is that she’s falling for Jay, all over again.
Victoria Pinder grew up in Irish Catholic Boston before moving to the Miami sun. She’s worked in engineering, after passing many t ests proving how easy Math came to her. Then hating her life at the age of twenty four, she decided to go to law school. Four years later, after passing the bar and practicing very little, she realized that she hates the practice of law. She refused to one day turn 50 and realize she had nothing but her career and hours at a desk. After realizing she needed change, she became a high school teacher. Teaching is rewarding, but writing is a passion.
During all this time, she always wrote stories to entertain herself or calm down. Her parents are practical minded people demanding a job, and Victoria spent too many years living other people’s dreams, but when she sat down to see what skill she had that matched what she enjoyed doing, writing became so obvious. The middle school year book when someone wrote in it that one day she’d be a writer made sense when she turned thirty.
She’s always been determined. She is amazing, adventurous and assured on a regular basis. Her website is www.victoriapinder.com.
Getting out of her car, Penelope brushed her worn jeans to get out a small wrinkle. Not that it mattered. She smelled the coffee drawing her to the door. The delicious aroma of freshly brewed java that could wake her up waited inside. Gainesville had coffee shops, but nothing that held her heart like this place. In high school, this place was her mecca. Her stomach grumbled for the familiar drink.
The coffee shop looked almost the same as it had years ago, except for the aluminum tables and wooden chairs with red cushions. She remembered the plaid chairs and brown tables, but the place still calmed her, like she was coming home.
Leaving Gainesville after college had always been the plan. Just never back to Miami, but she’d changed. She could live here now.
When she accepted the promotion from part-time to full-time, she knew she would have to face her mother and the catch of the month, Lars, her mother’s plastic surgeon. What that woman would do for a free tummy tuck.
The job she’d accepted had offered to triple her salary, provided she moved to the Coral Gables office. Somehow, she’d avoid her mother until necessary. What was the man’s name with money this week? Penny ignored that last call, knowing the man with the largest wallet always took precedence over whatever Penelope needed. She watched the barista get the nonfat milk and finish her latte. She’d succeed here, now. She had to.
She’d call Sandra, Eva, John, and Michael later. Wyatt, her half-brother, was stationed overseas, so she’d wait for his weekly call. These people were her real family.
The man handed her the latte. The first sip gave her the strength to do this. The tightness of the ride dissipated while she tasted her liquid savior. Sighing, she tasted heaven, the wake-up to her day.
Though the unmistakable voice was deeper, she knew who it was without even turning. Her high school crush, who never noticed her beyond her brain. Pulling at her pink tank top, she wished she’d worn better clothes. “John Jay.”
His steely blue eyes and sandy blond hair were the same color, but his build had grown more muscular. The leanness of his youth had given way to broad shoulders and hard, muscular arms. He had a straight, faded scar on his left cheek that was new—probably a bar fight. Rich boy wore his fancy, perfectly fitted polo and jeans, and was definitely hotter with age. His million-dollar smile and devastating dimples sparked a warm flush that sped through her all the way to the tips of her toes.
“It’s a good name, but I still prefer Dimples,” she teased. “It’s what I called you on online whenever I needed you.”
Damn. Rich boy knew his effect on women, including her. He could manipulate her when she went quiet, but she’d learned a lot in college. She’d not let him weaken her.

HIV-1 Vpu Promotes Release and Prevents Endocytosis of Nascent Retrovirus Particles from the Plasma Membrane
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type-1 encodes a small protein, termed HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu), which enhances the release of retroviral particles from certain cell types. This study shows that Vpu affects the distribution of the major retroviral structural protein within cells. In particular, the viral structural protein was initially detected at the exterior surface of the cell, where it assembles into particles, but over time was internalized. Vpu prevented internalization, and instead induced the release of particles from the cell surface. The effect of Vpu was specific for retroviral particles and simply blocking particle internalization did not obviate the requirement for Vpu. These experiments strongly suggest that Vpu counteracts a cellular activity that traps newly formed retrovirus particles at the cell surface. Surface entrapment of retroviral particles ultimately leads to their internalization to the cell interior, rather than their release to infect new cells.

Abbreviations: AGM, African green monkey; CA, capsid; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; CherryFP, cherry fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; L-domain, late-budding domain; MLV, murine leukemia virus; PM, plasma membrane; TM, transmembrane; VPS, vacuolar protein-sorting; Vpu, human immunodeficiency virus type-1 viral protein U
Structurally, Vpu consists of two major domains: an N-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain that anchors Vpu in cellular membranes and appears to form a cation channel [21,22], and a cytoplasmic tail consisting of two putative α-helices separated by a conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site [23]. Both the cytoplasmic tail and the TM domain are required for CD4 down-regulation [24]. Conversely, while truncations of the cytoplasmic tail are reported to have little effect on the ability of Vpu to enhance virion release, mutations that truncate the TM domain or change blocks of conserved residues within it impede this second function [24–26].
Early studies showed that expression of Vpu could enhance the release of diverse retroviral particles from human cells, irrespective of whether those retroviruses normally encode a Vpu protein [18]. More recent studies strongly suggest that Vpu, as well as the Vpu-like activity of HIV-2 envelope proteins [27], acts by overcoming a novel species-specific host restriction to HIV release [28,29]. Specifically, while efficient HIV-1 particle release from African green monkey (AGM) COS cells exhibits no requirement for Vpu expression, release from heterokaryons formed between COS and various human cell lines appears Vpu-dependent [28]. Additionally, the Env protein of HIV-2, previously reported to harbor a Vpu-like activity in that it stimulates virion release [27], also enhances HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MLV) release from simian–human cell heterokaryons [29]. The host factors responsible for this apparently dominant restriction and the method by which they act to inhibit release are undefined at present. Nonetheless, several electron microscopy studies showed that Vpu-defective HIV-1 accumulates as morphologically mature virion particles at the plasma membrane (PM) and in intracellular vacuoles [17,18]. In addition, one previous study suggested that Vpu changes the subcellular localization of HIV-1 Gag [30].
The matrix domain of HIV-1 Gag is largely responsible for targeting to the cellular membrane, but conflicting studies have postulated a role for HIV-1 matrix in Vpu-mediated particle release [31,32]. Nonetheless, the appearance of HIV-1 Vpu-defective particles in internal membrane-bound compartments [17,18] is suggestive of a Gag targeting defect, or a defect in the endosome-to-PM trafficking pathway that has recently been proposed to be important for retrovirus assembly and release [33–41]. Importantly, the HIV-1 morphogenesis defect associated with Vpu deficiency is distinct from that associated with p6 mutations that abolish late-budding domain (L-domain) function [42]. In the latter case, class E vacuolar protein-sorting (VPS) factor recruitment is defective, resulting in maintenance of continuity between viral and cellular membrane and accumulation of incompletely formed immature virions at the PM [43,44].
In this study, we determined the effects of Vpu on HIV-1 and MLV Gag distribution in cells where Vpu is required, or not required, for efficient virion release. Notably, we find that Vpu can cause a dramatic change in HIV-1 and MLV Gag localization in cells where it enhances virus release. Specifically, Vpu prevented accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag in endosomal compartments. Interestingly, inhibition of endocytosis or early endosome function similarly prevented the intracellular accumulation of Gag in endosomes, but did not rescue Vpu-defective virus release. Moreover, Gag localization to endosomes required that it be competent to complete late-budding steps. Thus, we propose that Vpu overcomes a host activity that prevents the release of completely formed virions from the cell surface, and that this host cell–specific activity leads to subsequent virion endocytosis and sequestration in endosomes.
To permit studies of the effects of Vpu on retrovirus assembly and release, we first sought to identify human cell lines in which particle release was Vpu-dependent and -independent. Cells were transfected with an HIV-1 proviral plasmid (NL4.3), a Vpu-defective derivative (NL4.3delVpu), or an MLV Gag-Pol–expression plasmid along with plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP, as a control), Vpu, or an inactive Vpu mutant in which the TM domain was replaced by that of human CD8 (V8). As expected, Western blot and infectious virion titration assays showed that HIV-1 release from human HeLa cells was clearly responsive to Vpu (Figure 1). Specifically, the levels of extracellular virions, as detected by an anti-p24CA antibody, from cells transfected with the NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmid, were significantly reduced as compared to those released from wild-type proviral plasmid-transfected cells, despite equivalent levels of precursor p55Gag levels in the cell lysates (Figure 1A). Expression of Vpu in trans rescued Vpu-defective HIV-1 release to levels similar to those of the wild-type virus, whereas the mutant Vpu, V8, was inactive (Figure 1A).
Human HeLa and HOS cells, together with AGM Vero cells, were transfected with HIV-1 NL4.3 and NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids, or an MLV Gag-Pol–expression vector, as indicated, in the presence of plasmids expressing either no Vpu (none), codon-optimized Vpu, or an inactive Vpu mutant containing a CD8 TM domain (V8).
(A and B) Western blot analyses of cell and virion lysates, probed using antibodies to HIV-1 (A) or MLV CA (B).
As has previously been shown [18,29], Vpu also stimulated MLV particle release from HeLa cells (Figure 1B). In the case of MLV, it was notable that more mature processed capsid (CA, p30) accumulated in HeLa cells in the absence of Vpu than in its presence, despite unchanged levels of Pr65 Gag precursor (Figure 1B). Thus, Vpu expression apparently reduced HeLa cell–associated mature MLV CA and redistributed it to the culture supernatant. Infectious virion–release assays also showed that Vpu expression enhanced NL4.3delVpu release from HeLa cells by approximately 10-fold, as assayed by β-galactosidase activity in TZM indicator target cells (Figure 1C). A similar increase in yield of infectious MLV vector particles (pseudotyped with VSV-G and carrying an HIV-1 Tat–expressing vector) was obtained in response to Vpu expression in virus-producing HeLa cells (Figure 1D).
In contrast, the effect of Vpu on HIV-1 or MLV release was very different in HOS cells (Figure 1A–1D). Specifically, NL4.3 and NL4.3delVpu were released equivalently from HOS cells, and there was no discernable effect of Vpu expression in trans on the level of HIV-1 or MLV particle release, measured using Western blot or infectious particle assays (Figure 1A–1D). Curiously, when compared to HeLa cells, HOS cell lysates appeared to contain proportionally less HIV-1 CA compared to p55Gag (Figure 1A). Moreover, only low levels of mature or immature MLV Gag were detected in HOS cell lysates, despite reasonably abundant particle yield from culture supernatants (Figure 1B). These data suggested that mature HIV-1 and MLV particle release is somewhat more efficient from HOS cells than from HeLa cells. Finally, as a control, AGM Vero cells were also tested, and these results were consistent with previous studies that HIV-1 release from AGM cells is unresponsive to Vpu expression [28] (Figure 1A–1D). Taken together, these results show that the ability of Vpu to enhance retroviral release is not only dependent on host-cell species, as previously shown [28], but is also human cell type–dependent.
HIV-1 and MLV Gag Accumulate in Endosomal Compartments in HeLa Cells but Not in HOS Cells, and This Accumulation Is Prevented by Vpu
Having identified human cell types (HeLa and HOS) in which Vpu expression differentially affected retroviral particle release, we next examined whether HIV-1 and MLV Gag proteins displayed any differences in distribution in HeLa and HOS cells. Cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 or MLV Gag-CFP, then fixed and observed by deconvolution microscopy. Initially, observation was done using cells fixed at 18 h after transfection, and we found that HIV-1 and MLV Gag-CFP could exhibit three distinct patterns of localization in HeLa cells. First, a diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed primarily in cells expressing apparently lower levels of Gag-CFP (unpublished data). Alternatively, in cells expressing apparently higher levels of Gag-CFP, the fluorescent signal could be observed to be concentrated primarily either at the PM or in intracellular accumulations. Mixed distributions could also be observed and examples are shown in Figure 2A. In contrast, Gag-CFP only rarely exhibited discrete intracellular accumulations in HOS cells, with most cells exhibiting only PM-associated accumulation or low-level diffuse fluorescence (Figure 2B). By simply counting the number of Gag-CFP–positive cells on the basis of whether CFP accumulated only at the PM or at both the PM and intracellular compartments, we found that for both HIV-1 and MLV Gag-CFP, the majority of HeLa cells (~70%) exhibited clear intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP, as well as PM fluorescence (Figure 2C), while less than 5% of HOS cells exhibited intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP.

(D) Examples of HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP (upper panels) or MLV Gag CFP (lower panels) in the presence of co-expressed Vpu.
Notably, expression of Vpu along with Gag-CFP in HeLa cells dramatically reduced the number of cells containing intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations. This result was obtained with both HIV-1 Gag-CFP and MLV Gag-CFP (Figure 2C and 2D). In marked contrast, Vpu had no effect on HIV-1 or MLV Gag-CFP localization in HOS cells (Figure 2C; unpublished data). Importantly, the inactive mutant Vpu, V8, failed to prevent the occurrence of intracellular concentrations of HIV-1 Gag-CFP in HeLa cells (Figure 2E and 2F). Thus, the Vpu TM domain that is critical for virus release function [24] (Figure 1), is also required for effecting changes in HIV-1 and MLV Gag localization (Figure 2E and 2F), specifically in cells (HeLa) where Vpu is required for efficient virion release.
Intracellular accumulations of HIV-1 and MLV Gag have been proposed to be a consequence of Gag targeting and/or virion budding into late endosomal compartments [33–40]. Consistent with this, and as has been previously reported [34,36,37], some of the intracellular accumulations of HIV-1 Gag-CFP in HeLa cells were coincident with late endosomes as revealed by antibody staining for CD63 (Figure 3A). However, co-expression of HIV-1 Gag-CFP with a cherry fluorescent protein (CherryFP)–Rab5a fusion protein also revealed some degree of co-localization (Figure 3B). Rab5a is a GTPase that is responsible for regulating endocytic vesicle trafficking from the PM and the formation of early endosomes [45]. Thus, this result indicated that a proportion of HIV-1 Gag-CFP localizes to early endosomes (Figure 3B). In some cases, the Gag-CFP signal appeared to be surrounded by a CherryFP-Rab5a signal (Figure 3B, lower panels). A similar degree of co-localization with each of these endosomal markers was also observed with MLV Gag-CFP (unpublished data).
Figure 3. Intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP Partly Co-localizes with both Early and Late Endosomal Markers in HeLa Cells
(A) HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP (green) were fixed 18 h post-transfection and stained with a monoclonal antibody specific for human CD63, and a secondary anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor-588 conjugate (red). Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI (blue).
(B) HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP (green) were co-transfected with CherryFP-Rab5a (red), a marker for early endosomal structures. Cells were fixed and images acquired at 18 h post-transfection. The lower set of images presented in (B) are shown at approximately 5-fold higher magnification to give a clearer indication of the juxtaposition of the HIV-1 Gag-CFP and CherryFP-Rab5a signals. White bars in the micrographs indicate a distance of 10 μm, except in the lower set of images in (B), where the bar indicates 2 μm
Based on this result, we hypothesized that Vpu might affect retroviral Gag trafficking through endosomes en route to the PM. In other words, in cells that require Vpu for efficient particle release, Gag molecules might be inappropriately targeted to endosomal compartments or retarded during transit through endosomal compartments. The likely consequence of such a scenario would be a failure or a delay in accumulation of Gag at the PM. To examine the kinetics of Gag accumulation at intracellular versus PM sites, we fixed HeLa cells at various times after transfection with an HIV-1 Gag-CFP–expression plasmid and counted the number of transfected cells that exhibited diffuse, PM, or internal Gag accumulations (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, visible accumulation of Gag-CFP at the PM significantly preceded visible accumulation at intracellular sites. Indeed, at early time points (<12 h after transfection) cells exhibiting Gag-CFP accumulations exclusively at the PM predominated and increased over time. However, at later time points (>12 h after transfection), the fraction of cells with significant intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations, in addition to PM fluorescence, increased (Figure 4A). Indeed, these cells eventually predominated and, by 16–18 h after transfection, an apparent steady state was achieved, with approximately 70% of the transfected cells containing primarily intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations. In marked contrast, co-expression of Vpu with Gag-CFP prevented the accrual of cells containing intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations, and cells exhibiting PM fluorescence exclusively increased over time to represent 60–70% of the total number of transfected cells (Figure 4B). Under this condition, the number of cells containing intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations always remained low (<12% of the total).
Figure 4. HIV-1 Gag-CFP Accumulation at the PM Precedes Accumulation at Intracellular Sites in HeLa Cells in the Absence of Vpu Expression
Endosomal Gag-CFP and Virion Accumulation in HeLa Cells Is Prevented by Inhibiting Endocytosis or Early Endosome Function
These results suggested that HIV-1 Gag-CFP accumulates first at the PM of HeLa cells and, in the absence of Vpu, subsequently accumulates in endosomes. Conversely, Vpu expression prevented endosomal localization and preserved the early, primarily PM, distribution of HIV-1 Gag-CFP. This result indicated that Vpu is not required for PM targeting of Gag and suggested the possibility that intracellular accumulations of Gag-CFP might arise via endocytosis of Gag molecules or nascent virion particles that are retained on the PM of HeLa cells in the absence of Vpu. To test this idea, HeLa cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP in the presence of dominant inhibitors of endocytosis. Thereafter, cells were examined at 18 h after transfection, at which time intracellular Gag-CFP accumulations would predominate (Figures 2–4). Remarkably, manipulation of PM to early endosome transport pathways dramatically affected HIV-1 Gag-CFP localization in HeLa cells, but not in HOS cells (Figure 5A–5C). Specifically, expression of dominant negative (DN) forms of dynamin (K44A) and EPS-15 (YFP-DN EPS-15), both of which are known to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis [46], significantly reduced the accumulation of Gag-CFP at intracellular sites in HeLa cells (Figure 5A and 5C). Furthermore, expression of CherryFP-Rab5a(S34N), a mutant of Rab5a that fails to bind GTP, blocks endocytic vesicle fusion and inhibits the uptake of both fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytic cargo [47–49], and almost completely abolished the appearance of intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP in HeLa cells (Figure 5B and 5C). This effect was not observed upon co-expression of Gag-CFP with the wild-type Rab5a protein (Figures 3B and 5C).
Figure 5. DN Mutants of Cellular Proteins that Mediate PM-to-Early-Endosome Transport Affect Gag-CFP Localization in HeLa, but Not HOS Cells
(A) HeLa cells (left panels) or HOS cells (right panels) were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP (green) and either dynamin K44A (no color) or dnEPS-15-YFP (red). Cells were fixed at 18 h post-transfection and analyzed using deconvolution microscopy.
(B) HeLa cells (upper and center panels) expressing HIV-1 Gag-CFP (green), and either DN (S34N) or constitutively active (Q79L) mutants of CherryFP-Rab5a (red), were fixed and images acquired 18 h post-transfection. The far-right-center panel shows an example of how localization of HIV-1 Gag-CFP in swollen CherryRab5aQ79L early endosomes could be resolved as apparently particulate fluorescence within a vesicle lumen. (B, lower panels) shows a similar analysis HIV-1 Gag-CFP localization (green) in the presence of CherryFP-Rab5a(Q79L) in HOS cells. White bars in the micrographs indicate a distance of 10 μm, except in the far-right-center panel of (B) where a distance of 1 μm is indicated.
(C) The numbers of HIV-1 Gag-CFP–expressing cells in ten fields exhibiting PM Gag-CFP accumulation only (black bars) or additional intracellular accumulations (white bars) in the presence of the indicated co-expressed cellular proteins was counted, as in Figure 2C, and is plotted as a percentage of the total number of cells with Gag-CFP accumulations.
Interestingly, expression of a “constitutively active” form of Rab5a(Q79L), which binds GTP but cannot hydrolyze it [47], and which leads to the generation of a swollen early endosomal compartment, also affected Gag-CFP localization (Figure 5B). However, in this case, while the proportion of HeLa cells that exhibited intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP accumulation remained similar (Figure 5C), the vast majority of intracellular HIV-1 Gag-CFP co-localized with CherryFP-Rab5a(Q79L) (Figure 5B). This result indicates that Rab5a(Q79L) can trap HIV-1 Gag-CFP in an aberrant early endosome compartment, and presumably prevent further transit to CD63+ late endosomes (Figure 3B). In some cases, these swollen endosomes could be resolved as Rab5a-bound structures containing distinct Gag-CFP accumulations (Figure 5B, far-right panel). Importantly, the wild-type form of Rab5a had no effect on the localization of Gag-CFP in HeLa cells (Figure 3), and neither wild-type nor mutant Rab5a proteins had any effect on Gag-CFP localization in HOS cells. Indeed, Gag-CFP accumulations in HOS cells remained robustly at the PM despite any of the aforementioned manipulations of endocytosis (Figure 5A–5C). Thus, the effect of Vpu expression on HIV-1 Gag localization in HeLa cells can be recapitulated by factors that inhibit endocytosis, and this suggests that Vpu blocks a cellular activity that ultimately results in the endocytosis of Gag molecules or virions.
To verify that the aforementioned effects were not an artifact of the use of Gag-GFP fusion proteins, we repeated several experiments using full-length or Vpu-defective HIV-1 proviral plasmids, coupled with Gag detection by immunofluorescence. As can be seen in Figure 6A, immunofluorescent detection of Gag revealed that it accumulated primarily at the PM of HeLa cells when expressed in the context of an intact proviral plasmid, but was also observed in intracellular compartments when a Vpu-defective proviral plasmid was used. Conversely, Gag accumulations were exclusively at the PM of HOS cells, even when expressed in the absence of Vpu (Figure 6A). Furthermore, Rab5a(S34N) prevented detectable intracellular accumulation of intracellular Gag in HeLa cells, while Rab5a(Q79L) showed significant co-localization with Gag (Figure 6B). Indeed, authentic HIV-1 Gag often appeared to be contained within Rab5a(Q79L)–bound aberrant endosomes (Figure 6B, lower panels). Enumeration of cells exhibiting PM only, or of cells exhibiting additional intracellular accumulations, revealed that authentic Gag molecules behaved in essentially the same way as Gag-GFP in terms of the effects of Vpu and inhibitors of endocytosis.

(A) HeLa cells (left and center panels) or HOS cells (right panel) were transfected with NL4.3 or NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids, as indicated. Gag localization was determined by immunofluorescence using an α-CA antibody as described in Materials and Methods.
(B) HeLa cells expressing Gag from the NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmid, and either DN (S34N, upper panels) or constitutively active (Q79L center and lower panels) mutants of CherryFP-Rab5a (red), were fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence to detect HIV-1 Gag (green) at 20 h post-transfection. White bars in the micrographs indicate a distance of 10 μm. The lower three images in (B) show expanded views of a portion of the overlay panels (indicated by the dashed squares) to exemplify how HIV-1 Gag and the CherryRab5a proteins are juxtaposed, Note that Gag sometimes appears to be within the lumen of the CherryFP-Rab5a(Q79L)–marked endosomes.
(C) The numbers of HIV-1 Gag–expressing cells in ten fields exhibiting PM Gag immunofluorescence only (black bars) or additional intracellular accumulations (white bars) after transfection with NL4.3 or NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids in the presence of the indicated co-expressed cellular proteins was counted, as in Figure 2C. Data are plotted as a percentage of the total number of cells with visible Gag accumulations.
In addition, electron microscopy examination of HeLa cells expressing HIV-1 Gag-Pol revealed accumulations of virus particles at both the PM and in intracellular compartments that were apparently membrane-bound (Figure 7A–7C). The majority of these particles had condensed cores, indicating that they were mature, and this was consistent with previous reports that characterized Vpu-defective viruses in T cells [17,18]. Co-expression of Vpu resulted in fewer cell-associated particles (Figure 7D), with no particles detected in intracellular compartments. Similarly, no intracellular particles were observed in cells co-expressing Gag-Pol and Rab5a(S34N), but numerous extracellular particles containing apparently condensed cores were observed. Many of these appeared close to or associated with the extracellular surface of the PM (Figure 7E and 7F).

(D) Cells co-expressing Gag-Pol and Vpu with reduced numbers of cell-associated particles, and absence of particles from endosomes.
(E and F) Cells co-expressing Gag-Pol and Rab5a(S34N), with exclusively surface-accumulated virions.
Because inhibition of endocytosis recapitulated the effect of Vpu on Gag localization (Figures 5 and 6), we next asked whether Vpu facilitated virion release from HeLa cells simply by inducing an arrest of endocytosis. Fluorescently labeled Alexa-Fluor-568 transferrin (red) was used as a traceable endocytic cargo and, as can be seen in Figure 7, HeLa cells that were marked by transfection with a GFP-expression plasmid efficiently internalized transferrin (Figure 8). Conversely, co-expression of dynamin K44A (as a control) with GFP abolished detectable transferrin uptake by HeLa cells or by HOS cells, and labeled transferrin remained at the PM of GFP-positive cells (Figure 8; unpublished data). Notably, GFP and Vpu co-expression did not affect transferrin uptake in either HeLa (Figure 8) or HOS cells (unpublished data), indicating that Vpu does not induce a general block in clathrin-dependent endocytosis.
HeLa cells were transfected with a control plasmid, or with plasmids expressing dynamin K44A, or Vpu together with a GFP-expression plasmid to mark transfected cells. Five hours after transfection, cells were transferred to serum-free medium. After overnight incubation, cells were then washed and incubated in fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml of transferrin conjugated to Alexa-Fluor-568. After 15 min of incubation, cells were fixed and images acquired.
Next, we transfected HeLa and HOS cells with NL4.3 or NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids along with plasmids expressing either Vpu, dynamin K44A, DN EPS-15, or Rab5a mutants. As can be seen in Figure 9, expression of Vpu in trans specifically enhanced the release of NL4.3delVpu (Figure 9A and 9B), but none of the aforementioned dominant inhibitors of endocytosis, which prevented intracellular accumulation of Gag and/or particles (Figures 4–6), could recapitulate this activity. Together these results demonstrate that generalized inhibition of endocytosis per se does not explain how Vpu stimulates retrovirus particle release. Moreover, inhibition of endocytosis did not appear to affect Vpu activity since NL4.3 was released more efficiently than NL4.3delVpu, even in the presence of each of the endocytosis inhibitors.
Figure 9. Inhibition of Endocytosis or Early Endosome Function Does Not Restore Vpu-Deficient HIV-1 Release
Retroviral Gag proteins encode small peptide motifs (L-domains) that recruit components of the class E VPS machinery that are required for nascent virion generation via the fission of virion and cellular membranes (reviewed in [43,44]). The block imposed on virion release by L-domain mutation results in the accumulation of nearly complete, but immature, membrane-tethered virions, as opposed to the apparently mature virions that accumulate in the absence of Vpu (Figure 7). Thus, given that intracellular, Vpu-defective virions appear to arise via endocytosis, the block to virion release imposed by the Vpu defect seems to occur subsequently to that imposed by an L-domain defect. Therefore, we next asked whether a functional L-domain and, by inference, either recruitment of class E VPS factors or separation of virion and cell membranes, was required for endocytosis of Gag or nascent virions by HeLa cells. Interestingly, while wild-type HIV-1 Gag-CFP localized to internal structures in HeLa cells, as before, a mutant containing inactivating mutations in both the TSG101-binding PTAP motif [50–52] and the AIP1/ALIX–binding LrsLF motif [53] accumulated exclusively at the PM, even in the absence of Vpu (Figure 10). This observation is consistent with a previous study which showed that the HIV-1 PTAP motif is required for detection of HIV-1 Gag in a biochemically enriched fraction containing endosomes [39].
HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 (A) or MLV Gag-CFP (B), or mutant variants thereof lacking functional L-domains (HIV-1 Gag dLD-CFP and MLV Gag dPY-CFP, respectively) in the presence or absence of co-expressed Vpu, as indicated. The cells were fixed at 18 h post-transfection and images acquired. Representative examples are shown in panels (A) and (B) and a quantitative assessment of Gag-CFP localization, enumerated as in Figure 1, is shown (C). The numbers of HIV-1 Gag-CFP–expressing cells in ten fields exhibiting Gag-CFP accumulation only at the PM (black bars) or at intracellular sites (white bars) were counted, as in Figure 2C, and are plotted as a percentage of the total number of cells with Gag-CFP accumulations.
Interestingly, we also found that a mutant MLV Gag-CFP protein (MLV GagdPY-CFP) that lacks the PPPY motif required for the binding of HECT ubiquitin ligases [54] failed to accumulate at intracellular locations (Figure 10B and 10C), unlike the wild-type MLV Gag-CFP protein. Conversely, a mutant MLV Gag-CFP protein, in which the PPPY L-domain was replaced by the PTAP motif from HIV-1, behaved like wild-type MLV Gag-CFP and localized to internal structures in the absence of Vpu, but was exclusively PM-associated when Vpu was co-expressed (unpublished data). Thus, for both MLV and HIV-1, internalization requires that Gag contains functional L-domain sequences, and either PTAP or PPPY motifs can mediate this effect. This finding suggests that the endocytosis of nascent virions that can occur in the absence of Vpu requires that virion and cell membranes should be discontinuous, or that L-domains recruit factors required for Gag or virion endocytosis.
Mature, Vpu-Defective Virion Particles Are Tethered to the Surface of HeLa Cells by Protease-Sensitive Factor(s)
Subtilisin-induced release of mature, Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. Hela cells were transfected with NL4.3 (A), NL4.3delVpu (B), or NL4.3 (PTAP−) (C) proviral plasmids as indicated, in the presence of CherryFP-Rab5a(S34N) or CherryFP-expression vectors. Cells and supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection and analyzed directly (no treatment), while cells in replicate wells were either treated with 1 mg/ml subtilisin (+ subtilisin) or a buffer control (+ buffer) for 15 min at 37 °C. Virions released by buffer or subtilisin and corresponding cell lysates were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti p24CA antibody as before.
In contrast, a significant proportion (at least half) of the virions generated by NL4.3delVpu-transfected HeLa cells were not constitutively released, but could be released following subtilisin treatment (Figure 11B). Thus, the absence of Vpu resulted in a loss of extracellular virion production in favor of an increase in a mature virion population, containing fully processed CA, which could be released from cells by subtilisin. The number of Vpu-defective virions that were released from HeLa cells by susbtilisin treatment was increased when cells co-expressed Rab5a(S34N) to inhibit endocytosis (Figure 11B). Indeed, in this case, the quantity of virions that were released by subtilisin significantly exceeded the quantity that were constitutively released, and actually approached the levels that were constitutively released by the Vpu-competent provirus-transfected cells (Figure 11A and 11B). Notably, subtilisin induced the release of particles that predominantly contained fully processed p24CA and very little p55Gag precursor, suggesting that the particles that were released by protease treatment were fully mature virions.
As a control, the effect of subtilisin on the release of HIV-1 virions lacking a functional L-domain NL4.3 (PTAP−) was determined (Figure 11C). In the case of this L-domain mutant, virions are known to remain immature and accumulate at the PM, tethered by a membrane that is contiguous with that of the host cell. Importantly, subtilisin treatment did not increase the release of NL4.3 (PTAP−) virons, irrespective of Rab5(S34N) co-expression. This finding indicates that subtilisin treatment does not compromise the integrity of the PM and that Vpu-defective virions differ from late-budding domain mutant virions in that the former are tethered to the PM by one or more protease-sensitive factor(s), and not by continuity between the virion envelope and the PM.
Although Vpu can strongly induce retrovirus particle release from cells, we, and others, have not observed co-localization, or any other form of interaction, between retroviral Gag proteins and Vpu (unpublished data). Vpu can localize to intracellular membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi, and endosomal structures, as well as the PM [17,55,56]. While ER localization is required for CD4 down-regulation, and may be required for enhancement of virus release [57], the site at which events relevant to particle release occur is not unambiguously established. A recent study that showed that expression of DN Rab11a or MyosinVb can inhibit HIV-1 release in the presence of Vpu suggests that a functioning recycling endosomal compartment is required [56]. Since Vpu localizes to sites distinct from those at which retroviral particles assemble, and from which they are released, it seems likely that the virus-release function of Vpu results from indirect effects on the host cell, rather than on specific components of the virion. Our findings are consistent with this notion, particularly when viewed alongside a recent study that strongly suggested that Vpu overcomes a host cell–specific restriction to retrovirus particle release in human cells [28].
The effect of Vpu on virus release varied significantly among human cell lines, and HeLa cells proved particularly useful for studying this property, because Vpu stimulated both HIV-1 and MLV release by about 10- to 20-fold from these cells [18]. Conversely, human HOS cells served as a useful control, because efficient HIV-1 and MLV release was completely independent of Vpu, as was previously shown to be the case in AGM cells [28]. By observing the localization of Gag-CFP fusion proteins as well as authentic Gag proteins in HeLa and HOS cells, we found that Vpu prevented the accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag in HeLa cell endosomal compartments, and instead constrained Gag accumulation to the PM. In the absence of Vpu, accumulation of Gag at intracellular sites required a functional L-domain and was blocked by inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (DN dynamin and EPS-15) or the function of early endosomes (DN Rab5a). Our observations strongly suggest that accumulations of retroviral Gag proteins and virion particles in endosomes, observed here and previously in the context of defective Vpu [17,18,30], arise from endocytosis of completely assembled virions from the PM. Consistent with this notion, an aberrant early endosomal compartment that is induced and marked by Rab5a(Q79L) appeared to contain the majority of intracellular HIV-1 Gag in the absence of Vpu.
It is important to note that while these experiments document a PM-to-endosome trafficking route for two retroviral Gag proteins, they do not address how Gag first achieves PM localization. Indeed, several groups have suggested that retroviral Gag molecules and/or completely assembled particles traffic to the PM and/or leave the cell via an intermediate step that involves Gag localization and even particle formation in endosomes [33–40]. While the existence of a late endosome-to-PM trafficking route for HIV-1 particles or assembly intermediates has gained wide acceptance [58], the precise method by which Gag moves to the PM in non-macrophage cell types remains somewhat ambiguous. The findings reported herein highlight the need to distinguish between Gag molecules that are directly targeted to endosomal membranes and those that arrive in endosomes as a consequence of virion endocytosis from the PM. Given the dramatic effects of the host-cell type, the presence or absence of Vpu, and the effect of Gag expression level on steady-state Gag distribution [59,60], it is perhaps unsurprising that there is wide discordance among studies that have determined this superficially simple parameter.
While Vpu appeared to prevent endocytosis of nascent retrovirus particles, it did not appear to inhibit endocytosis in a general sense, as judged by transferrin-uptake assays. Moreover, generalized inhibition of endocytosis prevented intracellular accumulation of HIV-1 and MLV Gag but could not substitute for Vpu function. Therefore, we propose that endocytosis of nascent virions is a downstream consequence of absent Vpu function, and that Vpu inhibits an activity that prevents the release of completely assembled virions from the PM (Figure 12). While the nature of this putative host-restriction activity is unknown, its existence is the simplest explanation for our findings and is completely consistent with earlier studies on Vpu which showed that Vpu-defective HIV-1 particles accumulate at the cell surface as well as in intracellular vacuoles as mature virions [17,18]. One possibility is that virions remain attached to cells via incorporation of cellular proteins with adhesive properties into the viral membrane. That mature, Vpu-defective, virions can be released from the cell surface by protease treatment, particularly when endocytosis is inhibited, is entirely consistent with this notion. Indeed, a variety of cell-surface proteins are well known to be incorporated into the HIV-1 virion membrane [61]. This scenario has several conceptual attractions. First, an analogous situation exists in other virus families. Many viruses that bind to sialic acid molecules for cell entry require a neuraminidase enzyme to release nascent virions from the cell surface [62]. Second, Vpu is known to target two cell-surface receptors, CD4 [8] and MHC class I [63], for destruction by proteosomes. Thus, Vpu-mediated destruction of other specific cell-surface factors with adhesive properties could conceivably enhance virion release.
Retroviral Gag molecules targeted to the PM (by unknown mechanisms) require the recruitment of class E VPS factors to enable budding of mature virions. At this point, nascent viral particles are subject to an unknown, subtilisin-sensitive, host-cell type-specific restriction (depicted as a question mark) that results in their retention at the cell surface. Subsequently, endocytosis by a dynamin-, EPS-15-, and Rab5a-dependent process result in intracellular accumulation in early/late endosomes, where they may be simply sequestered, or perhaps destroyed, in lysosomes. Vpu overcomes this restriction, leading to more efficient release of virions from the cell surface. In contrast, inhibition of endocytosis by DN mutants of dynamin, EPS-15, or Rab5a prevents the accumulation of virions in endosomes, but does not enhance virion release, suggesting Vpu inhibits a specific host-restriction activity, rather than imposing a generalized inhibition on endocytosis.
Variations on this scenario are also possible. Because endosomal localization of Vpu-defective HIV-1 Gag and MLV exhibits a requirement for a functional L-domain, we currently favor the interpretation that discontinuity of virion and cell membrane is required for particle endocytosis. However, it is also possible that whatever restriction factors impose Vpu dependence and induce Gag endocytosis, they are themselves indirectly recruited by L-domains. Indeed, L-domain motifs are known to recruit ubiquitin ligases [54] and/or class E VPS factors to sites of virus budding [51–53,64]. Since other class E VPS factors (for example Hrs [65] and AIP-1/ALIX [66]) are known to also regulate endocytic traffic, it is entirely plausible that Vpu may prevent the L-domain–dependent recruitment of endocytosis-inducing or virus release–inhibiting factors to sites of virion assembly. In our view, however, this model is less attractive, because it is more difficult (albeit not impossible) to reconcile with the observation that the Vpu defect induces accumulation of fully assembled mature virions at the cell surface [17,18] (Figures 8 and 11) .
In conclusion, the results presented herein strongly suggest that that Vpu prevents entrapment of nascent retroviral particles at the cell surface and, as a consequence, subsequent transport into early and late endosomal compartments. The absence of a such a pathway in HOS cells, and the finding that generalized inhibition of endocytosis “corrects” Gag localization but does not enhance release, strongly suggests that specific host-cell factors that are targeted by Vpu, but otherwise prevent efficient release of widely divergent retroviruses from the PM, exist in some human cell types. Clearly, the identification of Vpu target factors that exhibit such properties will be required to definitively show whether or not such a model is correct.
HeLa, HeLa-TZM, HOS, and Vero cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin. The expression vector pcDNA-Vphu, expressing a codon-optimized HIV-1 Vpu protein from the NL4.3 strain, was provided by K. Strebel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States) through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, Maryland, United States). A derivative of this plasmid in which the Vpu TM domain was replaced by that of the human CD8 molecule was constructed using an overlapping PCR-based approach. Similarly, a Vpu-defective NL4.3-based proviral plasmid (NL4.3delVpu) was constructed by introduction of a frame shift and replacement of the initiating codon of Vpu with a BamH1 site using an overlapping PCR-based approach. To express Vpu with C-terminal HA and YFP tags, wild-type HIV-1 NL4.3 Vpu sequences were amplified by PCR and inserted as an EcoR1-Xho1 fragment into the mammalian expression plasmids pCR/HA and pCR/YFP that have previously been described [67]. Plasmids expressing DN dynamin I (K44A) and DN EPS-15 (δUIM) were kindly provided by M. Caron (Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, United States) and S. Polo (FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology, Milan, Italy), respectively. Human Rab5a was amplified from human placental cDNA and inserted as an EcoR1-Xho1 fragment fused at its 5′ end to a CherryFP cDNA (provided by R. Tsien, University of California San Diego, San Diego, California, United States) in a pCR3.1-based plasmid, to express a CherryFP-Rab5a fusion protein. Mutants (S34N and Q79L) were derived using overlapping PCR-based methods. Plasmids expressing wild-type and mutant Gag-CFP fusion proteins, namely pCR/HIV-1Gag-CFP [60], pCAGGS/MLVGag-CFP, pCAGGS/MLVGag(dPY)-CFP, and pCAGGS/MLVGag(PTAPP)-CFP have been described previously [54,68]. A derivative of pCR/HIV-1Gag-CFP lacking the bipartite L-domain in p6 (PTAP and LRSLF were mutated to LTAL and LRSPS, respectively) was generated using overlapping PCR methods.
HeLa, HOS, or Vero cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well of a 24-well plate and were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA/well consisting of 800 ng of NL4.3, NL4.3delVpu, or MLV Gag-Pol, together with 200 ng of Vpu, dynamin, EPS-15, or Rab5a-expression vectors, using LipoFectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States). After 48 h, the cell supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.2 μm), and layered (500 μl) on to 400 μl of 20% sucrose in PBS and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 90 min at 4 °C. Pelleted virions were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, as were corresponding cell lysates. Virion and cell lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes which were then probed with HIV-1 or MLV CA-specific monoclonal antibodies (183-H12-5C or D175, respectively) and with the appropriate HRP-conjugated goat secondary antibodies.
In experiments where subtilisin-induced release of virions was attempted, HeLa cells were transfected with NL4.3, NL4.3delVpu, or NL4.3 (PTAP−) in the presence or absence of co-expressed Rab5a(S34N). Viral supernatants were harvested as above, and parallel wells were washed once with PBS and then either directly harvested or, alternatively, incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 with or without the addition of subtilisin (1 mg/ml). The reaction was then stopped with 0.5 ml DMEM/FCS containing 5 mM PMSF. The supernatants were filtered (0.2 μm) and the virions pelleted through sucrose as described above.
Infectious virus release was determined by inoculating HeLa-TZM cells (CD4 and CCR5+), which contain a lacZ reporter gene under the control of an HIV-1 LTR. Sub-confluent monolayers of HeLa-TZM cells were infected for 4 h, washed, and β-galactosidase activity was determined 48 h later using GalactoStar reagent (Tropix, Bedford, Massachusetts, United States), as per the manufacturer's instructions. In experiments where MLV infectious titers were measured, an HIV-1 Tat–expressing, packageable MLV vector (LXSN/Tat) and VSV-G–expression vectors were included in the particle-generating transfection mixture.
Cells were seeded on 3.5-cm, glass-bottomed dishes coated with poly-l-lysine (Mattek, http://www.mattek.com). The following day, they were transfected with 1.5 μg of HIV-1 or MLV Gag-CFP–expression vectors and 0.5 μg of empty pCR3.1 or expression vectors encoding Vpu, dynamin K44A, DN EPS-15, or Rab5a, using polyethylenimine. Cells were fixed at 16 to 18 h after transfection, or at the time points indicated in the text, using 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were then observed by deconvolution microscopy using an Olympus IX70-based Deltavision microscopy suite (Tokyo, Japan) and a 60× objective, and analyzed using SoftWorx software (Applied Precision, Issaquah, Washington, United States). CFP, YFP, and CherryFP fused proteins were excited at 436, 500, and 575 nm respectively. Similar approaches were used to determine the localization of Gag proteins expressed by the NL4.3 and NL4.3delVpu proviral plasmids in the presence or absence of co-expressed CherryFP-Rab5a fusion proteins. However, in this case, cells were permeabilized after fixation with 1% TritonX-100 and then stained by sequential incubations with an α-HIV-1 CA monoclonal antibody (183-H12-5C) and an Alexa-Fluor-495–labeled α-murine IgG conjugate. For electron microscopy studies, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HIV-1 Gag-Pol (pSYNGP) in the presence or absence of plasmids expressing Vpu or CherryFP-Rab5a(S34N). Cells were processed and examined by electron microscopy as described previously [64,69].
HeLa cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine–coated glass-bottomed plates (Mattek) and transfected the following day with a total of 1 μg of 1:1 mixtures of pCR/GFP with either pCR/HA, pcDNA-Vphu, or dynamin K44A-expression vectors for 5 h using polyethylenimine. The cells were then washed and serum-starved overnight. The cells were then incubated for 30 min on ice in serum-free medium containing 5 μg/ml of Alexa-Fluor-568–conjugated transferrin. The medium was replaced and the cells were shifted to 37 °C for 15 min, then washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and observed by deconvolution microscopy as described above.

‘Here you are. Enjoy.’ Our eyes shift from the waiter to the dish he has put in front of us. The sashimi blinks at us. But before we fall for its temptation, we finish our conversation. ‘Mmmm, yeah sure, it’s like OMG you know. But, HEY, did you just SEE that as well?!’
Our senses jump from mouth and ear to eye. A sudden movement has caught our attention. Did our sashimi just move or what?
Thorough study of the suspect of our suspicion tells us that we where probably imagining things. The sashimi looks fresh as can be, but alive? This is Amsterdam, not Tokyo or Seoul.
When we get ready to pick up our conversation where we left it, the sashimi once again attracts our attention. This time we catch it in the act. Of moving. The head of the raw lobster sashimi plans to make a run for it. Even though the canal must be at least 20 meters from where we sit, it seems determined to move from the plate to the table to the floor, leaving its tail behind.
It seems that the lobster is quite ambitious. Not only because of the distance to the canal, it also has to deal with our appetite. But Mr. lobster is a stubborn piece of work. He has managed to get rid of the fellow pieces of sashimi on the dish, many of them being his own body (but not soul as it seems) and it looks like he is picking up speed.
Fortunately for the frightened looking table next to us, the waiter arrives. Mr. lobster realizes his plan is doomed to fail and looses his spirit. Things quickly calm down as Mr. lobster’s head is reunited with the rest of his body.
This little episode tells us a couple of things about the restaurant we are as well as about ourselves. The restaurant, Geisha, is all about fresh Japanese and Chinese fusion food and the proof is in the lobster. What it tells about ourselves is that we have moved very far away from the source a lot of our food comes from, namely live animals. A close encounter of the lobster kind is therefore quite an eye opener.
The rest of our meal consists of both a discussion on this subject as well as wonderful dishes like Kobe beef, Pearl of the Sea, Udon noodles and in jasmine smoked duck.
For all who love fresh, modern Japanese-Chinese delicacies in a pleasant contemporary atmosphere with friendly and personal service, this restaurant close to Amsterdam Central Station is the place to be. Gochisōsama!

The Alabama Homeschooling website was created to keep Alabama homeschoolers "in the know". There is so much homeschooling information out there, it can be a little overwhelming and sometimes a little hard to find. The Alabama Homeschooling website is our attempt to make this part of homeschooling a little easier. The Alabama Homeschooling website is the official website of Everest Academy but offers information FREE to all Alabama homeschoolers.
Everest Academy is a ministry of Everest Family Church in Hayden. We offer freedom along with quality resources, information, activities and support to those homeschooling in Alabama. We believe that the parent has the best interests of their children at heart. We believe that the parent is the first and only teacher that a child needs. In keeping with this philosophy, we wish to be a very hands-off church "cover" school and allow the parent to lead and guide their children in the direction and at the pace they feel is best suited to their children. We ask only for what the law requires while offering support along with quality resources to aid families in their efforts.

The ROSSI Project (Emergence of communication in RObots through Sensorimotor and Social Interaction) funding within FP7 has started. Within the project, we will be developing a neuro-computational model that would allow robots to develop concepts such as nouns and verbs.
We have successfully completed the MACS project in which we have developed a formalization of Gibson’s affordance concept and demonstrated how it can be used at all levels of autonomous robot control, ranging from perceptual learning to planning.
The main scientific objective of this project is to investigate how and to what extend the dynamics of a robotic swarm can be externally controlled. In the project, a heterogeneous swarm, consisting of two types of mobile robots, one in large numbers but simple, the other in fewer numbers but more complex, will be developed. The experiments to be made with the real robots will be complemented by systematic experiments carried out in physically realistic simulation models that will also be developed.

Formed in Hobart, Tasmania, Randomorder have been thrashing out their hard hitting style of Metal since late 2007, the brain child of Gabe Latham (Vocals/Guitar) who's menacing vocal style and original guitar riffs begged to be heard. Matthew Bicket (Drums/Vocals) Justin Wilton (Bass) and Rod McAllister (Lead Guitar) provided the backing needed to see the band switch into overdrive with an assault on the ear drums of their hometown of Hobart in 2008.

Formed in Hobart, Tasmania, Randomorder have been thrashing out their hard hitting style of Metal since late 2007, the brain child of Gabe Latham (Vocals/Guitar) who's menacing vocal style and original guitar riffs begged to be heard. Matthew Bicket (Drums/Vocals) Justin Wilton (Bass) and Rod McAllister (Lead Guitar) provided the backing needed to see the band switch into overdrive with an assault on the ear drums of their hometown of Hobart in 2008. By the end of that year, Randomorder had built a solid foundation to work from and a demo was recorded and released. In early 2009, new lead guitarist Sean Kelleher entered the fold, forming the band’s strongest line up to date. With the inclusion of a new member, the band's music evolved to a more old school thrash metal sound.
Another demo featuring new material was then recorded, receiving excellent feedback from the metal community. The band continued to break new ground in 2010 performing in Melbourne, Sydney and Wollongong with some of Australia's most aggressive bands such as Dark Order, Rampant, Toecutter and Destend just to name a few. They also supported In Malice's Wake and Desecrator on their Australian tour in early 2011. In March 2011, work began on Randomorder's debut album with renowned Australian heavy metal musician and producer, Joe Haley (Psycroptic), handling the recording and production duties. In September 2011, Randomorder's debut album titled THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE was released independently. A savage and intense album, THE FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE will please any fans of raw thrash metal.

Voltage-Controlled Organic Dance Music "5 out of 5" for Kyoto Nights – Update Magazine "5 out of 5" - "Like the best Janet Jackson or Pat Benatar dub you've ever heard..." For Ran Shani's 'Cool Like That' DJ Magazine “Watch this man Closely" - For Sunshine EP - DJ Magazine Producer/DJ Ran Shani is on a roll. With every release, he reinforces himself as a critics' favorite, while his popular success keeps on growing. He just can't seem to get it wrong, and yet he's the most humble cat you'll ever meet. Probably because he's too busy making music, touring the world or composing for major film releases to catch the buzz himself.
Well, the buzz is there - his latest release 'Kyoto Nights' recently climbed to #4 on The Buzz Chart. Ran draws on his unique ability to tweak just the right knobs and get fat hooky bass riffs, in a way that makes everyone in the room think he was born doing it. Combined with his love for pop, what the listener gets is an experience that causes heads to bop involuntarily, reviewers to suddenly be having a good day, and audiences wanting more. That's why Ran Shani is busy these days - playing out regularly while working on a full length album, all the while his productions continue to appear on the worlds leading dance compilations. The most influential Dance music labels such as Cr2 Records, Big Love, Breastfed and others are releasing his tracks, and the world’s top DJs such as Sasha and Digweed are spinning his tunes. When asked about his inspiration, Ran will go into one of his passionate analysis of a world where Jean Michel Jarre met Quincy Jones, they jammed with Daft Punk and why it all makes sense.
When pressed as to what he's trying to achieve, Ran smiles and mumbles something about life in Tel Aviv being at 145 BPM... "...I relax by bringing it down to 125..." Read more on Last.fm. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply..

a. Global Assessment: The external review for the first order draft of the summary for policymakers (SPM) and the second order drafts of the chapters of the IPBES global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services is now open.
Deadlines for submission of comments are 29 June for the chapters and 9 July for the SPM, respectively.
This assessment will be the first global snapshot of the state of the world's biodiversity in more than a decade, since the release of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The global assessment will provide decision makers with the state of knowledge regarding the planet's biodiversity, ecosystems and their contributions to people, as well as the options to protect and use these natural assets more sustainably. Furthermore, the global assessment will provide vital data to assess progress against the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the Sustainable Development Goals.
This second review is addressed to governments and interested and qualified experts, including scientists, decision makers, practitioners and knowledge holders, and it is essential to ensure consistency and continuity after the first external comments have been addressed. Therefore, the widest-possible participation and most diverse engagement of experts in this second external review is vital to ensure the scientific quality and policy relevance of the global assessment.

The second point to consider is how much high quality time you are spending with each other, with and with out your children, if applicable. Do you find time for the unique outings that introduced you together in the initial place? Although investing high quality time with each other with family and friends is usually essential, time with each other alone is of the utmost importance as nicely.It that could be a delusion within the culture that divorce right here's a merciless or poor factor nevertheless it isnt true that is definitely a good outcome inclusive of the parents. Rather than torturing 1 another and accusing and creating the hell of your children childhood, it is most particular to is mostly a divorced. Some also assume that women can't make obvisously that this man can but now this has turned to be only an considering as a outcome of women have never didn't astonish the males by their glorious function and enthusiasm. Immediately we strategy in the direction of the instances that a woman deal with everybody in your house financially, emotionally and statistics show that a girl can elevate a kid faster than a man. Moreover, even the posts also submits the custody of the kid to his / her mother.Wyatt suspected Invoice dated their mom's about the exact same time. Wyatt stated he wasn't a women guy like Liam and Invoice were. Liam claimed he wasn't a ladies man both, but Wyatt pointed out he had both Hope and Steffy in his lifestyle. Liam explained it was more than with Steffy and stated he was waiting around on annulment papers. Just then, Liam received a message from Steffy congratulating him on his engagement to Hope. Steffy also stated she was unwilling to go the annulment route, but she was good with a no fault divorce. Liam knew that would consider six months.So, to steer clear of becoming 1 of the divorce statistics, let's look at a potent witchcraft magic you can solid to make your husband arrive back again to you fast. You should combine this witchcraft magic spell with some magic making up techniques to attain absolute success. Do not sit down crying when you only require to consider some steps to get back again your husband from the other lady.The IRS needs to congratulate you on your divorce by introducing tax legal responsibility to it. In this situation, the company is heading to tax you on any alimony payments you receive from an ex-partner. If you are the 1 paying, the news is a little much better. You can deduct the alimony payments! Both of these rulings are only relevant if the final divorce process In Missouri states that one partner must pay the other alimony. If it does not contain this kind of wording, then any payments are neither taxable nor deductible. How exactly the IRS came around to this view is a little bit of a thriller, but it apparently likes to add just a little bit much more tension to a tense situation.8) Is there court in her long term? Some couples never stage foot back again in the courtroom following the last divorce process In Missouri. Other partners are in entrance of the judge on a month-to-month foundation. Whether it's kid support, custody issues, or contempt violations, court is no enjoyable for anyone. It puts a massive strain on a new relationship, both financially and emotionally. To steer clear of this at all costs, make sure your new wife supports the partnership between the kids and their father. If you see her taking part in video games, contact her on it even when it's simple to consider her aspect because you adore her so a lot. If she is the 1 pulling her ex into courtroom on a regular basis, inquire her-and your self-why. What is there that she just can't allow go of. Learn to pick your battles, and maybe they will learn alongside with you.What changes are the key components that are essential to you. People over 40 are nonetheless keen on dating, but the emphasis for them is on mixing with people who think and feel the same, want to learn and discuss and whose focus is on building friendships first and associations second. Of program, there are still a small group who haven't changed their thinking from when they were eighteen and just want a companion in lifestyle because they can't bear to be on their own. Sadly some of this team drive up the divorce statistics simply because they have not stopped to distinct out their baggage, kind out what is going wrong for them and function on themselves and believe about how they interact with other people.In an try to thwart the smuggling in of Beanie Infants accessible only in Canada, the U.S. Customs Services strictly enforces a one-Beanie rule.

A blog about being a young breast cancer survivor. Musings on life, chemo, being bald, taking care of small kids and trying to work through treatment.
Well things are moving along really quickly here. My doctor has told me that my focus in life right now needs to be beating this disease, and that's definitely taking over the day to day routine. Yesterday I had the follow-up ultrasound to try to see if there's anything going on in my right breast and to verify what they found on the left. I had a physical and will meet my surgeon on Tuesday. Then I will do god knows how many other tests before I can actually have surgery and start to get this over with for good.
When I got to my new home away from home at the Lurie Breast Cancer center, they asked me to participate in a research study. Now science must love me, because the same thing happened when I was delivering Augie. I don't even remember what it was I signed up for--some study of labor outcomes for people who have petocin and an epidural, or something like that. I was in labor and they're asking me these questions. Fine, give me the pen and stop talking to me.
This time, I was selected because I can't have an MRI. Since I'm nursing, I would have to wait 6 months for the test to be accurate. Apparently it's only accurate on non-lactating women for a few specific days of their cycle anyway. This strikes me as a bit of junk science. If the test is almost always inaccurate, surely there must be a better way? Anyway, in addition to my regular ultrasound, I could have some 3-D thing. Would I be interested in being a part of the 1,500 women from the U.S., Germany and Japan to do this? My response: Will I get billed for it? No, no that gets charged to our research department. Sure, why not.
The 3-D thing was interesting. They place an x-ray type of machine on your breast, compress it, and this transponder slides itself across automatically. Very scifi. More uncomfortable than a regular ultrasound, but cool to see the 3-D pictures of the whole boob. My questionairre asked me if I liked that ultrasound more than a regular one or a mammogram. I thought, man if I could be a small part of helping replace mammograms with this thing women the world over would thank me! That test was infinitely better, though I was there for 3 hours, at one point reading an Agatha Christie novel in the dark, lying on my side with gel all over my chest waiting.
My result was good news too. Nothing on the right, nothing additional on the left. I was very relieved, but I'm scared of all the tests I need to get to show if cancer has spread to my lungs, liver, stomach, etc. No one thinks it has, but until I know what I'm dealing with it's hard not to be a little terrified. If I just have breast cancer, I know I can deal with that.
That's not a sentence I ever thought I'd write. But right now I'm panicking with every headache or stomach twinge, wondering if that means more cancer. It's not surprising that my stomach is bugging me since I haven't been eating and I'm a nervous wreck, but still.
It has been very helpful to me the way that people have responded to the news and this blog with so much love and support. It means so much to me. And I know that no one knows what to say, or whether to talk to me about normal things, or at all. I'm sure it will be easier for some people not to see me or talk to me, but what amazes me is the number of people who've offered to come out and help us or see us, even when I haven't seen those people in years. And people at work have been very supportive--there's apparently a group of breast cancer survivors at the Fed, and while I don't know any of them, I will very soon! I've already met another survivor at Gabe's work (he works three blocks away from me and until yesterday I had never been in his office building) and I'll be talking to a few other women who have survived breast cancer this weekend. It makes me feel very loved, and hopeful.
But I'm just not very good at being emotional in front of people, as most of you know, so it's hard too. Because I'm feeling wistful and sad all the time. My gyne seems to think I need to get a better attitude. I think he's surprised that I'm not being super positive. But I don't feel negative--I'm just not a cheerleader type. Just because I'm not shouting "All right, let's take this on!" doesn't mean I haven't accepted what I need to do. Anyway, I know people feel terrible and want to help and maybe just need to hear my voice, and here I am screening calls because I can't deal with talking yet. But soon, I will, and then I will be taking you up on your babysitting offers and I will want to hang out and be social too. After all, at a certain point, I won't be up for that. But now I feel just fine, which makes this whole thing seem surreal, like I could wake up from it. I know I can't though.
I'm starting to get angry about the fact that I will be on drugs for so many years, that I will have long-term consequences of chemo if I need to do that. I'm past the sadness about the inevitable weight gain, hair loss, etc., since that will be temporary. It's the lingering stuff that bugs me--the reduced immunity once they take my lymph nodes, the fact that unless they pass this health care reform I will be on the health insurance blacklist. Also, my gyne was very honest with me yesterday and told me that chemo would probably destroy my ovarian function. Between that and the drugs, I wouldn't be able to have kids for five years, and even then, the hormonal changes of pregnancy and the stimulation to my breasts (which could be, tragically, what gave me this cancer in the first place) would put me at risk again. Now Gabe and I didn't want to have more kids, but we hadn't made that decision permanantly yet. And now cancer made the decision for us. I don't want to have a kid at 40, so I guess we're going to stick with the two. They are definitely enough, but it makes me feel kind of old to realize my fertility is over.
I need to remind myself that if I hadn't found that lump, I wouldn't know I had breast cancer, and I'd be going out on girls nights, working out, trying to find a babysitter, talking to Gabe about when he should get a vasectomy, etc. Gabe said that while he knew I was upset that we'd lost all our babysitters for various reasons recently, I didn't need to get cancer to get some. But you know we're going to need to go out and do some fun things, and it's also hard for us to talk around Lenny, who seems to be about 80 years old in her knowledge of things.
We haven't told her anything, except that I have an owie on my breast and that's why I couldn't pick up her or Augie for a few days. Nothing since then. Of course, my mom doesn't usually stay with us, and Gabe and I don't usually leave the house early in the morning to go to a "meeting" together. She broke down when she was at gymnastics and I couldn't figure out why, until I realized that my mom was there, and I had been talking about my mom taking her for a while and she was worried. Then last night out of the blue she asked, "So why do you have an owie on your breast?" Well, I just do. But I can lift things now, it's healed. She said "So what's the deal with Augie's eating?" Yes, she did say "what's the deal." I've been trying to figure out how to wean him without becoming engorged or feeling too sad about it, but I haven't said anything to her. Gabe said she'll figure it out on Sunday when we're all on the breast cancer walk in Beverly (we signed up before we knew about me...irony...). I'd like to think she's not quite that perceptive, not yet.
Speaking of weaning, that process has begun. The only thing I've read online about breast cancer has to do with nursing, because I just want to avoid the pitfalls of reading online. So many women are militant about continuing nursing, but everyone in the medical community is telling me to wean as soon as possible. And the reality for me is somewhere in between. I absolutely want to be done nursing by the time I have surgery. How the hell would I deal with that? I might only have one breast, and I'll be laid up for a while. That just isn't going to happen. But I don't want to have too much pain or hormonal fluctuation by stopping too fast, and I'm already sad about one of my breasts being a harbinger of suffering, so I want to continue for a little while longer. Augie actually prefers the left side, so there's one person who doesn't care about the cancer. I've put the pump away, and I'm going to nurse maybe three times a day this weekend, then move to two by Sunday or Monday, then move to one. I wanted to give him at least one year, but shit happens I guess. It's more about me than him anyway. He'd rather just stuff puffs and wagon wheels in his mouth anyway.
This blog is also more about me--I will confess to doing it because it's just too hard to tell people one at a time or update people who are concerned with my progress. So that's my motivation, but in the end I feel better for doing it too. I'm starting to realize that for a while this will be the focus of everything for me, but that someday it won't be, and I'll be one of those people that other women call when they get that bad news and need to feel a little better. Until then, I'll be one of those annoying bloggers. Feel free to tell me when I'm full of it, okay?
I think we need this as much as you do, Katy. Love you, even if we haven't been in touch much in the past however many years.
Katy, I have no doubt that you will beat this cancer and be better for it! You have always been stubborn, as I remember, and I can't see that this cancer will be any different than any other obstacle you have overcome in your life thus far. You are an amazing person, friend and mother to those two mini-Katy kids! We're all behind you and will hold you up when you need us to. Now, I'm not going to start singing 'Wind Beneath My Wings' or anything, but I'm just sayin'...I love you, K-Tay!
katy - i know it's been ages since we've talked and seen each other, but we were longfellow school mates and all through high school and i have always thought, even when we were that young, that you were the most unique, intelligent, determined and willful person i knew! I promise to send you all the good vibes, stength, positive thoughts and that cheerleader attitude, so you won't have to! love you - Somie

Youth worker Alex Petrou has a rare quality – a drive to help those less fortunate, whatever it takes.
Built with a muscular frame and sporting a tanned ‘Aussie’ appearance and warm smile, 27-year-old Alex Petrou doesn’t have to work hard to light up a room. Involving himself with projects that raise money to make a difference within the community is a passion he throws a great deal of energy into. His long-term goal ̶ inspire the youth of today.
“In five years I would love to say that I am in a position to reach out and influence people on a global scale,” Mr Petrou said.
After completing a year-and-a-half at JCU, where he undertook a Bachelor of Arts (Political Science and Sociology), Petrou moved to Melbourne in February this year.
He now works for St John of God (Geelong), as a mentor for disadvantaged kids, and is doing a Bachelor of Arts (Philosophy) by correspondence.
When he’s not at St John of God or studying, Petrou is busy working at the YMCA at Lygon Square in Melbourne.
Petrou is also co-founder and operations manager of community organisation Seed of Thought, which he focused on after leaving a soccer scholarship at college due to an injury. The injury left him unable to continue his passion of playing soccer and, at the same time in 2009, Petrou was struggling with the break-up of a long-term relationship.
After suffering what he describes as a “momentary flash of depression” Petrou embarked on personal challenges, driven by the motivation to change the world for the better.
He completed the Kokoda Elite Trail in 64 hours in April 2011, which entailed 96 kilometres of hiking. As a result, Petrou was able to raise funds for three North Queensland girls who underwent surgery to treat brain tumours.
His latest achievement, The Street Dreams Project accomplished in September 2011, took 48 days and involved Petrou cycling for 5000 kilometres.
The journey, to bring attention to the issue of youth homelessness, began in Los Angeles and saw him travel across the USA to the finish line in New York City.
Few would choose to experience being homeless firsthand but Petrou opted to stay in homeless shelters throughout the challenge to further his comprehension of the issue.
“While sleeping on the streets I reached out to a number of people, and I also got to experience homelessness in a foreign country firsthand,” he said.
“This has put our organisation in a much better position to understand the issues that homeless youth face and therefore the future planning of projects can be based around what we know, not what we think we know.”
The company behind the challenge – Seed of Thought – is a volunteer-based community of passionate humanitarians who set up projects that target specific issues.
“Our goal (with the Street Dreams Project) was to raise awareness of and bring attention to the sad epidemic that is youth homelessness in both Australia and the USA,” he said.
Having never cycled until the Street Dreams Project, Petrou saw the challenge as an opportunity to test both his mind and body.
Never shy of a new task, strong-willed Petrou already has his next challenge planned ̶ Cycle for Kids. For this journey, in September this year, he’ll cycle 3600 kilometres from Perth to Melbourne in just 21 days. His aim is to raise funds for Camp Quality, which helps children who suffer from cancer as well as supporting their families.
With an energised outlook on life and its challenges, Petrou believes that if you want something badly enough, you will make it happen. It is this passion that has truly made a difference in the lives around him.

Jack Butler never played high school football. He attended a seminary to study for the Catholic priesthood. Later, he instead pursued another vocation but truly did not foresee what the future held for him. While attending St. Bonaventure University in Olean, NY, the Athletic Director approached Jack about trying out for the varsity football squad. The Director recalled playing sand lot football with Jack’s father back in Pittsburgh, PA. He told Jack that his dad was a fine player and maybe young Jack had inherited some of that talent from his dad. That Athletic Director was Father Silas of St. Bonaventure. Father Silas — also known as Dan Rooney — was the brother of Art Rooney, Sr. “The Chief” — owner of the NFL team The Pittsburgh Steelers.
Jack Butler developed into a fine defensive end and receiver. He was called by the Steelers for a try-out. At that time, the Steelers still played the single wing offense. Butler ended up as a defensive end. He proved himself to be a gifted athlete and a very tough one too. Near the end of that 1950 season, injuries to a teammate forced Butler to move into the defensive backfield. In the short time left to play that season, number “80” played so well that he then assumed that position and prevailed for the next eight years.
Jack Butler was All Pro, named to the Pro Bowl four times; intercepted 10 passes in one season, four of them in one game; filled in as a wide receiver and scored a couple of touchdowns. He was the second leading pass interceptor in the NFL at that time with a total of 52, all achieved in only 8 years of play. His brilliant career ended after a crippling knee injury in his ninth season. Later, Butler was named to the NFL 1950’s “Team of the Decade.” He was also named one of the top 300 players to have ever played in the NFL, the “All NFL First 50-Years” team, and the “All-Time Steeler Team.”
Following his playing days with the Steelers, Butler coached with the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers. His leg injury cut short an NFL coaching career. He became a Steeler talent scout for a few years before joining the newly created Blesto Scouting Group.
After a year or two, Jack became the Director of the organization and later its’ President. He has scouted or influenced the scouting of over 30,000 college football players to date.
Nearing his retirement, these three portraits of number “80” commemorate his brilliant career in the NFL as a player, coach, scout and executive. He has been married to his wife, Bernadette, for over 50 years. They have 8 children and numerous grand children. Jack Butler is honored as an exceptional athlete and truly as “A Man For All Seasons.” – Art Rooney, Jr
This collector card (which is actually poster size) hung in the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and the NFL Hall Of Fame in November 2007, to commemorate the Pittsburgh Steelers 75th anniversary.
Jack Butler’s family and friends are hoping to raise awareness among the NFL Hall of Fame voters concerning Jack’s exceptional 56 year career in professional football. We all feel that he has been overlooked for admission to the Hall of Fame, and are beginning to actively campaign for something we believe he has earned and rightly deserves.

Nancy Krusoe’s superb story Hens, Cows, and Canoes is interwoven throughout Lisa Bloomfield’s digitally altered wallpaper series. The result is a visually rich and compelling work about Hen’s search for identity. Underwater Hen is not silent, she is not a quiet good girl; inside the lake she shrieks and bellows, building her body into a flame.
"Doubting Thomas” as a term that is used to describe someone who will refuse to believe something without direct, physical, personal evidence; a skeptic. I based the look of this book on the “driving bible for Los Angeles,” the once ubiquitous Thomas Bros. Map Guide which in it’s 200+ pages mapped every street and freeway in the city. The maps in this piece are digitally altered pages from the Thomas guide. The text is sampled from writer and friend Nancy Krusoe’s novel, Cellophane about a female character, a jellyfish, who is trying to locate herself physically (her body has no set boundaries) and mentally. I selected about 25 sentences from this novel fabricating a loose narrative of a female character pondering her identity and location in Los Angeles.

So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off.

When it comes to the health of a dog’s bones and joints, orthopedic foam is the only choice worth considering. The value of a “true” orthopedic foam dog bed lies in how effectively the foam supports your dog’s body. It is easy for any company to claim they make an orthopedic foam mattress, but cheap foam can be less supportive than cheap fiber or batting fill. Our proprietary density and weight foam sets us apart from other orthopedic foam mattresses. By using our K9 Smart Foam that we’ve tested and calibrated for dogs, we are able to eliminate the layering process, removing glue from our process. This introduces greater airflow, amazing comfort, and superior support with the perfect amount of bounce. This foam blend distributes your dog's weight evenly, moving pressure away from common pain points such as the spine or joints. Fewer pressure points lead to better blood circulation, and good circulation benefits the whole body.

Ugh, our internet connection is so slow at times that I have problems uploading photos and especially videos. So the fact that I'm the only recording Liz Fitz Darcy performances means fans have to wait a while to see recordings if they missed the show. Nevertheless, I've started the process. I don't think I'll link anymore videos here, unless the band starts using someone else's recordings as their "official" videos. In which case I might link my "home" videos to this blog. But for now, you can see new videos on YouTube when they go up (subscribe to MrsThorsen to be notified when something new is posted). Also, I'm linking to the Liz Fitz Darcy page on facebook. "Like" the band page to get everything (including video links) in your facebook feed.
"I am, in brief, a libertarian of the most extreme variety, and know of no human right that is one-tenth as valuable as the simple right to utter what seems (at the moment) to be the truth." -- HL Mencken
For the last decade or so, the only print publication that my household has consistently maintained a subscription to has been Wired. It's hands-down my favorite monthly magazine, something I look forward to finding in the US Snail box by the door.
There will be no more Wired renewals from this household so long as Wired continues to shill for the state versus Bradley Manning.
A complete reversal, a public apology and a substantial financial contribution to the Bradley Manning Support Network might get that subscription back in play.
The sooner the better, because my weekend to-do list includes going through the latest issue (which seerendipitously has a great article on the "collar bomb" robbery that I recently discussed with my son) and notifying every advertiser I can find an email address for that I plan to negatively preference, within reason/convenience, companies that do business with Wired.
I also consider it a basic obligation of disclosure to point out that by being my friend or associate, one may well be at risk of prosecution under US Code, Title 18, Chapter 115, §2384.
That risk exists because I would likely be convicted of -- if ever charged with -- violations of the same title, same chapter, §2383 and/or §2385 and/or §2387.
For one thing, I don't recognize the US Code or said portions thereof as binding upon anyone who hasn't explicitly agreed to be bound by it.
For another, the things are so broadly written that anyone who votes, runs for public office, solicits votes (especially the votes of military personnel) or joins a political party is arguably in violation of all of them (if you don't think an election is a "means of force or violence," you're not living in the real world). So it's not like I'm uniquely in legal jeopardy here.
And finally, anyone who's observed the operation of what passes for a "court" in the United States in recent years knows that these institutions are, for the most part, mere extensions of the prosecution teams with only pro forma claims to just or even nominally impartial proceedings (although rare cases of jury nullification do sometimes act as a corrective). I hold such institutions in far too much contempt to "plead" if charged, let alone preemptively/prospectively admit the "guilt" which they assume from the start.
All things considered, maybe being my friend or associate isn't really any more dangerous than being anyone else's. In the declining 21st century United States, legal entanglements seem to be pretty much the equivalent of a straight-up roulette bet, at least if one lacks the "get out of jail free card" issued to members of the political class. But I still thought it worth apprising you of the risks.
Missouri loses a US House district due to the new census figures. Tony Messenger and Bill Lambrecht of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch tentatively predict -- and I non-tentatively agree -- that the existing 3rd District will be the one to effectively disappear.
That's Dick Gephardt's old district, and spin aside, it hasn't been a "safe" Democratic district in a long time. Gephardt held onto the seat the old-fashioned way: Knocking on doors and mobilizing organized labor support. Since he retired, Russ Carnahan rests uneasily on the throne, nearly losing to Republican Ed Martin -- a second-string player at best -- last month.
The lopsidedly Democratic city areas of the third will be used to bulk up the even more lopsidedly Democratic 1st District. The more Republican-leaning suburban/rural parts will be used to try to keep the existing 2nd (Todd Akin) and 9th (Blaine Leutkemeyer) districts Republican, and to pad out the "safe" GOP 8th (Jo Ann Emerson).
I, Mike Gogulski Tom Knapp, hereby pledge that if Julian Assange should call upon me in need of a place to stay, I will provide it to him with no questions asked, indefinitely, and with the highest degree of security and confidentiality I can provide. I’m easy to get a hold of.
Now it’s your turn. Simply replace your name with mine and publish. Link here if you wish, but publish.
The late 20th century stereotype image of the defecation intersecting with the rotating blades -- popular revolt, coup d'etat, or state suppression of either -- is the interruption of regular television and radio programming, usually with "patriotic music" substituted for that programming.
I generally eschew alarmism, but what we've seen over the last week or so may be the opening shots in the 21st century's Internet version of the same phenomenon.
In less than ten years, the US has gone from something resembling due process of law, to the USA PATRIOT Act and "National Security Letters," to "Joe Lieberman's office called -- give them whatever we think they want."
COICA is stalled in the US Senate, but "Homeland Security" seized dozens of domain names on spurious "intellectual property" grounds anyway.
Whether Amazon and Paypal acted under government pressure (as seems obvious) or on their own hook (as they claim) to suppress Wikileaks is an interesting question, but it's a distinction that doesn't make a lot of difference -- freely or under compulsion, they've sided with the state and against the truth and the people in a big and high-profile way.
In the US, the right would love nothing more than to suppress the left (including the libertarian left) under the guise of "national security." President Barack Obama is objectively allied with the right on this, if for no other reason than that he'd like to get the real left off his ass, or at least shut them up, on foreign policy and civil liberties issues.
If Amazon and Paypal have already swung into action to serve the state in its new war -- the war on YOU -- what makes you think your web host, payment processor, et. al won't?
Unless you were smart and located that kind of stuff offshore (and possibly even if you did), you're vulnerable. If you think you're not in violation of any Terms of Service, you obviously haven't read them -- ToS is in the eye of the provider, bubba.
Don't be surprised if you see pro-freedom web sites disappearing from the web over the next few weeks as their hosts suddenly "discover" ToS violations that only became violations with the change in political climate.
And if not sites, perhaps authors. How hard do you think it Homeland Security would find it to sweet-talk the major ISPs into closing the accounts of customers who have (for example) accessed Wikileaks?
This one's going to be harder to effectively respond to in terms of disentanglement, at least for me. Ideas, anyone?
My first order of business, having left Amazon, is to find a new preferred bookseller -- both as a reader and as an affiliate seller.
Setting up a customer account isn't very intuitive. It takes you to a login screen, with a username/password button. It has checkboxes for "I have an account" and "I'm a new customer," but if you pick "I'm a new customer" and click the "login" button, you get an error.
The trick is this: Check the "new customer" box, put your email address in the username field, and hit "enter." That will take you to account setup.
One of the things I'm looking at in auditioning booksellers is the eBook area, and Powell's has around 300,000 e-titles of which more than 17,000 are DRM-free PDF.
What's really cool is that they have a book I've been looking for in e-format (the first volume of Darcy Richardson's Others), which wasn't available from Amazon for Kindle), and in that DRM-free PDF format to boot!
What's uncool is that I bought it about half an hour ago and it's still marked "transaction pending" in my account on the Powell's site. Instant gratification is a big part of eBook purchasing, at least for me.
As a new "partner," I'm pleased to see that my purchase was instantly recorded for commission purposes. As a new customer ... well, I want my damn book. 51 minutes now. Download still not available. I'll update on that as it resolves. [Update: I was away from the computer for awhile, came back, and the book was available. The download went smoothly and the DRM-free PDF is quite nice. I'll probably order something else soon, to see if the delay was a one-time thing or "the usual."]
On the print side, I've purchased from Powell's a time or two in the past. The service has been quick, friendly, reliable and the books have arrived as advertised (they do new and used). So check them out, anyway.
After their domain name has been siezed you may be wondering “how can I access WikiLeaks?” Early this morning WikiLeaks posted their direct IP on Twitter encouraging us to get the word out there. Their url has been taken, but we can still access information directly. We must spread this information, provide links, mirrors and keep the information in the public eye.
Please help get this information out there to the general public. The state is doing all they can to deny access.
We need more real mirrors. If you have information on these please send it to me. If you have further sources to access the information also please forward it to me so I can post it all here. You can reach me here.
Amazon.com's spokesperson says (as reported by the Wall Street Journal) that the company's reasons for booting Wikileaks from its servers were half ideological, half just plain false, and not due to pressure from the US government:
It was "inaccurate" to claim that pressure from the U.S. government or large-scale attacks by hackers caused the company to discontinue its service of WikiLeaks, said Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener in a statement ...
WikiLeaks "doesn't own or otherwise control all the rights to this classified content," one of the stipulations of Amazon's contractual terms, he said.
There are no "intellectual property" implications here. US government documents aren't protected by copyright. Whether "nobody" owns them or "everybody" owns them is an interesting question, but what's absolutely certain is that Wikileaks is not violating any "intellectual property" rights by making them available. Herdener is, at the very least, prevaricating wildly there.
Mr. Herdener said that Amazon's terms of service also require that content "will not cause injury to any person or entity." Yet he said "it is not credible that the extraordinary volume of 250,000 classified documents that WikiLeaks is publishing could have been carefully redacted in such a way as to ensure that they weren't putting innocent people in jeopardy.
So the spokesperson for the largest bookstore on earth publicly claims that words are dangerous and can hurt people and that Amazon wants nothing to do with words like that. Chalk up a new high for cognitive dissononance.
And for hypocrisy -- as of a few minutes ago, Amazon is still selling The Communist Manifesto, Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, Mein Kampf, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and In Praise of Public Life: The Honor And Purpose Of Political Service.
If words really are dangerous and really can hurt people, well, each of the aforementioned books can be plausibly linked to more deaths than the entire Wikileaks ouvre has been so far.
So much for Amazon being the "victim," as some opponents of a boycott -- at least one of whom for some reason felt the need to email me with an invitation to go fuck myself for even temporarily dissociating myself from Amazon while I awaited their explanation -- have claimed.
So far as I'm concerned, my negative social and economic preferencing of Amazon has now transitioned from temporary to permanent: I just don't care to do business with the company any more. Your mileage may vary, and that's fine. You can even bust my balls about it if it makes you feel better.
If anyone wants to do something techy to support dissociation by Amazon affiliates, some Blogger and WordPress scripts for removing/replacing Amazon links in an automated manner would be really cool. That's a task I'm not looking forward to doing manually.
Amazon.com has apparently booted Wikileaks off of its hosting services. Antiwar.com is calling for a boycott of Amazon.
As I've mentioned before, I'm a long-time Amazon customer (pretty much since they started) and an affiliate. I'm not a big customer, but I've been pretty loyal. I'm not a big affiliate, but since I've made a little money from them, they've presumably made a little money on me.
- Notified Amazon that until I see an explanation from them, I'm taking my shopping elsewhere (hint: It's Christmas shopping season, which probably accounts for the bulk of my Amazon purchases each year); and that unless that explanation is damn good and pretty quick in arriving, I'll permanently dissociate myself from them as both a customer and an affiliate.
- Donated €3,50 (a little under US$5) to Wikileaks in lieu of a $3.99 Kindle purchase I'd been planning to make (I recently downloaded the Kindle app to the kids' Windoze machine, have downloaded some free books and purchased a couple, and was about to give it a favorable review).
On the off chance that Amazon will come back with a believable "wait a minute guys, it's not like that at all," I'm not going to start the arduous task of combing through a hundred thousand posts or so (close to 1,700 here at KN@PPSTER, 90,000+ at Rational Review, etc.) and removing Amazon links just yet. But please, don't click on Amazon links here, and don't buy from Amazon, at least for now.
Speaking of all this, my latest piece at C4SS is about the Wikileaks "diplomatic cables" saga. Check it out.

Thank you so much for a wonderful evening. People have not stopped talking about the band. I have three friends that are getting married and have already asked for your number. You guys were great. Very professional and went with the flow when people decided to just get up and give speeches. The music was amazing. I'm trying to think of when I can have you guys again but not at my own wedding so I can enjoy it more instead of running around. HAHA. Thanks again can't wait to use you guys again.
We loved Liquid Blue. They played the wedding perfectly! They started with slower tempos songs as people got settled in and grabbed cocktails and as the night progressed they picked up the tempo and the dance floor was rocking! Over the next few days the #1 comment I got is, “wow the band was awesome”. I also appreciate the professionalism of the contact person for the band by connecting with us a couple of weeks prior to the event to discuss all details pertaining to the party. I really appreciate that in midst of being so busy! You guys rocked!.
I can't begin to tell you how many people have told us how great you guys were! You really made our wedding. We could not have been happier! Thank you so much again!
We just went to another wedding this weekend and everyone was telling us again how amazing you guys were. Unfortunately the band was not that great and everyone wished Liquid Blue was playing instead. Thank you so much again! - Jenny
From beginning to end, Liquid Blue was nothing short of phenomenal. It's rare to find such a group of talented individuals that also manage the business matter with such profession and class. I planned my wedding around the band and had very high expectations. Liquid Blue met and exceeded all of those expectations. My 100+ family and friends who traveled to Cabo San Lucas all said the trip was worth it primarily due to the awesome entertainment, Liquid Blue. If I ever have the occasion again to hire this band without a doubt and hands down I will seek our Liquid Blue. I am in love!!!
After researching every wedding band in So-Cal, there was only one band that stood out from the rest. Believe it or not, Liquid Blue’s amazing promo video does not do the band justice after seeing them perform live after a San Diego Padres game. And when we first messaged the band regarding a possible wedding performance, it was one minute later that my cell phone rang from Scott Stephens! What an extremely personable point-of-contact for the band Scott is, who also doubles as the singer! Never in our wildest dreams did we think we would be able to have such a band at our wedding. They performed the whole spectrum of songs to meet our guests’ ages…from Dion of the 50s, to the Supremes, Cheap Trick, Madonna, Outkast and Lady Gaga! Liquid Blue is not just a cover band; the band just recently held the #3 spot on the Billboard Charts for one of their own songs, of which there are many! My most memorable moment from the night was slow dancing with my husband to Peter Gabriel’s ‘In Your Eyes.’ Scott Stephens has the ability to replicate any artists’ voice, such as Peter Gabriel and Louis Armstrong (‘What a Wonderful World’). The guitarist even came off the stage into the grove of dancing guests to shred! At another point in the night I looked up to find my photographer up on stage smack in the middle of the band, rocking out and capturing the fun festivities close-up. And lets not forget the ladies…these three beauties sang and danced the night away, smiling the whole while, which made our night seem all the more welcoming and special. My guests were trying to mimic their choreographed dance moves all night long. And any girl that can outperform the real AC/DC with ‘Shook Me All Night Long’ deserves a round of applause! The funniest moment of the reception came when the band performed Van Halen and my bridal party did David Lee Roth-style scissor kicks! Such is the captivating dynamism of Liquid Blue with its audience. I am eternally grateful for Liquid Blue. They performed slow songs during dinner, and upped the energy level directly following, transforming the venue to just what we wanted, a memorable, festive evening amongst friends and family. The night would not have been the same without them. Incredibly easy going, GOOD people, who came equipped with their own MC for the wedding and even sound equipment! I highly suggest allowing them to dress in their normal band attire and be themselves…they will put on a grand performance and you will have nothing to worry about. Liquid Blue is kind, giving, and talented, and they come with our highest recommendation and accolades.
We were blown away by Liquid Blue! Their energy level, creativity, talent, and performance had everyone up on the dance floor ages 6-85 at our wedding! The Blue Girls choreographed dances were a show in itself. They sing, dance and even have wardrobe changes. The band worked with us to honor our music requests and even performed an impromptu song per the brides request. They play everything under the sun and sound exactly like the original artist. They are incredible and really knows how to get a party started!!! What we liked most about Liquid Blue is they play every genre. Even my 89 year old cousin was on the dance floor as well as my 6 year old flower girl. We pre-selected music from their list so we had played exactly what we wanted to hear. Their energy level gets everyone up and it contagious. I was had so much fun dancing, that I skipped out on the photographers request to take pictures at sunset with my husband. I literally did not want to miss a minute. We loved working with Liquid Blue and look forward to referring them to all our friends and family. You can't go wrong with this band. They are brilliant!.
When we saw Liquid Blue at Jimmy Loves in San Diego we knew we wanted them to play at our wedding. They did a phenomenal job and had everyone talking about them including our vendors. Thank you for making our wedding so much fun and memorable. Please give my best to everyone especially Scott!
Liquid Blue made our wedding festivities truly memorable. There were so many songs to choose from that we couldn't decide. So we chose to let Liquid Blue play to the crowd with a few requests from time to time. Our entire guest list was on the dance floor by the end and nobody was ready to stop when we had to. The diversity of genres this band can play is very impressive. From hip hop to country and everything in between they were spot on. I would highly recommend Liquid Blue for any type of event. They are solid professionals with a lot of talent. Thank you for everything. We had way too much fun! Sincerely, Andrew and Kristen
Liquid Blue was absolutely fabulous. Even before we entered the ballroom, people were approaching us telling us how great the band was. They kept the dance floor packed the entire night. From the beginning they were easy to work with and the incorporated everything we wanted. I highly recommend them and would be happy to be a reference.
Liquid Blue has definitely set the standard for live performances! The whole band was at the reception on time and ready to go. Very professional throughout. Would MOST DEFINITELY recommend to anyone looking for Top-Notch entertainment for there next event or special occasion!
Each individual's situation is assessed on a completely personalized basis, and your specific needs, interests, and desired applications of the work will be addressed. In this exploration, the individualized instruction of an Alexander Technique lesson allows you to consider your body's habits in many normal and day to day functioning positions. We first stop and allow ourselves to notice our habits, then work to discover ways to do what we'd like to do, with a bit more ease and efficiency. The subtle hands-on guidance that Lisa provides will help you achieve this ease of movement. As your body unlearns habits and develops tools for better functioning, you will continue to discover how to do more and perform better, often with less work and almost always with better results.
You will experience change from your first lesson. But as with any process that has a lasting effect, true change is achieved over time and is a direct result of your investment in the work. Unlike some other body work methods, the Alexander Technique does require participation from students, in the form of thinking and awareness. It is important to remember that rather than coming to 'be fixed,' the aim is to explore and re-discover.
Although there is not a set number of lessons a pupil should take, an introductory set of 4 lessons is suggested, and at least a 10-lesson course is recommended for best results. Although there is nothing specifically required for you to bring to a lesson, you should wear clothing that is not overly restrictive and allows you to move freely.
Lisa currently works with a variety of musicians, dancers, athletes, doctors, business professionals, students, and individuals dealing with chronic pain and rehabilitation from injury. Anyone interested in improving their performance, addressing issues related to pain, or just looking to increase the knowledge of the way their body moves, breathes, and functions should take lessons in the Alexander Technique. Learn more about the benefits.
A lesson typically lasts between 35 and 45 minutes, and weekly or bi-monthly lesson times are offered. Learn more about Lisa.
A common denominator for us all? – Emotions. I’ve learned over time to respect all my feelings. We have them for a reason and it’s okay to not have a perpetual smile on your face. It’s all about degrees. Without sadness, we wouldn’t appreciate the joy in our lives. I saw the Pixar movie “Inside Out” and loved it! It’s not just for kids, adults as well can learn a lot about how emotions affect us.
My heart went out to Sadness. For her, situations always seemed to go wrong. I’ve always felt that we’re conditioned to believe the only acceptable feeling is joy and the others, anger, fear, and disgust are to be avoided. Even in the movie, Sadness tends to get a bad rap, but we need her. Plus, she’s so darn adorable!
I always try to remember that it’s okay to be sad sometimes. Just don’t forget to get back up again and celebrate joy!

Pastor Dix has created an in-depth itinerary that is coupled with beautiful hotels and amazing meals in Turkey and Greece. This is a small custom group with limited space. Pastor Dix and Cynthia Winston have selected a Seven Churches of Revelation Tour and Footsteps of Paul trip tailored for those who seek knowledge through The Word, archaeology, history, fellowship and people.
This tour spends 5 nights at a luxury hotel on the Mediterranean Sea. You travel out each day, in comfort, to see the sights of the Seven Churches of Revelation and the places where the Early Church took root. Imagine understanding and seeing where Paul spoke to the sorceress, to see where John was imprisoned, to stand on the beach where Paul handed over his parchments to Phoebe, to stand in the doorway of the Synagogue at Corinth where Paul spoke, and to stand on the Bema at Corinth that still exists today. Book early to ensure you are able to join us. The air carrier we use is Turkish Air, one of the top 5 carriers in the world. They are a United Airlines partner. We fly Denver to Istanbul and then have a short hop flight. The tour starts at $5,599 (all inclusive) per person, sharing one room. We match singles, or you can obtain a single room for yourself at a small surcharge. The tour price includes airfare and all meals and tours as noted.
Arrive at the cosmopolitan Mediterranean city of Izmir at 5:20PM (Smyrna in ancient times). We drive along the beautiful motorway with its sleek oceanfront condos. We will arrive at our hotel, for most of the week, the luxurious Korumar. Tonight we enjoy a welcome dinner together.
Free morning today to sleep in and recuperate from our long flights. This afternoon, we have a special lunch prepared for our group, by our friends at the finest restaurant with amazing ambiance! Afterwards, we visit some smaller archaeological sites and the Temple of Artemis. Dinner this evening is at a waterfront fish restaurant. Very lively!
Today we tour the site of Pergamon and the Asklepieion. The site at Pergamon is accessed via a funicular tram with stunning views of the Mediterranean basin. The village of Bergama is very quaint and we have a special lunch planned. Return to beautiful Korumar for dinner.
We will drive through the mountains today to see the next most important of the Churches of Revelation – the site of Laodicea. We will stop for lunch at a beautiful tennis and country club. Later in the day visit the site of Colossae. We will spend the night at the Doga Thermal Hotel. Once at the hotel, we can wrap up in thick robes and head down to the hotel’s private Turkish Bath’s and thermal pools that originate at the cascading Colossae archaeological site. Dinner is included.
This morning, we walk through the site of Hierapolis. Drive back through the mountains with a stop at a local artisan’s village for lunch. The site of sites is visited today. Ephesus is considered the top archaeological site in the Mediterranean. You will be able to walk the streets that the Apostles John, Paul and Timothy walked, and you will be in the city where Jesus’ mother, Mary lived out her final days. We also will visit the bazaar and shops at the famous port. Dinner at the hotel this evening.
Tour today of Didyma and Miletus. Lunch is on your own today. Dinner tonight is at hotel known for the best fish and Mediterranean food! What a great night to say goodbye to our new friends on the Turkish Riviera.
Leave the hotel and board our boat for the island of Patmos. The island will be a bit like stepping back in time as this precious island has no airport and few cars. The same families have lived on this island for centuries and real estate is out of sight! Once we arrive grab a gelato and walk the waterfront. We will enjoy a stay at our small botique luxury hotel. Plan on fellowship, great views and fabulous Greek cuisine!
Enjoy breakfast at hotel this morning. Then, we take the winding road up the island to the site where John was imprisoned in a tiny cave. Take the tour up to the site or a private teaching where John lived and received the Book of Revelation. We have time to visit the small monastery as well, with its Biblical manuscripts and other artifacts. Spend another night at our boutique hotel, with dinner and overnight.
After breakfast, we board our boat for the island of Kos. The trip is 3 hours, with time for lunch on the waterfront. After a bit of shopping we fly from Kos late this afternoon to the island of Santorini – the most beautiful place in the world! Check into our small 5 star hotel with dinner and a spectacular view. BD
Free day on Santorini. Lunch and dinner on your own to explore this precious place. The hotel is located at Fira and amongst the quaintest shopping, 4WD rentals, bike rentals and so much more!
Our last coffee with the most famous view in the world. Our flight departs at 10:30AM. On arrival at Athens, we take a tour of the site of Corinth where spend time at the upper and lower archaeological sites. Greek lunch is included. On our way to Athens, we will pass the sight of Cencherea, where the Apostle Paul made his Nazarite vow on that very beach. We will then arrive at our luxury hotel (2 nights) for a free night near the Plaka for shopping and a dinner on your own in an outdoor café.
Today we tour Athens. We will have time for a teaching at Mars Hill and the Parthenon. You will have free time this afternoon to explore the Plaka and its designer and locally made shops. Farewell dinner this evening with a spectacular view of the Parthenon.
Dr. Dix Winston has been in full-time ministry since 1975. He served three years with Campus Crusade for Christ. Wanting to better equip himself for a teaching ministry, he attended and graduated (1978-1982) from Dallas Theological Seminary where he earned his Masters of Theology. It was also at DTS that he met his wife, the former Cynthia Blum whom he married upon graduation. In 2005 Dix completed his Doctorate of Ministry in Apologetics from Southern Evangelical Seminary where he graduated Summa Cum Laude. He, along with a core group of individuals founded Crosspoint Community Church in January of 2012 where he serves as Senior Pastor. Dix and Cynthia have one son, Austin who is a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army. When not attending to ministry matters, Dix more than enjoys golf and riding motorcycles with Cynthia.
All I can say is AMAZING…FANTASTIC…UNBELIEVABLE and STUNNING! Every family member said it was our best trip yet, and we have had lots and lots of fantastic trips in the past 20 years!
Living Passages also facilitates all Koinonia House’s unique tours. The staff is always friendly and handles the myriad of complex travel details associated with large groups in the most professional manner. I cannot overstate how pleased I am with the service and professionalism of this outstanding organization.
I loved it! It truly was the adventure of a lifetime. My son had a wonderful experience, too. Thank you for making the trip kid-friendly!
Everything was wonderful, and first class. Hotels and ship were top of the line. Our Greek Orthodox guide, Sayat was fantastic. So much knowledge and history and enthusiasm! Pastor Lutzer’s teachings were much enjoyed and enlightening. Rebecca is a sweetheart.
I enjoyed this tour so much, that I’d like to do it again sometime, maybe in the Spring season. PS…our group enjoyed each others’ company so much that we are having a reunion party coming up on Monday the 21st!
To see Biblical sites in which Paul ministered as well as see sites of some of the churches of Revelation was an opportunity of a lifetime. The Bible teaching was absolutely outstanding. Of course, being on a sailing ship was delightful as well. I highly recommend a Footsteps of Paul.
Through the use of The Word, we trust that once you have returned from our Christian tours, you will have gained a deeper knowledge of the scriptures and the multiple layers of teaching and truths that are inside each.
Isaiah 55:11 So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.
You can be assured an experience like our previous participants, who have gained an appreciation of how God uses everything for His glory and for the purpose of furthering knowledge and understanding. You will see this as you encounter the geology of the land, the geography where events actually occurred and the archaeology that may (or may not!) still exist. Furthermore, through the remaining people in the land, the practices still in place and demography that have endured.
Colossians 1:20 and by Him to reconcile all things to Himself, by Him, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through the blood of His cross.
Further, our assurance is received that through The Word; the teachings you will be exposed will solidify the truth which you and your family have been taught by seeing, touching and hearing the scriptures each day. We assert and firmly believe Romans 10:17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.
I see this issue popping up ever so often with startups I either work with/for or advise (nowadays) and it’s a valid one and I’ve encountered it often enough that I feel it deserves at least a blog post from me. (Realistically, I can see this growing into a series as there are a lot […]

Dishwasher option selection. Dishwasher options can enhance the cleaning cycles you have selected. You can have sanitary rinse option to eliminate bacteria in the wash. Delay wash allow you to run your dishwasher whenever you wish: no matter if it is middle of the night or off-peak utility hours you can try this option any time.
Size up your options. While most conventional dishwashers are the under-counter type which are 60cm wide there are more compact options out there for those that want to save kitchen space. First off there are 45cm machines which have a capacity of around a third of a full-size dishwasher. That still amounts to around 20 pieces each of crockery and cutlery though so it's often an economical option for small families. Table-top dishwashers are also available for kitchens where space is at a real premium.
Compare the cost of replacing a damaged water inlet or drain valve with the cost of buying and installing a new dishwasher. There's a big difference. It's true that getting a repair done can be pricey and can throw your monthly budget into cardiac arrest. However dealing with a solvable problem when it comes up is much better than ignoring it and having to buy a whole new machine down the line. You might have to spend some money that you didn't plan on spending in the moment but you'll save far more money in the long run.

The drawer dishwasher also fits into a sink and it too is suitable for handling small loads in double time and it can double up as extra counter space. A single drawer dishwasher costs about seven hundred dollars while a double drawer dishwasher costs about twelve hundred dollars. Finally you might want to check out the portable dishwasher that is an ideal kitchen utility for renters and also for a homeowner that has limited space. Priced at between four hundred and six hundred dollars it is a useful appliance indeed.
One of the most frequently asked questions in remodeling is how is it possible? To some it might be a little bit more difficult but to others it may be easier even if you plan on buying new kitchen cabinets. When time comes to install a dishwasher properly most homeowners either take out a piece of the cabinet or a chunk of the countertop. This will eliminate any problems you had for the space of the dishwasher. Even if you have already planned your remodeling project you can still have your dishwasher that you might still want.
It may seem counterintuitive to say that hiring a major appliance repair professional for dishwasher assistance is a budget-conscious move but a repair pro can actually save you hundreds of dollars. Find out why you should call in an expert the next time you need a dishwasher repair in your kitchen.
As winter and the holidays are approaching, it is essential to consider the safety features in your home. Autumn is the best time to begin thinking about the safety inside and outside your home to prevent any problems.
It is a good idea to check your home's locks to verify that the devices are in good condition. Walk through your home to check the locks on all of the doors or windows, and keep track of any problems so that you replace the items on your own or by calling a professional locksmith. While old-fashioned locks might work, you may want to upgrade to better devices for additional protection.
When thieves are looking for a home to enter, they search for buildings that have hiding locations such as behind the dense foliage of trees and shrubs. Trimming these plants before winter begins can protect your property from a break-in during the holiday season when burglars are looking for valuable items underneath a Christmas tree.
Professional chimney sweeps recommend having fireplaces and chimneys inspected, cleaned and repaired once a year. If you want to use your home's fireplace this winter, then call a chimney sweep first. These experts inspect a chimney by dropping a camera into the item to look at its interior on a computer screen. When there is a problem with the chimney's materials, the technician can repair the item. In addition, the chimney sweep will remove wood particles and creosote from the fireplace and the chimney shaft to prevent internal fires.
The addition of lighting fixtures on the exterior of a home can prevent thefts or vandalism, but it can also prevent accidents. It is darker in the morning, and it gets dark sooner in the evening, making it difficult to navigate during snowstorms. You can add solar or electric lights to the lawns or the sides of a building to increase the visibility on your home's lawns.
Today, you can find do-it-yourself security systems that work with computers or smartphones. Alternatively, you might want a professionally installed security system that has alarm devices and surveillance cameras. There are inexpensive and simple security devices, or you can invest in a higher quality system that includes extra features to protect you and your home.
If you enjoy using candles in the winter, then you should use the items properly to avoid a dangerous fire that can lead to an injury or property damage. First, make sure that a candle is in a safe candleholder rather than using a glass jar or old dinner plate for the item. In addition, place the lit candles and candleholders in a location away from family pets, children or anything that can blow over the flame. Last, you should never leave a lit candle unattended.
You should have carbon monoxide and smoke detectors inside your home in various locations. It is vital to test these devices once a month to verify that the batteries are functional and that the alarm systems are working. Carbon monoxide is a lethal gas that often builds up inside a home during the winter from a faulty furnace. A good smoke detector will make a loud buzzing noise to alert you about a dangerous fire inside your home.
Please ask me your question by filling out this form. You will receive an answer to your question at the first opportunity I have to reply. I appreciate the time you have taken.
Are you having trouble selling your home? The delay could be due to a number of reasons. The market may be sluggish. The time of year may be all wrong. Or it could be due to the fact that some aspect of your property isn't at its most enticing. You don't need to panic over this revelation. You just need to take the appropriate steps to get things back under your total control.
Have you had a look at your front lawn lately? If it's buried under snow in the middle of winter, it won't be so noticeable. But if the season is summer and your lawn is patchy and brown, it needs work in a hurry. It's important for you to keep in mind at all times the fact that the first thing a potential buyer will see when they step out of their car is your front lawn.
Your lawn should never be brown or patchy. There is simply no excuse for it, especially if you are attempting to sell your home. The first thing you need to do is get the right kind of lawn fertilizer. This is the best way to fill in those patchy spots and get your lawn looking green and healthy. The sooner you perform this very important task, the sooner you can get your home sale back on track.
It isn't about winning some competition to be the best lawn maintenance expert in the neighborhood. It's about making your front lawn attractive enough to give a potential buyer an excellent first impression. When a potential buyer steps out of their vehicle, you want to be sure that they notice your lawn with approval. This is a good prelude to the rest of their experience.
If you want to sell your home in a hurry, it's up to you to make sure that the rest of your front yard is also in tip top condition. Are there kid's bikes, car parts, and various odds and ends sitting out in the driveway? Donate them to Goodwill, have a recycling service pick them up, or simply drive them to the dump yourself. In other words, get rid of them in a hurry if you want to sell your home this year.
What does your front pavement look like? Are the stones in your front yard path leading up to your door in good condition? If they are missing a few stones here and there, why not invest in some timely replacements? Likewise, if your driveway is patchy or crumbly, it might be a good idea to have it professionally resurfaced. This is an investment of time and money that will pay dividends in a short amount of time.
The most important thing for you to keep in mind at all times is that the sale of your home will depend on an excellent first impression. This means that you need to do everything in your power to make sure that you impress a potential buyer right away.
Keeping your front yard in tip top condition is essential to getting the best possible price for your home. If you have any questions concerning how to do this, it's a good idea to speak to an expert. You can arrange a meeting with a local real estate expert for more information.
Fortunately, there is never a dull day in the real estate market. The Canadian real estate market has been no exception. Earlier this year, the Canadian real estate market started off with a whimper. For the better half of this year, the Canadian market has reached a stalemate status.
According to the latest statics, the real estate market in Canada appears to be balanced. Toronto and Calgary have reached a balanced territory while Montreal and Vancouver are heading toward a seller's market.
In the latter part of 2017, Canada's housing inventory stood at 4.8 units compared to 4.9 units of housing inventory in the earlier part of 2017. Overall, Canada's long-term average for housing inventory is 4.2 months. Given the current statics, Canada's real estate market's supply equals demand.
Even though Canada's real estate market has flattened, housing prices are still holding their valve. The national average home price was down to 6.4 percent recently. This average is due to having more condos than detached housing in Canada current housing mix.
Considering the at the current benchmark price for available housing, home valves in Canada rose one percent. CFEA predicts the national average price going up to 3.8 percent in 2019. The market increases are likely to be seen in Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island markets. The Prairies, Newfoundland, and Labrador areas will probably continue to see more stability in their housing price markets.
Earlier this year, housing sales in Canada dropped 35 percent in Vancouver compared to the same time last year. Compared with the average priced home in Victoria, B.C., the benchmark price is still six times more than the average's family's income before taxes. House prices in these areas continue to rise. Using the Toronto area as an example, home sales are down 20 percent compared to a year ago. However, Toronto's home prices average eight times the typical Candian's household income.
In the current tepid markets of Prairies and Atlantic Canada changes in housing prices remain within the range of 2017 statics.
Economical housing markets are found in Saint John, N.B., Saint John, Nfld., and Regina Sask areas. Lower house pricing is available in the Charlottetown, Saskatoon, Halifax, and Edmonton areas. These housing prices are before the new mortgage regulations kicked in 2019.
The new loan rules will affect around 100,000 homebuyers. These homebuyers will still qualify for a mortgage. However, they will not qualify the same loan amount in 2019.
Under the new regulations, an applicant's mortgage application will use a minimum qualifying rate. This qualifying rate is currently at 4.99 percent. In the majority of cases, a home buyer will be forced into a less expensive home than they could buy in the current year. If a potential homeowner waits until 2019 to buy a home, a larger down payment will be required.
These new rules could mean the average Canadian homeowner looking at homes around 20 percent cheaper. Those homeowners having issues qualifying under the new mortgage laws will have to make a different purchase price than they originally planned.
For those homeowners looking to renew their home mortgages, the lenders do not have to impose the new mortgage regulations. However, in some situations renewing borrowers could be in a position where they could face uncompetitive rates from their current mortgage holder. Also, because of the new mortgage regulations, current homeowners probably will not be able to shop around a better rate.
Most Canadians may find it difficult to decide whether or not to sell their home. You may have an excellent reason for selling your home even if you love the house or condo. This fact is especially true when the house or condo cannot meet your changing needs. It is probably time to sell your home if any of the following apply to your situation.
If your job is in a great location with excellent benefits and your house is too far for a commute, then selling your home makes sense. If you are retiring and wanting low maintenance, high-security community, it may be time to sell.
As you grow your family, you may need more room to accommodate the growth. One option is to renovate your current residence. Sometimes this option is unavailable due to space restrictions or lack of available permits for an extension. When this option is void, selling your home and finding a larger one may be your best bet.
On the other side, if all of your children have left the nest and you are left with a seven-bedroom home for two people, it might be time to sell. If you move fast enough, you may proceed to the smaller house before any of the kids decide to move back.
When a person has experienced a traumatic event such as divorce, death, or home invasion, it may be necessary to move and leave the memories behind you. In this situation, it is important to explore your financial status and other personal goals before making a rash decision. You should make sure it is the right move for you.
Once you have decided it is time to move, you will be investigating new homes. You want to ensure your new home has been well maintained and free from hidden problems. When looking at a new home, look at the following:
Roof- The type of material (wood, asphalt, tar, steel, etc.) can significantly influence the life of a roof.
Windows- The windows should be well sealed. If there is dust and other debris in the windowsills, this fact could mean extra costs in window replacement.
Wiring- Some older homes still use knob and tube aluminum wiring. This type can be hard and expensive to replace. Some insurance providers will not insure a house with this type of wiring.
Plumbing- Copper plumbing can cause issues in older homes. You should also check for leaks and proper water pressure.
Exterior- You should inspect the exterior of the home for cracks in vinyl, decaying areas in stucco, rotten wood/ siding, etc. This type of no repair can be expensive to replace.
Bathroom and Kitchen areas- You should inspect the areas around the tub, shower, and sink to ensure no water damage or mould is present. You should also look around the toilet area to guarantee no leaks are present.
Appliances- Some homes are sold with the machines. These appliances should be well maintained and work. Some homeowners will leave old stoves and refrigerators in the home, so they do not have to transport the items to the trash.
When you decide to purchase or sell a home in Canada, be sure to follow the above tips. They can save you time and money. They can also help you with the big decision of whether to sell or not.
The real estate market in Canada last year suffered lower overall sales. In 2018, the market has started at a slow pace. However, toward the end of 2017, the market had flattened out.
In the spring and summer months of last year, activity was down with the numbers of listings increasing. This situation brought small increasing residential pricing for housing. With this situation, the market had moderate increases and flattened out toward the end of 2017. Even though activity and sales of Canadian real estate were booming before 2017, amendments to mortgage regulations have caused a slowing of the Candaisn's real estate market.
With the new amendments to mortgage regulations, all lenders must qualify new loan applicants. Also, those renewing a mortgage or negotiating a new lender must follow these new regulations. As of 2018, all loan applicants are qualified on the mortgage rates which run around 200 points more than previously discounted mortgage rates. These new regulations were voted on and approved in the latter part of last year. These regulations went into effect on January 1, 2018.
While the earlier boom in real estate sales may be over, the Candian real estate market is in a state of balance. Concerning months of inventory, in the late part of 2017 in housing inventory, the average months of housing inventory were 4.8 months. The number of months of inventory signifies how it could take to liquate actual inventories at the present rate of sales activity. Overall, the current long-time average is 5.2 months. Presently, these numbers represent a balanced market showing the housing inventory is meeting the demand.
The most disappointing outlook comes from The Candian Real Estate Association. CREA is a trade organization that includes over 100,000 of real estate brokers, and agents in Canada. CREA has dramatically lowered its real estate sales project for 2018. CREA's financial analysts feel the stronger mortgage rules and affordability issues in Canda's real estate markets will slow the Canadian real estate market.
CREA has posted a possible decrease of 5.3% in the number of actual home sales. CREA has projected a 1.4% decrease in national average housing prices for this year. This decrease is based off last year's average housing price of $503,400, bring the average housing price for 2018 at 496, 353. If CREA statistics forecast is accurate, this year would be the first year the national housing price has decreased since the worldwide recession in 2008.
Unfortunately, stricter lending regulations usually indicate possible higher interest rates. For buyers, they will not be able to afford the same home as they could have bought just last year. On average for the new home buyer, their housing budget will have to be reduced from 5% to 25%. On borrowers qualifying for a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20% would see an 18% reduction in the maximum purchase price in the home they could buy.
As a buyer, a mortgage pre-approval is a good idea before you start shopping for your home. For home borrowers having issues qualifying with a traditional lender, a non-prime lender could be a good choice. Non-prime lenders will allow higher debt ratios. However, these lenders charge higher mortgage rates. Some non-prime lenders may charge a lower interest rate but make up for their lost revenue by adding additional fees.
The days of selling a home in a week or two are gone. However, the changes in the market will warrant rapid housing price changes creating a balance stable real estate market in Canada.
This is a feature that many buyers dream about when it comes to owning a new home. They picture the swimming parties they can have during the warmer months, and all of the days spent relaxing in the pool when life becomes overwhelming. However, there are downsides to owning a pool, such as maintenance, legal codes, and more. Take a look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of having a pool, to decide what option is best for your family.
Having a private pool could help you get the exercise you need to maintain a healthy weight, and prevent heart issues in your senior years. Staying physically active is important for good bone health, as it can lead to better balance and flexibility. When it comes to stress management, swimming is a form of exercise that can get the positive endorphins running through your body, helping you combat anxiety and depression. Therefore, when it pertains to your quality of life, having a pool might be exactly what you need.
Owning a pool is a luxury feature that could increase the number of guests that come to your home, especially in the summer time. This could be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on your preferences. Friends and family will love coming over to dip their toes in the pool, or hang out and soak up the warm sun as they tan. Some of your close friends and family members may even ask if they can host swim parties and celebrations at your home. Keep this in mind when searching for homes with pools. If you are all for the extra guests, make sure you have lots of towels and sunscreen ready!
The joy of having a pool may be short lived when you calculate the fees associated with owning this feature, especially the insurance costs. Simply having a pool in your backyard is a liability risk, regardless if you plan to use the pool or not. This could cause your insurance rates to increase significantly. You should check with a sales representative and ask her about the increased insurance costs. She may have some tips when it comes to finding affordable insurance providers.
Swimming pools can increase your social life and improve your health, but they also come with maintenance. The chances are that something will break on your pool sooner, rather than later. The most common replacements and repairs pertaining to pools are:
In addition to unforeseen repairs, pools need to be resurfaced at least once every nine to 10 years. Before purchasing a home, be sure to ask the seller about past maintenance and repairs, in order to determine what needs to be fixed and how soon. You should also have an inspection done that includes the pool, to determine if it is in good condition.
On a good note, having a pool could add value to your property, should you choose to sale or rent out the home in the future. This will depend on current trends, the condition of the pool, and the style of the neighborhood. Speak with a sales representative to find out if having a pool will increase or decrease your property value.
Ultimately, the decision to purchase a home with a pool is entirely up to you. While the advantages and disadvantages of having a pool can make the decision easier, your preferences will be the deciding factor. If you decide that owning a pool is not the best option for your family, consider buying a home in a subdivision with a community pool. This allows you to keep some of the benefits, without many of the disadvantages!
It is everybody's dream to sell their home and be able to move into a bigger and better house in a completely different area but selling your home can get complicated if you do not go through the proper steps beforehand to make sure that your has is updated enough for potential home buyers of your home. Here are 5 things you need to fix before you can even consider selling your home and moving on to bigger and better. Remember that when a home is updated people are more likely to consider it when buying or looking for a new home.
One of the minor things that needs to be updated on your home before you put it on the market and show it to potential buyers is to repair and holes or cracks that may be in any of the walls of your home. Make sure to patch all holes or cracks weather they are big or small and to give your walls a fresh coat of primer and some new paint after you patch all the holes you find. This will make less work for the next owner of your house and is greatly appreciated.
When considering selling your home one of the more important things that needs to be looked at is the roof and exterior windows. You want to make sure there is no damage to the roof or the exterior windows and if there is be sure to fix or replace these issues before you sell your home to the next person. Problems with your roof or windows can cause rain water to get into your house and cause damage to your home over time. These repairs are more expensive and typically turn potential homebuyers away from buying a home when these problems are seen.
It is important to get repair or replacement estimates on anything and everything that is wrong or broken with your home so that you can either fix it or tell the next home buyer of your home how much it will cost to repair or replace the problem so they can assess if buying the house is worth it for them when they know everything that they have to repair or replace upon buying the house. Replacement estimates can also help potential homebuyers get a clear understanding of what they are in for.
Before selling your home it is important to remember to declutter your home of all your personal belongings. You can leave some furniture for staging or even pay a company to stage your home with furniture but there is no point leaving all your small Knick knacks laying around because it will cause potential homebuyers to spend less time looking at the actual details of the home and what they want but instead show them how awful your taste or interior decorating may be to them.
Last but not least it is important to remember to clean your house top to bottom before selling it so you can show it to potential buyers in its cleanest form. Also, replace any flooring that has stains or has been destroyed by any previous or current pets you have because often times pet odors can cause people to turn down potential homes during their search for the perfect home.
Aside from making sure you complete these tasks before selling your home remember to make your house look how you would want it to look if you were buying it.
Many first-time home buyers do not understand the importance of making sure they have all their ducks lined in a row before the venture into buying a home. This can lead to disappointment when they find out they don’t have everything done that they should before they purchase a new home. Complete these 5 tasks before buying a home to make first time home buyers a smooth and easy process for you and your REALTOR@ who will be helping you not look for your dream home but make it a reality.
The most important thing when you are looking to buy a new home is to check make sure you have a decent credit store. It can be impossible for anyone to get a home loan without having a good credit score. You can improve your credit score by opening new credit cards, spending money on them and keeping up on each payment. Remember not to spend more money on your credit card's than you have to pay it back because it is important that you make each payment on time in order to truly build your credit score up. Make sure you don’t open any new credit cards up until a year before you go to apply for a mortgage.
The second most important thing to do before you even consider buying a home is to figure out what you can truly afford. Figure out what your ideal home price would be but also what your maximum is so that you do not go over budget at all. It is important to look at a few homes and get a feel for the market and what you can get for your money before deciding how much you can afford to spend. Sometimes first-time home buyers are willing to higher their maximum to get their dream home.
The third most important thing to do before looking to buy a home is to make sure you not only decide how much you want to spend on the house, but you also have money saved for your down payment and closing costs. To purchase a house, you're going to need a down payment of at least 20 percent of the total house price. Remember that there are also closing costs when it comes to buying a home, so you will need to have extra money aside from the down payment saved up for that.
When you are building or maintaining your credit score it may be a good idea to open a savings account so that you can save money each month towards your down payment and closing costs as well as extra money for if something is wrong with your new home or something goes wrong. It is very important to know around how much money you have to save in total, so you can have a set amount taken out of your checks each month going Into your savings account so you know when your goal will be reached.
Lastly, it is important that you go to a bank and apply for a mortgage, so you can get preapproved for a certain amount. Knowing how much you are preapproved for can help you determine how much money you need to have saved in total and how much you can afford to spend on a house that has everything that you need it to. Without a preapproved mortgage you may have more trouble finding your new home.
When you decide to sell your home, there are several things you can do to make it sell fast. Make a list of items that need to be fixed, need to be cleaned, and need to be updated before you have pictures taken and have it listed. First impressions matter when selling a home, so it should look it's best for top price and quick negotiations.
The first thing potential buyers will see is the outside of your home. Even if you list your home with pictures, they will be drawn to the homes curb appeal. Hire a landscaper if your gardens and yard need work, or spend some time doing it yourself. All trash and debris should be cleared from the outside of the home.
If your home is in need of a paint job or exterior repairs, this should be done to raise the asking price.
The kitchen matters the most in a home. If you are unable to afford all new appliances and granite counter-tops, there are other things you can do to make it appealing. Purchase just one upgraded appliance, instead of all of them. Replace the knobs on your cupboards, and add a new backsplash for cheap but effective upgrades. If your paint colour is neutral, it will make your kitchen more appealing.
Clean your home and get rid of personal items as much as possible. Take your pictures down, patch nail holes, clean your oven, fridge, windows and vacuum every day. Taking the pets out of the house also makes for an easier selling process.
One of the biggest mistakes people make when selling a home is too much stuff laying around. Once the home is clean, consider putting what you don't need and extra furniture in storage. This creates a space for potential buyers to move around and see potential in the rooms.
Stage your home in a way that there is plenty of space and most of your things are stored and out of sight. This is important because potential buyers want to visualize the home as theirs.
Hiring a staging company is a good idea if you can afford it and have the ability to move your furniture out of your home prior to selling it.
You should always be ready to show your home once it is listed for sale. If you are still living in your home, make sure it is cleaned daily. Also, if you bake in the evenings it will trigger the feeling of home for buyers.
If your home isn't selling at the price you want, reconsider staying in it until you can sell it in a better market. This may gain you thousands over time. Asking a REALTOR® and doing some research on the right seasons to sell will help you prepare.
Buying a beautiful historic home is a dream that many people have for themselves. Plenty of older homes have had upgrades made throughout the decades and centuries to ensure that they are suitable for human occupation. Still though, as you are looking at these timeless beauties, do ask certain questions to ensure that the space is safe for your family.
A home that has seen the better part of the last century may have an electrical system that is not updated. In other words, the system might not meet the latest codes, and it might pose a serious fire hazard. Taking care of this issue is pivotal. A light that won't turn on can be more than just a nuisance; it can be a warning that major issues are happening with the home's electrical system.
While plumbing issues do not necessarily pose as serious of a danger as electrical ones, they can come with some hazards, and they can cause a host of problems in the home. Old pipes, for example, may be filled with rust and on the edge of bursting. If the main hasn't been replaced in a long time, the toilets, sinks and tubs could constantly overflow and get clogged.
You don't want to live in a house that has asbestos in it. You might think that you'll move in and take care of the problem later, but disrupting asbestos releases a world of danger onto your family living in the home. The decision to avoid houses with such issues is a wise one.
If the house is considered a historical property and is registered under certain guidelines, you might not have the ability to alter the house. For example, if you are thinking of adding an extension onto the house in a few years, you might find that you aren't allowed to do so. Find out this information now so that your house dreams are not stifled later.
Replacing and the entire roof and siding is a task that you may want to attend to later, but you likely don't want to have to handle this prodigious project as soon as you move into the place. Learning how sturdy these structures are and assessing them for issues are useful techniques.
Some houses do have moldy areas in them, especially if they have had issues with poor plumbing, bad ventilation or flooding. Taking care of the mold is important before you move in because can mold can jeopardize the health of your family. You also want to make sure that the source of the mold is found; simply wiping it away doesn't eradicate it forever.
Checking the house for signs of termite treatment and damage is another important step before committing to buying it. While pest control companies can certainly help to keep these bugs away, you want to make sure that you know what you're getting into. Also, you need to hire companies that use methods that are safe for your children and your pets to be around.

Is your forehead itching? Do you experience this itchiness with or without a rash? Let us look at causes, including during pregnancy and what one can do to hasten the relief this itchiness.
To begin with, according to healthhype.com, this kind of itching may develop with or without forehead rash. Whereas some causes may not be serious, proper diagnosis is necessary. During diagnosis, other symptoms experienced together with this problem may help you guess what could be causing it.
Itchy forehead has different superstitious meanings among different societies. These superstitions should not bother or agitate you and we would not dwell on them. We will instead focus this problem in the medical context.
An itchy forehead can have various reasons behind it. So under this section, we are going to give you some of the most common skin conditions that commonly trigger this condition. Here we go:
In most cases, allergies have been the prime trigger of forehead itch. It can occur as part of eczema (atopic dermatitis). Eczema normally begins in the childhood and are closely linked to allergic rhinitis and asthma. This condition will make the affected area to develop a dry, cracked, red and itchy skin.
Another allergy-linked condition we can’t forget is the allergic contact dermatitis. This usually occurs when certain allergens come into contact with an individual`s skin. Who can get allergic contact dermatitis? Well, this a condition that normally affects those individuals having an immune hypersensitivity to certain substance or allergens.
You should be able to acknowledge that, the skin on your forehead can be irritated with numerous substances. Common irritants that can cause general facial itch include soap, skin care products, water, sweat among others.
Do not neglect that there is more irritant that would be available in different environments including your work environment. Prolonged exposure to these dreadful substances can make one to develop irritant contact dermatitis. This is a condition that can cause itchiness on any other part of the body.
Your forehead skin can be irritated when touched by the hair leading to itching. In particular, uncleansed hair loaded with dust, dirt and accumulated hair styling products such as hair styling gel can be a source of irritants.
Other possible irritants in hair that can cause this problem include chemical straighteners, hair dyes, and perm agents.
Many people love wearing hats, helmets, veils, headscarves, and headbands. The reasons for this may range from head protection to swag among other interests including religious reasons.
Do these headwear have any prospective risk on the wearer? Of course, they can pose some effects on your head such as being a source of irritant, contact dermatitis i.e. certain headwear will directly irritate the forehead skin directly. This is common if the materials that make up this headwear can trigger allergic reactions.
Furthermore, note that the heat and sweat generated after covering your head for some time can sometimes act as irritants leading to itching and a rash. Covering a rash if available can only lead to severe irritation and itching. Be careful!
Acne occurring on the forehead is very usual. This is a problem that is most common among the adolescents though can as well be experienced among adults.
A characteristic symptom of this condition is the pimples. Pimples can occur due to bacterial infections, overactive oil glands and inflammation and blockage of the follicles.
Another possible cause is the chronic skin diseases. There are several skin diseases. Remember these diseases can trigger forehead itching with or without a rash. Sometimes, you can have a forehead rash without itching. Here are the main example of these skin diseases:
Do all itching arise from skin conditions? Definitely, the answer is NO. In some cases, itching may be due to psychological factors. For instance, an individual is exposed to anxiety and nervousness, he/she can be a victim of forehead itching without knowing.
What one should bear in mind is that itching triggered by the psychological factors are short-lived and they might go away when the stressor is no longer there.
The ideal solution in such a case is avoiding situations that can cause stress, anxiety or nervousness. Furthermore, one can try stress management strategies as well as find some distractions to avoid scratching their forehead.
It will hold water to say that, due to its location, your forehead can be prone to sunburn and consequently a sunburn itch on this area. Besides sunburn, any other source of UV rays can lead to irritation of the skin.
Itching around the forehead skin due to sunburn may be accompanied by skin peeling. In some cases, the itching will precede skin redness.
Wounds may develop an individual’s forehead because of different reasons. This may include accidental blunt trauma. Normally itching will be experienced by the time any wound will be healing. Expect your it if you have a wound in this area that is healing.
Besides the above, some skin fungal infections, bacterial infection and bug bites can also lead an itchy skin on your forehead.
What is a rash? Well, a rash is normally an inflammatory reaction of the skin. These can have variant sizes, appearances and will be influenced by underlying triggers.
It is not uncommon to have skin rashes on your forehead. These rashes can affect small or large areas. Such a rash may occur only here or also on other parts such the cheeks, or entire face or/or other body parts.
Are all forehead rashes itchy? NO, some rashes may be itchy while others may not. It all depends on the cause of these rashes.
In terms of their color and appearance, they can be white, red, purple or silver in color. Their texture of these rashes can be raised, flat, bumpy or scaly and they can be accompanied by flaky and peeling skin cells. Some forehead rashes can appear as dots or spots. The can as well occur over a continuous area.
Forehead rash may be induced by variety of factors that could be mild to severe diseases, disorders and conditions. Some of the causes these rashes include acne, dermatitis, mild allergic reactions, and inflammatory disorders.
Something to smile about is the fact that forehead rashes do not pose serious or permanent harm and they can always be successful with proper care and medication. However, not adhering to your healthcare provider can result in dreadful undesirable consequences.
During pregnancy, women will become a subject to many skin changes or reactions. They might experience changes such as sudden glow on their face. Some conditions such chloasma or what is known as “mask of pregnancy” will not be left out.
Mask of pregnancy can cause dark splotchy spots to present on an individual’s face. These spots usually appear on their forehead as a result of increased pigmentation during this stage. Pregnant women commonly experience “mask of pregnancy” due to the fact that at this stage their body will produce more hormones.
Another issue is that the fairly produced hormones will cause a face of a pregnant woman to become shiny, there will be more blood circulation causing the face to be brighter. Note that all these conditions are what lead to pregnancy glow that can be linked to forehead itching.
In case a pregnant woman had acne before, the condition may worsen leading to intense itching than before. The situation will be truly taken into the account that at this stage there are more hormones being produced.
Spider veins are also another common condition during pregnancy due to increased hormone production. Spider veins are also known as spider nevi are minute reddish blood vessels that branch outward. They are also caused by increased blood circulation. They usually appear on the face, neck, arms and upper chest. Though spider veins are usually not common, the can induce a bit itching around the forehead.
All the above causative factors can be relieved through medical treatment or remedies once they are discovered. You will soon itch gradually easing or vanishing once the underlying conditions resolve. How long the itching will take before it goes way will depend on the biology of an individual’s body.
In case of mild itching, there are several available simple remedies that can be employed to deal with itching. Once again, the effectiveness of the said remedies will vary depending on the roots of these itching. Severe cases of forehead itching or forehead itching that won’t go away may need you to see your physician for evaluation and treatment.
If your concern has been ‘what can I do to relief out my itchy forehead’? We have remedies that have been proved worthy. Take your time to explore the below listed simple and remedies.
In the first place, rinsing your forehead and scalp with cool water is just but an ideal move. During this process, you can use a mild soap that cannot induce any skin condition. Make sure to dry the affected area thoroughly but be keen not cause any irritation. Note that antibacterial and perfumed soap can just lead to a negative outcome in this case.
Please refrain from using hair care products or hair dyes too close to your affected forehead skin. This can lead to irritation.
Another issue stops any facial care products that could lead to itching since facial itching can extend to forehead too. The only problem here is that it might be very difficult to define and establish which product will have a potential influence on your facial skin.
In case the headwear is the gate opener to your forehead itching, please you should stop it immediately. Try out another solution apart from headwear or get ones made from different material .
Furthermore, you can as well limit their use and always ensure they are very clean. Remember helmets and hats that cannot be washed or replaced should completely not used at all. Such headwear can make a good habitat for bacteria that can lead to skin conditions linked to itching.
It is important not to share personal items such as comb, hair brushes among others. By doing so one can provide a ground for the spread of fungal infections, scabies, and head lice. All these are potent to causing forehead itching.
Try using sunscreen on the forehead and use a wide-brimmed hat in case your itching is not due to the headwear, this may limit the extent of the sunburn. You are also advised to stop exposing yourself to the sun while applying some topical creams or lotions, for instance, those that contain vitamin A derivatives.
For cases due to skin rashes, some home remedies like the use aloe vera, olive oil, chamomile tea, Vitamin E oil, oatmeal, Baking soda, Ice Park, Lime juice, tomato puree among other products can be used to heal it.
Sometimes some rashes will be very painful and burn and accompanied by swelling and redness. Homeopathic remedies can be suitable.
Itching due to allergies or irritants can be impeded using antihistamines but make sure you get the advice and prescription from your doctor before you use these medications.
Do not scratch your itching forehead because it can lead to infections or worsen the problem. Try patting the itchy skin instead or above discussed remedies.
In the cases where you have applied the above remedies and the condition doesn’t change or the itching persists, book appointment with your doctor for further diagnosis.
In many cases, you will agree with me that the other general causes of body itching have a lot also to do with your forehead itching. Always know that the various causes of itching can trigger itchiness.

This month’s ‘Mama Of The Month’ is dedicated to the brains and brilliance behind the one and only ‘PIZZUP’ – a fantastic night out for mothers…
Lorna Hayward aka @mrshhayward from The Mumblings put on her first ‘PIZZUP’ in April 2017 with a handful of women. This December she pulled off a night to remember with 300 mums with legendary DJ Luck and MC Neat…
For one night, mothers (including myself) left ‘responsibility’ at home, let their hair down, put on a fabulous dress, drank prosecco, ate pizza, met with other like minded mothers and danced the night away to nostalgic music that momentarily made us all feel like we were back in our 20’s and didn’t have a care in the world. It was honestly a night to remember
Well hey there. My name is Lorna Harriet (hence the ‘H’ – ‘L’ annoyingly wasn’t available) Hayward. Nee Poll. Born in Canterbury, raised in Henley-on-Thames and now residing in the borough of Wandsworth alongside my husband, Jamie and our two girls – Elsie (4) and Marnie (2)
I worked in Client Services within the digital advertising industry. I went back to my job twice, after both my girls maternity stints, and left Soho just over 7 months ago to freelance. I intended to stay within the similar sphere of work, however my blog and various chance meetings led me down a path of ‘Content creation and copywriting’ which has been both nerve-wracking and bloody amazing!
3. What changes does a woman have to apply to her life when she becomes a mother that you weren’t aware of?
Selflessness. I never knew just how selfish I was before, and I really don’t think – until you have children that you can. The freedom I had to just do whatever the hell I wanted (within reason) and when I liked. I’ve always been pretty organised, and OCD has always played a large part in my manicness day to day, but now it’s on overdrive. The level of juggling (even more so, since becoming freelance) to keep on top of the house, kids, work, alongside being able to keep a flicker of your own life alive is, well – it’s bloody hard!
PIZZUP is a night out for mums. Somewhere to drink (a lot) of booze, eat enough (delicious) food, and dance. No networking (unless you want to) no panels – just an informal night off, and out with a bevvy of awesome women. Some come with a mate, some come alone but we all unite over a drink or ten.
I always struggle to provide a succinct answer to this one. Much like how most Ideas start – it’s usually derives from something that is lacking. I know many say it – more often than when I first had Elsie – but motherhood can be really lonely, and equally pretty isolating – even for a social butterfly like myself. I was really craving a good night out, and off with like minded women. I have also never massively felt like I have belonged a particular group, network or circle since becoming a mum. NCT wasn’t a huge success, mum groups never really floated my boat and I guess I’m quite a needy person like that. I always felt on the periphery of something, but never quite in it. I had gained some interest from my blog, and a few local mums had suggested meeting in real life (after initially connecting through the weird and wonderful world of Instagram) and it just seemed like a natural step to organise a night out than try to battle conversations alongside the kids. There are tons of ‘events’ out there for mums these days – from business networking, to parenting panels but I guess I was just craving something a little different. I wanted to have the whole venue (not just a function room, where I felt hidden away) and know that if I was stood at the bar ordering a my potential 10th drink of the night, that I would be saddled up to someone who would also be facing the kids in the morning alongside a mutha of a hangover. There’s something about being with, drinking alongside and talking to women who get it. I still love going out with Jamie, and our mixed group of mates, but I believe there was a need for an en masse collective of ladies who all wanted the same as me. So, I did as my mum always says and I JFDI (Just fucking do it) What started with 35 of us (still a huge achievement for me) ended in 300 last week. Bonkers!
Ha! God knows! Actually, that’s a lie. Serious supplier coordination, a lot of communication and perseverance! I’ve never organised events before – it’s not my job, so I’ve learnt (a lot) on the job. I’ve made a few mistakes, but ultimately I have kept in the forefront of my mind what would I want from a night out and taken it from there. Pulling together the POST PIZZUP PARTY BAGS has always been a tough one. It takes a serious amount of hustling, hounding, chasing up and logistical trickery!
I guess one thing to remember is, PIZZUP isn’t my day job. I have three jobs (as a freelancer) – I have two kids, so at times it has been FULL on, and I’ve felt like I was drowning a bit. think more than anything the pressure of hosting women, most of whom I don’t actually know – has got to me. I’ve found myself starting to panic that supplies won’t arrive, or ladies won’t turn up. And yet – each time, I’ve been surprised with the positive results. Equally, I also think it’s good not to be complacent about it. Things go wrong, they always do – I have to juggle childcare, or there isn’t enough prosecco but they all sort themselves out in the end, mostly with support and encouragement from others. My poor mate Lauren has had me cry on her at every PIZZUP so far I think! She bears the brunt of my pre PIZZUP nerves.
Crikey. I really don’t know. I know what it won’t look like, if that helps? I don’t want PIZZUP to become inaccessible. I love that many of the near on 300 women who came to PIZZUP last week weren’t on Instagram, or just ‘dabbled with Facebook’ – I like the inclusiveness it brings. I feel a responsibility to facilitate women, who happen to mums in having a wicked night out. It’s that simple. I was chatting to someone through work the other day who said her friend (who happens to live locally to me) was struggling a year on – not having really fitted in, and hadn’t clicked with a group of mums. My immediate reaction was ‘oh you need to get her to PIZZUP’ – not because I want to sell a ticket, or because I need to get PIZZUP in front of her, but because I think she sounded like she genuinely needed it, and would meet some ace mates.
COME TO PIZZUP! In all honesty? Feel the fear, find ya lippy, stick on your trainers (or your heels) grab a good mate, and head out. There is so much to be said for letting go a bit. Motherhood can feel hugely relentless at times for me and I crave being able to just feel a little ‘free’ – event if it’s only for one night.
Surround yourself with good people. And Excellent women. It’s taken me to 36 to filter out the people in my life who might be good for others, but are not good for me. I want to try and instil confidence into them. Not showy confidence, just an inner confidence that is able to carry them through school and beyond. I wish I had the confidence to have walked away from some crap friendships in the past but we live and learn.
Thank you so much Lorna for being December’s MAMA OF THE MONTH… a true party planning legend and I cannot wait for the next PIZZUP… It makes us mama’s feel like we’ve all still got it… and we have!

I have not really thought much about my affiliates, however, as I have gained another today, I feel as though blogging about it will inform my slowly rising fan base as to who they are.
Let's start with iGenius and iHack3r of the Dest1ny Development Duo (the Dev team in which I founded and am a member of). So for the purposes of software development and promotional purposes, I am affiliated with iGenius and iHack3r, but also on the grounds of success within Dest1ny Dev (as we are a team, therefore we work together).
Today, I gained an affiliate; an old buddy of mine: InfiniteL00p8. He is working on software (I cannot reveal the purpose) and I am going to be assisting him with his software, therefore we are now affiliated on the grounds of developing the software and marketing the software to the public. So far, i've seen his beta (which is only a GUI with limited, not full functionality) and I must say that this is going to be one huge project!
And finally, although indirect, I am affiliated with YouTube on the grounds of the Dest1ny Dev YouTube account (which i also manage and created) being a YouTube partner.
I'm always interested to hear what you guys think! Leave your opinion as a comment on any of the posts.
I know nuclear power is much in the news right now because of the recent accident in Japan, so many teachers are assigning persuasive essays on the topic of nuclear power. I've had two inquiries recently through my form for asking questions about essays. Here are some ideas for other persuasive essay topics. One student, in Illinois, asked "im writing a paper on why nuclear power plants are bad but im having trouble stating my points can you help me."
So I decided to write a little sample persuasive essay. I thought this might be useful for those who are looking to find out how to structure a persuasive essay. The structure is pretty basic. You put in some of the arguments for your thesis; you put in some of the arguments against your thesis; and then you explain why the for arguments are better than the against arguments. Read through the sample persuasive essay to see how I do this.
First this sample persuasive essay needs an introduction. Visit my Five Great Ways to Write an Introduction page for some ideas on how to begin this essay. What follows is the body of this sample persuasive essay. By "sample" I mean: Don't copy this and hand it in as your work. These are some ideas for you to research and document. I could be full of s**t when it comes to reasoning about nuclear power. Get some quotes from experts to back up these statements.
But seriously, I can give many reasons to be opposed to nuclear power. But in a persuasive essay, you have to consider both sides. So let's look at the reasons why some people believe nuclear power is a good solution to the growing need for energy.
Nuclear power creates no greenhouse gasses. The amount of CO2 has almost doubled in the atmosphere since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Most scientists today believe that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is trapping heat and slowly causing the average global temperature to rise. Since heat is really a form of energy, the increased energy in the atmosphere is experienced by us not only in the form of higher temperatures, but also as more severe storms and extreme weather events. These are generally bad things. Burning coal and oil adds to greenhouse gasses. Nuclear power is a means of using the energy of radioactive decay, and thus does not burn coal or oil.
The sources of oil that we are using today are often either in difficult to reach places, such as undersea, or in the high Arctic. The oil extracted from these places is expensive. Oil from the middle east, or other places around the world may be a source of money for governments that are anti-democratic or corrupt. Oil from Canada's tar sands may have other environmental costs. Increasing the development of nuclear power may reduce the use of oil from all these sources. Unlike oil, uranium can be sourced in North America, bypassing the possibility of sending money to potentially unfriendly or unpleasant governments.
Now that's about all the good stuff I can think of for nuclear power. In my opinion, there are many more reasons to be against nuclear power than to be for it. Before I specifically look at why I don't think the two arguments supporting nuclear power are valid, I will look at other arguments against nuclear power.
Nuclear power is not safe. In just over 30 years three major accidents have caught the world's attention. The most recent, Japan's Fukushima's reactor, is still ongoing. We do not yet know how many have or will die as a result of this disaster. But at Chernobyl, in 1986, hundreds died, and thousands were affected by radiation. The thing about radiation is that there is no safe level.
That doesn't mean we can be absolutely safe. We are exposed to radiation every day. Every place on the planet has natural background radiation. Radioactivity produces energy waves not unlike light waves from the sun. However, some forms of energy waves produced by radioactivity can pass through our bodies. Most of the time, this is harmless, but occasionally, an energy wave passing through a body can hit a strand of DNA, damaging the DNA. In some cases, this can cause the cell to become cancerous. Even sunlight can do this.
But obviously, the more someone is exposed to radiation, the more likely they are to suffer some bad consequences, like cancer. Therefore increasing the radioactivity in the air or water as a result of even tiny leaks from a nuclear power plant will increase the risk of people getting cancer. Often we can't even identify which people were harmed by a radioactive leak; all we can say is that statistically, the cancer rates went up.
Nuclear power is not economical either. Since the costs of a nuclear accident could be so high, insurance companies will not insure a nuclear power plant. Therefore the only organization that can insure a nuclear power plant is the government -- us. We are the insurers of all the nuclear power plants in our country. (Doesn't matter which country you live in.) The government of Japan will have to pay for all the cleanup and damages from the Fukushima accident. They are already raising taxes. The nuclear power industry is already subsidized; government grants, loan guarantees, and other incentives make nuclear power cheaper than it would be if the real costs were calculated. The costs of storing or disposing of wastes are not calculated either. Nuclear waste can be toxic for up to 240,000 years. It must be kept from leaking into the environment for that long. This is an unimaginable time scale from a human perspective.
Now, let's look at the greenhouse gas issue. Yes, it is true that nuclear plants do not use fossil fuels to generate electricity, as do coal plants, natural gas plants, or oil burning plants. But why not measure the CO2 produced during the many years it takes to build a nuclear power plant? Why not calculate the greenhouse gasses produced by mining, refining, and transporting uranium? These are substantial, as well.
A final thing that should be pointed out when writing about nuclear energy is about who is promoting it. Nuclear power is promoted by very big corporations. It is a very centralized form of energy production. Alternative energy sources are naturally more widely distributed. No one alternative source can answer all of the energy needs the way that oil or nuclear have tried to. Whether you are talking about solar power, wind power, geothermal power, tide power, or small hydroelectric projects, decentralized energy systems are more democratic because they don't require such vast concentrations of capital to come into play. It should be clear that if democracy is really our highest value (and aren't we constantly asking our young people to give up their lives to defend it?) then democracy in energy production should be our model.
What does this need to be a proper essay? For one, it needs some original research. Don't quote me, I'm just a grumpy old anti-nuclear activist. Get some solid statistics from actual organizations that have done research on nuclear power. A persuasive essay must be ... well, persuasive. And it needs an introduction and a conclusion. Here are some suggestions on ways to write a conclusion.
“Growing concerns over climate change have highlighted the need to step up contribution of nuclear energy in the energy mix and to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels in the years to come. This essay discusses some of the major advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy.”
Nuclear energy represents only 15% of the electricity produced worldwide. Though in France, 80% of its electricity production is from nuclear energy and more than one-fourth of electricity in Europe comes from nuclear energy. Nuclear energy represents a very small percentage in many countries’ total electricity production, but this percentage is likely to go up in the coming years. Nuclear power is generated using Uranium, a mineral of which one of the isotopes, U- 234 is unstable. The nucleus breaks down resulting in the emission of heat and radiation followed by a chain reaction. This is called nuclear fission and this process liberates a large amount of energy, but the process also releases radiation which is very dangerous.
Nuclear energy has the ability to produce electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. It produces electricity without pollution. It is cleaner than many other forms of energy production. Essentially, nuclear power would be “carbon-zero” if the uranium were mined and transported in a more efficient way.
Nuclear reaction releases a million times more energy, as compared to hydro or wind energy. Large quantity of energy is generated from a single nuclear power plant.
Nuclear reactors make use of uranium as fuel and produces huge amounts of energy from small amounts of uranium. The Earth has the high reserves of uranium. Current estimates put the uranium supply as enough to last for 30 to 60 years. Moreover other fuel cycles like Thorium are available for power generation. Whereas, oil reserves and other fossil type fuels are likely to run out shortly.
Nuclear power plants operate reliably and have a continuous output of power.The plants do not generally face operations and maintenance problems. This is a contrast to other alternative energies which depend on the activity of the weather.
Although nuclear power reactors are expensive to build, they are relatively cheap to operate. Fuel is inexpensive and a plant can be operated by small number of people, approximately 10 people.
The nuclear energy is by far the most concentrated form of energy, so it can be produced in large quantities over short periods of time.
Nuclear energy produces electricity at a competitive price and is generally comparable in output to coal plants.
A nuclear plant is not dependant on local sources like oil and coal and can be set up in any part of the globe. It also does not require a lot of space and so can be placed in already developed areas and the power does not have to be transferred over long distances.
It has potential nuclear proliferation issues. Some reactors produce plutonium which can be used to make nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are a major threat to the world as they can cause a large-scale devastation.
Nuclear Plants require a high level of technology and a major initial capital investment. Its abandonment cost is also very high.
There are issues with management of radioactive waste. The spent fuel is highly radioactive and has to be carefully stored for many years after use. A solution to the waste management problem needs to be explored and developed. This has R&D cost.
An accident may cause a major disaster resulting in thousands of casualties and releasing high amounts of radiation into the environment, example: explosion of a reactor at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine and melting of the core of a reactor at Three-Mile Island in the United States.
Nuclear energy is an alternative energy but not a renewable energy as Uranium is a non-renewable source and its supplies are limited.
Nuclear plants may be vunerable targets to anyone wanting to disrupt the power supply, and to have quite horrific results and to devastate an entire region.
Today, nuclear energy remains controversial. There are proponents and opponents of nuclear energy, but nuclear energy along with other green energies has a major role to play in years to come. The actions to mitigate the risk associated with nuclear energy need to given due importance to harness its full potential.

Jharsuguda : Four men were arrested on Thursday for allegedly kidnapping a 52-year-old officer of a Company Shyam Metalics & Energy Ltd.(Rengali) from Baljori area of Jharsuguda and demanded a ransom of Rs. 10 Lakhs.
The four accused were identified as Satish Sharma (27), Apurb Dey (28), Raja alias Kailash Chaini (22) and Binod Oram (30).
As per sources, On Sunday morning, Shambhu Sharma, a officer of Shyam Metallics & Energy Ltd. (Rengali) was kidnapped on the gun point by the three bike Bourne miscreants on his own vehicle (OR-15 M 5263) near Black Diamond Engineering College Road, Baljori. They then took the victim to the house of Raja alias Kailash Chaini at Purnabasti and had demanded Rs. 30 Lakhs but finally settled for Rs. 10 Lakhs. On Monday, the accused made victim call to his wife and asked a ransom of Rs. 10 Lakhs for his release. As per the deal, victim’s accountant had handed over Rs. 10 Lakh to the accuse without the knowledge of police. The accuse then had left the victim along with his car near Vedanta Gate No.2 situated at Purna Village.
Jharsuguda SDPO Purushottam Sethi Said that,” After collecting valuable clues about the criminals involved in this kidnapping case, we had conducted various raids based on the information and managed to nab four miscreants involved in this case and seized Rs. 10 Lakhs , Six mobile phones, one Bolero Car ( OD 16 A 8715) , Hero Honda I Smart (MH 32 AC 4013) , Hero Honda Splendor (OD 23 8555), One Yamaha Fazer (OD 23 5699) , One Royal Enfield (OD 23 D2222), one Pistol with four live ammunition and a dagger. In this gang another two people involved in this case has been still at large, will also be nabbed very soon.”
“Jean-Yves Thibaudet was the excellent soloist, bringing just the right flair to the work’s built-in flamboyance. He played brilliantly and seemed scarcely to break a sweat in the cascading scales and crashing octaves.” Read the rest of the review here.
I have had two wonderful people send me yarn. As soon as I opened one of the boxes my dad said, “That’s Skidoo Yellow!!!!! I bet that would make a great helmet liner hat that wouldn’t be itchy or tight.” It was obvious in that moment the yarn had no choice. All the patterns I found used really small gauge which is 1) a pain and not very quick which a stockinette stitch hat has to be if it wants to get finished and 2) requires a ton of yardage which is "Like so not cool". So I winged it. I was worried about having enough yarn because my dad has a biggish head. There was plenty leftover though!!! I have never worked with Cascade fixation before but it was awesome!!!!!!! SO lovely!
I like that the hat is a simple helmet liner on him. On my smaller head it kind of has a reggae look but I can fold up the bottom as shown down the page and it looks like Meg's hat from Family Guy! And because the yarn is so stretchy even when it's folded up it's not going anywhere!!!
I didn't get a row gauge but that is the less crucial of the two because you can always knit more rows, but the gauge for the stitches was 5 sts per inch. I made sure I didn't stretch the yarn while I knit with it. Keep it loose people!!!
Stockinette stitch to you desired length (For a helmet liner make it the same approximate length as you would a normal close fitting beanie or for the reggae/fold up Meg's hat make it a couple inches longer)
You can either cut the yarn and thread the tail through the remaining stitches and pull up tight or flip the needles to the inside of the work and do 3 needle bind off. It makes the top of the hat look sooooooo much nicer!!! I tried to show this in the bottom pic but the yellow hurt the camera :) Weave in your ends and you are done!
I know this is a really simple pattern but I thought I would put it out there for those people who don't want to take the risk of winging it, and can't find a pattern to use up that ball of Cascade fixation.
Because this is such a simple pattern please feel free to sell hats made from this pattern but please do not sell the pattern. If you would like to share the pattern please share the link and not the pattern itself! Happy Knitting!!!
Hurray for new yarn! The hat is very cheerful and your hair is darling. I look forward to seeing what you post next.
That's cute and nice color. It;s good to look to bright color. Thanks for sharing the pattern, it would be great to create something like that.

Cave wall art led to symbolic paintings telling timeless stories about life, work and religion on walls, pottery and papyri. Art next evolved into realistic illustrations, starting with the ancient Greeks. While this art also told a story, we saw little data visualization. Why? Humans were becoming more realistic, however, data visualization was rare because data was rare.
Starting about 5,000 years ago, ancient Egyptians used symbolic paintings, drawn on walls, pottery and papyri, to tell timeless stories that were believed to carry the dead into their next life. Egyptian surveyors also portrayed earthly and heavenly positions locating these using something akin to latitude and longitude. In essence, geography and symbolism led to data visualization.
Claudius Ptolemy (100-170 A.D.), a mathematician, astronomer, geographer, astrologer and poet in ancient Greece, used a map projection to portray his concept of the structure of the earth. The illustration below, from the 15th century, portrays Ptolemy’s world as he saw it at the time.
Much later in the 10th century, an unknown astronomer created what could be the first line chart illustrating planetary movements.
As data became more available in the 1500s and 1600s, early maps and diagrams continued to evolve. The next phase of infographics began in the 1700s as these rudimentary collections of data evolved into reams of information about everything from geography to weather to economics portrayed by new graphic forms.
The stories that follow give us a window into the lives of key influencers and the power of crucial turning points in the history of infographics.
William Playfair is widely considered the inventor of most of the graphical forms of data visualization used today. He first created the line graph and bar chart, and next the pie chart and circle graph. As he began to develop more complex charts, Playfair created a chart that used two separate vertical scales to show taxes per capita in various nations arguing that the British were overtaxed.
As Playfair wrote, data should “speak to the eyes.” He believed that human eyes were “the best judge of proportion, being able to estimate it with more quickness and accuracy than any other of our organs.” Further, Playfair argued that a really good data visualization “produces form and shape to a number of separate ideas, which are otherwise abstract and unconnected.”
We think of Florence Nightingale as the founder of modern nursing, but she was first a brilliant statistician. Born in Florence, Tuscany, Nightingale took infographics to a commanding level when she created the polar area diagram to illustrate soldier deaths during the Crimean War of 1854-1855. During the Crimean war, more than 500,000 men lost their lives. Nightingale’s diagram illustrates both the dramatic rise of death and the disturbing causes of death during this brief six-month period.
As though to demonstrate how infographics changes people’s view of the world, Nightingale began training nurses to aid the injured soldiers she had found while researching this project in the Crimea. After the war, she went to England where she founded a nursing school at St. Thomas Hospital in London, making Nightingale the founder of modern nursing.
In mid-19th-century America, slave maps illustrated the areas where slavery was most rampant and the Union army could then focus its effort. The maps used census data to illustrate the number of slaves in each county in a Southern state.
On an early map of Virginia, one trend that immediately jumped out was that while eastern Virginia was a hot-bed of slavery, western Virginia was virtually slave-free illustrating a military strategy: pit western Virginia against eastern Virginia. This breakthrough map led to a larger map of the South that influenced how the government viewed the warring nation through an understanding of where Southerners would be most, and least, eager to fight the North.
Reading about the growth of the western U.S. in the 1800s is like reading a science fiction novel about an apocalyptic time. According to Schulten, infographic maps drawn by John Wesley Powell, a civil war hero who had lost an arm in the fighting and was now leading heroic expeditions in the remotest areas of the west, could have influenced how the West was populated and how state boundaries were drawn. But the nation did not listen.
Powell was certain that the rush to settle the West was a disaster in the making. He believed that all decisions about settlement and politics should flow from the West’s watersheds and was inspired to use maps to divide the West’s arid regions. In a time when railroads were in control of arable tracts of land, John Wesley Powell, a U.S. soldier, geologist, professor at Illinois Wesleyan University and director of major scientific and cultural institutions, presented revolutionary ideas.
These stories, maps and infographics illustrate how data visualization influenced wars, economic theory and the growth of the most powerful nation in the world. The next post in this series will feature modern-day infographics.
And, I thought that would be it – a three-part series, right? But when I researched this post, I found an astounding array of resources for the modern-day infographic designer. So, stay tuned for a final post on infographic design that will provide many, many resources for you!
This post was influenced by an article by Clive Thompson in Smithsonian Magazine, July 2016, “The Surprising History of the Infographic.” Additional sources include A Brief History of Data Visualization by Michael Friendly and “This 19th Century Map Could Have Transformed the West” by Susan Schulten.

Entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency movement may be wise to explore possibilities for making enormous ammonts of money with various types of internet marketing.There could be a rich reward for anyone daring enough to brave the cryptocurrency markets.Bitcoin design provides an informative example of how one might make a lot of money in the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin is an amazing intellectual and technical accomplishment, and it has created an avalanche of editorial coverage and venture capital investment opportunities. But not many people understand that and pass up on quite lucrative business models made accessible because of the growing use of blockchain technology.
It is certainly possible, but it must have the ability to comprehend opportunities no matter market conduct. The market moves in relation to cost BTC … So even if it’s in a BTC tendency down can make money by buying the altcoins which are altcoin oversold trading ratios-BTC. Sure, your purchasing power in DOLLARS may be lower, but as long as your purchasing power in BTC is still growing you’ll be acceptable.
You may run a search on the web. First learn, then models, indicators and most importantly practice looking at old charts and pick out trends. When you learn to keep a trading diary screenshots and your comment/forecast. Precisely what is the best way to get confident with charts IMHO. Oh certainly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that you acquire the uptrend will never drop! Always will go down! Viewers incremental increases are more reliable and profitable (most times)
Here is the trendiest thing about cryptocurrencies; they don’t physically exist anywhere, not even on a hard drive. When you examine a particular address for a wallet featuring a cryptocurrency, there is no digital information held in it, like in precisely the same manner a bank could hold dollars in a bank account. It is nothing more than a representation of value, but there is no actual tangible sort of that value. Cryptocurrency wallets may not be seized or frozen or audited by the banks and the law. They would not have spending limits and withdrawal restrictions imposed on them. No one but the owner of the crypto wallet can decide how their riches will be managed.
In case of the fully functioning cryptocurrency, it may possibly be exchanged as a thing. Advocates of cryptocurrencies say that kind of electronic cash isn’t manipulated by way of a key bank system and it is not therefore susceptible to the vagaries of its inflation. Since there are always a minimal quantity of products, this money’s price is dependant on market forces, enabling entrepreneurs to deal over cryptocurrency deals.
The beauty of the cryptocurrencies is the fact that scam was proved an impossibility: because of the character of the process in which it is transacted. All deals on a crypto-currency blockchain are irreversible. As soon as youare paid, you get paid. This isn’t something shortterm wherever your customers may challenge or demand a discounts, or use illegal sleight of hand. In-practice, many investors will be smart to utilize a transaction processor, due to the irreversible character of crypto-currency purchases, you must ensure that protection is hard. With any type of crypto-currency whether it be a bitcoin, ether, litecoin, or the numerous other altcoins, thieves and hackers could potentially access your individual tips and so take your cash. Sadly, you most likely can never obtain it back. It is quite crucial for you really to adopt some excellent safe and sound techniques when coping with any cryptocurrency. Doing this will guard you from many of these adverse functions.
For most users of cryptocurrencies it isn’t necessary to understand how the process operates in and of itself, but it is simply crucial that you understand that there’s a process of mining to create virtual money. Unlike currencies as we know them today where Authorities and banks can simply choose to print endless numbers (I am not saying they’re doing thus, only one point), cryptocurrencies to be operated by users using a mining program, which solves the sophisticated algorithms to release blocks of currencies that can enter into circulation.
The physical Internet backbone that carries information between the various nodes of the network is now the work of a number of companies called Internet service providers (ISPs), including companies that provide long-distance pipelines, sometimes at the international level, regional local conduit, which finally joins in homes and businesses. The physical connection to the Internet can only occur through any of these ISPs, players like amount 3, Cogent, and IBM AT&T. Each ISP operates its own network. Internet service providers Exchange IXPs, owned or private businesses, and sometimes by Governments, make for each of these networks to be interconnected or to move messages across the network. Many ISPs have arrangements with providers of physical Internet backbone providers to offer Internet service over their networks for last mile-consumers and companies who want to get Internet connectivity. Internet protocols, followed by everyone in the network makes it possible for the data to flow without interruption, in the correct area at the perfect time.
While none of these organizations possesses the Internet collectively these businesses decide how it works, and recognized rules and standards that everyone remains. Contracts and legal framework that underlies all that is happening to ascertain how things work and what happens if something bad happens. To get a domain name, for instance, one needs consent from a Registrar, which includes a contract with ICANN. To connect to the Internet, your ISP must be physical contracts with providers of Internet backbone services, and suppliers have contracts with IXPs from the Internet backbone to attach to and with her. Concern over security dilemmas? A working group is formed to work on the problem and the solution developed and deployed is in the interest of most parties. If the Internet is down, you have someone to call to get it mended. If the difficulty is from your ISP, they in turn have contracts in place and service level agreements, which regulate the manner in which these issues are worked out.
The benefit of cryptocurrency is that it uses blockchain technology. The network of nodes the make up the blockchain is not regulated by any centralized firm. No one can tell the miners to upgrade, speed up, slow down, stop or do anything. And that is something that as a committed promoter badge of honor, and is identical to the way the Internet operates. But as you comprehend now, public Internet governance, normalities and rules that regulate how it works current constitutional problems to an individual. Blockchain technology has none of that.
You’ve probably noticed this many times where you often spread the great word about crypto. It is not unstable? What goes on if the cost crashes? to date, many POS programs offers free transformation of fiat, improving some issue, but before the volatility cryptocurrencies is resolved, most people is likely to be reluctant to put on any. We must find a way to struggle the volatility that is inherent in cryptocurrencies.
A lot of people prefer to use a currency deflation, especially individuals who desire to save. Despite the criticism and skepticism, a cryptocurrency coin may be better suited for some uses than others. Financial seclusion, for example, is great for political activists, but more debatable as it pertains to political campaign financing. We need a secure cryptocurrency for use in commerce; in case you are living pay check to pay check, it would happen within your wealth, with the rest allowed for other currencies.
Ethereum is an unbelievable cryptocurrency platform, nevertheless, if growth is too fast, there may be some issues. If the platform is adopted quickly, Ethereum requests could grow drastically, and at a rate that surpasses the rate with which the miners can create new coins. Under a situation like this, the entire stage of Ethereum could become destabilized due to the raising costs of running distributed programs. In turn, this could dampen interest Ethereum stage and ether. Instability of demand for ether can result in an adverse change in the economical parameters of an Ethereum based company that may result in company being unable to continue to run or to discontinue operation.
Just a fraction of bitcoins issued so far can be found on the exchange markets. Bitcoin markets are competitive, which implies the price a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Many people hoard them for long term savings and investment. This restricts the variety of bitcoins that are truly circulating in the exchanges. In addition, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. Consequently, even the most diligent buyer could not buy all present bitcoins. This situation is not to imply that markets aren’t exposed to price exploitation, yet there is no requirement for substantial sums of money to transfer market prices up or down. The merest events on earth economy can affect the price of Bitcoin, This can make Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency explosive.
This mining action validates and records the trades across the whole network. So if you are attempting to do something prohibited, it is not a good idea because everything is recorded in the public register for the remainder of the world to see forever.
Bitcoin is the main cryptocurrency of the net: a digital money standard by which all other coins are compared to. Cryptocurrencies are distributed, global, and decentralized. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, there is no governments, banks, or some other regulatory agencies. As such, it’s more resistant to outrageous inflation and corrupt banks. The advantages of using cryptocurrencies as your method of transacting money online outweigh the security and privacy threats. Security and seclusion can easily be realized by just being smart, and following some basic guidelines. You wouldn’t set your entire bank ledger online for the word to see, but my nature, your cryptocurrency ledger is publicized. This can be fastened by removing any identity of ownership from your wallets and thus keeping you anonymous.
Cryptocurrency is freeing people to transact money and do business on their terms. Each user can send and receive payments in a similar way, but in addition they be a part of more elaborate smart contracts. Multiple signatures enable a transaction to be supported by the network, but where a particular number of a defined group of folks consent to sign the deal, blockchain technology makes this possible. This enables progressive dispute mediation services to be developed in the future. These services could enable a third party to approve or reject a transaction in the event of disagreement between the other parties without checking their money. Unlike cash and other payment systems, the blockchain consistently leaves public evidence that a transaction happened. This can be possibly used in a appeal against companies with deceptive practices.

"THINKING LIKE A LAWYER," THE IMPACT OF WORKING AT A MEDICAL MALPRACTICE LAW FIRM WHILE IN LAW SCHOOL
Stephen L. Snyder will be presenting Trial Technology at Maryland Association For Justice Membership Dinner
A study was done in 2004 that discovered that nearly 200,000 people died each year in the US due to preventable medical errors. This figure does not take into account those who were merely injured (either temporarily or permanent) due to medical errors. There is a more recent study that does take this into account reports that this figure may be more staggering than previously believed.
The new study concludes that only 14% of medical errors are even reported. One in 4 patients are injured in some way, and the injury or error is not reported. The fact that "no one is perfect" is little help to the families and loved ones of those injured and affected. It could also be seen as fact, that if these instances were reported, then hospitals and doctors could learn from their mistakes, and not repeat them in the future.
Our team ofmedical malpractice lawyers has compiled some tips on how to protect you from medical malpractice and error.
You spend the time shopping around for cars, or choosing a good restaurant based on reviews, so why not do the same for your health? HealthGrades.com rates hospitals based on hospital complication rates on 27 common procedures.
While you are in the hospital, make sure you keep a close eye on the hygiene and cleanliness of those you entrust the healthcare of yourself or your loved ones to. The simplest thing you can do is demand and ensure that the staff wash their hands. This simple procedure is only done 20-30% of the time.
Ask questions. Understand what is wrong with you, and what it will take to fix it. If your doctor seems annoyed or upset that you are showing such an interest, perhaps it is time to find a new doctor.
Pay attention to your prescriptions. Do not just rely on a pharmacist to interpret the prescription. Make sure you know what you are getting, and what dose you are supposed to take, and then make sure your bottle says exactly that.
Some patients may feel awkward in being so forward in their own care, but at The Snyder Litigation Team, our Baltimore medical malpractice lawyers urge you to consider that it is better to be pushy and forward than to be a victim of a medical mistake.
Injured due to medical malpractice or negligence? You deserve qualified counsel. Do not hesitate to contact our firm!

As the new year rolls in, no thanks to the Mayans, we wanted to remember all the great movies that went underseen in 2012 in the hopes that they might find a little love in their next life on DVD. Each of us picked a couple titles we think you might have missed. Do yourself a favor and seek them out now.
George’s pick: The Imposter. It’s hard to pick one, but The Imposter is a masterfully assembled documentary, with a story that takes so many unbelievable turns you will have to scrape your jaw off the floor.
Hope’s pick: Killer Joe. Wow, this was one wild, wrong-headed mess of a brilliant piece of filmmaking. Astonishing performances showcase a cast ready to do whatever is asked of them, and that is a lot. I will pass on that chicken dinner, thanks.

We work On micro dynamics & factors which ultimately influence voters mind deeply & turns them into potential voters for You by changing their perception value due to micro political perceptual process management by hitting political cues & triggers.We work on developing effective rather than good communication strategy which ultimately hits mass psychology and change their opinion about you and your rival party.We execute activities & Process in such a way by our strategic political re engineering which helps you develop a invincible political positioning during elections.More Beyond this,by penetrating further layers of strategies,we laid down such a series of political course of action which not only strengthen bonding between you and mass but also break the ice
Beyond these we just no merely covers macro factors but we covers every micro constituents involved in political environment and building block of political dynamics- most of the are intangible like we consider individual voters to mass population further segmenting them according age sex gender income,social & political interest basis,similarly we too consider Geography In same way i.e Sub Booth Level To state level to nation level. Also in same way we consider competition on candidate level to district level to state level to nation level and develop strategies for each candidate & their constituency becoz each constituency’s results is building blocks of your government after elections. …….. Many More …..
While Strategising Your Election Campaign,there are 2 parts to consider. First Is Tangible and which is easily available and all works on this i.e. voters data,candidates details,Your own strategies to promote Your self etc etc.
As we know that Indian political environment is most complex by nature and scientifically least studied and understood too, this is reason why big political parties and leaders loses elections frequently.Examples are past election Of India ,Delhi,Bihar where BJP make the clean sweep of all parties but loses in Delhi and Bihar.
Don’t Forget That Advancement In Your Political Career is a continuous & Long term process like carriers in any other field.Making you or your party as main stakeholder and most influential in Indian political environment is quiet tricky and strategic task.
As we know that Indian political environment is most complex by nature,political dynamics are unpredictable,voters behavior is ever changing and shifting. This is reason behind unpredictable results & rise and fall of different political parties in Indian elections.
“With Above explanations, it is clear that Strategic Political Management is futuristic and visionary task.One who can understand the competitive strategic political dynamics ( Cohesive & Adhesive Political Forces acting upon each others) and voters voting behavior ( What we calls it – Pulse Of Political Mgt.) can manage elections effectively and can turns results in own favor” !
India ! Platform for World Biggest Political Events. One Biggest, Most Complex Political environment.Ever Changing And Volatile Political Dynamics,Organic and ever changing Political Competition.Ever Surprising Political Results after elections. Never predictable Political Happenings.
Why Indian Political environment in context of elections is So volatile, why The Elections Events and their results are unpredictable and why the leading political strategist,research agencies,media, and even experienced party , Think Tanks Fail To Manage it effectively ?
De Facto,India’s Political environment is example of one of Most Complex and organic Political ecosystems in this world where several Political,Social,Economical,micro forces acts upon each others.More Interestingly major stakeholders in Indian Political Systems in Organic I.e. Human Being As Voters hence their responses towards political stimulus changes very fast—– perhaps reason which makes indian elections most uncertain to predict to manage and one of most complex and organic competition in world.
Secondly,Like western countries,India Political Competitions are multipolar where several political participate in election as competitors and influences their vote shares which affects greatly but the relative performance of Best Political Party Or Candidate.
Unfortunately,Indian elections are one of most prestigious events and question of life and death for many and this event is carrying an old history ——— But unfortunately It Is least Understood Subject,Least Studied Filed in scientific & professional way even being such an important factor for society.
This is reason like other streams of studies,management courses and knowledge, there is no availability of knowledge about systematic strategic management of Political elections,Political environment,its components,dynamics and forces acting upon each others which decides the end results.
This is the reason why Political excellence is not repeated In India Like excellence is repeated in other fields like in industry,education etc.
Questions Come That Can Political excellence can be repeated in all events like excellence is maintained in other filed if yes ….Then how to maintain excellence in all political events in such a situation when there is complete lack of Systematic informations,tools and techniques ?
Answer is yes ! If excellence and quality can be maintained in other field,same is possible for political fields too but ….. But if having and in depth scientific knowledge of Political ecosystems,it’s components,dynamics and cohesive and adhesive forces acting upon each other which decides the end results of Political elections In India.
The Consultants proudly announces that after a decades of micro Studies of Indian Political environment,events,Components and their nature and invisible forces acting upon each other to decide end results of elections- we have developed the scientific political management process for betterment of political performance during political competitions i.e. elections.
We developed This System As “Political Mix” after careful and scientific observations that how different components of Indian political ecosystems work and affects the voter decision making process to cast their votes.Political Mix is helpful to manage the uncertainty of dark continent of Political Management or say it is helpful to strategize your political movements for betterment based on micro understanding of Political Systems As whole.

As part of our Wealth Management services to clients, we are able to guide you where to invest monies if an ethical/socially responsible investment approach is something you would like to have considered for your portfolio and pension investments.
There has been a growing trend over the last few years for clients wishing to have all, or part of their money, with an ethical/socially responsible screen (positive or negative screening) applied to their investment management.
As part of the planning and investment suitability process we have an in-depth discussion concerning your investment views, taking into account your capacity for loss and risk aptitude to investing your money that will sit alongside your overall financial planning needs.
There is no particular right or wrong way to invest in terms of ethical/socially responsible investment versus other types of investments, you simply need to have peace of mind that you are happy with your investment choices and own philosophy around how your money is being used to gain suitable investment returns to meet your goals.
At King’s Court, we are able to provide an ethical/socially responsible screening process to help clients invest in styles of funds that meets their values. These funds are available for investment portfolios and pension contributions with the scope of funds available now being greatly improved as the ethical/social responsible investment sector has grown in popularity.
A new type of socially responsible investment has recently started to gain momentum, this being called Social Impact investing. There is significantly greater risk than mainstream ethical investment associated with this newer type of socially responsible investing, but if clients wish to have a very targeted and geographic influence on how their money is invested, which provides a direct ‘social impact’ e.g. helping local youth work or supporting homeless charities, for a proportion of their investment this may meet part of their investment ‘values’.
An attraction to social impact investing is that with some funds there is tax relief available for tax payers under the Government Treasuries ‘Social Impact Tax Relief’ (SITR) rules, where up to 30% of income tax and potential Capital Gains Tax Relief (CGT) deferral can be achieved using similar rules to Enterprise Investment Schemes (EIS).
Again, King’s Court can help you decide if this type of investment is suitable to your circumstances and you are willing to take the associated extra risks with part of your monies available for investment.

The LMU Business, Arts and Communication Program is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to not only discover new countries and to form lasting friendships, but also to have a great study abroad experience! Originally called New Europe Program it is LMU's longest-running study abroad program and is coordinated by the Akademie für Internationale Bildung (AIB) in Bonn, Germany. Students of all majors are eligible to participate because the program is designed to offer a wide range of LMU’s CORE courses and upper-division major requirements. This includes classes in theology, ethics, history, art and business.
For business students, the program offers three upper-division business courses that count towards the major or minor while obtaining a substantial part of the credits needed for graduation.
During the course of the program, all students gain a comprehensive introduction to European history and politics. Students learn how business, commerce and communications operates in the European Union. With nearly 500 million citizens the EU is one of the largest markets in the world! Courses in art and art history explore sustainability, culture and the environment.
The Business, Arts and Communication Program also puts an emphasis on engaged learning as a means of heightening the educational experience. Students are asked to work with community partners on vital projects. This can include participating in course-related site visits throughout Germany and Europe or setting up an exhibition or installation as the final project. It can also mean cooperating with local businesses or non-governmental organizations to develop ideas or campaigns together.
The Business, Arts and Communication Program gives students insight into how Europe functions and perceives itself, how its histories and nuanced cultures have defined it and a glimpse into its future. Such an invaluable learning experience is also an excellent springboard for entering the professional world after graduation.
Professors in this program have a passion for learning. They come from LMU and from universities and institutions throughout Europe. Courses are taught in English with a strong emphasis on global, political and cultural issues. All courses are recorded on LMU transcripts and count for academic credit. A German language and culture course is required to assist students in communicating effectively during their stay.
Offering the opportunity to experience firsthand how Europe is tackling crucial social, cultural, economic and environmental issues, students in the Business, Arts and Communication Program will explore topics such as changing demographics, climate change and declining natural resources. This leads to a deeper understanding of how Europe works to maintain a strong sense of national identity and cultural specificity within the individual nations while also functioning on the global stage as an integrated, multinational entity.
Located in Western Europe on the river Rhine and surrounded by many medieval castles and towns and beautiful landscapes,
Bonn has shaped itself into a global center for peace-keeping, and research on sustainable resources and renewable energies. Bonn as the German United Nations City holds regular conferences on key issues of the future. This creates an excellent international environment for scientists and research institutions to co-operate together. It also provides a vibrant and intense environment for its large student population.
The city’s cosmopolitan openness attracts an international cast of global businesses such as T-Mobile and DHL/Deutsche Post, which have their headquarters here. It is also home to the Deutsche Welle, the international radio and television broadcaster, which broadcasts across the planet.
As for art and culture, Bonn has a phenomenal Museum Mile, incorporating five state-of-the-art museums specializing in a broad variety of disciplines, ranging from German contemporary history to art, photographic history and zoology.
Experience this unique city – its ancient Roman sites, the house where Ludwig van Beethoven was born, and the majestic Rhine, located in the heart of Europe!
The Akademie für Internationale Bildung (AIB) is an independent, non-profit educational organization based in Bonn. LMU and the AIB have been partners in providing high-quality study abroad programs for undergraduate and business students for over 20 years. AIB manages all of the onsite logistical details of the program: matching students with host families, coordinating schedules and classroom spaces, planning and leading educational excursions, organizing cultural activities and extra-curricular programming, and offering advice and support during your stay. For more information on the AIB, including videos and photos, please click here.
Students may choose 3-4 courses in addition to the required German Language course. Students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units.
Principles of Marketing (MRKT 3510): The course will examine the key concepts and issues of Marketing and the role it plays in the life of an organization, which can be for profit or non-profit. What are these key issues? In fact, they are the fundamental substance of Marketing: What constitutes my market? Who is my customer? What does my customer think that he/she is buying? How many potential customers will there be for my product 10 years from now? Why are customers buying my competitor’s product? What is happening in the world socially, politically, or economically which may alter a consumer’s likelihood to buy my product? How can I most effectively communicate with my customers? What price should I charge for my product?
The major purpose of the course is to introduce the student to the management practice of marketing and its role in fulfilling an organization's mission and achieving its objectives in the marketplace. What is marketing? How does it apply? The course takes a managerial approach to the study of the concepts, activities, and decisions that are designed to facilitate exchanges between buyers and sellers and that are applicable to business and non-business organizations, as well as both products and services. You will learn the basics of the marketing management function, the environmental scan, the aspects of buyer behavior, marketing research, segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Finally and most importantly, you will learn the elements of the Marketing Mix: product, pricing, placement and promotion.
This course will examine the European Union (EU) broadly as an institution, as a policymaking body, and as a marketplace. The EU represents historically, a unique arrangement of societal organization. At the heart of it are (so far), 28 countries referred to as Member States and their over 500 million citizens. The unique feature of the EU is that, although all of the Member States are sovereign, independent states, they have collectively and democratically created some shared institutions and have delegated some of their decision-making powers to them. This allows decisions on specific matters of joint interest to be made democratically at the European level versus the national level. So, to gain strength and the benefits of greater mass, they have “pooled” some of their sovereignty.
The course will examine the features of this unique organization, analyze how political, economic, historical, social, and cultural factors have all been relevant to the shaping and functioning of today’s EU. A number of excursions will be included to visit and learn about various organizations and how they play a role as part of today’s EU. These will include the EU institutional bodies such as the EU Commission, the Committee of the Regions highlighting the cultural differences that exist, the European Central Bank, and some major companies. Finally, the course will address the current, critical EU issues of the day including the current economic problems, the Immigration issue facing the EU; and the ongoing Brexit negotiation on the United Kingdom’s decision to withdraw from the EU, the first such instance in EU history.
This course is relevant to students majoring in most Liberal Arts areas including Political Science, Economics, and History.
You don’t know the difference between „Guten Tag“ and „Gesundheit“? That’s fine. NO previous knowledge of German is necessary! During your study abroad experience in Bonn, all courses whether presented by LMU or German faculty are taught in English. You will find that you can easily get around in Germany, as most Germans speak English well enough to help you out in any situation. However, we want you to be more than a tourist. In our German Language and Culture class you will learn enough German to feel less like a tourist and more equipped to enjoy all aspects of everyday life in Bonn.
All students have the opportunity to experience German culture firsthand by living with a German host family. We believe these homestays to be the best way for students to immerse themselves into the new German cultural environment. Your host family will also be delighted to help you practice your German! The program fee includes accommodation, breakfast and dinner with the host family, and a public transportation pass for the Bonn region. The families who participate in the Business, Arts and Communication Program have a long history of welcoming students into their homes. Many students say that living with their host family was one of the highlights of the program.
Visits to multinational companies such as DHL, T-Mobile or Bayer are often part of the business students´ curriculum. Art and history students enjoy trips to the many superb museums in Bonn and Cologne. Together, we also go on day excursions, following the trails of the Romans in Cologne, discovering the royal relicts of Charlemagne in Aachen, and savoring the beautiful scenery of the romantic Rhine Valley on a boat cruise. Classical concerts, theater plays and sport events add to the program’s integrated approach to creating a truly exceptional study abroad experience. Note: Study trips are subject to change.
The LMU Business, Arts and Communication Program also includes two multi-day excursions during the semester.
Bruges, Brussels & Paris– Students enjoy a multi-day visit to the medieval city Bruges, to Brussels, the headquarter of the EU and to the romantic city of Paris, famous for its elegant shops and cafés, and its abundance of art galleries, museums and historical architecture.
This study tour gives students a greater understanding of the European Union and European integration as well as Parisian history and culture by exploring typical French landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower or the world famous Louvre Museum.
Berlin and Dresden– Students take a second multi-day excursion to Germany's capital Berlin and the romantic German city Dresden. In Berlin, students explore the modern excitement and remarkable history of this recently unified and reclaimed capital city.
Once the seat of two dictatorships and the frontier city of Cold War, Berlin offers a multitude of cultural and educational possibilities including the German Reichstag, the Jewish Museum and Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp Memorial.
Dresden, a beautiful city on the Elbe River, is rich in palaces, churches, museums and opera and concert halls. It was also part of the old East Germany so students will be able to contrast it with old West German cities such as Bonn and Cologne. In Dresden, we visit Volkswagen’s 'transparent' factory and enjoy a concert at one of the world’s finest opera houses, the Semperoper.
Madrid and Barcelona – Viva Espana! Students enjoy a multi-day excursion to the Spanish cities of Madrid and Barcelona, visiting historic sites in order to explore the variegated histories of Spanish history and art. Famous for its Prado and Reina Sofia museums as well as its professional soccer teams, Madrid is one of Europe's most important capitals. Barcelona is the heart of the Catalonia region, the birthplace of artists like Dalí, Gaudí and Picasso. As Spain's second largest city, Barcelona is also one of the world's leading cultural and design centers.
Berlin and Dresden – In the spring semester, Business, Arts and Communication students also get to visit Berlin and Dresden for their second multi-day excursion.

After long connection with ranching interests during which he met with sousing flat success, John Wesley Wiseman is now living retired in Portland, enjoying in well earned rest the fruits of his former toil. He was born in Andrew county, Missouri, In 1845, a son of John and Catherine (Von Doran) Wiseman, the former a native of Kentucky, while the latter came of German parentage. In an early day John Wiseman removed from Kentucky to Indiana and later to Missouri and in 1852, accompanied by his family, he crossed the plains with ox team and wagon, arriving in Oregon in the fall of that year. He located at Brownsville, where he took up a donation claim of six hundred and forty acres of rich prairie land and at once began the development and improvement of that place, upon which he spent a few years, transforming it into a highly cultivated farm on which he erected a residence and made all modern improvements. His remaining days were spent residing with his children.
John W. Wiseman was but seven years of age when the family crossed the plains and the mountains to become residents of the northwest. He was educated in the schools of Brownsville and at the age of fourteen years entered the employ of a farmer in that vicinity with whom he remained for three years. He saved his earnings during this period and then began buying and selling stock on his own account in a small way. He prospered in the undertaking and continued in the business for several years.
It was in 1871 that Mr. Wiseman was united in marriage to Miss Bettie Jane Barton, a daughter of Benjamin R. and Rebecca Jane (McClung) Barton, the former a native of North Carolina, while the latter was born in Ohio. Both were taken to Iowa by their respective parents in an early day. In 1853 they crossed the plains, arriving in Oregon in the fall of that year. They first settled in Lane county, in Camp Creek valley, where Mr. Barton engaged in agricultural pursuits and from there to Brownsville, Linn county, where he farmed a number of years. In later years he removed to Colfax, Washington, where he and his wife spent their remaining days.
It was in 1871, the year of his marriage, that Mr. Wiseman went into the Walla Walla country where he engaged in farming and stock raising until 1875. He then disposed of his interests there and took up his abode in Whitman county, Washington, where he secured a homestead and preemption claim. He also bought adjoining tracts of land from time to time as his financial resources increased until his holdings comprised more than twelve hundred acres of rich agricultural land which he greatly improved, bringing his fields under a high state of cultivation and gathering therefrom substantial harvests annually. Year by year he tilled the soil, producing large crops and he continued to reside on and operate this land for more than thirty-eight years, In the meantime, however, be sold a part of the land but he Still owns five hundred and twenty-five acres which is cultivated order his supervision, his son being fit charge of the property.
Mr. Wiseman has often been solicited to become a candidate for office but has usually refused.

Christmas is the best season. When we were kids, we loved to learn stories regarding how Santa Claus gives toys to those who are nice and give coal or stones to those people who are naughty. We believed a great deal in those stories when we were kids that we even pass this tradition on to our children.
It has been a typical tradition for kids to publish letters to Santa telling him how good these people were over the year and how deserving they are of receiving gifts. Children also write letters describing their perfect Christmas present from Santa Claus. It might seem so adorable for parents to read regarding their santaclausgreeting that sometimes they might head to distances simply to get them believe that Santa Claus will write back.
As a parent encouraging this tradition within their children, it would be disappointing to allow their children know that Santa Claus does not exist. To maintain this from ever happening, making up letters from Santa would be a good thing. Parents can write the letters themselves and pretend that they are Santa Claus. This process may be great but you will find lots of Santa Claus letters offered in stores and on the net.

Just about the most influential inventors in human history has been Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931). There are other than 1,000 patents in his name, a rare feat to be achieved by someone. His genius also helped the commercial utilization of his inventions. His contribution in this context is invaluable, as he is credited with initiating mass production of innovative products.
Edison was from the poor family. So were a number of other Inventhelp Inventor Service. This is the streak to perform something different, to create something totally new, that differentiates an inventor from an ordinary human being. It really is still debatable that whether inventors are born geniuses, or if people of average IQ be taught to become inventors.
Past experience has shown that it is not required to become a trained scientist or an expert to be an inventor. The two basic elements that enter in the making of your inventor are an inquisitive nature and logical thinking.
Up until the early years of the 20th century, Inventhelp Tv Commercial didn’t earn much money off their inventions. They often times invented useful things and died unsung heroes. However nowadays, with increasing give attention to new inventions and also the inclination of industry to customize them for commercial purposes, many inventors have turned from paupers to billionaires. New patent laws worldwide have ensured that an inventor’s future generation could still reap the benefits as royalties.
Millions of people accomplish this routine: After waking up, they get up and have a shower; they utilize an iron board to press out their work clothes; since the room is pretty warm, they turn on the ac unit to cool off; After using a hair brush to acquire ready for work, they go downstairs, open the refrigerator door to create some eggs. Chances are they work with an egg beater to help make some scrambled eggs. After breakfast, they leave for work after getting their cellular phone and make use of the key on the key chain to lock the rear door. So what does an iron board, air conditioning unit, hair brush, refrigerator, egg beater, mobile phone key chain and lock have in common? All those just mentioned products were created by African-Americans.
Since human civilization came into existence, there were innumerable inventions. The wheel is among the most important inventions that changed the fate of human civilization. Ironically, we still do bwmgut be aware of name of the individual or number of persons who invented it.
In earlier days, many inventions were caused by a procedure of evolution of ideas. As standardization of scientific methodologies started taking shape, many inventions and inventors emerged.
This article will focus on How To Pitch An Idea To A Company who made products which we used almost every single day. These inventors created some amazing products that a lot of people didn’t know, but sadly within the era of Jim Crow, they never received the credit or for instance reap inside the fortune they richly deserve. In certain case, these inventors came up with product and without providing a patent for their invention, told people with regards to their new creation. Since the product had not been patented, these people would go somewhere to steal… I mean…make their very own product, slap their name into it and gain instant fame. While doing research within this topic, it is truly amazing to find out that each inventor made their product with very primitive material, unlike the technology that people have in today’s world.
Warning: This is not a review of AF-S Nikkor 105mm f2.8G Micro VR instead this is just to share my experience using this lens on wildlife. I most of the time use this awesome lens (despite of its minor flaws) for portraits and macro shots of inanimate objects or toys (not the one you are thinking naughty you) so this is a departure from my regular usage of Nikon 105mm f2.8 VR and I won't be discussing any technical specifications or MTF charts on that matter 'cause I can assure you this lens is sharp (I did a few front and back focus testing of my own). Let's treat this as a simple field application of this lens and my “likes” and “dislikes” while I’m using it for wildlife. Take note that all photos are shot hand-held without the use of any tripod or monopods and I can say that it’s not “proper macro photography” the fact that I didn’t use any ring light or the Nikon R1C1 Macro lighting system. I just want to see for myself if it’s possible to shoot macro photography hand-held with the use of VR (vibration reduction in Nikon terms) or IS (Image Stabilization in canon terms) on just available lighting like other photographers claim.
Again this is not a technical review of this lens. If you're looking for good in-depth review there's a lot out there in the web. You might wanna check the links bellow:
My experience in portraiture for this lens is great either on controlled or uncontrolled situations I can’t find anything to complain about it just don’t forget to switch the focus limiter or else the focus barrel will focus from minimum to infinity. It gives you “bokeh” almost as good as the Nikon 85mm f1.8D if you know the right technique. You can check my daughter's photo for bokeh sample. This lens has a minimum aperture of 2.8 if use as short telephoto and might stop down (like floating aperture) of f3 to f4 on macro or its minimum focus distance. I also used this lens as a short telephoto on my Voyage de la Vie photo series and it never gave me any problem in focusing knowing that the theater is very dark. There is one concern though which is the focus breathing. The focus sometimes is hard to frame because of this. Looking at the viewfinder you can see the subject gets bigger or smaller making the focus barrel go in full turn which is quite annoying sometimes but not that big-a-deal if your patient (haha). All in all for portraiture and short tele this baby is a winner.
This is eyebrow raising challenge, shooting critters with this lens hand-held. This is my version of “Photography Myth Buster” I will prove to myself how true the claim of Nikon (on paper) and other Nikon 105mm VR owners that this lens is capable of macro/micro photography without the use of a tripod using only the Vibration Reduction system or VR for short. I know a lot will react (hope not violently) about this but you can judge for yourself. The blurred edges on some macro photos are not CA (Chromatic Aberrations) or Color Fringing it’s probably the cause of the wind or my finger clicking the shutter giving it a slight movement hence the blur. The lens might block available lighting so I shoot on high ISO (1000-1200) not bad for the Nikon D700. For the regular telephoto use It’s not that hard to manage unless your face to face with a wild boar thinking you’re some kind of threat to its pack and to its babies. This encounter is the most exciting part of my field test also good way to promote ecological awareness and another way to connect with mother nature.
Photo taken with Nikon D700 and AF-S Nikkor 105mm f2.8 Micro VR (VR on handheld) at Pulao Ubin Singapore Nature Reserve. This photo is originally in Raw format exported as Jpeg for web upload. This spider landed on my forearm and i just took a snapshot of it but it's really not that easy because this critter is moving all over my arm so i need to hold still at the same time catching up with it moving like crazy.

This wild boar just stop in front of me starring and approaching me. I good opportunity to shoot up-close good thing it doesn't have tusks (or else i'll be a bit intimidated) could be a female or a young boar. Then others saw me with boar they just go nuts and start taking photos not as discreetly as I did but noisy and aggressively made the boar run away.
A lot of positive reviews about this lens were published in the internet from web magazines, blogs and video blogs and all of them are saying that this lens can deliver exceptional photos when handled correctly. Sharpness, creamy bokeh and spot on focus accuracy are just few features expected from this pro-grade lens buts does it really deliver? Answer is "yes" based on my photo shoot specially the claim that VR works on macro photography. There are certain limitations that needs to consider like focus breathing and drop of f-stop on close focus distance. It's not a perfect lens buts it's excellent when used properly. People who says that VR is only good for low shutter speed doesn't really know what their talking about. They're forgetting that framing a subject (specially in macro) is very important you can see the difference of frame shake with VR on. It's more stable and less time consuming. This will be one of my favorite lens. Borrow one if you have doubts but I recommend you buying it 100%.
Really your post is very informative and I enjoyed your opinions. Wildlife Photography is one of the best ways to show to a broader public the values and the necessity of hunting and wildlife management. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Thanks Ritchie. I appreciate your comment. I will do more lens field testing in the future or I can say "Myth Busting". Cheers!!!

There are several factors that a court will consider in determining visitation. First, a court will consider the age of the child. It may be better for a younger child to remain with the primary caregiver while older children’s interests, desires and preferences could be relevant. A visitation attorney may be appointed to represent the interests of the children if the parents do not agree on what those are. A court will also consider the health and special needs of a child. It may be that the child’s special needs are met the best in a certain educational or geographical location. The court will examine each parent’s history of supporting the child, to include financial as well as actual physical and emotional care. Also relevant is the physical and emotional health of the parents themselves. These are just some of the factors that a court will consider.
As with other aspects of divorce, mediation is often a preferred alternative when determining child custody and visitation arrangements. When the parties determine their own custody and visitation scheme, they are often more satisfied with the arrangement then they would be if the court ordered the arrangement, and they will likely be more willing to comply. Custody and visitation mediation is also often faster and much less expensive than litigation. An experienced mediator will be able to guide the parents through all of the relevant questions and aspects of determining who should have physical custody and what visitation arrangements should be.
A mediator will examine with the parents a variety of issues. One important factor will be the child’s current educational setting and the impact of any changes on education if the child were to move to a new location. Parents should also consider education in light of a desire for joint custody. Joint physical custody situations ore often viable only in situations where the parents both live in the same school district for school age children. Another important aspect for many couples will be the religious education of the child and where and how religious needs can best be met. These are just a few of the factors that a mediator can assist you in examining to help determine what is in the best interests of your child or children.

Welcome to Functional Medicine Update for February 2004. In this issue, we will focus on a topic that will be covered at our upcoming 11th International Symposium on Functional Medicine in May—“The Coming Storm: Reversing the Rising Pandemic of Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome .” We will extend the discussion beyond diabetes to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. This month we will discuss estrogen hormones, natural management of estrogen imbalances, and interrelationships with the insulin signaling pathway, the peroxisome-proliferated activated receptors (PPARs), and some of their effects on the metabolism of progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone.
A recent paper illustrates the controversy brewing in the world regarding the best way to intervene with patients with complex, chronic age-related diseases. This article describes a presentation made by a senior researcher, a vice president at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), who talks about the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs for the management of chronic health conditions.[1] I believe everyone at the conference was surprised to hear this speaker state that most prescription medications do not work on most people who take them. Dr. Allen Roses, worldwide vice president of genetics at GSK, said, “Fewer than half of the patients prescribed some of the most expensive drugs actually derived any benefit from them.”
This is the first time that a mechanism has actually been ascribed to explain why this is the case, and it ties back to the area of pharmacogenomics—the unique differences from person to person and how they respond and metabolize specific substances. Dr. Roses was an academic geneticist at Duke University Medical School for many years before he joined GSK as a vice president. He further stated:
“Drugs for Alzheimer’s disease work in fewer than one in three patients, whereas those for cancer are only effective in a quarter of patients. Drugs for migraines, for osteoporosis, and arthritis work in about half the patients. Most drugs work in fewer than one in two patients, mainly because the recipients carry genes that interfere in some way with the medicine. The vast majority of drugs—more than 90 percent—only work in 30 or 50 percent of the people. I wouldn’t say that most drugs don’t work. I would say that most drugs work in 30 to 50 percent of people. Drugs out there on the market work, but they don’t work in everybody.”
Doctors often think when a drug is approved that it will influence all their patients in similar ways.
But, as pointed out in the article, “This goes against a marketing culture within the industry that has relied on selling as many drugs as possible to the widest number of patients.” This type of drug marketing led to a culture that sold one drug to lots of people, assuming that anyone with a particular diagnosis would get a specific kind of response. Now, with pharmacogenomics, we realize the response may vary greatly from one individual to another based on genetic uniqueness.
This discussion is also related to this month’s theme—the modification of hormonal balance in women as part of the endocrine web, the symphonic orchestration of the messenger molecules that control cellular/tissue/organ function. Recently, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists developed some medical guidelines for the clinical use of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in the modulation of these endocrine complexities.[2]
Published in Endocrine Practice, this paper is more than 50 pages long and contains 550 references. In this review of nutraceuticals in endocrine practice, the authors discuss alternative medicine and the definition of alternative care. They state that the problem with alternative medicine is often that the therapies are offered without explanation of mechanism.
The functional medicine approach to endocrine and metabolic disorders is discussed in Point 5 of the document:
“Physicians should remain abreast of not only advances in traditional medicine but also evolving alternative medical practices. Sorting through the seemingly endless lexicon that is articulated by alternative care practitioners is particularly challenging&ldots;. Nonetheless, analysis of alternative options may yield advantages. First, such studies can be informative and lead to ‘lateral thinking’ in innovative applications of proven therapies. Second, they can stimulate new ideas for the design of scientific medical research. Third, they can assist discussions with patients contemplating such therapies&ldots; One alternative practice that is gaining popularity is ‘functional medicine.’ This term is used by some healthcare practitioners to describe a clinical approach emphasizing (1) the physiologic and biochemical uniqueness of each patient; (2) the ability of laboratory tests to detect such uniqueness; and (3) the importance of minor symptoms to guide prevention of and therapy for suboptimal health, degenerative disease, and chronic illness. The over-arching teleologic principle is that individualized nutrition, based on a person’s unique genotype and phenotype, can produce a state of optimal health. ‘Functional foods’ are defined as foods that contain, in adequate concentrations, one or more substances that have a positive effect upon physiologic function. In functional medicine, complex theories involving the psychoimmune-neuroendocrine axis are blueprints for natural interventions. Data from scientific studies and non-scientific studies are applied to buttress an argument against polypharmacy with traditional medicines and to favor lifestyle changes and the use of a wide variety of dietary supplements/nutraceuticals. ‘Nutrigenomic’ and ‘nutriproteomic’ therapies are nutritional interventions directed at genomic and cellular mechanisms of disease. An example would be the genomic screening of children early in life, (perhaps in utero) for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms. A potential treatment would be to increase the dietary intake of folate or the neutraceutical 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This approach would theoretically then help prevent pediatric leukemia, which has been linked to altered folate metabolism.”
It is exciting to see that the functional medicine model is at least on the radar screen and described in clinical guidelines that appear in various forms, especially medicine. This month, we will discuss the specialty medicines of endocrinology and obstetrics/gynecology, and the role lifestyle, diet, and environment can play in those disciplines.
We are really measuring functional status. Many disorders, including fibrocystic disease of the breast, cervical dysplasia, uterine fibroids, preclinical polycystic ovary syndrome, perimenopause, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), would not be considered diseases as such, but rather conditions. We might call them functional physiological disturbances or endocrine imbalances. Our Clinician of the Month, Dr. Allan Warshowsky, will discuss a functional medicine model approach he has been using for the management of complex endocrine symptom clusters.We are really talking about how to measure functional status. A recent issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism, the journal of the American College of Rheumatology, contained a series of papers discussing measures of general adult functional status.[3],[4] It was interesting to see how many different ways there are to assess function, including psychological function, somatic function, physical function, cognitive and mental function, and physiologic function.
We are aware of the Short-Form Medical Outcome Survey questionnaire (SF-36). This questionnaire evaluates quality-of-life issues and various disabilities from a functional level and can be helpful in mapping back against psychological and physical dysfunctions that may be present prior to the onset of a cleanly defined disease that fits an ICD9 code. Well before that, there can be functional decrements.
The second review paper discusses adult general performance tests. This is a way of getting physical measurements in the office for evaluating functional status. These include the Berg Balance Scale for measuring equilibrium; the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI), Gait Velocity, Physical Performance Test (PPT), Timed Chair Stand Test, Timed Up and Go, and the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA). These are ways to evaluate, at a gross level, certain aspects of peripheral and central nervous system activity, the immune system, structural balance, and how those assays track against physiological and physical functioning.
These are tools for evaluating early-warning signs in patients who present with symptoms of differing severity, intensity, and duration that may be indicators of later-stage, more serious problems. For instance, patients who begin to lose smell and taste acuity are often at higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease. This may be an early warning functional assessment test to measure loss of taste and smell. When we begin to examine these markers, we are led to a different set of questions beyond just diagnosis. It relates to physical, physiologic, cognitive, and mental functioning.
Hormonal imbalances track early on in terms of changed symptoms in the absence of diagnosis. In perimenopause there is a significant change in hormone levels from period to period. Women do not simply suffer from low estrogen that results in flushing, night sweats, cognitive and sleep disturbances, depression, and dysphoria. Estrogen levels change rapidly in perimenopause, from very high to very low, and the metabolism of the intermediaries may trigger many of the symptoms associated with menopause. There can be an imbalance of one form of an androgen/estrogen to another form, and a progesterone insufficiency relative to estrogen excess in the moment.
These are the kinds of things that create the whipsaw effect on physiology seen as functional changes in outcome that questionnaires like those I just described can pick up, well before there is a clean diagnosis. In fact, we should not view menopause as a disease. It is a condition, a normal transition that most women go through in their fifth decade of life. It is the severity of the experience that is the real concern, the symptoms and signs that result as a consequence of altering hormone values and how they influence physiological, cognitive, mental, and physical functioning.An article in Nutrition Today is titled “Managing Menopause Naturally?”
[5] The answer to that question is yes; it has been done throughout much of human history. When exogenous hormone replacement was not available, women had to manage menopause naturally. The real question is whether we can improve the transition with supplements like black cohosh, soy isoflavones, cruciferous vegetable glucosinolate concentrates, or various other types of adrenal adaptogenic substances like licorice. Do these substances influence the transition into menopause? Can they affect the symptoms that women experience, such as night sweats and flushing?
Alternative Medicine Review contained a paper titled “Hot Flashes—A Review of the Literature on Alternative and Complementary Treatment Approaches.”
[6] The author discusses various medications that have traditionally been used in attempting to modify hot flushes and night sweats and compares them to natural interventions. Some natural interventions use selective estrogen response modulators in the form of isoflavones or lignans. Others may remove gut dysbiosis and improve digestive function.
You might consider that the human body operates like a machine. The “operator” uses feet on two pedals simultaneously—the accelerator and the brake—to balance out cellular function. The balance metabolism of estradiol through the 2-hydroxy pathway becomes an important part of modulating function.
The cruciferous vegetables, rich in glucosinolates, help increase 2-hydroxylation. The catecholmethyltransferase enzyme transfers a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to the 2-hydroxyestradiol to produce 2-methoxyestradiol and 2-methoxyestrone. These estrogen-braking substances, which are anti-mitotic—anti-cellular proliferative—tend to calm down the estrogen message of estradiol which is cellular proliferative and increases mitotic activity. We see the relationship of diet to function playing out in terms of signs and symptoms that the patient experiences.
Women do not all respond identically to these interventions. In the same way that they respond differently to medications, people respond differently to diet and lifestyle interventions. We are biochemically unique. There are 2 to 3 million different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in our genome of 30,000 to 35,000 genes, and they code for many different variations on a theme. Estrogen can modulate xanthine oxidase activity, but it does so by an estrogen-receptor-independent mechanism. You might have relationships between estrogen and estrogen metabolism on vastly different physiological functions unique to the individual, such as in purine metabolism, xanthine oxidase, or oxidative stress.
When the enzyme xanthine oxidase is upregulated, it produces superoxide. Superoxide in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) can react very rapidly chemically to produce peroxynitrite in the body. Peroxynitrite is a powerful irritating, nitrosylating reagent that injures proteins, resulting in altered protein function.
An immune-upregulated proinflammatory state, coupled with altered estrogen metabolism, can produce an outcome of oxidative injury. These are weblike effects; they do not work in isolation. A symptom is not the result of one factor alone; it results from the weaving together of a variety of factors.
Xanthine oxidase activity and its interrelationship with postmenopausal inflammation are discussed in the journal Antioxidants & Redox Signaling.
[7] The authors explain that when estrogen declines, the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase activity increases, and xanthine oxidase produces more superoxide. This may be another component of postmenopausal lowering of estrogen, increasing the incidence of inflammatory conditions and oxidative stress in women. It might also tie together with a variety of oxidative-related and inflammatory-related disorders such as arthritis or heart disease in postmenopausal women.
These relationships are individualized to a woman’s own genetic uniqueness. Her response to drugs is modified by her genetic uniqueness; so is her response to her environment, lifestyle, and diet. This topic is discussed in a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, titled “Association between Estrogen Receptora Gene Variation and Cardiovascular Disease.”[8] In this article, the authors explain that certain types of polymorphisms of the estrogen receptor have a much higher statistical correlation with cardiovascular disease, and that estrogen receptor variation has the potential to explain recent conflicting data regarding the effects of hormone therapy on cardiovascular disease susceptibility in women.
Some women may carry SNPs of the estrogen receptora sensitivity. On hormone replacement therapy, these women may have a lowered risk to cardiovascular disease, whereas other women may have an elevated risk, depending on how that polymorphism receptor responds to the environment, i.e., the hormone.
Again, individualization, customization, and personalization indicate where we are going. In fact, that was the subject of an editorial that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine. That article on hormone therapy discussed customized approaches to women, individualized therapy, not just one-size-fits-all; consider what the body mass of the person is, give a dose responsive to that body mass, and look at individual needs.[9]
The effect of many nutritional agents is to modify estrogen metabolism as agonists/antagonists. It is an adaptogenic effect: the highs go down and lows come up. An agonist effect is when low goes to high; an antagonist effect is when high goes to low. It tends to normalize around a setpoint. This is what has traditionally been called an adaptogen. Soy isoflavones have this effect, serving as agonists/antagonists of estrogen metabolism, or adaptogens of estrogen response.
The author of a recent paper in Medical Hypotheses points out that estrogen agonists and antagonists like soy isoflavones may downregulate growth hormone signaling and therefore have an influence on a variety of effects, including insulin sensitivity through IGF-1 and IGF-1 binding protein, and they may impact lipoprotein(a), which may explain how estrogen can modulate cardiovascular risk and insulin sensitivity.[10]
It is a web. The endocrine system contains an interconnected series of signals that create specificity of outcome as function in cells and tissue. This concept of functionality is more than idle banter. It contributes to our understanding of how to manage patients with complex, chronic health problems related to the imbalance of these chemical messengers or signaling substances, such as the sex steroid hormones.
What relation does this discussion have to breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy (HRT)? We recently discussed the results of the Million Women Study. This is the largest study ever done looking at the effect of HRT on breast cancer incidence. It indicated there was a statistically significant and meaningful increase in breast cancer risk and incidence regardless of the type of estrogen used, whether it was estradiol or mixed equine conjugated estrogens.
All forms of estrogen, if unbalanced in delivery and metabolism, may pose a risk when administered exogenously. Even endogenous estrogen, if it is not properly metabolized and excreted, may pose a risk. That is why two years ago, the Institute of Medicine suggested that estrogen is a carcinogen.
It is unusual to think that a natural substance in the body could be a carcinogen, but estrogen or its metabolites, if they are out of balance, inappropriately metabolized, or elevated could, in fact, pose a carcinogenic risk. The Million Women Study appeared to indicate that.[11]
It is also important to remember that estrogen can be manufactured in tissues outside the ovaries. Breast and adipocyte cells, for example, particularly visceral adipose tissue, will manufacture estrogen. This estrogen can be converted into estrogen metabolites like the 4-hydroxyestrogens, which are the catecholestrogens that Dr. Rogan and others have discussed with us; they can be very caustic and cause injury in DNA adducts that pose carcinogenic risk.
The breast itself can generate estrogen. There is the isoform of cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the breast that can convert estrogen directly into the 4-hydroxyestrogens—CYP 1B1. Recent papers on polymorphisms of CYP 1B1 and their relationship to postmenopausal breast cancer risk have indicated a strong correlation between CYP 1B1 gene polymorphisms and estrogen metabolism. There is no strong influence of risk to breast cancer, however, because other modifying factors may affect the way that plays out in the phenotype.
[12] In other words, you may have a CYP 1B1 polymorphism, but secondary factors of how those catecholestrogens are metabolized by methoxylation or by glutathione conjugation may render these potential 3,4-quinone estrogens detoxified before they have an injurious effect on DNA.
It is not just a single point gene mutation or a single SNP that creates an outcome in a phenotype called breast cancer. It is a pattern of genetic uniqueness coupled with environmental exposures and dietary selections that ultimately gives rise to the outcome.
When we talk about a functional medicine approach to endocrinological outcome, we take into account this web of interacting variables and look at the way hormones influence insulin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and lipoprotein synthesis such as apolipoprotein A1 or B1. All of these are part of the web of understanding how the individual woman responds to her environment.
The conversion of the hydroxylated estrogens such as 4-hydroxyestradiol into the nontoxic byproducts involves methylation. Methylation is performed by catechol-O-methyltransferase. It requires the presence of a methyl donor called S-adenosylmethionine or SAM. SAM comes from proper activity of the folate cycle. Polymorphisms in the folate cycle may impair the ability of the body to produce proper levels of SAM at the necessary site. These are polymorphisms like the MTHFR 677C® T polymorphism, which we discussed in earlier issues of FMU.
A relationship between a polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene and folate and riboflavin status as it tracks into homocysteine can affect the methylation of homocysteine ultimately through that cycle to produce SAM. A paper published in the Journal of Nutrition discussed that combined marginal folate and riboflavin (vitamin B2) status affects homocysteine methylation in people who have the homozygous MTHFR 677C® T mutation.[13]
Having that polymorphism means being unable to handle lower levels of riboflavin and folate as well as a person who does not have that SNP. Therefore, methylation is impaired, increasing homocysteine and decreasing methyl hormone levels, and that can have a different dynamic on the web related to risk.
In a study by Dr. Lynn Bailey, titled “Folate, Methyl-Related Nutrients, Alcohol, and the MTHFR 677C® T Polymorphism Affect Cancer Risk: Intake Recommendations,” the author explains that alcohol causes increased turnover and loss of the B vitamins, including riboflavin, pyridoxine, and folate.[14] A MTHFR 677C® T polymorphism makes one more folate-dependent. Increased alcohol consumption lowers folate status and sufficiency of the folate cycle. It lowers SAM levels and influences relative cancer risk when an individual is exposed to the same level of carcinogens that would not pose a risk for someone who has proper folate chemistry.
We cannot say that a single exposure to a carcinogen is the risk. Nor can we say that consumption of a single drink of alcohol is a risk. We cannot say a single dietary insufficiency of B6, B12, folate, and B2 is a risk. Nor can we say that, in isolation, a MTHFR polymorphism is a risk. But when all of these occur together—frequent consumption of alcohol, poor diet, high stress, a MTHFR polymorphism, exposure to environmental xenoestrogens that increase hydroxylation to the 4 family, or perhaps taking mixed conjugated equine estrogens—they may paint a picture of higher risk.
Individuals respond differently to dietary isoflavones based on their individual metabolism. These would be things like the soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein. When a person responds to these isoflavones, the response has principally been found through estrogen receptor b rather than estrogen receptor a . This is interesting because estrogen receptor b is present in higher amounts in osteoclastic and osteoblastic cells in bone, as contrasted to estrogen receptor a , which is very high, for instance, in the ovary and the breast.
If you preferentially activate or modulate response of estrogen receptor b, it is reasonable that the result would be a significant effect on bone dynamics. This would be like the SERM raloxifene, to use an analogy from the pharmaceutical industry, in which a substance is working more in bone than in breast.
A review paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition looked at dietary phytoestrogens and their effects on bone.[16] The authors did a meta-analysis of 24 different studies—17 in vitro studies of cultured bone cells, 24 in vivo studies of animal models for postmenopausal osteoporosis, 15 human observational/epidemiologic studies, and 17 dietary intervention studies. They looked at the role of isoflavones on bone dynamics, bone cell physiology, or on bone loss in women.
Their collective data suggest that diets rich in soy isoflavones have bone-sparing effects in the long term. Current evidence suggests that, when coupled with weight-bearing exercise as simple as a regular walking program, isoflavones may have beneficial effects on retention of bone and prevention of fracture risk similar to those of the SERMs, possibly without some of the risks of adverse side effects from the synthetic molecules.
Some people believe HRT of some type is necessary because one cannot get all the benefits from a natural approach that can be derived from artificial hormone replacement. The evolving story appears to contradict that belief for most women. If a woman exercises, has lower stress, eats a high-quality diet, makes sure she’s getting adequate levels of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K, and adequate levels of the isoflavones that modulate estrogen receptivity, activity, and metabolism, the outcome can be positive.
Vitamin K, vitamin D, methylation, calcium, and soy isoflavones all frame a pattern of intervention. It is not a single agent, but a complex intervention using diet and lifestyle that is consistent with what women traditionally did in cultures that did not have access to these pharmaceuticals. Once they got through the age of infectious diseases and childbearing, their transition to menopause in older age was quite good.
A series of effects can occur as a consequence of hormone imbalances. One of those conditions is fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia might be seen as a complex condition that results from an imbalance in the neuro/endocrine/immune system. A recent article in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism discussed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).[17] If one looks at the questionnaire used to evaluate fibromyalgia, with trigger points, tender points, and certain disabilities, one can see they tie back to what appear to be immunological and neuroendocrine imbalances.
Fibromyalgia may be a heterogeneous disorder, not a single disease, with different variegated forms that lead to myalgic pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, and immunological suppression.[18] We should probably concern ourselves with individualized therapy for fibromyalgia patients, rather than assume one size fits all.
Dietary modification plays a role in modulating the signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia. A paper in Complementary Health Practice Review discusses dietary modification of fibromyalgia.[19] This dietary modification consists of getting rid of dietary excitotoxins such as monosodium glutamate, lowering inflammatory potential and improving redox potential by lowering oxidative stress, improving bowel flora, and lowering some of the central nervous system immunological activation through the microglia.
What Dr. Alan Logan recommends for dietary modification of fibromyalgia is the exact approach we have been discussing from our research over the last ten plus years. Dr. Scott Rigden has achieved remarkable results in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia patients with a hepatic resuscitation program to improve GI and hepatic detoxification. He normalizes oxidative stress by using balanced levels of redox-active substances such as lipoic acid, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and N-acetylcarnitine, and rebuilds membranes using essential fatty acids of the omega 3 family.
Lipid Replacement as an Adjunct to Therapy for Chronic Fatigue, Anti-Aging and Restoration of Mitochondrial Function
Some work has recently been done on the use of omega 3 fatty acids as an adjunct to therapy for both CFS and fibromyalgia. A paper appeared in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association, written by Dr. Garth Nicolson of the Singer/Nicholson team who developed the fluid mosaic model of the lipid bilayer of membranes.[20] This model is now viewed around the world as the “plum pudding model” of cellular membranes, in which the proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer transport substances across the membranes selectively.
Dr. Nicolson talks about lipid replacement using omega 3 fatty acids as an adjunct to therapy in CFS and fibromyalgia to help build back mitochondrial cellular and cytoplasmic membranes. That would generally be done after reducing oxidative stress. Intervention would begin with a detoxification program, go on to antioxidant therapies or redox mitochondrial resuscitation programs and last, rebuild membranes with essential fatty acid supplementation.
High levels of omega 3 fatty acids should not be given to people who are in extraordinary oxidative stress because they can be peroxidized and undergo “biological rancidity.” That stage of the therapy would begin after minimizing the oxidative stress.
A review paper in Medical Hypothesis discusses management of fibromyalgia and CFS. It examines the metabolic basis for fibromyalgia based upon the model of neuroendocrineimmune balance.[21]
That will take us into our discussion with our Clinician of the Month. We will look at women with endocrine disturbances and obstetrical/ gynecological problems from a holistic functional medicine perspective.
JB: It’s time for our Clinician of the Month. For the past several months we have been following the theme of hormone metabolism and balance, with particular emphasis on estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. Today we follow up on those research discussions with some “news to use” from an obstetrician/gynecologist who is at the forefront of this field, dealing with these problems in his patients on a daily basis—Dr. Allan Warshowsky.
Dr. Warshowsky is a graduate of Downstate Medical Center at the State University of New York and has worked extensively in obstetrics and gynecology for more than 30 years. For the past decade, he has focused on integrative medicine, managing complex patient problems in the area of women’s health. There is no more interesting time to collaborate and work in this area. The Women’s Health Initiative Study and new data have changed the thinking on the issue of hormone replacement therapy.
With great enthusiasm I welcome Dr. Warshowsky to Functional Medicine Update. He plays a role in managing women’s health issues both in his private practice and as Director of the Women’s Program at Beth Israel’s Continuum Center in New York City. Welcome to FMU, Dr. Warshowsky.
AW: Thanks very much, Jeff. It’s a pleasure to be on FMU and to have an opportunity to talk about some of the things I’ve been doing over the last 10 years. It’s been an interesting decade in terms of women’s health from the perspective of hormone replacement, hormone balance, and a lot of new information on the catecholestrogens. Listening to FMU for the past several years, we have heard about a lot of new information, a lot of controversy, and a lot of new questions on these issues. It seems that every time we learn something, it opens up an entirely new avenue of exploration.
I’ve been working with a holistic or integrative approach to women’s health for 15 to 20 years, perhaps even longer. When I started in medicine, I was dealing with issues of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which wasn’t regarded as a true clinical entity, but I found that women were really suffering. Back in the mid 1970s, I found that when I supplemented these women with a few vitamins, worked with them to clean up their diet, and actually listened to them (giving a mind/body therapeutic effect), they started to improve.
Soon after that, I found that women were not dealing well with the “one size fits all” therapy of menopause, using Provera and Premarin. There were many negative side effects related to Premarin, and I found that by using bioidentical hormones, those identical to what the human ovary was producing, and individualizing care, I got better results, fewer negative effects, and better therapeutic effects on alleviation of symptoms.
In continuing to develop and evaluate my own therapeutic programs, I started dealing with issues of hormone imbalance in the reproductive years. Fibroid tumors of the uterus were a major issue. I was concerned about unnecessary hysterectomies and other unnecessary surgeries. Doing a lot of surgery myself at that time, I noticed that normal-size uteruses were being removed for conditions such as bleeding. I knew at that time that if I was doing a more integrative or functional approach, I could alleviate those symptoms and the need for surgery was certainly diminished.
I put together programs from an integrative or functional approach that would alleviate a lot of the symptoms. I found I could no longer just deal with a uterus or an ovary in terms of helping to alleviate some of the common symptoms and conditions associated with fibroids, PMS, or polycystic ovaries. I started looking at some of the other issues, such as gastrointestinal (GI) problems like detoxification, inflammation, and sugar dysregulation. Certainly, the hormonal imbalances involved more than estrogen and progesterone. They also involved adrenal and thyroid hormones and the hypothalamus-pituitary axis (HPA).
Issues such as emotional states were also important, because they seemed to affect hormone imbalance and, in looking at the limbic system, which affects the HPA, we can see an emotional component that would affect hormonal balance. Instead of simply looking at estrogens or progesterone, and conditions associated with the uterus and ovaries, my focus became one involving the total body, looking at GI dysbiosis states or permeability problems, yeast and bacterial overgrowth and parasites.
All of these seemed to be affecting how hormones were balanced or imbalanced. Liver detoxification and other detoxification systems in the body also came into play. If the GI tract was not functioning adequately, the body’s detoxification capabilities carried an additional burden, and that led to an imbalance of hormones. It wasn’t just giving hormones, or working with hormones in a replacement sense; it was working with detoxification and GI issues before we could affect a hormone imbalance.
Then we started looking at sugar dysregulation and insulin levels. We found, certainly in the case of polycystic ovary conditions, a major piece is related to sugar dysregulation and insulin resistance. (I’m now finding this in other conditions of hormone imbalance as well, such as fibroid tumors or functional ovarian cysts.) In turn, that will affect estrogen/progesterone balance and, more importantly, inflammation in the body.
From this viewpoint, I moved on to look at inflammatory states, because we know that increased insulin levels, sugar dysregulation, and deposition of adipose tissue in the body are going to increase inflammatory messenger molecules that will also have a major impact on hormone balance.
From an initial approach of just looking at what’s going on in the pelvis, as a traditional obstetrician/gynecologist is trained, my approach now encompasses the entire body. That includes the emotional state of the patient, and trying to put the whole body back into balance rather than just trying to work on a small piece of it, without acknowledging all the other issues that come into play.
JB: That is a very impressive program. Obviously, it deals with the patient as a unique individual, rather than hammering her into some diagnostic criterion and then treating her as if she were a diagnosis. I imagine that also increases the complexity of your life, both from a professional perspective and in the way you integrate these things, including the business perspective.
It takes time to ask the right questions and engage in proper communication. How have you gone from that highly mechanized setting of the traditional approach built on efficiency, to this model built around relationships and understanding?
AW: I’m glad you asked that question. I decided about four years ago that I was going to stop doing obstetrics because I couldn’t devote the amount of time necessary for a good obstetrical practice in addition to doing this kind of integrative or holistic approach to health care.
Before that, I had been doing both. I had been setting aside a couple of days a week just to see integrative medicine patients, and to devote the amount of time necessary. A new patient would require an hour to an hour and a half. Revisits would be 30 to 45 minutes, so I would devote two days a week just for these kinds of patients, but I found that with my obstetrical practice, I’d be canceling my hours frequently because I’d be up all night.
Four years ago, I stopped doing obstetrics and devoted myself to this kind of approach to health care. At the same time, I also stopped taking all managed care. I took myself out of that loop completely, where I was dependent on reimbursements through insurance companies, and I became a fee-for-service practitioner. I found it made no difference for the patients who needed this kind of approach. They had already been to half a dozen or more physicians with their chronic complaints. There is no good ICD9 code for these chronic conditions, and there really aren’t good treatments for them. Medical treatments just deal with symptoms, and surgical treatments simply remove the tip of the iceberg, the piece of the problem that we can see.
None of this gets to the “why” of the problem. I see several conditions that stand out as the “why” of the problem—inflammatory imbalances, what we call the Th1/Th2 imbalances; immunological issues; hormone imbalance; GI detoxification issues; and certainly, sugar dysregulation issues. The conventional approach wasn’t looking at any of the “whys.” To look at the “whys,” you need the time; especially in Manhattan, you need to be able to pay your bills and monthly overhead charges.
Getting out of managed care was very helpful. I have found over the last few years that I don’t need to do surgery any longer. Most of the surgical procedures I was doing are no longer necessary because of this particular approach. For the cases that do need surgery, there’s always somebody around that would be happy to do it. The patients then come back to see me because they still want this kind of care for their chronic issues.
That was the direction I decided to take, and I’ve been very happy with it. I’ve changed my identity. At this stage in my life (I’ve been in practice over 25 years), I never thought I would move completely to another field of medicine. It has been very fruitful and satisfying, however, because patients with these chronic conditions, for whom there is no good conventional therapy, are getting better. When I ask myself, what have I done? I’ve given up my identity. I loved doing obstetrics; I delivered three of my five children. I enjoyed doing surgery. What have I done?
Then a woman will come in and thank me because after having gone to half a dozen doctors over the last half dozen years with no improvement, and after being on my program for three months, her menstruation has been normalized. Her energy level is better; her mood is better, and her husband wants to thank me. These kinds of comments, which I get on a regular basis, keep me going and show me not only the efficacy but also the utility of this kind of approach. It seems phenomenal to me; it amazes me all the time.
JB: In my very busy travel schedule, I frequently get to the New York City area. I can testify as to how many people have been your patients. Through interesting and sometimes second-level connections, your name comes up in conversation and I’ll hear that “Dr. Warshowsky is a savior,” that they’ve never been treated as they are in your program. They say, “It’s an amazing form of medicine,” and “Every doctor should be like that.” Obviously, your reputation precedes you. You are making a big difference.
AW: Thanks, Jeff; I appreciate that. When I hear things like that, especially from patients, it keeps me going. I know I’m on the right track. When I see a patient who has really severe fibroids, for example (I can think of two or three patients who have actually come in from the hospital after having blood transfusions for their fibroids), I put them on a program which certainly includes evaluation of the GI tract.
I find that more than 90 percent of the time, the GI tract is full of bacterial imbalance, yeast overgrowth, and very often parasites that haven’t been picked up. Doing a gut restoration program and supporting liver detoxification, dealing with sugar dysregulation issues and the inflammatory states, and putting them on a simple program to begin dealing with stress reduction and a nutritionally-rich program, within three weeks, most of these people start to feel better.
When I deal with bleeding issues, I do a lot of herbal therapies and other antiinflammatory therapies. I would say that within three to four weeks, 80 to 90 percent of these people are incredibly improved in terms of their energy, their state of well being, resolution of their sleep issues, and clearing up of their skin problems.
They are extremely thankful. If I follow them over a couple of months, their menses lighten up and the pressure and pain symptoms all seem to subside. For the first time in years, they feel they can get out of their houses during their menstrual periods. They don’t have to be confined to the bathroom because they’re hemorrhaging so badly. These are real issues.
A majority of women who come to me with fibroids are already scheduled for surgery. They come to me for a third opinion. Two or three gynecologists may have already recommended total hysterectomies or other invasive surgical procedures as the only way to deal with their issues.
I would say that 80 percent or more of them never have surgery. Their conditions and symptoms seem to clear up to the point where they don’t need surgery; they’re extremely happy; they’re functioning in society again; they’re able to do their work. It’s extremely gratifying. It takes time, but the results are well worthwhile.
JB: Your book, Healing Fibroids: A Doctor’s Guide to A Natural Cure, a Simon & Schuster publication, is an excellent overview. In the book, you describe what you do and why you do it in a way that’s very understandable.
AW: I wanted to get it out to the public. As you probably know, almost 300,000 hysterectomies are done every year in this country for fibroids. I would say the vast majority of them are unnecessary. We could deal with the issue of fibroids from a functional approach. Even the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, in its recent Practice Management Bulletin, has said that fibroids as benign tumors do not need to be removed surgically unless symptoms necessitate it.
If we could deal with symptoms, it leaves a lot of time to work with the issues that are causing the fibroids to grow. Elizabeth Stewart at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston has been doing a lot of work on growth factors found in fibroid tumors and how they are influenced by inflammatory states.
I have found that more than 90 percent of women with fibroids have some kind of intestinal inflammation issues. Consider that the intestines are lying on the fibroids right in the pelvic area where estrogens are being produced. (Estrogen is a growth hormone.) There are inflammatory messenger molecules stimulating cellular change within the myometrium of the uterus and the estrogens are causing the fibroids to grow, so inflammatory issues in the gut need to be cleared up.
It’s almost a no-brainer to me. These are the issues that need to be cleared up. I use the 4R Program, and thank you so much for it. Patients are thrilled with it. For the first time in years, they don’t have bloating and other digestive problems associated with their irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. Clearing up these things and then working on the symptoms of the fibroids themselves are extremely beneficial. Fibroids stop growing and start shrinking.
Similarly, other conditions of hormone imbalance improve. Polycystic ovary conditions seem to be in the medical news more and more recently because of the connection with insulin. If you can use PPAR agonists and PPAR modulators and diminish insulin resistance, reduce insulin levels, and increase sugar utilization, a lot of these inflammatory issues also seem to clear up. You can clear up polycystic ovary conditions and all the problems associated with it, whether it’s cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or other chronic conditions of aging that now seem to be associated with inflammatory states. If you can clear up sugar dysregulation issues, you can reduce the incidence of many of the diseases of aging. It’s not just gynecological issues; it’s not just reducing surgical procedures in terms of fibroids.
What I’m now doing is dealing with all the conditions of aging, from dementias to arthritides to cancer to cardiovascular disease to diabetes, which you’ve called a pandemic. They all seem to be connected with the major issues that I mentioned. When I see a patient with “hormone imbalance” represented by fibroids, functional cysts, fibrocystic breast problems, or even cervical dysplasia, that to me is just the tip of the iceberg.
Consider the other conditions, the “why” conditions, why is this happening? Those are the basic conditions—inflammation, immunological conditions, hormone imbalance, sugar dysregulation, GI and detox issues. They need to be cleared up first so that you can reduce the risks of the diseases of aging in later life.
That’s what I’ve gotten out of this approach and the journey that I’ve been on. I have moved from the traditional gynecology medical school curriculum—basically fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, and vagina—to a total body approach and, ultimately, to increase the optimal health of the individual and reduce the degenerative aging process at the same time.
JB: For listeners who may not be familiar with the 4R acronym, those Rs stand for Remove, Replace, Reinoculate, and Repair. That is the gut restoration program. It involves removing allergens, toxins, parasites, and bacterial overgrowth; replacing digestive enzymes where necessary; using pre- and probiotics to reinoculate the gut with friendly bacteria; and last, repairing with nutrients like pantothenic acids, glutamine, and vitamin E to help restore gut mucosal integrity.
AW: That’s something I started doing about 10 to 15 years ago, and it’s been a mainstay of therapeutic treatment for these chronic conditions.
JB: As we all know, we lost a great pioneer and leader in our field with the passing of Dr. John Lee. Perhaps you could tell us a bit about your experience with bioidentical progesterone and where you think it fits into the puzzle.
AW: Progesterone gets depleted in a number of different ways in our society. Certainly, there is enough stress in our society with the concomitant elevations in cortisol and alterations in DHEA and progesterone, that I think increased progesterone deficiency states in the reproductive years are common. I suspect numerous nutritional deficiencies also play a role.
It’s been estimated that more than 70 percent of the population doesn’t achieve the RDA of things like magnesium and zinc, both of which are extremely important minerals for hormone balance. B vitamins also get depleted very easily in stressful situations, B6 in particular. I have found low levels in some of the testing I’ve done.
Progesterone, is a very sensitive marker of stress. Certainly, stress also has a major impact on ovulation. We know that when women don’t ovulate, they don’t make any progesterone in the ovaries. My feeling is that whatever progesterone is being produced elsewhere, as in the adrenals, is going more toward production of stress hormones like cortisol. Low progesterone levels or abnormal estrogen/progesterone ratios are extremely common in many of the conditions I see.
Replacing or restoring the normal ratio between estrogen and progesterone becomes extremely important. Natural progesterone transdermal creams work very well to restore that ratio. It’s not the only thing we do, but in someone who is premenstrually symptomatic of excess estrogens, natural progesterone can be extremely helpful. I also use the 3 percent progesterone cream that John Lee promoted in menopausal issues.
In menopause, I use bioidentical hormones or hormones that are identical to what the human ovary makes. In addition to the estrogens, I also use natural progesterone. The conventional thinking is that once a woman has a hysterectomy and has her uterus removed, she can just use estrogens and doesn’t need progesterone to balance it out in the uterus because there’s not going to be any uterine cancer.
I don’t understand the thinking that there are estrogen and progesterone receptors in other parts of the body—in the brain, in bone, in heart, and in blood vessels. If we’re giving estrogen and we’re not replacing any progesterone, we’re going to be stimulating more of an imbalance. In those cases, I also like to use the 3 percent progesterone creams.
It’s been suggested that the transdermal progesterone creams don’t get into the body. My understanding is that when conventional progesterone serum levels are done, they throw away the red cells, but the red blood cells are, in effect, carrying the progesterone. They’re basically throwing away evidence that progesterone is being absorbed transdermally. However, saliva testing for progesterone will show that progesterone is being absorbed transdermally.
I think the transdermal progesterones are very effective. They’re certainly absorbed and can be very helpful in a complete program in restoring estrogen/progesterone balance.
Some of Dr. Lee’s work on osteoporosis treatment using the 3 percent progesterone creams has not been borne out in subsequent studies. I think it’s certainly helpful in a total approach, but not by itself. Other interesting work done by Helene Leonetti actually showed that using the 3 percent progesterone cream in menopausal women with a uterus would protect the uterus using a 0.625 Premarin.
[22] We know there’s a lot of efficacy in using the 3 percent creams, and it can be very helpful as part of a total program.
JB: Another controversial area in which I know you certainly have some experience is the modulation of estrogen-related symptomatologies with soy isoflavones. There has been a recent backlash against soy in the fear that it will stimulate estrogen receptors and cause problems. What is your experience and position on this question?
AW: My experience has been that using levels of soy that approach what’s been found in the Asian diet—somewhere between 30 and 100 mg per day—has a modulating effect on estrogen levels. If estradiol has a strength of 1 in terms of its estrogenic effects, soy would have a much lower estrogenic effect, maybe 1/500 to 1/1000.
Soy acts more as a tonic. If estrogen levels are very high and soy is added to the mixture, it is going to compete with the stronger estrogens for the receptor sites. That’s going to bring down the total estrogen effect. If the estrogen levels are low, as they can be in menopause, adding the soy isoflavones will help fill up some of the receptor sites that would have been empty, and that would raise the estrogen effect. As with anything else, you can overdo it. You could take very large levels of isoflavones and perhaps get into trouble, perhaps with thyroid conditions, but my feeling is that using soy in moderation only acts as a modulator of estrogen in the body, or a tonic of estrogen in the body, and that it is not harmful.
[23] After evaluating all of the studies, his take was that soy in moderation is not harmful and is probably helpful, and would not be contraindicated, even in women who are breast cancer survivors.
If we’re talking about soy isoflavones as potentially dangerous, then we also have to look at some of the other foods that contain isoflavones. There are fruits, like apples and pomegranates, and several others that contain fairly high levels of isoflavones. Are we also going to restrict all those things from the diet? It doesn’t make much sense to me.
I’m a proponent of using soy in beneficial amounts. As I said, that would approximate the amounts found in the Asian diet. I also use other modulators of estrogen from foods. Flaxseeds are extremely important for modulating estrogen levels. They also have their own isoflavones. Using flaxseeds and soy in combination, which I often do with soy protein powders, seems to be very helpful in reducing some of the symptoms of menopause.
Many of my patients are businesswomen in Manhattan; they don’t have time for breakfast. When they run out of the house without eating, they begin the insulin resistance picture. I have them use a soy protein powder shake first thing in the morning, getting them about 20 mg of the isoflavones from the soy, and using flaxseeds along with that, and adding some extra fiber. Most of my patients love it and feel great. It gives them energy for a good part of the day and alleviates a lot of symptoms. I’m a major proponent of using soy in moderate amounts.
JB: I’d like to ask about one other nutritional modulator and that’s crucifers. People have different opinions about whether the glucosinolates found in cruciferous vegetables and their secondary metabolites like indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and diindolemethane (DIM) are beneficial for modulating hormones. What’s your experience?
AW: I certainly use the I3C and DIMfor women who have hormone imbalances. I measure the 2:16 (estrogen) ratio, although right now I’m not sure where we’re going with that. I feel you need to have good levels of the 2-hydroxyestrones in comparison to the 16s. I also feel there is an inverse relationship between the 4-hydroxycatecholestrogens and the 2-catecholestrogens, and the 2s need to be a little bit higher, compared to the 16 catechols.
I will be happy to see the day when we can measure the 4s or we can measure the effects of the 4-catechols on DNA, but I have certainly found that in women, using I3C or DIM seems to increase the 2-hydroxyestrones. I believe that the crucifers are extremely important for liver detoxification, and I have a quick personal story to share in that regard.
When I was an intern, I came down with serum hepatitis and for some reason, I couldn’t eat anything. My weight dropped from about 170 to 139; I was just getting ready to be hospitalized. For some reason, I started eating Brussels sprouts. I hadn’t eaten them before, but there was a package of Brussels sprouts in the freezer. I ate those and then started eating them twice a day. Within a short period of time, my enzymes started coming down, my weight started back up, and since that time, which was almost 30 years ago, Brussels sprouts are my favorite vegetable.
As a food, Brussels sprouts have a lot of glucosinolates and affect liver detoxification. I think crucifers should be an important part of everyone’s diet, and I certainly recommend one to two servings for everyone every day.
JB: I saw a paper published recently by Dr. Elizabeth Jeffery and her group at the University of Illinois on the direct influence of broccoli extract on glutathione S-transferase and the detoxifying phase 2 enzyme systems and hepatic cells. They found broccoli extracts protect against oxidative injury and upregulate phase 2 detoxification. This article was published in the journal, Nutraceuticals and Functional Medical Foods. [24] People who increase their consumption of cruciferous vegetables can realize positive benefits. In fact, as you say, you can measure the alteration in 2- to 16-hydroxylated estrogen ratios with an increased crucifer-rich diet.
AW: If I had to pick one thing that works best or has the most impact, I would say it’s dietary change. Getting the hormones out of the diet, removing the commercial sources of poultry and meats, getting the acidic foods and dairy products out of the diet, helps reduce inflammation. Gluten grains (wheat, rye, and barley) also seem to have a tremendous impact on increasing hormone imbalance, thyroid imbalance, and immunological and inflammatory imbalance.
I started doing celiac panels on anybody who comes in with a hormone problem. I have found that almost 50 percent of women have some elevation of the IgG gliadin antibody. I don’t think anybody is doing that regularly, but just getting these people off the gluten grains for three to six months has a tremendous impact on their energy, their sense of well being, and all the hormonal symptoms.
You don’t always have to go to a medication or an herb. You don’t even always have to use supplements. There are many people who, for one reason or another, don’t like taking supplements. They don’t like taking vitamins, but if you can get them to change their diet and remove some of the inflammatory foods, the acidic and allergenic foods, they start feeling better.
If you can just get a foot in the door you can show them that simple lifestyle changes can help them start feeling better. Then they can start picking up on some of the other things that need to be done, whether it’s gut restoration or supplements for PPAR agonists. Whatever it is, if you can get a foot in the door, and they start to feel better, they can move on and become committed to their own health.
I think that probably the major thing that I do is to get people committed to self-nurturing. So many of my patients have been nurturers. They nurture everybody else. Whether they’re businesswomen or housewives, they’re nurturers, but they don’t nurture themselves. A major piece of what I do is to get people to understand that they can nurture themselves; they’re entitled to be nurtured. Just getting them to understand that helps them to become committed to a program where they’re going to be optimally healthy.
JB: That’s a great message that must play wonderfully with your patients. I’m sure they have not heard that as the standard line from their other physicians. It frames a different type of medicine. I guess that’s why we’ve coined the term “functional medicine,” because it sounds like it has a connection of function between the provider, the practitioner, and the patient.
AW: I always ask my patients what it is that gives them joy in life. When I get a patient who tells me that nothing gives him or her joy in life, I know that’s going to be a difficult patient. Whatever the condition is, if there’s nothing that gives them joy in life, that’s a real challenge. They need to find something that is going to give them some joy.
Many of these patients are put on Prozac or antidepressants just so they can get out of bed and start seeing that there are roses to smell. It’s not even stop and smell the roses; they don’t know there are roses they can smell because they can’t even get out of bed in the morning.
JB: We have all learned a tremendous amount from the wisdom you’ve shared with us in the last 30 minutes. It is what holistic medicine was designed to be. You look at the individual as a functioning whole organism in whom the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, and recognize that you’re not treating organs; you’re treating people. Thank you, Dr. Warshowsky, for sharing this with us. I hope it can be a stimulus to produce many more physicians like you across the country.

Have you heard of the “Third-Place” phenomenon? First put forth by Ray Oldenburg (author of “The Great Good Place”), the theory goes something like this:
Third Place: Where you choose to spend the remainder of your leisure time. A “third place” is community-oriented, inexpensive, and inclusive of all ages, abilities and beliefs.
I am writing this to encourage you to make the library your “third place.” Your local public library has so much to offer just about everyone — at little or no cost! From newspaper and magazine subscriptions, to books, to computer use and Internet and wifi access – from local history and genealogical resources to classes covering computer literacy and sewing basics – the library is a wonderful opportunity for instruction, edification, and leisure.
If you are already using the library, then you know about our vast collection of books, audiobooks, movies, magazines, kits and other items you can check out and use at home. You can also check out a Georgia state park pass from the library and park for free! You can check out the Zoo Atlanta DVD, which gives you a voucher for four free tickets to the zoo! In addition, we have passes to the state historical sites, the Go Fish educational center in Perry and the Michael C. Carlos Museum and the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. We can be your “third place,” or we can get you there!
If you didn’t know about the Shareables and other kits available for checkout, we have a variety of educational and maker kits that you can check out with your library card. Exploring Light, Exploring Magnets, and Exploring Sound are a few kits geared to younger users, and for older students we have Little Bits and Makey-Makey kits. For adults we have a weaving loom and a jewelry-making kit. For our musical patrons we have ukuleles and a darbuka drum available for checkout. In addition, we have a Kill-a-Watt device that you can plug into your appliances and check the power usage from each one.
But there’s no need to just check out materials and leave! We have 34 computers available for public use, and wireless internet service 24 hours a day, which reaches the parking lot for your after-hours needs. We also have sewing machines available for public use at no charge (bring your own materials). For a small fee, we offer copy/print/fax services — just ask at the front desk! You can join our weekly craft group or a book club (we have three) or join our fundraising group as a Friend-with-a-capital-F of the Madison County Library!
Hang out in our Heritage Room and peruse our collection of Madison County yearbooks, look up your family history online with Ancestry Library Edition or HeritageQuest, and read papers from years past on microfilm. We have quiet study rooms available for use on a first come, first served basis, and tables throughout the library for your study or work needs. A few of our tables have electrical outlets built into them for convenience. Charge your devices in climate-controlled comfort!
Have I mentioned our online resources? You can learn a language for free through Mango Languages, available on our website and accessible from home with the GALILEO password. GALILEO is also a great resource for research and school projects. We have Chilton manuals online so you can troubleshoot your car repair problems, even if only to get an idea of what you’re in for at the mechanic’s shop. ReferenceUSA can give you information on local and global businesses. Access the Gale Legal Forms database or Digital Library of Georgia’s archives through our website, and then practice schoolwork on Learning Express Library, with lessons for pre-k through college students — including study materials and practice tests for the GRE, GED, and SAT. For smaller kids, enjoy literacy games and reading programs on ABC Mouse and Tumble Books. All are available for FREE through your local library.
Your local public library can and should serve as a community hub, where all the resources available in your area are known and shared without judgment or discrimination. We want to be here for you, and we want you to be here with us as your third place.
India is one of the greatest democratic countries in the world. India houses eight major religions of the world an many tribal communities with their own religions. Massive poverty, religious pluralism and caste discrimination have been a great challenge to communitiy building and communitiy living. This study attempts to find ways and means to build up inter-religious basic human communities with the many native religions and with Christian message.
In order to build up basic (Christian) human communities there is an urgent need for a pedagogy of inter-religious dialogue between and among religions. Inter-religious dialogue aims to provide forums for communal search to combat the above said challenges and difficulties. This dialogue needs to be intra-religious among the Christian communities before venturing for the inter-religious dialogue with the neighbours of other faiths. Pedagogy of intra-religious and inter-religious dialogue in view of building communities is an attempt to create space and time for mutual enrichment through religious and God experiences.
In my paper I want to show that this kind of inter-religious dialogue aims at basic dialogical inter-religious communities based on a communal attempt for the Reign of God for a greater communion an well being among the people of India.

Inside Librado Bernal's brown wallet is a small photograph of him and his bride, Olivia, when they were married 54 years ago. The wallet has been opened many times for many reasons, but every day it carries the moment they vowed to love and cherish each other till the end.
Librado, a soldier fresh out of the Army in 1962, went to visit a small bakery on the corner of Seabreeze and Cameron Street with his brother that was for sale. He ended up purchasing the business where Olivia worked.
“She weighed 98 pounds, had a Coca-Cola shape, beautiful ponytail she used to have, and she hated me,” he said laughing when he remembered what his bride looked like when he set his eyes upon her. “And than I became her boss.”
The couple laughed as they remembered that Olivia didn’t fall for the soldier turned boss right away.
“I couldn’t stand him...,” Olivia laughed with her husband. “I can’t say there was any one thing that changed my mind about him, but we started dating.”
For their first date they took in a movie at the old Buckhorn Drive-In, a poplar attraction for teenagers and young adults in Alice back in the day.
“We kept it a secret from my parents for a long time, until we were ready to get married,” Olivia said. “I knew that if (my father) knew I had somebody he would’ve taken me out of (the bakery), like he did the moment (Librado) asked for my hand in marriage.”
Librado knew that his future father-in-law was protective of his daughter. Her father never allowed anyone to get near her, but Librado caught a break when Olivia’s sister got married. He showed up to Olivia’s parents house as the photographer.
Time passed and they got married on Jan. 5, 1964, raised five children who blessed them with 12 grandchildren.
“It’s been a beautiful marriage. We’ve had our ups and downs like married couples do,” Olivia said looking to her husband in agreement. “The secret to a long marriage, to me, is yeah get mad, but don’t stay mad forever, forgive and love always.”
When anyone asks Librado what he believes is the secret to a long, happy marriage he tells them, “Right away you say ‘I’m the boss’" and that you’ll have the last word in everything.
Librado and Olivia both agree that Librado does have the last word in everything by saying “Yes, honey.”
“Of course, love has to be there. You have to have it if not you won’t survive,” Olivia said of her first and only boyfriend.
While they enjoy there lives true to the vows they made in front of their family, friends and God, they have had rough patches.
“It was not a very good day. I was scared,” Olivia said. “I didn’t know what was going to happen, I didn’t know the extent of the disease. After awhile, the doctor said he wasn’t going to die of this illness. He was going to be okay thanks to a new treatment, new medicine.”
Bernal became the Guinea Pig for a medication that the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) had just approved two months before his diagnoses in 2015.
He’s been in remission for the last four months enjoying every moment of their lives with each other and their family.
“We’re together 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Olivia said. “More than ever after he was diagnosed with cancer."
Located on the heart of Leicester Square, M&M’s World is possibly London’s sweetest attraction and the largest candy store in the world. Spread across 4…

Our octodiver print adds a minimal yet adventurous accent to your wall decor. Printed in black and white archival inks, this print comes in multiple sizes and can be framed to add a modern aquatic touch to any space. Bring a nautical vibe into your modern beach home or any room where ocean accents are all the rave!
You know when you bite the back of your fist because you’ve come across something so unmistakably you, that it suddenly dawns on you how you have even been surviving without your new found obsession. Well, thats the feeling I get every time I come across a stunning photo of these slim aluminium or steel framed windows. Whether they’re used inside to divide a room or as simple exterior window frames, the finish they provide is second to none.
I almost feel that if windows were people, then my current double glazed white windows I’m sat next to right now would be called Barry. Yeah sure, Barry is safe and reliable, I’ve been with him for years, but he’s a tad bland and can’t really dress himself well. Where as these new steel windows are like that hot new work colleague thats just started in compliance. Hmmm, maybe lets call him Ryan, (Gosling perhaps?) he also happens to moonlight as a neurosurgeon, has a black belt in karate, speaks five different languages, drives a shit hot sports car and gets all his suits tailor made on Saville Row.
Take a look at the little collection I’m compiling together on my pinterest below and feel yourself fall head over heels in love with them all too.

Served by Bryn railway station, Bryn is home to the Three Sisters Recreation Area which has been created from three large spoil tips which remain from Bryn’s role in Lancashire’s coal mining past. The recreation area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.The former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a “safe house” for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones been cleared.The Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady of Good Counsel was founded in 1896. In 1902 the foundation stone of the church, dedicated to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, was laid by Bishop Thomas Whiteside, the 4th Bishop of Liverpool. The church, situated on Downall Green Road, was designed in the style popularised by Pugin and opened on 21 October 1903. On 8 September 1955 the church was consecrated and the holy relics of two early Roman martyrs – Saints Speciosi and Fructuosi, were placed under the altar stone. Ion the course of over 100 years, the church has been served by a total of 13 priests, the current parish priest being Father John Gorman.The Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the heavily recusant area.

The long-running ABC sitcom Bewitched starred Elizabeth Montgomery as Samantha Stephens, a pert, perky, suburban housewife who happened to be a genuine witch, with all the usual magical powers. Samantha was married to Darrin Stephens (played during the first five seasons by Dick York, and in the final three seasons by Dick Sargent), a rising young advertising executive who worked at the New York firm of McMahon and Tate. A mere mortal, Darrin insisted that Samantha — or “Sam,” as he called her — behave like an ordinary human being, and that she keep her witchcraft under wraps at all times. Sam tried her best to oblige, but the situations occurring in the course of the series invariably required her to cast a few spells and chant a few incantations to get her husband or herself out of jams.

The US Embassy has the State Department’s 2008 INSCR report. Here is a quote from Volume II: Money Laundering and Financial Crimes that describes Suspicious Activity Reports (SARS):
Financial institutions are required to report transactions when the entity has reasonable grounds to suspect the transaction involves the proceeds of crime; involves the financing of terrorism; or is suspicious in nature. In cases where the FIU [Barbados Financial Intelligence Unit] suspects a transaction involves the proceeds of crime, the FIU will forward the report for further investigation to the Commissioner of Police. As of June 30, 2007, the FIU had received 56 SARs; none were referred to the Commissioner of Police. Government entities and financial institutions are required to provide the FIU with information requested by the Director of FIU. The Royal Barbados Police force pursues all potential prosecutions.
2005: there were 84 suspicious activity reports (SARS) to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), but no mention was made of any being reported to the Royal Barbados Police Force (RBPF). INSCR 2006
For visual impact, I have plotted the number of SARS reported to FIU next to the number of SARS that were referred to the RBPF. This is for the years 2005 - 2006. The column of SARS actually reported to the police is almost invisible, it is so short.
Of the 181 suspicious activity reports filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit, only 2 are know to have been referred to the Royal Barbados Police Force. I have not seen any reports of any convictions. Based on my experience with RBPF, I am not optimistic. Last year, a complaint was filed with the Barbados police about violent threats my mother and I were receiving. I was most dissatisfied with their investigation. They were ineffective. I am not the only one unhappy with the RBPF. Here is a snip from the contact page of the web site of the Royal Barbados Police Force:
Notice that there are no names, no telephone numbers, no email links and no addresses on this page. Is RBPF sending us a subtle message? - “Don’t call us. We will call you!” Is the Barbados Offshore business environment effectively regulated, or is it extremely permissive?

Give these individuals your very best in addition to really aim to be for support. One time they observe how good work is, will have them compelled in order to want much more.
Don’t cheap your products. Some consumers, like me personally, assume you get that which you pay pertaining to and will instantly choose your own personal top quality delivering. Many scientific tests show that will 20% of this audience is going straight in order to the top part. Produce sure a person currently have an item usually that will buy! An additional to owning your high-class provide: those people who buying on value, will order a mid-range preference and look like they have a decent deal. Often the high-end supply often multiply sales on your own mid-range products.

This February we led a Drupal 7 usability study at Google and livestreamed it to over 115 developers. Usability studies provide a firsthand look at how users experience a product and are incredibly effective at highlighting interface flaws and confusions. However, the impact these studies have are limited by their audience; it is only those present during the study who really feel engaged with it. After the analysis and recorded videos have been released, the thrill of the discussion and collaborative brainstorming has already died down. When you open up usability studies to the world, you have the power to stir an army of people into action. Everyone watches the same users getting frustrated, everyone feels the same pain at interface quirks, and everyone participates in the discussion, and ultimately the solution. We believe that live usability studies are the best way to advocate for a focus on user experience in Drupal development. In this talk, we will explain how we ran this study, key insights we gained from it, and how to do it again.
Glasgow isn’t necessarily the first destination that one thinks of heading to for a getaway, perhaps because of those old stereotype views of it. However, it has a vibrant city centre and, unsurprisingly, if you recall that it used to be the Empire’s second city, there are a number of cultural institutions worth visiting, especially the Burrell Collection. Better still, the city has been undergoing a food and drink regeneration. No more than two nights are needed to see the city and, when it comes to where to stay, the Hotel du Vin is my choice. It was here that Gordon Ramsey had his Glasgow restaurant before he was forced to close it.
The Finneston area of the city, centred on Argyle Street, is where a number of new bars and restaurants have been opening over the past few years. They’ve been gaining a well-deserved reputation for good quality food and drink, especially among the younger set after micro brews and clean modern cooking. King among those in Finneston is The Gannet. It has been gaining a reputation since first opening in late 2013. I ate there in 2014, as Finneston was taking off, and even then it was leading the way. Now it has 3 AA Rosettes.
The décor is suitably modern with stripped back brick walls and grey paint. As is common these days, there’s a buzzing bar that serves some light food at the front while the restaurant is behind. The restaurant is divided between the back room and a mezzanine, where I have eaten and found my waitress to be delightful.
The menu is modern British in style, featuring the best local and seasonal produce. When last I was there with my family, we ordered as starters the sweetbreads, the pickled herring, the egg, pea and radish salad, and I chose one of the specials: the fried pressed pig’s head. All these dishes were faultless. The sweetbreads, despite being described as crispy, were cooked to perfection when so often such treatment results in them being overdone and tough. The herrings had a subtle pickle to them, while the salad was light, refreshing and flavoursome. My pig’s head was also perfectly prepared and lifted by the pickled veg which were not over powerful from too much vinegar.
The mains were just as good. My sister had the agnolotti, which she enjoyed, while the three of us had the lamb with barley risotto, mushroom and scorched leek. This dish could only have been bettered if there had been a hint of heat to the lamb from cumin, or perhaps a bit of mustard running through the risotto.
For dessert one of our number had the cheese selection. Scottish cheese is one of the discoveries that a trip to the Highlands provides. There are a handful of very good ones, though in general I’d say there is still some way to go before they reach the level of some of the best English and French cheeses. The Eton mess was wolfed down, while I had the caramel fondant, which was very impressive and thankfully not over salted as so often can be the case with salted caramel.
The Gannet really is a must if you’re in Glasgow. I was left with a feeling of enthusiasm for the culinary renaissance in the city.
Halfway between Glasgow and the Isle of Skye is Port Appin on Loch Linnhe, just behind the Isle of Mull. Here you’ll find The Airds Hotel, a Relais Chateaux, with its 11 rooms and 3 AA Rosette restaurant. Set right on the edge of the loch, the views across the water are spectacular, only outdone by the quality of the light and the colours it gives off.
As an escape for a weekend or just a night en route to Skye, it’s a perfect place to stay. The two lounges, complete with roaring log fires, are full of comfy chairs and sofas, with the rooms, conservatory and restaurant all set up to ensure the best possible views. The conservatory is filled with flowers and acts as the entrance to the hotel; it also makes for the most perfect setting for afternoon tea when the sun is shining.
The hotel has held its three Rosettes for 25 years now, and has done so under a number of chefs. Currently the head chef is Chris Stanley who was previously at the Glasgow Hotel du Vin; previously David Barnett, now of The Torridon, was head chef. The menu reads as if classic British but is served with a modern twist. As you’d hope for the area, it is heavy on fish and shellfish with lighter game making up a decent proportion of the meat dishes. Helpfully, given the remoteness of the hotel, dinner is included in the room rate.
Among the dishes I had over the three nights I stayed were a large piece of stone bass that was succulent and translucent, and the beef fillet, which was accompanied by tongue, always a nice touch. One dish of particular note was the West Coast scallops with caramelised cauliflower purée, a classic dish that was elevated to something new and interesting with the addition of Nori crackers and a kombu butter sauce. Much has been made of deconstructed pies, and many are silly, but the breast and leg of quail were served up as one, despite not been advertised as a pie. The meat and its egg came sat on top of a disk of pastry in a black bowl; when broken through, a bright, almost radio active, orange carrot velouté is revealed. It’s such a memorable dish that, despite not ordering it myself, it’s the dish I remember the most.
Everything that came out of the kitchen was clean, crisp and cooked with precision and delicacy. No dish represented this more than the Loch Linnhe langoustine that was part of a special tasting menu. Simple and stripped back, it was a single large tail with a little puree and langoustine oil to go with it.
Stunning views and spot on food, oh and an ample supply of whisky, its hard to know what more one could ask for from Scotland.

There could be some new office space available on the London market if the Henderson Group acquire Gartmore Investment.
Office space in London could be emptied leaving the opportunity for a new London office lease if the Henderson Group go through with the acquisition of Gartmore Investment Management.
The investment company is to be bought out by Henderson for around £335 million and there has already been some speculation concerning what effect this will have on Gartmore’s leased office space in London.
It looks like the Henderson Group will relocate all of the Gartmore staff in the Rex Building to their offices at 201 Bishopsgate. This is despite Gartmore taking a 15 year London office lease on the property with no break options.
The Rex Building consists of 74,908 sq. ft. of office accommodation in the centre of London. The property spans seven floors and was designed by renowned architects Rolfe Judd.
Henderson also recently extended its £560 million Central London Office Fund I to December 2015 and also acquired £36.4 million worth of office space in Glasgow.
In other London office lease news the Liberal Democrats have announced that they are looking for new office space that is in closer proximity to the Houses of Parliament.
The Lib Dems are to leave their current offices at 4 Cowley Street which is a Grade II listed building that supplies the party with 7,000 square feet of office space. The property also features temperature controlled rooms and kitchen facilities.
The building will be available for a London office lease once the Lib Dems have vacated the premises, currently the property comes at a cost of £225,000 per annum which is around £31 per square foot.

I just returned from a 3 week trip to India. I was able to catch up on reading my old Indrajal Comics, the ones still left with me, which I had given to my brother's kids during my last trip there.
One of the comics I read again was IJC 176 - Mandrake And The Giant Man from Feb 1973. I had shared this comic in Prabhat's blogs a long while ago. The first panel in the comic looked like this:
I am presenting here the full 90 strips of this daily strip which was called Kolossus and it ran from 05-31-1971 thru 09-11-1971. The first panel looked like this:
Thanks for visiting this blog, perhaps the one and only place on the web having the most Mandrake comic strips.
If you happen to come across or have Mandrake comic strips/books (in English preferably) please scan them and I can post them here. Please email me if you have any questions.

I have 1 word to describe the France team cheater’s the reason why is because they fake fall he did hands and the ref is like wha eh i don’t like Belgium i hope they lose but it’s just football and this dirty team get’s a golden cup reminding them about how they cheated they did hand fake falls etc but gg
i love how the majority of the videos this channel posts before a match usually talks about the team that ends up losing!!!
They decided to play hazard deep, Fellani on the wing and in the hold up position.... It was a shit show
Steve Nicol was right-- Lukau was bloody dreadful...old, slow, overweight, disinterested. The only thing right he did was when he did nothing (ie played a dummy). Other than that he was a bystander.
I think Lukaku will play as an old fashioned number 9. I will be surprised if Belgium don't boss the midfield. That will cause France problems but any speed could cause Kompany a few problems. Overall I think Belgium have the edge if De Bruyne and Hazard play well and my guess is Hazard is promoting himself out of Chelsea so he will want to play well.
France’s logic is simple Do you have the ball? No- never mind Yes- Are you Mbappé? Yes- RUN No- pass the ball to Mbappé
and who did belgium play so far? if france were in a group with tunisia and panama mbappe's stats wouldve been much much better so for me lukaku so far has been average. you obviously know your stuff but what you did is cover the best case scenario for both teams, what they could do at their best unfortunately football is not as simple. kante and umtiti will be key for france because they aim to cut passes and steal the ball early, they move a lot rather than stay static. belgium has good players but to get past kante they need teamwork and so far they havent shown much of it. sure, they have exploited spaces left by their opponents but thats it. against japan they won because they were better prepared and stronger physically but didnt quite convince with their performance. against brazil for example late in the game when brazil finally started trying to attack the back post there were huge holes in belgium's defense, the players were really static and thats their weakness. france on the other hand has been quite average as well but apart from argentina they met team with good defense and even so, they still won the majority. they've build their team around midfield stablity and control of tempo - griezmann plays in a free role mostly aiming to slow things down and calm his teammates while mbappe is solely focused into penetrating and there's giroud who so far has just watched for free. the rest are responsible for the defense. france has pacey wing backs on the bench but the fact they are not starting tells you a lot. belgium are by no means doomed here but if france's approach is something belgium generally find hard to deal with. france has enough pace and stability to deal with belgium's creative midfield but they themselves lack creativity. belgium as said can be creative and unpredictable but they find it hard to play in slow tempo games such as this one. in my opinion france wins this
how the hell are you going to talk about belgium v france and not even mention hazard in the reds attacking play?! he will do immense damage against the french side and you forget that even if fellaini is a clear threat against kante in the air, pogba can still play deeper and beat him on a header
Should've probably wrote Attacking CM about Fellaini because "Attacking MF" made me giggle for 30 seconds straight and I don't mean his initials.
If Deschamps doesn't win the demn trophy with the players he has he is dumb, there is no team that can pull a suprise n beat him, everything is too alighned for France to win it.
Tifo is the real deal!! I actually use these tactics for PES. I love tactics. Can't wait for this game go kick off.
Take care of the only remaining European team CROATIA <3 . All 23 players are Croats and Europeans and there are only 4 million !
I feel France should start without Giroud. Use Dembele or Lemar on the left side, and Griezmann as a false 9 in the middle. I think Giroud will be completely taken out of the game with the three strong centre backs. A quick winger on the left hand side would put a lot of pressure on Belgium since Meunier is out, and that's where Kompany plays and he looks really shaky.
How many games will be played by the Waves and the Flemish and the French in this match ?? You have over 70 million and you can not give 5 players . Who is playing against who ? You are so talented for football :)
St Petersburg after todays match will be more red than in early 1940s when soviets defend the city of nazis
We should take a moment and be just happy how well this years world cup has been. Find it 10x better than the one in Brazil. Any team had a chance it feels like and every team scored a goal. 100% in my top 3 world cups. Also its not coming home
If you were to die today are you 100% sure you can go to heaven?. So, you must realize that you sinned, against a holy God therefore you are a sinner(Romans 3:23 - For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God), if 1 crime makes you a criminal, then 1 sin=you are a sinner. And God has to punish sin with hell forever( Revelation 20:5 - And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet [are], and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever). But, you can be saved/go to heaven because of Jesus Christ and only what He did( who is God by the way John 1:1 and 14 - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God/And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.) by putting all your FAITH/TRUST from the HEART in the death on the cross for the forgiving of sins, burial and ressurection on the third day of Jesus Christ, the BLOOD of Jesus for the forgiving/cleasing of sins(1 Corinthians 15:1-4 - Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures), (Romans 5:9 - Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. ). Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God/ Not of works, lest any man should boast. You don't have to do anything to get to heaven, no work, just trust, RELY on what Jesus Christ did, in His blood for your salvation. Now if you put your trust in what Jesus did, you are going to heaven no matter what, you have eternal security(Ephesians 4:30 - And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption). Now of course grace is not a excuse to sin. Do not sin but not to get saved or stay saved but only to please God.( Romans 6:1-2 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?), after death going to heaven or not you will face judgement. If saved, you will go to The Judgement Seat of Christ where your works you do after being saved are judged for rewards there.Also out of a good conscience we must not bother God by sinning because he died for us to be saved.

Am i the only one thts hating o t he current immigrant bs plaguing national soccer, most of those players are not french or belgium born so why are they playing on the team, it just doesnt feel special ,thts y i wamted japan or russia to win because its actual russians and japs
hussar Interesting facts for you: Right Back, Gotoku Sakai of the Japanese squad, was born to a Japanese father and German mother in New York. Winger, Aleksandr Samedov of the Russian squad was born to an Azerbaijani father and Russian mother in Moscow. Whereas, Right Back, Mario Fernandes was born in Brazil. S/N: Your head would have probably exploded if you were alive prior to the 17th century (Gregorian), the concept of citizenship was in its infancy and nation-states only just started emerging. People used to move across territories all the time back then.
The French press should make for a quality cup of coffee and stop the Belgian attack effectively as well...
Who is gonna replace Meuneir? Why doesn't Martinez take any full backs?!! Some guy from the Belgian league is better than playing Vertonghen and Alderweireld there? Even if he thought they would play 3-4-3, they're good to have in the squad for tactical flexibility.
Ive been watching your channel for a few months now and I'm not suprised in the slighest that it has blown up over the world cup. Keep up the great work
Henry have the same secret that dishamp have // and zidane // that generation got the phylosophy of football
As a Croat, the France vs Belgium will be a blast to watch. I dread at the Croatia - England match however. I think we are more exhausted but alas the team should press forward. Whatever happens - happens, top 4 in the world isn't a small thing. peace
why wouldn't belgium try jordan lukaku? he's more like natural left back, i think he will handle mbappe just better than carrasco
He hadn't completely recovered from an injury when the World Cup started so wasn't included in the 23 man squad
You forgot to mention that Carrasco didn't play against Brazil. Chadli filled the LWB role. And I would like to add that he was excellent.
Is it seriously possible that France doesn't have a true left winger??? I can hardly believe that they can't find a better LM unless it's their tactics to have a defensive winger alongside an offensive winger...
SuperMutt&BMax ._. We haven’t ‘guessed’ or predicted anything. We don’t do that. We simply explain things, and from that people can make their own decisions.
I think the key to this game will lie in how Martinez handles Meunier's suspension. Chadli has pretty much "fixed" the problems in the left side of their defense by replacing Carrasco at that flank, but with no real replacement for right-sided FB/WB in the bench Martinez might be tempted to play Chadli on that side, which would be lethal with Pavard/Mbappe exploring the space behind Carrasco on the left. On the other hand, if he plays Vermaelen as a makeshift RB, then you effectively have 2 central defenders playing as full-backs on both sides which will rob the team of width going forwards. Maybe Martinez can pull another tactical masterclass and fix this problem with something completely inventive (e.g. go with a back-3 and adapt De Bruyne or Dembele as one of the wingbacks?) then we may well have a great game on our hands.
Back when Wilmots was coach we used to play a 433 all the time with Vertonghen, Alderweireld as LB and RB and Vermaelen, Kompany as CB. Our defence can adapt back to that formation easily. Especially Vertonghen, he has loads of expierience as a LB.
Felliani World Cup Winner. Blimey. Fair Play to Belgium, their come back against Japan and brilliant performance against Brazil means they deserve to win the whole thing for me.
What about Meunier being suspended? Assuming that forces Belgium to a back three, who comes on as right wing back? If they draft in Boyata for a back four with no natural full backs, what then?
I think it will all come down to who can execute the counter attacks better, both teams have shown great strength in this

Every student is unique and may require a unique way of dealing with their behaviour. This is where I feel that being a parent of more then one child gives you great background and experience on how each and every child is different and may require different ways to be understood. Depending on the student and the situation is how I look at each situation on how I will approach it. I am still fair and I do believe that the punishment should fit the crime, but it is the way we deliver that message that is the most important part for our students to know we care.
Fair but Firm, you can make exceptions at times but everyone should be treated fairly, and you need to stick to what you say no wishy washiness with your students.
Students need to know your limits. Establishing this early on is very important to the success of the classroom and also to other teachers that may be in your classroom.
Be prepared, always know what you will be teaching or working on so students do not have the opportunity to act out or misbehave.
Get to know your students, I find this one is so important. By taking an interest in each and every student it shows the students you care, and they will gain great respect for you and you for them.
Use humour in your day to day talk, students love funny things and will see you more like a person and not just a teacher. It also grabs their attention when you are teaching a lesson.
Listen to your students, this one can go a long way in many situations! It may just give you the underlying reason why your student is acting out.
Redirect when neccesary, try and keep track of who is off task and get their focus back but maybe asking them a wuestion about their work. This may be your chance to see why they are off track in the first place, they may not understand the work being asked of them.
Reward good behaviour, recognize students who are always doing good. But also give credit to those who need to hear it when doing good even if it may be small.
I would love to hear more ideas of how you manage your classroom. Please feel free to share or to add to my ideas. All feedback is welcome!
Open Communication is sometimes the key to success with a number of my students. I find that as the teacher, I need to connect with parents, other teachers, community agencies and the student to have a good understanding of each and every one of my students.
At the beginning of every semester I call ALL the parents of every student! I introduce myself and let them know about our class website and how to access it, how to contact me with any questions or concerns and I ask questions at this point about any behaviour issues or concerns I have seen with the student at this point. (I call within the first 2 weeks) I also send home a “School and Home Communication” sheet that parents and guardians need to fill out and return to school. This communication sheet tells me the best way for me to contact the parent and/or guardian, and it gives me all the important numbers or email addresses that I need from the parent to reach them if needed.
When needed I touch base with other teachers and community agencies to discuss strategies that may work for them with the student or sometimes to find out more information about a student that will help me, help them learn. Recently, I had a tutor of one of my students call me about what they could be working on with the student for science homework. I found this to be very helpful for me, as well as the student, being able to let the tutor know what we were working on and helping the student to stay on top of things in the class.
During class time I like to have conferences with my students throughout the semester to keep track of any outstanding work and how students are feeling about my class. This gives the students opportunities to touch base with me without looking like they may need extra help in front of their classmates. We all know that looking cool is important…well to a teenager it is! I want my students to know that they can email me at any time, drop in at lunch to ask questions, or just be able to approach me if needed. I want to be approachable for my students and their families.
Another way that I keep communication going throughout the semester is to send emails out to parents when we are doing something exciting or even just a reminder about a field trip or a due date. In my experience most parents are very receptive to this and appreciate me taking the time to keep them up to date.
I have found in the past that putting in a little extra time at the beginning (and it does take time!) makes the rest of the semester run so much smoother for everyone. Parents know how to contact me directly, they know how to keep informed about their child’s work and it gives me a better understanding of each student and the support they have at home and within the community. These simple strategies open the door to communication in my classroom so parents and students feel that they can come and talk to me and that my door of communication is always open!
How do we engage our youth of today? What does it take to grab their attention and focus for more than 5 minutes? Do WE as the teachers need to change our own practices and the way we plan lessons? What is it going to take to get our students attention in this day and age???
When I ask myself these questions, the first thing that comes to my mind is how can I structure the lessons and learning in my classroom so my students want to be involved. Where do I start? A recent experience I had in teaching made me realize that I need to create a “Growth Mindset” approach to my lessons, so every student feels that they are capable and can grow and learn in my classroom. The tasks that I have my students participate in need to be meaningful and related to the “Real World”. Students need to understand why we as teachers are teaching certain topics in subject areas. Why do we need to know about ecology? Why is it important to know about the food chain? How does this affect me as a student? These are types of questions that I actually got asked a number of times in different units in a recent teaching experience. Our students need to know WHY we are teaching them specific topics. We don’t just say the night before class…”Oh I think I might just want to do a lab on dissecting owl pellets tomorrow!” Our students need to know the underlining reasons why we are focusing on dissecting owl pellets. Why is it important for them to learn about this? So #1 for me is make it real for them, connect the learning to real life!
When I look around at all the students in my class (I teach high school) majority of these students have some type of electronic device. Now these things can be the biggest pain in your side as a teacher, and let me tell you I have had some large side pains from these devices! I recently have realized that these devices are not going away. No matter what we do to prevent them from coming into our classrooms, students will find a way to access them. So as the saying goes, “If you can’t beat em’, join em’!” I have begun to use these devices that cost our board literally nothing. Nearly every student in every class I am in has a personal electronic device, and even if they don’t we have iPads, chrome books and laptops for those to use. My thoughts on this is that since students have these devices and have a very difficult time staying off them, why don’t we incorporate these into our lessons. I have given lessons where students are to do some of the research during the lecture and are to share their findings with the class. I couldn’t believe the participation and enthusiasm in this when I asked students to do this. They race off to try and find what we need to know and are enjoying it, but also using their electronic device in a positive way! Wow! This is a win win you would think. If we are going to use these devices we still need to set down boundaries and rules with them so they are used appropriately in class. So #2 for me is USE THEM, incorporate electronic devices into the learning.
Another way to get students attention is to get to know them, try and understand where they are coming from, and really hear them, LISTEN! Students want to be seen as individuals not as a group, so by getting to know them makes a big difference in the way they see me too, as their teacher. Taking the time at the beginning of the semester and getting to know each individual student will show them you care and that you want them to be successful. Finding out how each student will be more successful from them personally, will really show the students that you want to help in any way you can to help them achieve to the best of their ability. Setting up one on one conferences just to chat about student progress and how they are feeling in my class is a strategy I have used for a number of years now. This helps the students get to know me, and know that I am here to help them succeed and that I am cheering them on. My goal is to create a positive atmosphere and show my students excitement and enthusiasm for what we are learning. By creating positive relationships with my students will help us as a class to achieve this goal! So #3 for me is taking the time to get to know each student.
I have had a class website for a while now but students don’t seem to be accessing it like I would like them too. My idea is to get them to use it more and refer to it, and to use it daily in class time. I want to connect our lessons to our website, make it interactive, and engaging so students can use their devices to access the website during class. I want to be able to set up my class like a blended learning class, where some of our learning is done online on our website or a D2L where we have more options for online learning. I want to make the D2L part super exciting and engaging so students want to log on and participate in the learning. I am open to new ideas on this topic and how to make my classroom more engaging, if anyone has ideas that work for them I would love to hear them! If you have any thoughts you would like to share about my post please feel free!
In response to “Watershed Moments of Learning” shared by Dean Shareski. http://ideasandthoughts.org/2016/09/01/watershed-moments-of-learning/
When that light bulb comes on and you feel a rush of excitement over something that the majority of the population would look at you and say, “Really!” Those are my “Watershed Moments of Learning, “and I love that feeling! Those are the moments when I realize I am meant to be an educator and l love what I do.
The most engaging PD that I have been involved in to date is the PLCs with the Social Science Department at a very engaging and wonderful high school, CASS. These PLCs were very interactive and have given me the opportunity to gain hands on experience planning lessons for the LD learner with a group of teachers and administrators that I aspire to be like. I have never had such an engaging and collaborative learning experience, where I came away from each session we had together as a better more competent teacher. I can only hope that I will be able to become a part of this team once again and continue my learning involvement in these PLC sessions.
The absolute most mind-blowing amazing presentation where everything made sense was when I had the honours of attending a presentation by Will Richardson in March of 2016 in Sault Ste. Marie. He is a fantastic presenter and knows his stuff! I felt so engaged in the presentation I wanted to run out in the middle of it and start incorporating everything he was saying in my science classroom. But then I realized I wanted to hear the rest of the presentation! Such a fantastic presenter, with even more fantastic ideas for us teachers to bring to our classrooms and make a real difference in learning. Since then, I have started using some of his thoughts on 21st century learning and have begun to let the students take the wheel in their own learning.
The book I think that has given me great insight into becoming a better educator is “Mindsets in the Classroom, by Mary Cay Ricci.” When I read this book I had a hard time putting it down, one of those good reads where you just want to keep going! This book has made an enormous impact on the way I look at learning for each individual student that I teach. It has made me feel that creating a growth mindset within my classroom is possible. Giving me strength to instill this thinking in all my students. I phrase things differently when talking with my students, making them see themselves as a positive learner. I had a student come up to me in my Careers class and tell me that they couldn’t do the assignment the same as everyone else because they were (students words) “stupid!” I had just finished reading this book and all the principles and concepts from the book came flooding back and this is where I began implementing this mindset within my students!
I honestly think that my new favourite tool has become my blog https://julesrobinsonblog.wordpress.com/. I started this blog while taking the E-Learning additional qualification course to post my responses for my classmates to read and to connect with educators online. I was very nervous at first about posting my responses out there for everyone to criticize and read. Boy was I wrong! Starting my blog has been a super rewarding and positive experience where I can share my thoughts and ideas with other educators. Getting feedback, or as another teacher in my other AQ class puts it “feed forward,” is such a fantastic way to engage with other educators who are on the same page. I am hoping to keep up my blogging once my course is complete and to keep connecting with educators who I can share experiences and ideas with.
The person whom I think has inspired me the most in education is a previous principal, now superintendent, “Marcy Bell.” Marcy has helped me to see my potential as an educator and given me great insight on qualities that I have that can help me grow as a teacher. I can only hope to be as good an educator and leader as Marcy. She inspires me to reach high and set my expectations of myself to a level I never thought I could reach! She is a fantastic leader and encourages others around her to go after their goals.
While contemplating the article “Documenting for learning” by Silvia Rosenthal Tolisano, I went to look up the definition of the word document. The fourth definition down was, evidence, proof! This is exactly what we do as teachers when we document our students learning. We give evidence, proof to the student, parent and teacher that learning has occurred and continues to. By providing that proof that learning is happening is encouraging for everyone involved, student, parent and teacher. It shows us that our students are on track or sometimes gives us proof that our students are off track or that they may need more support to get back on track. Personally I am a documenter as well, I document all my children’s milestones and exciting moments! “Honey grab the camera he is going to blow his candles out!” “Honey grab the camera she is taking her first steps!” “Honey grab the camera he is eating his booger!” Ok, not to that point do I document. But I do like documenting and it gives me a sense of accomplishment that I have proof of my children growing. It gives me something to look back on and see the changes that have occurred in my kids and realize how far they have come. This is the same way that I look at documenting as a teacher it gives me proof that my students are achieving where they need to be, so I can look back at their progress and see that they too are growing, but in their learning. I also feel that documenting gives me a way to check myself as a teacher, “Are my students understanding this concept?” “Should I maybe that topic in a different way?” These types of questions arise from my documenting ways, and help me to become a better teacher. Documenting has given my students ways to self-assess and see their progress, but it has also given me a way to self-assess my learning as a teacher and it helps me grow as an educator every day!
Absenteeism is a problem that can arise in online courses. When taking an online course you have to be responsible and self-motivated to participate and be a part of the course community. If students are not participating in discussions or being present online to complete assignments this can be a big problem. They may fall behind in content, lose interest completely or not qualify to attain the course credit.
To prevent absenteeism teachers should create an environment where students are required to be active in discussions within different groups in the course. By creating an active learning environment in your online course gives students opportunities to help each other and it encourages interaction among classmates. By giving students chances to pose discussion questions and moderate discussions is another way for students to feel involved in their learning and requires them to be present online. Teachers need to make online courses engaging and set it up that all students are able to participate at times convenient for them. The expectations of how many times per week students are to be logging in and taking part in discussions needs to be put in place at the beginning of the course.
When addressing a student with an absenteeism problem in an online course the teacher needs to contact the student by email or phone, if email is not returned. They need to find out if the student is continuing with the course and if so, find out the reasons why the student isn’t present online. If accommodations need to be made to assist student learning then the teacher and student should come up with a solution that will work for both sides.
Teachers can support students who struggle in an online learning environment by scaffolding the learning so they can begin to build on previous experiences and prior knowledge. We can do this by giving progressive self-tests, hints for solving problems or completing tasks, and give tasks and assignments that will continue to build on previous learning
By providing a multisensory approach to learning gives students different opportunities to engage in the content and clarify for understanding. Teachers can provide this multisensory environment within online courses by implementing; visualization tools, graphics, illustrations and pictures. When setting up your course with these tools mentioned above, can enhance student understanding for content, assignments and discussions for those that may struggle in the literacy component of the learning. “The use of organizers and overviews of the content enable students to think holistically, and it supports visually orientated learning (McLoughlin, 1999b).”
McLoughlin, C. (1999b). The implications of the research literature on learning styles for the design of instructional material. Australian Journal of Educational Technology, 15(3), 222-241.
Online course or regular classroom, we have to make our lessons interactive and engaging for our students to connect with the material. I feel that by connecting my lessons to real world experiences and bringing in a simple video or demonstration as a hook, helps to build a fun and engaging classroom online or in person.
When looking at assessment in an online course I feel that the actual feedback isn’t really that different from the regular classroom. It is more the way the feedback is given that is different. In fact I think there is some perks to assessing online! Teachers can give digital feedback (audio, video, screen-casts) which may be more engaging for most students to have the opportunity to watch and listen to the feedback, instead of reading what is written on their paper. The teacher can make the feedback more personal and fun, putting a little humor into their suggestions. Now, having said that, it can be difficult sometimes while assessing online because you don’t get the chance to have a quick f2f on a daily basis with your students. When you do give feedback, most likely you are going to give more at one time because you don’t see the students daily to give verbal feedback though out the day here and there.
An idea for assessment “For Learning” would be to incorporate quick quizzes in my course before each module, so I have an idea of where all my e-learning students are in relation to the content and technology. This will give me an idea of where to focus my teachings and what, as a group or even as an individual, we should put more emphasis on within each module.
Students should be given a number of opportunities throughout an e-learning course to have a one-on-one discussion with their teacher. This is where the teacher can ask predetermined questions to see if students are achieving where they need to be. This gives the students a chance to ask questions for clarification and discuss the expectations within each module.
An online group project is a great way for students to showcase their learning within an e-learning course. It demonstrates what students have learned, and also what types of technology they have used to complete the task. An example of a product that a group may put together could be a slide show. A slide show is a great way to incorporate the use of technology, but also shows what students have learned and taken away from the course.
The topic that I chose to focus on for the backward design was the first unit in my Careers class. The unit is titled “WHO AM I?” In this unit we focus on getting each student to explore who they are as a person and what their interests are. We compile lists of student attributes, characteristics and skills that would be present in a great employee. We also explore past and present experiences that students may have that relate to the working world.
Students will be able to identify experiences, attributes and skills that they have that relate to being a good candidate for a job.
Students will create a resume that compiles all their important and relevant experiences, attributes and skills that will relate to the work force or a job of their choosing.

Recently, a trip to the cinema brought me to a realization. Comic books have a vast cultural impact these days, as evidenced through the trend worldwide behind Spidey-mania, and more recently, with Fantastic Four. And yet, there is a prevailing notion among the majority of people that comic books are delinquent at worst or lowbrow at best. The fact that there was such a dichotomy in the way people view comic books struck me as highly curious, and started me delving into its culture.
My interest led me to look for materials dealing with this culture, and through that search, to this book. The title of the book is a highly significative one. It suggests that the culture in America is highly connected to the comic book movement and industry. To this end, the author has divided the book into several chapters that were based on various comic book epochs, from its birth during the Great Depression (1933) to the more recent 1990s. Interestingly, most of these epochs have a strikingly close relationship to events in American history.
Wright showcases comic books as a potent force in cultural imagination. In the first chapter of the book, he shows us how comic books gave voice to the common man throughout the era of Depression. Elsewhere, such as in the chapter dealing with the years of World War II, he demonstrates the huge role comic books played in raising patriotism through propaganda. However, he does not shirk from controversy, discussing difficult issues in chapters such as “Youth Crisis” and “Turning Point”. Throughout the book, he remains balanced in his handling of issues such as censorship, racial, and gender concerns.
What is great for new comic book fans is that he includes a fair amount of excerpts, and cover art from old comics to emphasize his findings. However, the discussion sometimes centers on the more controversial crime and horror comics. In such cases, the images that are included can be quite graphic. He also includes interesting accounts such as origins of major characters, as well as the story behind Marvel’s success. Some of these anecdotes were pretty surprising, like the one about people viewing Superman as related to Nazism. For people interested in doing further research, he includes a very useful note on resources at the end of the book
Unfortunately, the author regards the culture of comic books as a distinctively American one, and as such, has chosen to place his focus highly on American culture. This means that European comics such as Asterix or Tintin, and Japanese manga as well as their impact on the culture of their respective countries are not discussed. This drawback is not so much an indication of the quality of the book, but rather a matter of the author’s focus of attention.
Despite this, the book still remains a highly entertaining and informative one. I would highly recommend this book, as it is a highly seminal one, and contributed greatly to my learning of comic book culture and history.

"Each friend represents a world in us, a world possibly not born until they arrive, and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born."
On yesterday, Oprah Winfrey canvassed for Democrat Stacey Abrams amid a fierce Georgia gubernatorial campaign against Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. The race has historical implications. An Abrams victory over would make her the first African American female elected governor in our nation’s history.
Myriad shenanigans have marred the 2018 mid-term election season, reminiscent of some of dark days of American politics. The Florida race for governor kicked off with a charismatic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, confronting challenger Ron DeSantis cautioning voters that to not go “monkeying this up” by supporting Gillum. And in Florida, authorities ordered seniors off a Black Voters Matter sponsored bus that was in route to an early voting location. Kemp was slapped with a a separate lawsuit that alleges his office’s purging of over 53,000 largely voter black pending registrations.
And yet, historians will remember Ms. Winfrey’s speech as one of the bright spots that appeals to our nation’s enduring aspirations.
Two speeches define the choice before the electorate. One by Ms. Winfrey and another by Donald Trump. Ms. Winfrey reminded an energized audience of the nation’s grinding march towards justice and harmony. Meanwhile, in a starkly different crowd, Trump threatened his authorization for U.S. military personnel to shoot any rock-throwers that show up at the Mexico/US border, having fled desperate conditions. As a pound of red meat hurled to his political base, Trump’s directive could result in the needless killing of a little girl or boy engaging in throwing pebbles.
Trump’s draconian caravan scare followed recent controversial statement. Namely, this he is a “nationalist”. Further, that his office vests powers to reverse birthright citizenship guaranteed in the 14th Amendment by way of an Executive Order.
In one week, Americans witnessed a rash of pipe bombs mailed to the residences of iconic figures, including President and Michelle Obama, actor Robert DeNiro, and billionaire philanthropist George Soros. As the nation struggled to absorb these heinous acts, Gregory A. Bush (51) fatally shot two black patrons – Maurice Stallard and Vickie Jones – at a Jeffersontown, Ky. Krogers grocery store. Subsequently, Robert Bowers (46) murdered 11 Jewish worshipers at a Pittsburgh, Pa. synagogue, to temporary bumps in the road that slowed Republican momentum. However, the current White House occupant reduced these tragedies to a temporary bump in the road that slowed Republican momentum.
Oprah’s hopeful future. Or Trump’s resurrected past. Perhaps past elections excessively invoke the mantra, “This election is most important of our times.” Obviously, we have lived through crises before and will face them in the future. However, the hyper-seductions inherent in Trumpism, coupled with a willing Republican apparatus that winks at some of the most charged political rhetoric witnessed in decades, poses serious consequences for the coming years. A Trump victory will embolden the very instincts are the center of the nation’s deepening chasm.
This mid-term election feels different because it is profoundly different. Ultimately, there is no middle ground. Which America will emerge from this season of hyper-polarization? Which vision will shape America’ foreseeable future?

Racing requires lots of money to do and sponsors/partners can help with this. However, sometimes funds may be covered and sponsors/partners are not needed. This means there might be a vacant area on the car that could be utilized for something else. It’s always important to utilize the space on your car and giving it away to a charity or good cause can benefit you and the people involved, maybe not with money but in media exposure in local communities and at the track. All of this can put you one step in the right direction to finding that partner or sponsor. Getting involved with charities, local communities, and other events can really help farm to network connections which in turn puts you another step closer to putting together a partnership. Plus it can be lots of fun!
Last year I did something really cool with a little green man of clay: Gumby! Most everyone knows about him and it makes for a fun twist on things. Gumby just happened to be started in my hometown of Glendora, CA and the city was trying to rebirth him by hosting an event called Gumby Fest. I saw this is an opportunity to get more involved with my local community and businesses. I called up the Chamber of Commerce to have lunch to chat about it, and before I knew it, I had Gumby plastered on the side of my MX-5 Cup Car.
I received a loner car from Mazda and contacted a local decal company to make a Gumby and Pokey vinyl wrap for it. This car was driven around and used as a prop for media, and our story was a hit! I appeared in a few different major newspapers in my community in the following weeks as I helped promote Gumby Fest. We also had a custom racing suit made along with a helmet to be auctioned off at the event to help raise money for the local library. I wore this suit in the race prior to the event to help leverage media at the track; those stories were then translated to media exposure down in Glendora. My involvement with Gumby Fest proved to be a powerful networking tool as I got involved with my community and attended rotary meetings in Glendora to talk about the event and my part in it. It also helped build my credibility to future partners.
The next Gumby Fest is at the end of September when I will be helping promote the event once again, this time with the added twist of involving another charity to the mix.

She bent over and said fuck me as hard as you can, make me cum with your dick and cum all over my face, I want to swallow it!!! Late at night, while correcting the tests, he gets another message from the same anonymous girl, at the same time, hearing his wife screaming from the bedroom upstairs!
Two lesbians playing on Omegle. As it turns out, these four totally hot babes were having a party. I could feel my cum boiling in my balls as my gf rode me. Thick ropes of hot saliva drip down the sides of her mouth and from my balls as I fucked her throat with my hard cock.

Hello and thank you for visiting my profile, and I hope to make your friendship. I am a single man liking the world over for my second half. I enjoy being outdoors and having an active life. Hunting and fishing, camping and hiking are some of my favorite things. I also enjoy exercising at the gym 5 or 6 days a week. I enjoy all types of food and especially a good diet of health meats and fish, I can cook really well and hope to find a woman who can enjoy a wonderful fun filled life together with.

Regular old peanut butter cups get a facelift! We’re making Mocha Almond Butter Cups today! Coffee flavored chocolate with creamy smooth almond butter inside. So good and completely dairy-free, vegan, naturally sweetened, and gluten-free!
Call it mocha flavored chocolate wrapped around an almond butter center or a, shall I say, better version of the ever so famous peanut butter cups?
A few different reasons make these cups better. Starting with the fact that there’s coffee in our almond butter cups. If that wasn’t enough, these are for my friends with peanut allergies. But also these are clean! As in there is no dairy or artificial sweeteners here. Plus they’re fit for vegans and those that follow a gluten-free diet.
I shared these a couple of weeks ago on Instagram, and within five minutes of my post going up, I got a message from my sister saying she ‘needed these in her life.’ And I have to say I agree. We all need these in our life. And by that, she meant she wanted the batch I made in her life. Younger siblings are always so spoiled, aren’t they? Needless to say, she tried them the next time she was over.
I couldn’t believe my ears when she said she loved them MORE than her beloved peanut butter cups. This is the girl that ate a peanut butter cup almost every single day during her middle school and high school days.
We’ll start with the ‘chocolate’ We’ll combine the melted coconut oil, cocoa powder, choice of sweetener and the espresso powder in a bowl to make our homemade vegan chocolate. You can play around with the amount of espresso powder you use. If you want just a hint of mocha, use 1½ teaspoons for more flavor you can use as much as 2 ½ teaspoons. Any guesses on how much we used and preferred?
Now drop a couple of tablespoons into a muffin paper-lined cupcake pan. Add a generous dollop of almond butter followed by another drizzle of the cocoa mixture. Add a pinch of sea salt if you’d like and then pop these babies into the refrigerator for a few hours. Can’t wait that long: pop it into the freezer for 30-45 minutes.
Take five. Unwrap a mocha almond butter cup, and savor every single bite. You get a hit of that mocha chocolate first, followed by creamy almond butter and it’s so hard to eat just one of these!
P.S. If you can get your hands on vanilla flavored almond butter, it works so well here. Like, way too well. And in our house, we’ve unanimously agreed that we’ll have a batch of these mocha almond butter cups in the fridge at all times. Oh and also, I’m usually not the biggest fan of maple syrup, but I have to say, you can’t even taste it here! It works beautifully as a sweetener so don’t be afraid to use it!
Line a muffin pan with cupcake liners. In a 4-cup measuring cup, whisk together the coconut oil, cocoa powder, your sweetener of choice, and the instant espresso powder. Start with 3 tablespoons of sweetener and adjust as desired.
Fill the prepared muffin cups with roughly 2 tablespoons of the cocoa mixture, don’t use more than half of the cocoa mixture. Place 2-3 teaspoons of almond butter on top and pour enough of the chocolate to cover the almond butter completely. You can also just press the almond butter down if it’s poking up.
Sprinkle with a pinch of sea salt and refrigerate for 3 hours or freeze for roughly 45 minutes to an hour! Repeat the process often.
I find using a ‘no-stir’ almond butter works best here. You don’t want to use one that has the oil separating from the butter easily.
These will last in the refrigerator covered for at least 2 weeks (but I don’t think they’ll be around that long!)

You’ve probably seen this many times where you generally spread the nice word about crypto. “It’s not unstable? What happens if the value crashes? ” sofar, several POS programs offers free transformation of fiat, improving some worry, but before volatility cryptocurrencies is resolved, most of the people is likely to be resistant to put up any. We need to discover a way to combat the volatility that’s inherent in cryptocurrencies.
Lots of people prefer to use a currency deflation, notably those that need to save. Despite the criticism and disbelief, a cryptocurrency coin may be better suited for some uses than others. Fiscal solitude, for instance, is excellent for political activists, but more problematic when it comes to political campaign funding. We need a stable cryptocurrency for use in trade; If you are living paycheck to paycheck, it’d take place as part of your wealth, with the rest earmarked for other currencies.
Ethereum is an unbelievable cryptocurrency platform, however, if growth is too fast, there may be some problems. If the platform is adopted fast, Ethereum requests could grow drastically, and at a rate that exceeds the rate with which the miners can create new coins. Under a situation like this, the entire stage of Ethereum could become destabilized because of the raising costs of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest Ethereum stage and ether. Instability of demand for ether can lead to a negative change in the economical parameters of an Ethereum based company which could lead to company being unable to continue to manage or to discontinue operation.
For most users of cryptocurrencies it’s not necessary to comprehend how the process functions in and of itself, but it is basically crucial that you comprehend that there is a procedure for mining to create virtual money. Unlike monies as we understand them now where Governments and banks can simply choose to print unlimited amounts (I am not saying they are doing thus, just one point), cryptocurrencies to be operated by users using a mining program, which solves the advanced algorithms to release blocks of monies that can enter into circulation.
Cryptocurrency is freeing individuals to transact money and do business on their terms. Each user can send and receive payments in the same way, but they also take part in more elaborate smart contracts. Multiple signatures allow a transaction to be supported by the network, but where a particular number of a defined group of folks agree to sign the deal, blockchain technology makes this possible. This allows innovative dispute arbitration services to be developed in the foreseeable future. These services could allow a third party to approve or reject a transaction in the event of disagreement between the other parties without checking their money. Unlike cash and other payment systems, the blockchain always leaves public evidence a transaction happened. This can be possibly used in a appeal against companies with deceptive practices.
Since among the earliest forms of earning money is in money financing, it really is a fact that one can do this with cryptocurrency. Most of the lending websites currently focus on Bitcoin, some of those websites you might be required fill in a captcha after a specific time frame and are rewarded with a bit of coins for seeing them. You can see the www.cryptofunds.co site to find some lists of of these websites to tap into the money of your choice. Unlike forex, stocks and options, etc., altcoin marketplaces have quite different dynamics. New ones are constantly popping up which means they don’t have a lot of market data and historical perspective for you to backtest against. Most altcoins have fairly inferior liquidity as well and it is hard to think of a fair investment strategy.
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listen for broadcast transactions on the peer-to-peer network and perform the appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners do this because they can bring in transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and new bitcoins in existence are under denominated formulas.
Only a fraction of bitcoins issued so far can be found on the exchange markets. Bitcoin markets are competitive, which implies the price a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand. Lots of people hoard them for long term savings and investment. This limits the quantity of bitcoins that are really circulating in the exchanges. In addition, new bitcoins will continue to be issued for decades to come. Hence, even the most diligent buyer could not purchase all present bitcoins. This situation is just not to imply that markets aren’t vulnerable to price manipulation, yet there is certainly no requirement for large amounts of money to transfer market prices up or down. The smallest events in the world market can change the price of Bitcoin, This can make Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency volatile.
You may run a search on the web. First learn, then models, indicators and most importantly practice looking at old charts and pick out trends. When you commence to keep a trading diary screenshots and your comment/forecast. Precisely what is the best way to get confident with charts IMHO. Oh certainly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking that you acquire the uptrend will never go lower! Always will go down! Viewers incremental benefits are more reliable and profitable (most times)
Entrepreneurs in the cryptocurrency movement may be wise to investigate possibilities for making enormous ammonts of money with various forms of online marketing.There could be a rich reward for anyone daring enough to brave the cryptocurrency markets.Bitcoin structure provides an informative example of how one might make a lot of money in the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin is an incredible intellectual and technical accomplishment, and it’s created an avalanche of editorial coverage and venture capital investment opportunities. But not many people understand that and pass up on very successful business models made available as a result of growing use of blockchain technology.
It should be hard to get more small gains (~ 10%) throughout the day. Study the best way to read these Candlestick charts! And I discovered these two rules to be accurate: having little gains is more rewarding than attempting to resist up to the pinnacle. Most day traders follow Candlestick, so it’s better to have a look at novels than wait for order confirmation when you believe the price is going down. Secondly, there is more unpredictability and reward in monies that never have made it to the profitability of sites like Coinwarz.
Here is the coolest thing about cryptocurrencies; they usually do not physically exist everywhere, not even on a hard drive. When you look at a unique address for a wallet featuring a cryptocurrency, there’s no digital information held in it, like in exactly the same manner that the bank could hold dollars in a bank account. It is simply a representation of worth, but there is no actual palpable type of that worth. Cryptocurrency wallets may not be confiscated or immobilized or audited by the banks and the law. They do not have spending limits and withdrawal constraints enforced on them. No one but the owner of the crypto wallet can determine how their wealth will be managed.
Mining cryptocurrencies is how new coins are put in circulation. Because there is no government control and crypto coins are digital, they cannot be printed or minted to make more. The mining process is what makes more of the coin. It may be useful to think about the mining as joining a lottery group, the pros and cons are exactly the same. Mining crypto coins means you will get to keep the full benefits of your efforts, but this reduces your odds of being successful. Instead, joining a pool means that, overall, members are going to have higher potential for solving a block, but the benefit will be divided between all members of the pool, predicated on the amount of “shares” won.
If you are considering going it alone, it’s worth noting that the applications settings for solo mining can be more complex than with a pool, and beginners would be probably better take the latter route. This option also creates a stable flow of earnings, even if each payment is modest compared to entirely block the wages.
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Ether, YOCoin, and many others happen to be designed as a non-fiat currency. Quite simply, its backers assert that there’s “real” value, even through there is absolutely no physical representation of that value. The value rises due to computing power, that’s, is the lone way to create new coins distributed by allocating CPU electricity via computer programs called miners. Miners create a block after a time period that’s worth an ever decreasing amount of currency or some type of wages in order to ensure the deficit. Each coin consists of many smaller components. For Bitcoin, each component is called a satoshi. The one who has mined the coin holds the address, and transfers it to a value is provided by another address, which is a “wallet” file stored on a computer. The blockchain is where the public record of all transactions resides. Most all cryptocurrencies function as Bitcoin does.
The fact that there’s little evidence of any growth in using virtual money as a currency may be the reason there are minimal efforts to control it. The reason for this could be merely that the marketplace is too little for cryptocurrencies to justify any regulatory effort. It truly is also possible the regulators just don’t understand the technology and its implications, expecting any developments to act.
The sweetness of the cryptocurrencies is the fact that fraud was proved an impossibility: due to the dynamics of the process by which it is transacted. All exchanges on the crypto-currency blockchain are irreversible. As soon as youare paid, you get paid. This isn’t something short term where your visitors may dispute or desire a discounts, or use dishonest sleight of hand. Used, many merchants would be smart to work with a fee processor, because of the irreversible dynamics of crypto-currency deals, you need to be sure that safety is challenging. With any form of crypto-currency whether it be a bitcoin, ether, litecoin, or some of the numerous different altcoins, thieves and hackers could potentially gain access to your personal keys and therefore grab your cash. Unfortunately, you probably will never obtain it back. It’s vitally important for you to embrace some very good safe and sound methods when dealing with any cryptocurrency. Doing so may protect you from all of these bad events.
In the event of a fully functioning cryptocurrency, it could also be exchanged being a product. Proponents of cryptocurrencies say that this sort of digital income isn’t manipulated by way of a key banking system and it is not thus subject to the vagaries of its inflation. Because there are always a limited variety of items, this cash’s worth is based on market forces, allowing owners to deal over cryptocurrency deals.
A woman in California is suing a hospital where she received a bone marrow transplant after she later had to undergo an amputation as a result of medical negligence during the procedure. The medical malpractice suit was filed last week.
The woman had a bone marrow transplant in 2004, which was successful. However, she alleges that the hospital where the procedure was performed did not provide her with vaccinations she needed after the transplant. The plaintiff later developed pneumococcal sepsis and had to have all of her toes, parts of her feet, and most of her fingers amputated. The amputation occurred in the ICU of a different hospital in 2011. The wounds resulting from her partial amputations of the feet will not heal, so she may require amputation of her feet entirely in the future.
The plaintiff alleges that she developed pneumococcal sepsis as a result of the first hospital’s failure to give her required vaccinations after her bone marrow transplant in 2004. While the transplant itself was successful, the lack of ancillary treatment eventually led to further complications. The pneumococcal sepsis needed to be treated using drugs that led a lack of circulation in her extremities, after which the only possible treatment was amputation.

It’s been a while since my last post. I’ve been working on some stuff, and dealing with the kind of roll-with-the-punches situations that life seems to be throwing at me lately.
I’m still playing with brain.fm. I don’t find it quite as effective, but it’s pretty close. I think letting the kid use it a couple of times moved it away from my optimum, but I’m slowly getting it back. I’ve settled on an average of 3000 words per day, one the days that I get anything done, but any time I try to switch back to one of my main projects, it plummets, which is frustrating. I think it’s because the practice projects have simpler storylines, so it’s easier to just sit and roll through it. I’m pantsing them too, which probably doesn’t help with the main projects.
Today, I plan to write a couple of scenes in The Wall Nuts, a few more in Proud Flesh, and a few more in a side project. It’s storming here, because Canada. Six inches of snow. I’ve decided that we all, collectively, need to buy Mother Nature a few drinks and get her laid. I keep checking my email and hoping that my daughter’s dance class is cancelled, lol. It feels like a pajama day. Brrrr.
Other than that, I’m still looking at late May for The Wall Nuts, simply because of editor scheduling. And I’m going to need to pick up some shifts at the old day job, because a couple of big bills just landed on my lap. I hate this in-between state, where I’m making almost enough to manage the household bills, but not enough to handle any emergencies. And this year has been one emergency after another, so it’s just proved the point that I’m not ready yet to chuck the day job and go whole hog at this writing thing. Close, but that only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. Maybe in another year, once I’ve got the major house repairs done, and a bit of money put away for emergencies. (Because heaven knows, they do seem to like me.)
My niece and nephew are thinking about moving out of the country to look for work, as well. Which means I’m expecting to inherit some of their menagerie. The girlchild may get her snake after all. And I may end up with some sort of lizard. And a dog. And possibly some birds. (Yeah, I wasn’t kidding about menagerie.)
So pray for me to have a snow day. Because I just realized I left the car windows cracked open and the car will be full of snow now. O.O

This scene is challenge scene #2 from 3drender.com. Jeremy Birn provided the models, and it was my job to create the textures and lighting rig. Here is the final render:
The challenge with any blank scene is properly portraying the emotion and feel that you so desire. Summer was uprising and I felt like creating a scene with lots of light and a rich back plate. Of course, lighting is nothing without textures, so I proceeded to texture all the elements of the scene. All the wood, fruit, glass, and wall textures are procedural. I projected textures onto the countertop, floor, and back plate.
Next comes the lighting, which was the main purpose of this project. I began with a directional key light to simulate bright sunshine:
What I've noticed in a lot of amateur CG scenes simulating sunlight, the intensity of the light is far too low; as if the artist was afraid to turn the intensity too high. I really wanted to simulate a hard beam of light flooding in from the window so my sunlight's intensity is somewhere around 3 with no decay (Maya).
Next were the fill lights. Although there is a bright sunbeam coming from the window, there will always be quite a bit more indirect light coming from the sky and grass outside, as well as from the room off-camera to the left. This is what these lights accomplish:
Even though my intent was to use final gather to simulate the bounce light within the room, there are always a few areas that final gather leaves too dark. This is where my bounce lights came in to play. I tried to simulate light bouncing off the walls and cabinets to brighten up the room a bit:
At this point it's looking really nice. Though, in reality if there was an intense beam of sun coming in to a room, that light would bounce several times before expiring. Having simulated a single bounce manually, it has added a lot of realism to the scene. However, to get a better simulation of reality, I turned on final gather to really drive the scene home. Here is the final render again:
Since the extent of this project was only to be a single frame, I didn't hesitate to use raytraced shadows for all of my lights. Although sunlight will naturally have crisp shadows, the bounce and fill lights have soft raytraced shadows that do a great job of simulating reality.
Aside from raytracing, one more thing that I added to my scene was soft, blurred reflections. On a surface like a wood table or a linoleum floor, the reflections aren't going to be crisp as they are by default. By turning up the mi_reflection_blur in mental ray to 1-1.5 (must increase reflection rays as well), you get the nice blurred reflections as shown above. Be avised, using heavy raytraced shadows and blurred reflections (as well as final gather) is not cheap. The final frame of this simple scene took 45 minutes to render.•••
This scene is challenge scene #1 from 3drender.com. Dan Wade provided the models, and again my job was to create the textures and lighting of the scene. Two slight modifications I did to the scene: I created new plum models for the scene, and I also made a new leaf for the apple. Here is the final render:
Like before, I was given a blank scene with no textures or lights. I wanted my real emphasis to be on realism. I wanted you to look at the final render and feel as if it were a photograph. Whether I reached my goal or not I'll leave up to you, but that was the approach I took to my texturing. My real challenge with texturing this fruit is that they are organic items that everyone is very familiar with; even the slightest flaw would register with the viewer. Another challenge was that these are spherical, organic shapes; not easily mapped to a texture.
I spent the next few days in my free time developing procedural textures for the fruit. There is subsurface scattering used on the grapes, but other than that it's all pretty standard 2D and 3D maps daisy chained and mixed together as shaders. There was a real emphasis on the specular, as that's where I believe sells the realism of the fruit.
On to the lighting! Once I was happy with the shaders (well, I'm never really happy with them - constantly tweaking) I set up my key light. I wanted to go for an overcast/indirect feel with light coming from a nearby window. With indirect or overcast light, the intensity isn't too high, and the shadows aren't too crisp. This is because instead of the light coming from a single point (sun, light bulb) it's scattering through a cloudy sky, diffusing the light in all directions. Here is my scene with the key light only:
As you can see the shadows aren't hard, but soft, diffuse shadows. Just with the key it sort of looks like moonlight. Now, for the fill light I wanted to imagine that the fruit was sitting in a bright room with warm-toned walls. I made the fill lights a warmer color. The warmth really takes the feel from moonlight to indirect sunlight:
So that is looking pretty nice for only a handful of lights. In reality, even if the light is diffused through clouds, there would still be a fair amount of light bouncing within the environment that the fruit is in. This means that there wouldn't be so many dark spots on and under the objects. So, since I elected not to use global illumination or final gather on this scene, I needed to take care of the dark spots manually. Here is how it looks when I have added some bounce lights to simulate indirect illumination:
Adding the bounce lights may seem nit-picky, but when realism is my goal, I can't cut corners. There is a nice difference on the orange. Now, last but not least, I have added some rim lights to the orange and the plums because I feel they are too dark on the right side. One kick light was added to the left side of the orange as well just to brighten it up a bit. Then, for the final composition I rendered out a depth map and added a small amount of depth of field to really make it look like a photograph:

Reinstalled the drivers netgeaf software and nothing, plugged it into another usb port and it starts working instantly. Image Unavailable Image not available for Colour: Hopefully, it continues to work this way Between Windows 10 and Netgear, I’m not sure who the winner is at failing. Never worked right from the git-go. Two stars for now because it’s stable at this time after eliminating the USB extender dock.
This was the last netgear product I will purchase. You don’t know when it will disconnect but mine won’t last 30 minutes, and if there is a big file to dload, it’ll disconnect during the transfer.
It would connect, disconnect, stop responding, freeze my netgear 3100, and more. There is a newer model of this item: Please try your search again later. The installation was simple and connected right away however, during operation the WiFi connection kept going up and down meaning, its connected one moment, then the next its netgear 3100 – Was simple enough to netgear 3100 reconnect but annoying as hell.
When netgear 3100 in through it’s docking extender, within minutes, I would first get a notice that I had lost netgear 3100 Internet connection, next my mouse would die, and finally the keyboard. Improve wireless performance from built-in WiFi in notebooks and desktops.
Furtherial was founded in 2007 by Baser Celebi, under the name of Extinction, in Istanbul / Turkey. After recording an underground and self-produced demo in 2008, the band was born into the Turkish metal scene. Although a record was done in that year, the band activated themselves in July 2009 and began taking stage at many cities in Turkey, mainly at Istanbul, Ankara and Bursa.
Following years they tried to record a new E.P but due to the member changes and some other problems; they could finish their recording session hardly in 2011. The band released a single in 2012 but after, they had to change their name to Furtherial due to there being many bands with the same name.
The name Furtherial doesn't exactly mean anything but it has generated by Baser Celebi, inspired by the word further That word expresses after life and the other side. So Furtherial holds a meaning like that belongs to the further, coming from the other side. The band recorded their first album Destroying Atropolis in Autumn 2013. Furtherial is currently working on their second album and expecting to finish recording by the end of 2014.
