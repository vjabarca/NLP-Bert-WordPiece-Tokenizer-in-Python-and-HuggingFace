LUST’s set of Medea is in equally strong contrast to a student spex, like a shadow theatre to a carnival. LUST clearly does not fear the pretentious, and they let the story be as heavy and dark as it is. Which feels like a fresh nip of air for those who sometimes suffocate in the student life.
The play premiered Tuesday and is played tonight, Friday, at 19.00 in the concert hall at AF-Borgen.
Not to be mistaken for Escape from Witch Mountain, even though this film has some parallels, Under the Mountain is based on the novel of the same name by New Zealand author Maurice Gee and is a relatively above average children/family action adventure film.
The two main protagonists in Under the Mountain are twins, Rachel (Sophie McBride) and Theo (Tom Cameron) who just lost their mother in a car accident. Unable to come to terms with his grief, his father sends them to Auckland where they stay with their uncle Cliff (Matthew Chamberlain), aunt Kay (Micheala Rooney) and cousin Ricky (Leon Wadham).
Although initially, the twins are apprehensive about their country move but as they explore the surroundings, they soon stumble upon a strange mystery that dates back to the 1800’s. This strange mystery is Mr. Jones (Sam Neil) who has the ability to control fire around the volcanoes of Auckland.
The twins soon learn that they are destined to help Mr. Jones who has been searching for these twins since 1879 and are required to defeat the Gargantuans, monster like creatures whose goal is to enslave the Earth for their masters, the Wilberforces.
At times, the children feel like the characters out of the recent Disney movie, Escape from Witch Mountain but interestingly enough, this is actually a more believable plot in terms of science fiction and fantasy. At times the story may be clichéd and over the top but the actors in the film, especially McBride, Cameron and Neil really captured the hearts of their characters which easily allowed you to form a bond with them. You actually cared for the characters.
Director Jonathan King (Black Sheep) also makes good use of New Zealand’s amazing landscapes and the cinematography is visually quite impressive with some amazing use of colours. This in turn relates well to the widescreen presentation with sharp images, vibrant colours and a perfect transfer to DVD. The soundtrack really rumbles at certain points that uses the surround sound technology well as does the immersive soundtrack.
In terms of extra, Under the Mountain contains commentary by Jonathan King and writer Matthew Grainger, a Making of Feature and some other trailers. It’s definitely a movie that can be watched by the entire family and considering that school holidays are coming, this is definitely a must have buy or rental. Recommended!
Driver San Francisco PS3 Review. Driver focuses on what any game called Driver should, and that is driving, and it does this well and anyone use to arcade racers will feel right at home.
The Driver series sees its beginnings back on the Playstation 1 and was one of the first games to feature a full city for players to drive around. This is a series that has definitely seen it’s ups and downs, unfortunately mostly downs in recent history. These days however it seems like every second game released features sandbox style game play and unrestrictive game rules. Does Driver: San Francisco offer enough old school driving mayhem to please fans of the series but still add something new so that it can stay relevant?
The story for driver has a huge influence on the game play for driver, this is because Tanner it put into a coma early on, this is not really a spoiler, this had been strongly hinted at and is basically revealed within half an hour of playing. You then spend the rest of the game trying to figure out what happened and tracking down a major criminal, with your sidekick along for the ride. The story sounds pretty average, the “and then I woke up” kind of storytelling, but it is handled in such a way that will actually allow you to be drawn into the story.
The fact that Tanner is in a coma has allowed the developers to add a completely unique game play element into Driver: SF, Tanner is able to leave his body and hover over the city, and then go into the body of anyone driving another car. This is certainly unique and can create some interesting strategies, for example, to stop a high speed pursuit you can possess a truck coming in the opposite direction and ram into the car. You can’t do this in any other game, it does seem odd that Tanner can’t simply stop the car they are chasing but I suppose he can make up his own rules while in a coma. Sometimes when jumping into another drivers body you can get involved in their conversations/arguments, on particularly memorable mission involved scaring a driving instructor when giving a student a hard time. It’s nice that Tanner doesn’t seem to take this new found super power too seriously and has time for things like this.
You would expect a game called Driver to have a good driving mechanic, fortunately this does not disappoint. Each car feels distinct enough for players to develop favourites over time and feel uncomfortable driving other types of cars. It definitely has an arcade feel to it and this feels just right, you will find yourself sliding your car, or somebody else’s car all over the road. Unfortunately there is no burnout button as there was in the original. There are a nice variety of side missions available that will let you test out these different cars and styles. The game does a good job of getting drivers to try out a range of different driving abilities. Speaking of driving abilities, Tanner’s abilities improve as the game progresses, such as the ability to ram other cars with more force and accuracy.
Driver seems to have a fairly average graphics engine, with minimal shading or shadows really visible. Character modelling and talking animations do look really good though and this really makes a difference in the quality of the cut scenes. All the cars that Tanner is able to drive having fully modelled interiors that look good, everything here is as it should be, this adds a lot to the experience. The world itself can look pretty bland, it would have been nice to have a bit more detail go into buildings, but this is not essential as the focus will generally be on driving. The whole game has a strange light yellow filter which gives it a real 70’s feel and I liked that , despite it being set in modern times they never felt out of sync with one another.
Some of the cars featured in Driver are meaty and growling beasts while others are perky and spritely sounding things, both ends of the spectrum are handled well and each car sounds as you would expect. The radio is nice and really has a 70’s feel without actually being 70’s songs, this aspect was handled nicely and really does add to the experience, we’re not talking about the level of radio as GTA but it never takes away from the driving. The voice work is also handled well and is complemented nicely by the character animations. Dialogue can get a bit long in some points but the voice actors do well to try and keep players listening and not skipping through cut scenes.
Driver focuses on what any game called Driver should, and that is driving, and it does this well and anyone use to arcade racers will feel right at home. If you are willing to overlook the gimmicky nature of transferring into other cars there is a good game in here, you do really have to buy into this completely to enjoy it though. There is nothing here that will ruin the experience, bar a couple of side missions here and there, and there is a lot of fun to be had. The story is not the strongest aspect of this game and nor should it be, you can’t get out of the car and walk around, the star of the show is the cars and it fits the Driver franchise to a tee.

SAN DIEGO – Rickey Henderson said he had no shot to get to third base on his ninth-inning double in last night’s 3-2 loss to the Padres, even if he had run hard all the way.
Leading off the ninth against closer Trevor Hoffman, Henderson hit a ball to left center that looked as if it had a distinct chance to clear the wall. Henderson jogged down to first base and tried to telepathically push the ball over the fence, saying “Get over there, get over there.”
But the ball hit off the base of the wall and Henderson was caught off guard and cruised at medium speed into second base.
“I thought it had a chance,” Henderson said. “It probably wouldn’t have made a difference. I don’t think I could have gotten to third base. I’m not one of those speedsters out of the box. I was saying, ‘Get out of here,’ but it didn’t work.”
“Oh yeah,” Bobby Valentine said. “He could have given himself a chance to get to third. But he’s not going to make the first out of the inning at third, that’s for sure. When I looked up, I was surprised he wasn’t at second. He was just at first when I looked back.”
As it turned out, he probably wouldn’t have scored from third anyway because Edgardo Alfonzo hit a grounder to Hoffman, John Olerud struck out and Mike Piazza grounded out.
* In the wake of firing Phil Garner and Sal Bando, the Brewers will begin interviewing replacement candidates and two Mets assistant GMs are prime candidates. The Brewers will undoubtedly ask for permission to speak with both Omar Minaya and Jim Duquette. Minaya was interviewed for the Dodgers job last year, but Kevin Malone was hired.
* Mike Piazza failed to break his own club record of homering in four consecutive games last night. It is a record he shares with five other players. Piazza did it earlier this season from May 17-21. Piazza was 0-for-3 with a sacrifice fly, giving him RBIs in six consecutive games. In that period, he is 10-for-20 with four home runs, eight RBIs and five runs scored. Over his previous five games, Piazza is 13-for-25 (.520) with four homers and 11 RBIs.
* While talking about Octavio Dotel’s no-hit bid Monday night, Valentine mentioned that the Mets had a couple of pitchers – Al Leiter and Kenny Rogers – who have thrown no-hitters. When someone pointed out that they hadn’t done it with the Mets, because no Met has ever thrown a no-hitter, Valentine shrugged.

This contemporary oil painting is based on a friend of mine who came to visit, that is her sitting on the wall. She was not very happy, problems with her boyfriend and a sense that life was passing her by. She envied my single status and the apparent freedom that bought. I for my part occasionally look on couples and remember some good times, wondering if I will have those feeling again.
Leafy green vegetables are known to be a good source of iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium vitamins A, C, K, folate (increases with cooked), antioxidant lutein etc. Canada’s Food Guide suggests 1 cup uncooked or ½ cup cooked as a serving (and recommends 7–10 servings of fruits/vegetables per day).
Well, If anyone can boomerang something back into style, it’s Victoria Beckham. Now, I must admit, she might be taking it too far by ordering spinach and just spinach while at restaurants. Apparently, she’s been upsetting some serious high-caliber chefs in LA by requesting a plate filled with only steamed spinach — read the full story here.
Not that the “recipe” took much work, I went ahead and put Victoria’s simple restaurant order in Meal Garden to see what a plate of spinach comes up with on our health meter.
But take a look at the nutrition facts and macro analysis for this meal and it becomes painfully obvious just what’s missing…protein and fat! Both essential elements for a healthy and nutritious meal.
As you can see, while this recipe has more fat, this fat is mainly “good” — with 22% of the calories coming from only monounsaturated fat (i.e. from the avocado and extra virgin olive oil). Furthermore, it offers a whole lot more dietary fiber (helps to keep your feeling full) and is still completely cholesterol free! Of course, it also offers protein which is extremely important as every cell in the body contains protein and is used in the formation of many molecules essential for life.
While Victoria is clearly missing some vital elements on her plate, there are still some useful take-aways here.
“A positive thing we can pull from this article is the cooking method for the spinach. In general, cooking vegetables breaks down the cells wall of the plant, and this can be beneficial in making nutrients more available for absorption. For example, as described by Leslie Beck, RD, spinach is high in calcium, but when raw it is bound to a compound, oxalic acid, which inhibits the amount available for absorption by the body. Therefore, cooking spinach will release the bound calcium. Cooking also improves the availability of iron and magnesium.
Similarly, steaming spinach would be preferred over boiling in water. The reason is that certain water-soluble vitamins may leach out of the food and become discarded in the water that it is cooked in. Examples are B vitamins (folate, thiamine, B6) and Vitamin C. The less water the food comes in contact with, the more vitamins retained.”
In summary, Victoria — thanks for the cooking tips, but I think I’ll be adding a few more ingredients to compliment my steamed spinach thank you very much!

So now that summer is over, you’ve most likely hung up those beach chairs, deflated the pool rafts, and tucked away your board shorts back into the bottom drawer. During the summer, we hang out with friends at local hot spots, neighborhood parties, and attend summer festivals. I did all of these and more this summer, but now it’s fall, and for most people, it’s back to work, kids back to school, and back to the weekly grind. Personally, I thought the time for outdoor partying was over. That can be true if you don’t live in Southern California. But here in my backyard, there’s a month-long, outdoor extravaganza that’s just getting started — Oktoberfest!
Anaheim, California is a bustling city of over 300,000 residents located smack dab in the heart of Orange County. It’s not well known outside of the local community, but Anaheim’s ties to the German tradition of Oktoberfest go back over 150 years when German wine-makers first settled the city. The city’s name translates in German as “home by the river,” as it runs adjacent to the Santa Ana River along its northeastern border. As the initial 19th-century German farming community continued to grow, residents from across the county gathered together each year in the fall to celebrate in the Bavarian tradition of their homeland.
While Munich, Germany leads the world in terms of October partying — millions of people make the annual visit for Oktoberfest — Anaheim does its fair share of picking up some of the beer drinking and sausage eating slack for the rest of the world. The German tradition of Oktoberfest began in the early 19th century as a celebration of the marriage of Prince Ludwig to Princess Therese. The local population of the time was invited to join in the festivities and celebrate with games and horse races. As the festival continued over several generations, it evolved into more of a tradition of celebrating food and drink, dancing and singing, with games and contests. This celebration of Bavarian culture continues in Anaheim today, at an out-of-the-way German community center known as The Phoenix Club.
Although Disneyland is the most recognizable name in the city, since 1961 The Phoenix Club has attracted thousands of visitors to the county’s longest-running Oktoberfest celebration. The festivities begin on September 18th and continue through October 31st (I know, I know! It’s “Oktober”). There is also another Orange County Oktoberfest celebration in the Old World area of Huntington Beach, but The Phoenix Club is well known locally as the more authentic and traditional venue. It’s common to see both club society members and attendees dressed in traditional Bavarian-style Lederhosen or Dirndl, as they cheerfully join in with ancestral German song and dance.
Recently, I was invited by a few friends to join them on Oktoberfest opening weekend (I figured this was a good time to go since the crowds would be minimal). Entering the grounds, the first thing I noticed were the members of the German community who work the front gate and ticket booths. This is a tight-knit neighborhood community that runs the fest, and the group was friendly and welcoming, in-line with their cultural traditions. I quickly noticed that many of my neighbors and friends were either attended the celebration or working as volunteers. I was even surprised to find out by some, that they were of German heritage.
As I strolled the festival, I was first greeted by a traditional Bavarian beer garden, (as if you would expect anything less), as smiling volunteers quickly handed out cold drinks to eager attendees. Of course, you have your choice of beers — German or Bavarian. Although the dark lager was a little rich for my palette, they do have a good selection of both Hefeweizen and lighter beers, some stronger than others. It is a beer festival after all, so I thought the only responsible thing to do was try them all. Inside the grounds, there’s a massive Biergarten tent where picnic style tables are lined up end to end in front of a raised stage. According to club staff, this setup follows the German tradition of sharing tables with friends as well as strangers. It was interesting to see the interior of the tent adorned with a unique variety of German beer and food sponsorship signs, all hanging alongside historical Bavarian banners and flags.
The festival includes traditional Oom Pah Pah bands play each day, and there is what I would call a “fusion” band that performs Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons. The night I attended, they rocked the house with a mix of German folk songs and contemporary rock music, played with a touch of a classic accordion. When you’re there, you can expect to see quite a few people dressed in traditional German garb joining in the songs and mingling with guests. Everyone in the tent, both young and old, seemed to be having a great time dancing and singing along with the band. Maybe it’s the beer, but when you looked around the tent, what were most noticeable were all the smiles.
Food booths dotted the grounds, offering visitors hearty samples of some traditional German fare for a decent price. Not only do they offer a good selection of German favorites that include Bratwurst, Roasted Chicken, Schnitzel, and Leberkase, but you can also grab a pretty tasty cheeseburger or hot dog with fries for the kiddies. The traditional food is popular with locals, and some will even sell out before night’s end, so if you’re hungry, you should get your grub on early. Besides eating and drinking, there are traditional dance shows, games, and contests throughout each weekend.
Oktoberfest is a great way to get outdoors with family and friends while the nights are still nice, and engage in celebration with the local community. The Phoenix Club may not be as well known as other attractions around Orange County, but if you want a healthy dose of authentic Bavarian culture, dress, music, and beer and food, then Anaheim is the place you’ll want to visit this October.
The celebration continues at The Phoenix Club every weekend throughout the month of October. Friday and Saturday feature nighttime hours only, from 5 PM until Midnight, and Sunday its open from 12 PM until 6 PM. There are no age restrictions, and there are activities the entire family will enjoy. You can find out more details by visiting www.thephoenixclub.com/oktoberfest.

I will never forget my first fly-in fishing trip to the Northwest Territories. Looking out the windows, as our floatplane circled the lodge on Great Bear Lake preparing to land, we were stunned by the transparency of the water. It was so pure and so clear, even from a couple of hundred feet up in the air, we could easily see the logs lying on the bottom of the bay.
It was an early lesson that I have subsequently relearned on every trip back. When you fish in the Northwest Territories, you expect the unexpected.
It was also a fitting introduction to the finest freshwater fishing on earth, and to steal a phrase from the classic movie, Casablanca, the start of a beautiful relationship.
Indeed, the fishing is not only as good today as it was back then, thanks to a strong catch-and-release ethic promoted by lodge owners, guests and the NWT Natural Resources agency, it is better.
Well, half way down Kasba Lake, one time, our guide swerved the boat quickly as the water erupted in front of us. I thought he was veering to avoid hitting a submerged reef or floating deadhead. Nope, it was a giant lake trout that was sunning itself inches under the water, out in the middle of the lake and he didn't want to run over it.
I thought he was joking, until several more trophy trout started splashing and cavorting like playful porpoises.
A short time later, my partner and I were trolling half-silver and half-gold Williams Whitefish spoons from which we'd removed the treble hooks, replacing them with barbless singles to which we had skewered five-inch long white curly tail grubs. It is one of my favorite NWT trolling tactics for lake trout because it so perfectly matches the ciscoes, whitefish, grayling and juvenile lake trout that the giants devour with glee.
As we trolled past some friends in another boat, however, who were trolling in the opposite direction, we watched as a huge lake trout smashed our buddy's bait and quickly stripped every inch of line from his spool. I kid you not, try as he did to tighten the drag and control the beast, the trout emptied his spool of line and left him speechless.
Now, how ironic is this: my partner felt a hit at the very same time, but from a much smaller fish that he reeled into the net without a lot of fuss. That is when I spotted something dangling from his hook. It was the loose end of our friend's line who had just been spooled.
I quickly grabbed the line as it streamed through my fingers and put it between my lips as I quickly reeled in my lure. Then, I tied the loose end on to my spoon via a triple surgeon's knot, threw it back over the side of the boat and wrestled a better than 40-pound lake trout into the net.
Some of the very best fishing that I have ever experienced in the Northwest Territories has come after I had pulled aside my guide and asked him if there was anywhere on the lake that he had yearned to fish, but hadn't had the chance yet to explore?
Invariably I have been greeted with starry eyes and tales of ghost-like lake trout and gargantuan northern pike, the size that which would chew off your leg.
"So, let's do it," I always say, and I've never once been disappointed with the decision .... or the results.
Like the time I popped the question to my guide, Cubby, and was regaled with whispered tales of The Dome, a mysterious hidden hotspot at the far end of the lake, that was allegedly festooned with giant lake trout.
Well, forget the hype, because The Dome proved to be even better than its advance billing. It is where my buddy, Mark and I landed 20 lake trout weighing between 20 and 40 pounds and watched mammoth fish literally swim out of the top of a wave and into the air as they chased after our lures.
In fact, the fishing was so outlandish, when we pulled onto the tip of a nearby island to enjoy shorelunch - what, you never eaten fresh fish, cooked over a crackling driftwood campfire - I grabbed a spinning rod from the bow of the boat and made a cast out to deeper water while Cubby prepared our feast.
On my very first cast, I felt a jolt and hooked a 24-pound lake trout, followed by far too many of its hefty brothers and sisters to tally. If it was the first time I had seen it happen, I would have said it was a pleasant, unanticipated, unforeseen, surprise.

What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. — Zig Ziglar
While they care about outcomes, they are more concerned with who they are becoming than where they are going.
“Follow your passion, be prepared to work hard and sacrifice, and, above all, don’t let anyone limit your dreams.” — Donovan Bailey
They have found a way to tailor their lives in a way that allows them to spend their time doing what they love.
Don’t get me wrong, they work hard and make sacrifices along the way, but while doing the things that they love the most.
They are happy because they surround themselves with positive and optimistic people who help them reach their goals.
“I am happy because I’m grateful. I choose to be grateful. That gratitude allows me to be happy.” — Will Arnett
They are content with what they have and they count their blessings instead of lusting after the next shiny object.
They don’t feel like that have to go out and buy things to be happy. They are genuinely thankful for the things that they have already been blessed with.
They have found that serving others is a great way to experience positive changes in their own lives.
Instead of fighting these situations, they have learned to accept things as they are and make the best of the situation.
“Looking good and feeling good go hand in hand. If you have a healthy lifestyle, your diet and nutrition are set, and you’re working out, you’re going to feel good.” — Jason Statham
They know that taking care of their body affects their energy levels, ability to focus, and their feelings.
If you want to find the sliver lining in your life, become extraordinarily happy and create the life of your dreams, check out my checklist.

We have known them outside of the womb for one hundred and eighty nine days. We have known each other as parents for one hundred and eighty nine days.
It’s bittersweet. Whilst I adore the babies that they are right now I feel such an intense longing for the babies that they were then, the newborns that I barely got to know in the chaos of an additional hospital stay, half my life spent on the breastpump (neither baby ever learnt to latch on properly and we gave up on asking the NHS to snip their tongue ties) and family stresses.
In retrospect I wish that we had shut our doors for the first month and focused on us as a family – but nobody is quite sound of judgement in the first month of their babies’ lives and the mental fog is doubly worse with twins!
I look at pictures of them as they were and I can barely believe that they were ever so tiny, so helpless. That they were strangers to us.
They are changing every day. This week Balthazar weighs 16lbs 4oz and Lysander weighs 17lbs 8oz. They are fascinated with toys and understand how most of their rattles and shakes work. They have a range of noises that are evolving daily. We are beginning to try them on actual human food; Balthazar seems to favour strong flavours – olives and hummus are never rejected – and Lysander enjoys the bland – plain yoghurt – and sweet fruit.
Sometimes I look at them and I can see who they will become with time: the five-year-olds racing through the woods, the students with their heads down at their desks.
Sometimes I can’t believe how big they now are. Other times they snuggle in to sleep and they still seem so small.
Can you believe that I created these, that I grew these people? That they came from my body? I know, I know – they’re not the first babies in the world, I’m not the first mother to have a child – but it astounds me.
Well – it hasn’t been as much of an adaptation as I had anticipated that it would be. Finances are tighter with two new dependents and just one of us working. That has been challenging at times; budgeting has never been my strong point and babies are a slippery slope of expenditure! Kirsty loves to splurge on toys – the brighter and louder the better – and I am all about the clothes. We never went out very much and the places that we did go to were dog-friendly, which makes them almost automatically baby-friendly as well.
The most difficult adjustment? We have to be less selfish with sharing each other. Kirsty is the other half of me, she’s been my best friend since childhood – I’ve never been good at sharing her. That said, our relationship is truly stronger than ever. I’ve been privileged to witness my incredible other half doing what she does best – being a mother – and I’m constantly overwhelmed with admiration for her in her new role.
They have brought a lot of brightness to our lives. They make us smile every day. They have rewritten my five year plan, my ten year plan.
For the first month of their lives, every Thursday at 4.01 and 4.03 we would stop what we were doing and kiss them on the heads, first Balthazar and then Lysander, and tell them how glad we were to have them. That tradition fell into disuse but oh, we are.
Such beautiful words and images. Creating a human has to be one of THE best superhero powers. Creating two at once? Truly amazing 😉 Happy six months.
oh what a beautiful post! Happy six month birthday boys!! Your family is truly beautiful and you always look so happy and content together, that’s definitely a superpower worth having!
Beautiful post! happy half birthday boys! you write so beautifully with a heart at its fullest. just lovely xx
I love reading your posts, and I think you summed up how I feel about mu little lady. I don’t remember her as a baby at all, I didn’t take as many photos as I should have and don’t even ask about video. We were so busy trying to get through the fog of becoming a four with the added bonus of special needs. Please can I have that time again. As always I love all of your photos x
I LOVE the jungle outfits you found, just perfect! How crazy that six months has passed already, and that only six months has passed as well. They look so happy, you look so happy, I keep imagining the dog smiling too, although I don’t think dogs really smile, do they?
what a lovely post, and yes its true they have changed, but every 6 months is another change, maybe by a year they will be walking etc, life flies by so fast.
Love how you talk about the bond between you two as parents, yes that relationship changes ans matures as well.
I'm Amber, and Meet the Wildes is a modern love story about two women who fell in love, and the family they made together. Mostly I write about my life with my partner, Kirsty, and our two sets of twins - boys born in October 14 and girls born in July 16. And now with a little November 18 baby on the way!

Cesar is 'the boss', the one everyone hates, the one some flatter and the one nobody tells the truth; the great successful businessman is on the edge of the precipice. One night his actions crumble down, his partners betray him and his wife kicks him out of the house. Entrenched in his office, he tries relentlessly to recover his company and his life. But he will not do it alone, César will find a very special ally, Ariana, the cleaner of the night shift.
The echo command writes character strings to standard output. String s are separated by spaces, and a new-line character follows the last String parameter specified. If no String parameter is specified, a blank line new-line character is displayed. Normally you could distinguish between a flag and a string that begins with a hyphen by using a — double hyphen.
Since no flags are supported with the echo command, a — double hyphen is treated literally. The echo command recognizes the following escape conventions:.
After shell expansion, the echo command writes the output based on the escape sequences in the input. Refer to the Backslash Reduction table for an example comparison of how backslashes in a command are first reduced by the shell and then by the echo command:.

In the original 4chan thread where the hacker first posted the images, the consensus was that Apple's iCloud service Sluts in bryn common to blame. But Celeriity likely is it that Apple's encrypted cloud service led to the mass hack, and what phootos the other ways that the nude photos could have emerged?
It's unlikely that someone has broken into Apple's iCloud service. Instead the photos most likely emerged due to a type of hacking known as "social engineering. Apple has patched a security flaw in iCloud that could Celerity naked photos been used to hack celebrity accounts. Jennifer Lawrence is known to use phoots after she let slip in a red carpet interview with MTV this year that naoed frequently has trouble with the service, remarking "My iCloud keeps telling me to back it up, and I'm like, I don't know how to back you up.
However, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead claimed on Twitter that the leaked photos of her included in the hack were taken "years ago. Various naked celebrities are photographed nakee selfies with Android devices and webcams. Leaked videos could not have originated from the iCloud photo backup service. The Celerity naked photos of devices and media may mean that another backup nzked like Dropbox nakfd Google Drive nakde be the originator of the leaked photos, with both services offering automatic backup tools Celerity naked photos photos and videos imported from cellphones.
Snapchat Several of the leaked celebrity photos had text overlaid, which indicates that at least some of the photographs were first sent through Snapchat. While Snapchat has struggled with security issues in the pastit's unlikely that the app was the source of all the nude photos. Rather, it may be that it was either accessed as part of a larger hack, or screenshots of images received through the app were discovered after hacking into a backup service.
A hacked insider Many celebrities don't manage their devices themselves, instead they hand them over to an assistant to do all the boring things like backing up photos or managing iCloud accounts. The sheer number of photos involved in this hack suggests that someone has been saving up naked photos for a while.
Other than the celebrities themselves, the only other people with access to these photos would be the "insiders" who help celebrities get around from day to day, such as personal assistants and bodyguards. If a well-connected and scheming personal assistant had their personal backup account hacked, it could result in a trove of photos similar to what we've seen posted online.
A stolen laptop or phone The leaked photos seemingly originate from a variety of different devices, and two of the videos of British actress Jessica Brown Findlay were made to send to a friend. Could the leaked photos come not from an online hack, but from the physical theft of a phone or laptop belonging to a well-connected celebrity who had been hording naked photos of their friends? While it may seem unlikely, there's actually precedent for unfortunate celebrities losing their devices.
In early it was reported that Lindsay Lohan and her management were doing "whatever it takes" to try and retrieve a stolen laptop that had gone missing during a trip to China. The laptop's hard drive was reported to contain naked photos of the star, as well as private correspondence with other celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Woody Allen. It's unclear whether Lohan's team were successful in reclaiming the laptop, but no leaked photos of the actress have emerged this year.
A hacker collective The original 4chan thread where the leaked photos surfaced included two different users posting new leaks. It's possible, then, that the trove of leaked celebrity photos came from not a single hack, but a group of enterprising hackers pooling their resources to try and earn the biggest reward.
The 4chan user who posted the majority of the photos was soliciting for Bitcoin donations in order to publish more leaked snaps. Could the leaked photos result from a collective gang of hackers sharing their photos in one giant leak in order to maximize the amount of money gained? It's certainly possible, many of the photos in the batch were proven as fake, meaning that they likely came from a variety of sources with varying levels of access and credibility.
The Def Con conference is often touted as an example of the dangers of using venue Wi-Fi for awards or conferences, with the conference operating a "Wall of Sheep" to showcase the various attendees who have been hacked.
A stolen laptop Celerity naked photos punk The had photos seemingly originate from a persona of different devices, and two of the songs of British clock Jessica Technology Findlay were made to home to a friend. The Def Con dad is often touted as an album of Celerity naked photos dangers of playing venue Wi-Fi for stories or conferences, with the public operating a "Reason of Sheep" to tell the various attendees who have been compared. Other than the songs themselves, the only other features with guitar to these photos would be the "songs" who are celebrities get around from day to day, such as out assistants and bodyguards. The laptop's thinking drive was punk to contain song photos of the star, as well as eclectic correspondence with other politics such as Lady Central and Woody Larry. In the experienced 4chan other where the hacker first commanded the images, the consensus was that Moment's iCloud service was to tell.

The coral reef structure buffers shorelines against waves, storms, and floods, helping to prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion. When reefs are damaged or destroyed, the absence of this natural barrier can increase the damage to coastal communities from normal wave action and violent storms.
Several million people live in U.S. coastal areas adjacent to or near coral reefs. Some coastal development is required to provide necessary infrastructure for coastal residents and the growing coastal tourism industry.
However, the impacts of coastal development (e.g., marina, dock, and bridge construction, dredging to replenish beaches) and polluted runoff from coastal areas can damage coral reefs over the long term. Therefore, the health of coral reefs depends on sustainable coastal development practices that protect sensitive coral ecosystems and the creatures that reside there.
A spring tide—popularly known as a "King Tide"—refers to the 'springing forth' of the tide during new and full moon.
A neap tide—seven days after a spring tide—refers to a period of moderate tides when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other.
A spring tide is a common historical term that has nothing to do with the season of spring. Rather, the term is derived from the concept of the tide "springing forth." Spring tides occur twice each lunar month all year long without regard to the season. Neap tides, which also occur twice a month, happen when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other.
Tides are long-period waves that roll around the planet as the ocean is "pulled" back and forth by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun as these bodies interact with the Earth in their monthly and yearly orbits.
During full or new moons—which occur when the Earth, sun, and moon are nearly in alignment—average tidal ranges are slightly larger. This occurs twice each month. The moon appears new (dark) when it is directly between the Earth and the sun. The moon appears full when the Earth is between the moon and the sun. In both cases, the gravitational pull of the sun is "added" to the gravitational pull of the moon on Earth, causing the oceans to bulge a bit more than usual. This means that high tides are a little higher and low tides are a little lower than average.
These are called spring tides, a common historical term that has nothing to do with the season of spring. Rather, the term is derived from the concept of the tide "springing forth." Spring tides occur twice each lunar month all year long, without regard to the season.
Seven days after a spring tide, the sun and moon are at right angles to each other. When this happens, the bulge of the ocean caused by the sun partially cancels out the bulge of the ocean caused by the moon. This produces moderate tides known as neap tides, meaning that high tides are a little lower and low tides are a little higher than average. Neap tides occur during the first and third quarter moon, when the moon appears "half full."
NOAA’s tide and tidal current predictions take into account astronomical considerations due to the position of the moon and the sun.

Modified Arts presents “Within & Out,” a printmaking group exhibition about the inner dialogue that happens inside our heads. A reflection on the negatives and positives, the differences and similarities, and the choices and outcomes that are bound by the nature of our humanity. A glimpse into the wide variety of decision making processes we apply to our individual existence and creations.
The artists in this exhibition are all students of the printmaking tradition. Each of these printmakers are at different stages in their exploration of the many processes within the print-making practice. Lithography, photolithography, serigraph, intaglio, and photogravure are some of the ones shown in this exhibition. Each artist uses different techniques and combinations of processes to arrive at their final works. Brandon Meged, Lauren Kelly, Ethan Roads, Sofia Maria Paz, and Andrew Caruso use printmaking as a vehicle to allow you a glimpse into their conscious and subconscious minds.
Brandon Meged creates out of the struggle to bring opposing elements into harmony, delving deeply in to the subconscious, and often interpreting his dreams through his work. Lauren Kelly is concerned with helping herself and others move past the roughest and darkest parts of the human psyche through her contrasting use of heavy subject matter and bright colorful palettes. Ethan Roads carries his camera everywhere he goes, documenting his experiences as they manifest; through his discovery of the hybrid photolithography process, he adds layered philosophical meaning to his compositions. Sofia Maria Paz combines the classical and modern with traditional mass production print processes to evoke narratives that aim to stimulate conversation about deeply difficult and often taboo subject matter. Andrew Caruso‘s lithographs explore a variety of issues ranging from human psychology, moving towards a sustainable future, and our place in the cosmos.
The meditative process of printing allows for a ruminating experience, one which is translated into an ink impression on the surface of paper. These processes bridge the gap between what is inside of our heads and what we do in the world. This group of artists focus on bringing out what is within them to create ripples of change in themselves and potentially those around them.

1941. WWii. the second lieutenant Nikolai ivushkin, commander of a t-34, engages in an unequal battle against the tank ace Klaus Jager in a battle near moscow. His mission is more of a suicide - to destroy a dozen german tanks, all by himself. that said, luck does favour the bold. He wins the battle, barely survives, but loses his tank and lands himself in captivity for three long years... there was little to no chance for ivushkin and Jager to meet again, but the war knows how to throw a curve ball.in the spring of 1944, the Wehrmacht commands Jager to take charge of the ohrdruf re range and turn it into a training center for elite german armored forces, using the latest t-34 as a running target. this is how Jager and ivushkin cross paths again. Jager o ers ivushkin to become the commander of a legendary tank and pick his crew from fellow camp prisoners. Nothing goes according to plan, though, when ivushkin uses exercises for a daring and carefully planned escape.

In this small article we make not technical data of the side-by side comparison. Would rather we give you opinions from both sides - Microsoft and SAP. Both products were for medium-sized enterprises in the United States, Europe (but Microsoft Great Plains - leaves Dynamics GP version 10.0 - the continental Europe market somewhere in 2008, where Microsoft business solutions will probably put on Microsoft Dynamics NAV - again, this is contingent on progress with project green or now Microsoft Dynamics project). We come to the subject:
o strengthen Microsoft Dynamics GP. Microsoft, and the leader in operating systems, Office products, and also such platforms such as Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server - can now utilize ERP technology infrastructure, including ERP integration: SQL heterogeneous queries, SharePoint Workflows, web portals. At the same time, long time on the market for such products such as Microsoft Outlook Microsoft the opportunity offers, count on Outlook user experience - Microsoft Dynamics products need no user training (from the interface intuitiveness view) – Microsoft Dynamics CRM Outlook client, Microsoft Dynamics GP have closer integration with Outlook to version 9.0. It is some comments on another Microsoft product - Microsoft Small Business Accounting - integrated where to create invoices and to promote Outlook contacts to your MS-SBA customers with MS Outlook.
o SAP business one. This product was bought by SAP of Israel software development company four years ago. The driven reason was probably the need, enter into small and medium-sized customers, as well as SAP requires such product multilanguage and complex international taxation rules easily adaptable. SAP business one has CRM, ERP/production modules and technical ERP/MRP/CRM for production or maintenance subsidiary of large companies may be used as. SAP business one has modern architecture and design, and this is what might be, select one of the strengths of decision making ERP platform. Microsoft Office must SAP business one integration — e-Mail via MS Outlook client / SMTP to it and to integrate with MS Office on the level of COM objects
o Microsoft Dynamics arguments. At the time when Microsoft Dynamics / Project Green enable Microsoft ERP products work with Microsoft Office technologies, SAP several years behind in this direction is work. SAP is currently shrinking enable Microsoft SAP MySAP integration with Microsoft Office. Microsoft has this strong argument against SAP business one - SAP sets industry experts, which very much and probably business and industry vertical consulting implements come ERP from medium-sized enterprise in General ERP/MRP consulting and expertise first. The result is longer implementation cycle, as well as complexity with SAP business one integration with technology innovative and legacy products
o SAP business two arguments. Microsoft tries to resolve, technical solutions and technologies. It's excellent ERP platform enough, if we give you, which has plus allows good integration tools for Microsoft Office integration with Windows platform itself – can ASP.NET or c#.NET (our comment - can your SAP business one communicate with the outside world with such non-Microsoft platforms as IBM Lotus Notes Domino and Lotus Notes as a document workflow)
o additional Microsoft arguments. There are Analytics out there on the ERP strategic research market, Microsoft in the opinion to the support that business one need SAP technological advances (e.g. development, own Office platform, or more closely with Microsoft Office products) to stay current with the ERP market in 2010...
o additional considerations. SAP has change of course additional bells and whistles, such as language - you can switch keyboard shortcut Cnrtl German, French or Portuguese (Brazil), US English. Microsoft Dexterity has been in previous lighting technician and supports a nice feature and Unicode - not such the question asked by the view from China, India and Arab world.
With each new release of Microsoft Office, it seems that in Microsoft's wisdom, that they decide how change, we are the modest merge. In earlier versions of Microsoft Word such as such as Microsoft Word 2000, the process for performing a mail merge was simple. The first step was to create the data source, which was a Microsoft Word document with a simple table in it by default. The next step was that create main document that could be a letter or a brochure. Then the third step was your fields add to perform the main document and then finally the merge.
In Microsoft Word 2003 when you start a new mail merge you should be then the data source that you create a Microsoft Access database aware, that you in fact is not to Microsoft Word document as a data source. To some degree, I welcome this step because I am a passionate supporter, who in fact should all raw data stored in a database of some kind, it does not matter, whether of a Microsoft Access database, a MySQL database or SQL Server. The reason for this is that the database allows it is much more stable as a Microsoft Word document users more than once to use this data and a database, especially if you are working with large amounts of data. You will also notice that the Microsoft Access database, created from the mail Merge Wizard is very simple and contains only a single table with the fields you defined.
The cool thing Microsoft has done with this, is that store your raw data in a Microsoft Access database, you change it in the future this data with other applications allows. Actually, it's much easier to move data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, or even in a system of commercial database such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access. The new merge functionality, you can filter and sort your data also easy. Another important advantage is that the filter can you on what data you actually want to include in the mail merge process.
I have the problem but is to do with the new Microsoft Word 2003 mail merge process the complexity of a merge. Especially the long winded way, you must insert the merge fields in your document. In earlier versions of Microsoft Word application, such as Microsoft Word 2000 you could add your main document at once simply each merge field. In Microsoft Word 2003 you must first open the mail merge field dialog box each time you want to add a field. That of right, need to add each field by selecting the field and then insert the merge field, and then close the dialog, and then repeat this step for each field. I find more annoying than anything else.
We could of course manually enter each field with the key combination CTRL + F9 (used, insert a field), but a lot of work is that I agree. I think, in future, this is something that Microsoft changes, but I think that only time will tell versions.
I think all in all, this new Microsoft Word 2003 mail Merge Wizard is a positive step, but be a little overwhelming and confusing for the user that the merge can process earlier.

My sister-in-law has a little girl due at the end of April, and I have been wanting to make something for the baby. I know what you're all thinking, but I was trying to think of something that didn't involve any sewing. When my mother-in-law mentioned that she hadn't been able to find a mobile that worked with her crib, the wheels started spinning and I thought of these rosette balls. So I took a peek at my craft stash, and headed out to Dollar Tree. They didn't have any styrofoam balls, but they did have wiffle balls, which I thought would do just perfectly. I also grabbed some white crepe paper, and a dream catcher because I knew I'd need some sort of hoop, and you can't beat one for $1!
I then took one of my wiffle balls, looped some ribbon through 2 holes and tied it up, with a little hot glue under my knot to keep it secure. (I don't want my niece to get knocked on the head by a rose-covered wiffle ball while she’s trying to sleep!) I knew that a little bit of the ball would be visible between the roses, so I wrapped the balls in crepe paper first, by taking 3 short strips, wrapping each one around the ball, and hot gluing the ends of the paper down. It didn't lie completely smoothly, but it was a good foundation to stick the roses onto and covered up the wiffle ball evidence.
House of Smiths gives a great illustration on how to make these roses, and was the inspiration for this idea. But basically, you make a base for the rose with a little line of hot glue on the end of a strip of crepe paper (mine were about 14 inches long). Fold the paper over the line of glue, and from there, you simply roll the base of the rose, while twisting the excess crepe paper. I varied wrapping the paper tightly and sometimes wrapping it a bit more loosely to give the rose a nice blossoming look, and stopped periodically to add a drop of glue to keep the rose from unraveling. This may seems a little confusing, but it is super easy and after a little fumbling, you can fly through making them. (You will get hot glue gun strands everywhere though, as you can see in these pictures.)
I trimmed the stem off the bottom of the roses, and then glued them onto the balls, starting with 3 around the ribbon strand, and then worked down from there.
The nursery is painted a lime green color with this Geo Girl bedding from Target, so I wanted to use crepe paper colors that coordinated with the bedding: light pink, dark pink, blue, purple and white. I couldn't find any purple crepe paper at Wal-Mart, so I just got purple tissue paper and used that instead. The end result is similar, but it is certainly more slippery to work with. I just lined the tissue paper up on my cutting board, cut the width into 1 1/4 inch strips, and started rolling and gluing.
Once my roses were glued down to the balls, I noticed that the center of the blooms was really prominent and the balls almost looked like they had little points all over them. So I got some sharp scissors and snipped off the center of those blooms. It gave the flowers a nice little ruffled effect in the middle, so I ended up doing this with each of the roses on all of the balls. It made for a flatter, more rounded surface on the balls as well.
I ended up with 4 rose wiffle balls, and covered 1 four-inch styrofoam ball with white roses, so that she would have a few options as to which balls to pair with the crib.
Also these rosette balls are available in my etsy shop here, with the colors customized to your preferences.
Love it! I used the same ring thing for Laurele's bumble bee mobile. I don't think I would be patient enough to make the roses so perfect! Yours look amazing!
very pretty! I love these little flowers! I'm dropping by from Cottage Instincts. I hope to see you back at my place soon! until later...

Wow, this is wonderful! I linked on last weekend's weekly roundup and am just now (yikes!) finally getting around to comment. I never made a mobile for my daughter... maybe if we're blessed again I can whip one up! Thanks so much for sharing -
I love this project. I have to talk one of my friends into having a little girl so i can make it for them. :)
Aww this is so CUTE! I like how you used crepe paper. That is something I always forget to try to use. I think you could do a lot with the rose covered balls. Great idea!

I only just learned about Arctic® apples, marketed as non-browning apples. They achieve this by adding extra copies of the polyphenol oxidase gene, thereby inducing gene silencing.
Polyphenol oxidase is the enzyme responsible for turning the white flesh of an apple brown after exposure to oxygen, by catalyzing the oxidation of polyphenols to o-quinone, which can autopolymerize and/or cross-link with other molecules that contain phenol rings including the amino acid like tyrosine to form melanin.
Aesthetics aside (I know lots of people don’t like eating brown apples even if they’re otherwise fine), I do wonder if this really extends shelf-life, since the mushiness/mealiness is due primarily to the degradation of cell walls.

Skateboarding is one of the most exciting, daring and adventurous games. The electric skateboard is very versatile, portable and easy to drive with a minimum of effort. In addition, they are an environmentally friendly way of traveling.
There are many types of skateboards that decide the final passion of skaters. Long, normal and short skateboards are easy to find. The shape of the skateboard body is very important for the type of tour that will be played. Keeping the extraordinary passion of people, electric skateboards are also available on the market. The best thing about electric skateboarding is fixing the battery from the Electric Skateboard manufacturer. The battery provides the power to ride on a skateboard and the skater does not need to slide the skateboard with his feet.
Most electric models offer the possibility of driving at a constant speed, which can be of the order of 11 mph. It is possible to have great control over the speed of the electric skateboard. For example, the conventional model has the potential to go extremely fast downhill, while its flat speed on a sidewalk is as fast as the power of the leg. The speed will remain constant both on a flat road and on a hill with a slope that has an angle of about 15 degrees. In addition, with the ability to travel at a constant speed, it will be easy to reach a destination on time. As well as to have more control over the speed of the skateboard, there is also the possibility to reduce the speed and even to use a reliable braking system.
The electric skateboard is a very versatile product and often offers the possibility to switch from an electrical unit to a manual unit. For example, the ability to perform tricks in a skatepark is much easier with manual push style. After the fun action in the park, the electric function can be reactivated to make the trip faster and easier.
No need to push constantly, it is less likely to wear out after traveling around the city. The travel distance for a single battery charge may vary by model, but can be up to 25 miles or more. In addition, they are as easy to charge between each use as a smartphone or similar device. Because you do not have to put in a lot of effort, you will not feel exhausted even after a relatively long trip.

If you don't like this regimented/form orientated shooting, you don't need to comment. DON'T DO IT BECAUSE I DO IT, DO IT BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU.
Second of two places where the bow is touched. It's as important as the grip and probably more complicated.
The hook is somewhat problematic because of the length difference of fingers. To add to that is the difference in the location of the joints, that the string rides in, on those different length fingers. If you look at that last sentence it rules out shooting with the string on the tips of the fingers. I'm not saying you can't shoot off the tips of your fingers, but I will say that you won't have as good a release as if you have a deep hook. (IF need be we could get into particulars to back up that statement, but it's kind of a no brainer to me, BUT then again this is the Leatherwall) Very much like shooting a glove, it puts you behind the 8-ball.
IF you look at your fingers with the Boy Scout salute, you'll most likely see 3 different locations of the first joint on each finger. My fingers has the first and third finger joints pretty close together with the middle being about a half inch different than the first. If I crook my fingers like they're holding the string, my second and third are almost in line. It does me not good, I want my joints in a straight line – but they're not!!!
If I go to Rick McKenney to see what I should do, he has a picture of all three joints in a row – straight line!!! Further he has the string on those three in a row joints riding on the inside of those joints. Meaning in the direction of the palm of the hand!!! Keep that in mind.
If I go to KSL, he starts off with a hook that can make things easier for the 'odd' jointed. In his book all the pictures of the hook, he has the string riding in the middle of the pad on the third finger. Guess what? It's easier to get two joints in a line the three.
Further, in the 'set' position ( bow at a 45 to the target with slight tension on the string) he says the first finger should have 70 to 80 % of the force of the bow. Then at full draw that distribution changes to 40-50-10. I don't think there's anyway to judge exactly what the percentage are exactly and it doesn't matter. BUT I think they are key to figuring out YOUR string placement.
One little diversion from the hook, which is also important. At the set position, the wrist is not straight. It should be cocked in, as in if you're right handed, the wrist should be bent to the left. What this does is when the draw starts the wrist straightens out, turning the string to the right and pushes the arrow into the riser/rest/strike plate. Especially important for kids that flex their forearm during the draw, which causes the arrow to come off the rest. (pinching down on the nock has nothing to do with this problem)
OK, back to hooking, taking the above into consideration here's what works for my fingers. On the third finger I have the string in the middle of the pad. Now, keep in mind that my middle finger joint is about a half an inch from the first finger joint. The string on the second finger rides on the inside of the joint (toward the palm) and the string is in the joint of the first finger.
If I think about the 80% in the set position I can feel it until I start to draw. Then at full draw it seems the string has rolled into the joint of the middle finger putting it in line with the first finger. The roll makes me feel that my strongest middle finger now has 50 % of the weight and the forefinger lost about half. There is method to this maddness.
Once you have it figure out for your own fingers, there's no thinking involved. Your subconscious places the string where it needs to be. You first have to figure out what to tell your subconscious. Hopefully you'll have all joints in a row and be able to make things simple.
I will disagree with this one; " It should be cocked in, as in if you're right handed, the wrist should be bent to the left."
I'd recommend a change to "It should be cocked OUT as in if you're right handed the wrist should be bent to the RIGHT." (Wrist OUT)
Then, as you draw and the bow weight straightens the wrist, the fingers and arrow will be turned towards the strike plate not away from it causing the arrow to fall off the shelf.
I tried both ways and both ways work. If the arrow moves off the shelf when drawing it means the fingers are too tight around the arrow nock and whatever the user is doing is reflecting in the arrow movement. I like to hook above the middle finger joint and before starting to draw let the string roll toward the joint. This will rotate the string and through the nock will push the arrow on the side shelf.
PS Another thing that is related with the hook and fingers (shooting in general) is how well protected the fingers are will influence the shooting. The first thing that WILL let down is not the back muscles or shoulders but the fingers, especially if you don't shoot just 20 arrows and you are done for the day.
I favor a deep hook in the 1st joint or beyond. The back of the hand needs to be tension free which isn’t possible with a shallow hook. The relaxed hand is vital to a good clean release.
I am thinking Todd meant the wrist is cocked out, the hand is turned to the left. I hope or I am messed up.>>>----> Ken
Todd, I tried the deep hook for two years and did fairly well, as you were saying as soon as you bend your fingers the joints line up, at least mine do. I have recently gone back to my Howard Hill glove which I have to shoot off the fingertips or a shallow hook. and I was surprised on how much smoother the release was and my groups improved considerably. I'm sure it has to do with each persons capabilities and or equipment, But I have to disagree with the deep hook as being smoother because the string has to travel over a lot more area of glove material before it gets airborn than a shallow grip.
I agree that it is a lot easier to draw with a deep hook because your fingers don't have to hold the poundage, but I have extremely strong hands and it is no problem for me.
Thanks for posting this, it needs to be discussed to let folks know the differences so they may try and see what works best for them.
Ron you are right. I never had a glove that was comfortable for deep hook drawing when using heavy bows. All the ones I used have the stalls just a tad above the finger joint, favouring a shallow-ish hook. With a tab this part is solved. Protection is there, you just have to pick your poison.
" But I have to disagree with the deep hook as being smoother because the string has to travel over a lot more area of glove material before it gets airborn than a shallow grip." I would have thought this to be true, but it's not. Rick McKenney has a picture in his book.
Arne, we may have a disagreement it discription. If you're right handed and you stick your right hand out in front of you, you cock it to the left - to me that's in towards your body and the bow. Now when your wrists straightens it turns the string to the right - where the riser is. Cock your wrist to the right and it turns your string to the left and off the rest.
Maybe I should have said if you point your finger straight away and then bend your wrist IN or left, your fingers will be pointing to the left. KSL has a picture in his book of this bend.
The more shallow the hook the more hand and forearm tension it takes to hold the string so the string tends to have to go around tensed bent fingers. The deep hook makes holding the string easier so it's easier to relax the fingers. At least that's how it is for me. Less string plucking happens.
The beauty of the anatomy of the fingers is the three joint phalangeal system. By changing the angle of individual proximal, intermediate and distal phalangeal joints, each finger has the ability to change it's own length relative to the other digits. It also gives the hand the ability to align all the finger tips and the joint into the same plane.
So I would disagree with your assertions in the first paragraph of your first post that "The hook is somewhat problematic because of the length difference of fingers"
YEP, Bowmania, The language can be a problem sometimes. Sounds like our description is of the same thing, just expressed differently.

So I would disagree with your assertions in the first paragraph of your first post that "The hook is somewhat problematic because of the length difference of fingers"
Yes, but for some that still creates wildly different tension levels in each finger to crook them in a way where the hook would sit evenly in a single joint groove.
Just tried finger tip shooting for the first time in who knows how long- but with only a 42-ish lb. draw wt. recurve. No problem; except that my draw hand felt uncomfortable & stiff, but still got off the string fast & easy; same follow through & arrow went where it was supposed to. But then I followed that up by going back to deep hook, and the draw hand felt more relaxed- so what's "right"?
Curious to keep exploring; I teach a lot & want to keep all options open for wildly differing students and at least have the ability to demonstrate all techniques, whether for good or ill.
Dan W. it takes more finger strength to hold a bow string with a shallow hook. If you shot that way for a while it will come around to being comfortable, let's face it, Howard Hill, John Shulz and many others used the shallow hook, it's what you get used to. Just because someone has a picture in a book doesn't mean he is correct. That is another problem I believe, what is written in a book is not law, it's someone opinion.
I have gone back to my shallow hook with no snap shooting, I can hold the string at full draw for as long as I need to with out panicking and the release is by far smoother and more accurate in my case, my hand doesn't leave my anchor, I have found that the string does get a little closer to my face because of the string doesn't travel as far and I can put the string right near my face. I'm also not pulling the string away by trying to open my fingers to release.
Think of it this way Deep hook is a standard trigger pull A shallow hook is a hair trigger.....much more accurate and less movement to mess up the arrow travel.
Here's my take on it. I think a deep hook simply helps an archer isolate their back muscles better and promote better back tension. The reasons why are in the video.
Jeffer, I agree with you regarding the promotion of better back tension. I would also add that the deeper hook engages the back muscles a little earlier in the draw cycle compared to using the tips of the fingers
I hook with the wrist turned in, no tension in the hand or arm, utilize the rotational draw, get 1/2th of the draw free.
Boyscouts back in day taught us fingertips...I've found latter in life deep hook just works for me...can't argue with results...goes against my better thinking but my groups improve in half as a result of a deep hook...
Bowmania, I really enjoy your post. You always have something good to offer. For the price, well your advise is priceless :)
One thing I would like to add to this particular post is tab placement on the string its self. It is very important to have a tab that actually allows consistent hand placement. I have found the Safari Tuff tab works best for me.
I believe that two string nocks are very important as well. Having two string nocks aid in consistent hand placement along with other benefits. The two string nocks prevent excessive pressure on the arrow nock that can caused by tab being directly touching the arrow nock. Not only does two string nocks prevent excessive pressure it also insures exact hand placement shot after shot.
It is amazing on just how much one eighth (1/8") of an inch difference in hand placement on the string can change the arrows impact on the target, even at very short distances.
Thank you for taking your time to help us out, Lord knows most of us need all the help we can get :)
London: Researchers have unearthed what they believe to be the “oldest eye” in a 530-million-year-old fossil of an extinct sea creature.
The fossil of Schmidtiellus reetae, which includes an early form of the eye seen in many of modern animals, including crabs, bees and dragonflies, was discovered in Estonia, while the researchers were examining the remains of a fossil called as Trilobite.
Trilobite — the hard-shelled ancestors of spiders and crabs — lived in coastal waters during the Palaeozoic era, between 541-251 million years ago.
“This may be the earliest example of an eye that it is possible to find. Older specimens in sediment layers below this fossil contain only traces of the original animals, which were too soft to be fossilised and have disintegrated over time,” said Brigitte Schoenemann, Professor at the University of Cologne in Germany.
The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, revealed that Schmidtiellus reetae had a primitive form of compound eye — an optical organ that consists of arrays of tiny visual cells, called ommatidia, similar to those of present-day bees.
Although the species had poor vision compared with many modern animals, it could identify predators and obstacles in its path.
Its eye consisted of approximately 100 ommatidia, and did not have a lens, like the modern compound eyes, probably because the primitive species lacked parts of the shell needed for lens formation.
“This exceptional fossil shows us how early animals saw the world around them hundreds of millions of years ago. Remarkably, it also reveals that the structure and function of compound eyes has barely changed in half a billion years,” said Euan Clarkson, Professor at the University of Edinburgh.

In a new Instagram video, the Young Money femcee is seen being so excited as she opens two Chanel boxes from a special someone, whom fans speculate to be the 'Mask Off' rapper.
AceShowbiz - Are Nicki Minaj and Future dating? According to a latest fan speculation, they are. In a new Instagram video, the Young Money femcee was seen being so excited as she opened two Chanel boxes from a special someone.
The black Barbie opened the boxes, one of which is filled with a stunning bag, rather unpatiently and let out small scream of excitement. "Thank you. you know the way to a Barbie's (heart emoji)" the rapper captioned the video.
Fans wonder where the expensive gifts come from, and after some diggings, it's assumed that they are from Future.
Media Take Out pointed out that the same Chanel boxes were spotted in "King's Dead" spitter's recent Instagram Live. He also took to Instagram Stories to share a snap of the boxes, writing, "If she yours she yours.."
Nicki and Future have been rumored to be dating last year. Back in May, the two were spotted going out and about together at a Miami club.
During the time when the rumors started, Future's ex-wife Ciara reportedly warned Nicki. "To say there’s no love lost between Ciara and Future would be an understatement," an insider said. "She sent an e-mail to Nicki warning her to be careful as Future can't be trusted. She also warned Nicki that she thinks he may be using her."
However, Nicki reportedly "just laughed it all off though, she thinks it's sour grapes on Ciara's part and that she's acting like a scorned woman. Nicki's big enough and strong enough to look out for herself, she doesn't need any help or advice from anybody when it comes to her love life."
Despite the warning, Nicki maintains her relationship with Future fine. The two even are set to embark a joint tour NickiHndrxx together this fall. The tour will start on September 21 at Royal Farms Arena in Baltimore, MD, and wrap up on November 24 at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, NV.

All About LUV' (past, present, future and more): New season of "Wie is de reisleider?" premieres on January 8th
The new season of RTL 5 program "Wie is de Reisleider?" premieres on January 8th at 8.30 pm. Six celebrities (Patty Brard, Charly Luske, Do, Yes-R, Fred van Leer and Julius Jaspers) have to act like real tour guides who are in charge of tourists. The holidaymakers have to select the candidate with the best skills.
This blog is about LUV', Holland's greatest girl group of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The original trio consisted of José Hoebee, Marga Scheide and Patty Brard. The three singers scored a string of hits (U.O.Me, You're the Greatest Lover, Trojan Horse, Casanova, Ooh, Yes I Do...) in a large part of Continental Europe, South Africa, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and Mexico. In August 1980, Ria Thielsch replaced Patty. In March 1981, the group disbanded for the first time. Luv' made several comebacks later and went through line-up changes. The original members reunited several times. In 2016, José, Marga and Ria decided to resurrect Luv'. Currently, Patty is still busy as a media personality. Several topics are discussed in this blog (including the ones dealing with the group's past and present entourage).

Honesty and reliability – these are traits that matter most to local real estate agent Jane Milner. Milner attributes her success as a Realtor to her immaculate attention to detail, her integrity and her ability to nurture relationships with clients from all over the country.
As an agent with William Means Real Estate, Milner’s credits in the industry include Realtor of Distinction, Accredited Buyer Representative and Certified International Property Specialist. She has been a part of the Charleston community for over 30 years and places her work with potential buyers and sellers in the highest regard. Milner markets herself through her extensive referral network of friends, colleagues, builders and architects and, most importantly, finds joy in introducing new people to the area.
Having lived in neighborhoods including downtown Charleston, Sullivan’s Island, the Old Village and, currently, I’On, Milner said: “I have a great sense of what neighborhood might be the perfect fit for my clients. In our thriving local market today, I distinguish myself as a Realtor who prioritizes the needs of my buyers throughout the entire home buying process. I pride myself on helping make my client’s dreams of a new home come to life.”
“I have been fortunate to have sold two of the most expensive homes on Isle of Palms and Wild Dunes last year,” she added.
Friends and family continuously told Milner that she would be excellent in the real estate industry, and, after years in the non-profit world, her heart finally told her that she should listen. Being a mother of two daughters and a grandmother of two vibrant grandchildren, she understands the importance of putting down roots for you and your family.

dc.description.abstract Objectives: To study and document the mandibular angle of Nigerians from the north eastern arid zone, and investigate its role as an anthropological parameter for racial and or population groups differential diagnosis, its utilization in laryngoscopy and for successful inferior alveolar nerve anesthesia. Design: A cross sectional study. Setting: Department of Anatomy, College of Medical Sciences, University of Maiduguri, Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria. Subjects'. 60 dry adult mandibles from Nigerians who lived in Maiduguri (Borno State Capital) and its environ until their death. Main Outcome Measures: Measurements of the right and left mandibular angles, length and height of the mandibles and the comparison of the mean angle with that of other racial and or population groups Results. The mean mandibular angle (118.75 ± 0.395 i.e. mean ± SEM) was smaller than that of other African populations but was wider than that of the Neanderthals and similar to that of the Chinese and Peruvians. The mandible had a shorter ramus, slightly longer length resulting in a smaller angle than that of the Zimbabwean mandible. Highly significant differences occurred between the mean angle of the Nigerian mandible and those of other African population groups (p <0.0001) except the mandibular angle of Natal Nguni and Cape Nguni populations from South Africa. There was no mutual dependence and no significant departure from linearity between the mean angle, length and height. Conclusion: The mandibular angle in conjunction with other anthropological parameters may be useful anthropological tools in racial and or population diagnosis. The configuration of the mandible of Nigerians from the northeast arid zone may predispose them to difficult laryngoscopy and/or intubation.

I used twin Sony DSC-V1 digital cameras with a LANC Shepherd wired remote, and I used Adobe Photoshop to set up the images. I also used a Gary Fisher Sugar II mountain bike to good advantage.

I made this card with the new set I got at Stamp-A-Faire that will release in August called Simple Sunflower. I love it!
I impressed the background with the Linen/Canvas Impression plate. The sentiment (from Enjoy the Ride) was heat-embossed with clear detail ep. The ink colors used on the flowers are Summer Sunrise, Rich Cocoa (Memento), and Ripe Avocado.
This birthday card will be on its way to a friend who loves sunflowers...and speaking of birthdays, my baby girl is 4 tomorrow. Holy cow, that flew by!
Stamp-a-Faire was amazing! Here's one of the cards that I made with the new set included in our goodie bag. It has such beautiful images and sentiments!!
The paper is from "Out of Print" by Basic Grey (we stopped at Archiver's!) and I used Mat Stack 4 die and stamp, which was heat embossed with clear ep.
The little rose was given to me by Rose , and she made them herself! I can't wait to use more of them, they are beautiful! Thanks again, Rose!
Happy Friday! I am waiting for Cheryl and Sherry to pick me up, and we are off to Cincinatti for PTI's Stamp-A-Faire! I'm so excited!!
I'm making a stash of sympathy cards for my mom, and this is one I did recently. I stamped the daisy image (from Friendship Jar Fillers) onto Fine Linen cardstock and colored them to look like Black-Eyed Susans (Maryland's state flower!). The card base is simply chartreuse. The sentiment comes from Healing Touch.
I stamped the background using Faux Fun, with Lulu Lavendar ink (Memento) onto a Vintage Cream sheet, while masking off the frame area. The cameo, from Cameo Creations, was heat-embossed with black powder. The sentiment comes from PTI, as well as the die for the frame and the ribbon.
I heat embossed the polka dot background with clear embossing powder. The sentiment comes from Tag Its #5, and the frame is a Fillable Frame (#1, maybe?).
I'm a little late to the waltz....but I was so excited to stamp something last night when my new stamps arrived!
I stamped the oval frames and cameos with Fresh Snow (PTI) ink onto kraft cardstock. I went back and added a small flower from Eat Cake with Grape Jelly ink (Memento). For the center of each flower, I used my Sakura Souffle pen.
The sentiment, from Say it Loud, was heat embossed with clear ep (Filigree) onto a die cut (Mat Stack 4, PTI) in Vintage Cream cs (PTI). The card base is Lavendar Moon, as well as the satin ribbon (PTI).
Hope you're having a great weekend! We spent the day at our community garden tilling and mulching our newly acquired, second plot! We've had so much fun with the first that we decided to also rent the one next to ours that hadn't been used yet.
We have some beautiful hybrid sunflowers growing there, and when I started coloring this card, those colors inspired me!
I wanted to try the technique that Nichole Heady showed in her recent post of embossing with white powder, and then coloring. I'm very happy with the results!
I cut the one edge of my focal image with the Edger #1 die. The sentiment, from the Think Big series, was selectively inked to get the words side-by-side. I then popped up the flower portion on foam tape and tied a small white ribbon around.
Happy Thursday! Here's my card with this week's summer card camp colors, as well as the pocket technique from PTI's Make It Mondays video.
I used my Edger #2 die to create a pocket with Kraft cardstock. Then, I sewed up the sides with my sewing machine. I should have swiped the edges with Fresh Snow ink before sewing though! You can't see very well in the photo, but I stamped the rose from Year of Flowers: Collection onto the pocket with Antique Linen Distress ink (Ranger)
I cut "forever" with the Wonderful Word die into Pure Poppy cardstock which I had backed with scor-tape in order to adhere it easily. It wasn't so easy to get the cut word out, though. The rest of the sentiment was stamped onto the pocket with Rich Cocoa (Memento) ink.
The background of the card was stamped using WMS' Faux Fun, and heat embossed with clear Filigree embossing powder. The cardbase is Fine Linen cardstock, as well as Fine Linen satin ribbon. The tag was cut with Tag Sale #1.
I made this card a few night sgo...it turned out so different than I had orginially envisioned! I wanted to use the flowers from the Daydreamer set (PTI) and stamp them in these colors to have them match with the pretty Emma's Shoppe paper (Crate Paper), but in the end the focal image was too busy for me to also use the paper.
The focal image was cut with a Label 18 die (Nestabilities). The background is stamped using the polka dot background from WMS's Off-Beat Backgrounds. The sentiment is from WMS's Say it with Style.
These color made me think nature...probably helps that I have our vegetable garden on my mind a lot lately!
I stamped a background using the 2009 PTI Anniversary set, Round and Round, using Summer Sunrise for the sunflower image and Simply Chartreuse for the leaves onto Vintage Cream cs. The base of the card is Orange Zest and the next layer is Pure Poppy. The trim came from Emma's Paperie, although I can't remember the manufacturer.
For the focal image, I stamped the Fillable Frame with Versamark, and clear embossed it. I added the sentiment (also from Round and Round), colored some gems with a green Copic, and added them.

For the past fifteen years, a regional cultural institution on the border with Germany, in the beautiful Moselle valley, has been presenting wide-ranging offer of entertainment, art and history. The local name for it is the Kulturhuef - the culture court - and it houses two museums, a cinema and a café with a small stage. Does that make you think it's on a huge scale? Prepare to be surprised!
The Kulturhuef forms part of the decentralised cultural offer in the Grand Duchy. Located in Grevenmacher's former abattoir, in Luxembourg's Moselle region, surrounded by vineyards, the Kulturhuef has taken on an interregional dimension by presenting an exceptionally varied cultural offer.
As well as a museum devoted to playing cards, the Kulturhuef also houses a printing museum. The machinery on display is in working order, and can be used - operated by museum volunteers - by artists working with printing techniques. The 'Cinémaacher' aims at a wider public, with its 78 comfortable seats and its non-specialist programming.
Lastly, the Kulturhuef welcomes the public for a meal or a drink among friends, and makes room for performers wanting to use the stage, all in a friendly atmosphere. For children, the Kulturhuef also offers art workshops, and makes it premises available for birthday parties and school visits.
It should be emphasised that the Kulturhuef functions mainly thanks to the work of volunteers, who operate the cinema projector as well as the printing presses.
Grevenmacher is a small town with a thousand years of history, on the Luxembourg bank of the Moselle. Apart from its picturesque centre, it is also known as a winegrowing centre and for its annual wine market, at which the general public can taste the new vintages, as well as for the grape and wine festival, with its procession of decorated floats.

The direction of the pin, from the viewpoint of the component. It may be one of HAL_IN, HAL_OUT, or HAL_IO. Any number of HAL_IN or HAL_IO pins may be connected to the same signal, but at most one HAL_OUT pin is permitted. A component may assign a value to a pin that is HAL_OUT or HAL_IO, but may not assign a value to a pin that is HAL_IN.
The hal_pin_new family of functions create a new pin object. Once a pin has been created, it can be linked to a signal object using hal_link. A pin contains a pointer, and the component that owns the pin can dereference the pointer to access whatever signal is linked to the pin. (If no signal is linked, it points to a dummy signal.)
There are functions for each of the data types that the HAL supports. Pins may only be linked to signals of the same type.
This chapter covers important user concepts that should be understood before attempting to run a CNC machine with g code.
Trajectory planning, in general, is the means by which LinuxCNC follows the path specified by your G Code program, while still operating within the limits of your machinery.
A G Code program can never be fully obeyed. For example, imagine you specify as a single-line program the following move:
In reality, the whole move can’t be made at F10, since the machine must accelerate from a stop, move toward X=1, and then decelerate to stop again. Sometimes part of the move is done at F10, but for many moves, especially short ones, the specified feed rate is never reached at all. Having short moves in your G Code can cause your machine to slow down and speed up for the longer moves if the naive cam detector is not employed with G64 Pn.
The basic acceleration and deceleration described above is not complex and there is no compromise to be made. In the INI file the specified machine constraints such as maximum axis velocity and axis acceleration must be obeyed by the trajectory planner.
A less straightforward problem is that of path following. When you program a corner in G Code, the trajectory planner can do several things, all of which are right in some cases: it can decelerate to a stop exactly at the coordinates of the corner, and then accelerate in the new direction. It can also do what is called blending, which is to keep the feed rate up while going through the corner, making it necessary to round the corner off in order to obey machine constraints. You can see that there is a trade off here: you can slow down to get better path following, or keep the speed up and have worse path following. Depending on the particular cut, the material, the tooling, etc., the programmer may want to compromise differently.
Rapid moves also obey the current trajectory control. With moves long enough to reach maximum velocity on a machine with low acceleration and no path tolerance specified, you can get a fairly round corner.
G61 - (Exact Path Mode) visits the programmed point exactly, even though that means it might temporarily come to a complete stop in order to change direction to the next programmed point.
G64 - (Blend Without Tolerance Mode) G64 is the default setting when you start LinuxCNC. G64 is just blending and the naive cam detector is not enabled. G64 and G64 P0 tell the planner to sacrifice path following accuracy in order to keep the feed rate up. This is necessary for some types of material or tooling where exact stops are harmful, and can work great as long as the programmer is careful to keep in mind that the tool’s path will be somewhat more curvy than the program specifies. When using G0 (rapid) moves with G64 use caution on clearance moves and allow enough distance to clear obstacles based on the acceleration capabilities of your machine.
G64 P- Q- - (Blend With Tolerance Mode) This enables the naive cam detector and enables blending with a tolerance. If you program G64 P0.05, you tell the planner that you want continuous feed, but at programmed corners you want it to slow down enough so that the tool path can stay within 0.05 user units of the programmed path. The exact amount of slowdown depends on the geometry of the programmed corner and the machine constraints, but the only thing the programmer needs to worry about is the tolerance. This gives the programmer complete control over the path following compromise. The blend tolerance can be changed throughout the program as necessary. Beware that a specification of G64 P0 has the same effect as G64 alone (above), which is necessary for backward compatibility for old G Code programs. See the G64 section of the G code chapter.
Blending without tolerance - The controlled point will touch each specified movement at at least one point. The machine will never move at such a speed that it cannot come to an exact stop at the end of the current movement (or next movement, if you pause when blending has already started). The distance from the end point of the move is as large as it needs to be to keep up the best contouring feed.
Naive Cam Detector - Successive G1 moves that involve only the XYZ axes that deviate less than Q- from a straight line are merged into a single straight line. This merged movement replaces the individual G1 movements for the purposes of blending with tolerance. Between successive movements, the controlled point will pass no more than P- from the actual endpoints of the movements. The controlled point will touch at least one point on each movement. The machine will never move at such a speed that it cannot come to an exact stop at the end of the current movement (or next movement, if you pause when blending has already started) On G2/3 moves in the G17 (XY) plane when the maximum deviation of an arc from a straight line is less than the G64 Q- tolerance the arc is broken into two lines (from start of arc to midpoint, and from midpoint to end). those lines are then subject to the naive cam algorithm for lines. Thus, line-arc, arc-arc, and arc-line cases as well as line-line benefit from the naive cam detector. This improves contouring performance by simplifying the path.
In the following figure the blue line represents the actual machine velocity. The red lines are the acceleration capability of the machine. The horizontal lines below each plot is the planned move. The upper plot shows how the trajectory planner will slow the machine down when short moves are encountered to stay within the limits of the machines acceleration setting to be able to come to an exact stop at the end of the next move. The bottom plot shows the effect of the Naive Cam Detector to combine the moves and do a better job of keeping the velocity as planned.
Make sure moves are long enough to suit your machine/material. Principally because of the rule that the machine will never move at such a speed that it cannot come to a complete stop at the end of the current movement, there is a minimum movement length that will allow the machine to keep up a requested feed rate with a given acceleration setting.
To keep up the feed rate, the move must be longer than the distance it takes to accelerate from 0 to the desired feed rate and then stop again. Using A as 1/2 the ini file MAX_ACCELERATION and F as the feed rate in units per second, the acceleration time is ta = F/A and the acceleration distance is da = F*ta/2. The deceleration time and distance are the same, making the critical distance d = da + dd = 2 * da = F2/A.
For example, for a feed rate of 1 inch per second and an acceleration of 10 inches/sec2, the critical distance is 12/10 = 1/10 = 0.1 inches.
When LinuxCNC first starts up many G and M codes are loaded by default. The current active G and M codes can be viewed on the MDI tab in the Active G-Codes: window in the AXIS interface. These G and M codes define the behavior of LinuxCNC and it is important that you understand what each one does before running LinuxCNC. The defaults can be changed when running a G-Code file and left in a different state than when you started your LinuxCNC session. The best practice is to set the defaults needed for the job in the preamble of your G-Code file and not assume that the defaults have not changed. Printing out the G-Code Quick Reference page can help you remember what each one is.
How the feed rate is applied depends on if an axis involved with the move is a rotary axis. Read and understand the Feed Rate section if you have a rotary axis or a lathe.
Tool Radius Offset (G41/42) requires that the tool be able to touch somewhere along each programmed move without gouging the two adjacent moves. If that is not possible with the current tool diameter you will get an error. A smaller diameter tool may run without an error on the same path. This means you can program a cutter to pass down a path that is narrower than the cutter without any errors. See the Cutter Compensation Section for more information.
After starting LinuxCNC each axis must be homed prior to running a program or running a MDI command.
If your machine does not have home switches a match mark on each axis can aid in homing the machine coordinates to the same place each time.
There are several options when doing manual tool changes. See the [EMCIO] section for information on configuration of these options. Also see the G28 and G30 section of the G code chapter.
The Coordinate Systems can be confusing at first. Before running a CNC machine you must understand the basics of the coordinate systems used by LinuxCNC. In depth information on the LinuxCNC Coordinate Systems is in the Coordinate System Section of this manual.
The only time you move in the G53 machine coordinate system is when you program a G53 on the same line as a move. Normally you are in the G54 coordinate system.
If you’re having trouble getting 0,0,0 on the DRO when you think you should, you may have some offsets programmed in and need to remove them.
Set the G54 coordinate system to be the same as the machine coordinate system with G10 L2 P1 X0 Y0 Z0 R0
Now you should be at the machine origin X0 Y0 Z0 and the relative coordinate system should be the same as the machine coordinate system.
The following diagram shows a typical mill showing direction of travel of the tool and the mill table and limit switches. Notice how the mill table moves in the opposite direction of the Cartesian coordinate system arrows shown by the Tool Direction image. This makes the tool move in the correct direction in relation to the material.
The following diagram shows a typical lathe showing direction of travel of the tool and limit switches.
Armonk, NY -- November 8, 2004 -- Today's introduction of IBM eServer Blue Gene system ushers-in a new era of high performance computing (HPC) for businesses and scientific uses. The system, unveiled today, will provide customers with the capability to advance science and business with unprecedented speed, ultrascale performance and extreme efficiency.
IBM eServer Blue Gene enables customers to obtain a peak performance of 5.7 teraflops, with a single full rack system, and is optimized for density, low power consumption, bandwidth, and scalability while consuming a fraction of power and floor space.With a footprint of less than one square meter, the system delivers more than ten times the performance of other supercomputers now on the market while occupying less floor space.
"The Blue Gene technology allows us to introduce a new class of high performance computing capability to industry-specific business challenges allowing our clients to deliver new or better optimized business functionality to their customers, said Colin Parris, vice president, eServer Product Management, IBM. "We are actively working with key industry partners to execute an optimal delivery of the blue gene capability into these key marketplaces."
IBM Blue Gene is the result of a research project chartered five years ago, requiring the effort and collaboration among IBM designers, engineers and master technologists, with more than $100 million dollars invested in research. Known originally as a research vehicle for the study of protein folding, it is now commercially available for purchase to qualified customers who have application workloads in a variety of science disciplines.
IBM, working with partners, is making Blue Gene applicable for workloads across a variety of disciplines. IBM and many national lab and university members are enabling a growing list of HPC applications and codes in areas of life sciences, financial modeling (not underway yet), hydrodynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, astronomy and space research, and climate modeling. Other areas of interest include grid computing, business intelligence, risk and compliance, aerodynamics study and testing and manufacturing processes.
Many key software vendors such as LSTC, Platform Computing and Allinea have specified an interest in enabling their applications on Blue Gene. Etnus is already in the process of enabling their TotalView parallel debugger to Blue Gene.
Helping customers to gain access to IBM eServer Blue Gene, IBM is developing programs to expand the opportunities for clients with constrained budgets or limited usage requirements. For the first time, IBM is planning to offer access to Blue Gene through IBM’s Deep Computing Capacity on Demand Center. Customers will remotely access the system through a highly secure and dedicated Virtual Private Network and pay only for the amount of capacity reserved – lowering financial and technical risk.
In addition, IBM eServer Blue Gene can be leased or purchased with flexible financing provided by IBM Global Financing. IBM Global Financing can provide highly competitive rates that help customers control costs minimizing financial risk. IBM is also studying options to offer entry-level priced Blue Gene systems with physically smaller packaging for use as program development platforms.
IBM’s Blue Gene/L system is the fastest supercomputing system in the world, computing data at an astounding performance of 70.72 Linpack teraflops, or trillions of calculations per second.
· IBM eServer Blue Gene is available from 1 to 64 racks - 1024 dual-processor nodes per rack - Partially populated racks with fewer than 1024 nodes are also available to qualified customers · IBM eServer Blue Gene delivers a peak performance of 5.7 teraflops (trillions of calculations per second) per rack · IBM eServer Blue Gene yields 25 times more performance per KW than Earth Simulator · The system is more compact than the average supercomputer at 3ft. by 3ft. by 6ft
Note: Customers must provide documented information to qualify for IBM eServer BlueGene based on financial and background information provided to IBM.
On top of the server, some specialised modules are also developed. The most important is a the microscope-controller, a combination of a client application for a remote workstation and a java applet which allow the remote control of a microscope over internet.

So for a few, the finest motivator is definitely the picture pricy matters about the desktop, for other first of all undoubtedly make a profit web, and with the 3rd the audience as well as their remarks. To begin with and foremost you should sit back and think that about what motivates you most popular.
My inspiration stands out as the need to share related information, to go away a effective believed for your audience. To get not simply an observer but additionally a Creator, minor Creator.

Notice the main and final posts recognized bloggers heaven and earth, as though various people young and old wrote, and you’ll find it only been 1-2 several years. They only researched, remembered the most efficient chips of rivals, tried out many possible choices, stuffed arm.
Each time, it ought to be famous, is often a modest little bit distinctive, since the approach happens to be steadily refined. And now the solution very. Could perhaps can be found in helpful.
In Common, I needs to notice, I at first adhered towards the principle that to show this can be extremely hard, due to the fact most of the suggestions which can be specified, belong to how to proceed. Which needless to say will not be enough for knowledge how to proceed is simply best suited.
Moreover, individually, I’ve lengthy texts dictates with the internal voice, the recommendation to have the similar is completely appropriate, but definitely ineffective.
Over time, then again, I nonetheless obtained quite a lot of regulations which can be not excluded even, the aforesaid internal voice will erupt from your internal silence. Certainly, creating awesome texts cannot be taught, but the good news is, it may well be figured out in case you know a couple mega-secrets and use right approach. Ensures, certainly, I am not, even so the dollars continues to be convey.
So, let us begin with the very first and, concurrently, with the property. You will find an individual mega-cheat, which accurately performs miracles: make rock-stars from a shrinking violet, mathematicians of fools and beasts belonging to the pathetic large amount. And this includes mega-authors from all those from the first two words and phrases cannot.
The key is that this: I need to understand the best ways to do anything, get it done. Especially, to master to write down very well, 1 will need to frequently publish. Venerable theoretical writers, not surprisingly, will give totally different information: ?it is critical to primary look at the heritage of literature, to graduate through the school of journalism and you can ask individually for his or her blessing, which they to any individual never give?, but nevertheless, as is definitely noticed, many of the texts of venerable theoretical writers in some way restricted to idiotic opinions to my content pieces, which provides us to your apparent imagined: ?they can compose more effective than any individual on earth, just you should not want? ?fuck you hints and tips from an individual whose abilities you can not check??
In Normal, the recipe is easy and incredibly highly effective: have got to compose significantly. And for some time. It can be not excluded, for 5 yrs. While a thing may be apparent following a couple months.
It is important to write down total important things. Enable 50 % a website page, but semantic semantic the start towards the finish. Unfinished novel will gain triumph lower than 10 unfinished tales. Created, in basic principle, it can be probable to not exhibit virtually anyone, however it has to be drafted like in the textual content in Peter Jackson quickly initiate capturing some other movie nowadays night.
Written is smart to study and proper. Also, even composed way back with time ideas to the subject matter are generally extra, and also elevated ability enables you to definitely accurate the earlier flaws with the textual content.
What to put in writing about? That you just treatment about. Make an effort to craft about what excites another person, and also you really don’t treatment, won’t sound right. Issue here is where exactly: all through this entertaining like foods may want to arrive like urge for food. Which subsequently can help you to maintain crafting, in spite of the sensation that you are incompetent, and coming to interchange him, the sensation that you are a genius and everybody else is idiots and also you for this reason really don’t recognize.
The to begin with time can arrive out is nonsense. And in many cases the primary hundred moments. But development is unavoidable, at any time you carry on and do not discontinue. Inside of a 12 months you might be astonished how much you’ve got progressed in self-improvement. Although among every set of texts the main difference is form of very small.
As you development to achievement, like, correct within the starting, a large number of will show you: ?you haven’t any talent?, ?is not yours?, ?leave it to professionals? and lots of related granatni. But providing you choose, it’s always yours. And unworldly advisers cheerfully head to the forest. It really is not them, plus your texts will then be browse through through the general public. And, it ought to be mentioned, seriously isn’t a Goblin, or perhaps. B. , the remainder will operate for you within the reviews urgent help regarding how to generate reports. For the opposite, will operate some unfamiliar citizens, whose knowledge, as you can imagine, for all of us is amazingly really important.
Learn more details on instruction and associated concerns, but additionally about expertise, the recommendation of advisers and things like which you can study in this article and in this article.
First the trick belonged to strategy of reaching achievement. The next fundamental technique of implement to method.
The essence on the hidden secret: produce while you believe that. Comprehending this could be essentially: the thought is you jot down. Those self same terms, which it’s always. With no need of making an attempt ?to be objective?, ?to adhere to your canons of?, ?to communicate on the literary? and the like. Nearly all allegedly certified journalists will disagree with me, but you’ll find it accurate: women and men have an interest to check out concerning the feelings and feelings of other individuals. I’m wondering what others consider, how they sense, what occurred to them and everything. Journalism and, specially, fiction shouldn’t be critical information. It is easy to ?objectively? produce about what working day it truly is, even so the relaxation is possibly cleverly disguised deception, or maybe the outcome of insecurity.
In the main situation ?the objective? the creator is to put it accurately however subjective, and as a consequence offers facts in a very light-weight that could be useful to him and his potential clients, but worried that it’ll burn up, so pretends that he ?just gave particulars.
In the next situation, the creator fears that ?not understand? that ?would guess that he can not? and ?will be considered to not be described as a gentleman?. Owing to these robust emotions, the creator presents a faceless and helpless textual content, which somewhat effortlessly seems being uninteresting.
If creating a couple of agonizing, people phrases over it I need to convey, audience will see. Significantly of audience.
With time. And at the outset, no audience, no terms should be skipped. And may fiercely wish to fulfill the expectations to come back out like that or seem at it. But to maintain you you do not might need the end result from this is often only receiving even worse. And do not seek to specially emulate it inevitably and so lengthy a robust likeness with the imitation.
In addition, its not important to speculate who necessities it this is often your textual content. At the outset no person looks inquisitive about neither your tale nor your views, nor your reasoning. That is not so. Absolutely attention-grabbing to several. You simply really need to deliver the results out to express all of this inside the sort through which notwithstanding that numerous will are available in delight.
The textual content might possibly be published in tremendously stylized language, and maybe essentially the most that neither is colloquial. And both equally is exactly what did it. The leading factor that you just desired to say in such a kind.
That is, your own, subjective impression, moreover, that sort and that’s the soul, remains the trick of prosperity.
With a powerful impression, through the way, to begin with, can also increase collectively. However it performs good enough for exercise. What’s more, the very same. Producing of texts will involve subjective reasoning, subsequently, the creator of those texts inevitably educated to speak.
Initially, you are likely to oppress the absence of the pronounced model that you choose to compose. Also, it is going to perpetually feel that you will be clumsily portrayed the kind of an individual you want. So you want a thing that you are aware of correctly and, in the opposite, you attempted to emulate.
The concern is, as aforesaid design and style to supply? Remedy: intentionally to supply it. But, he zabudetsya himself, otherwise to help keep. A definitely sure way do not ever to possess your very own model to drive to put in writing as your self not wish to create. Conversely, in the event you craft the way in which you like, possess model by by itself will start out to arise. You will even velocity up the method for this we have to re-read what I wrote, and take note all those parts which you individually are most strongly cling to.
Many belonging to the theoretical writers would say, once you work out that like many others, however you currently know the ultra powerful being successful of those writers. No, you will need to be able to write because it touches you individually. Because of samosatene is rising which will choose up people still left and accurate. You’ll pay attention to hints and tips on the way it would sound right to reformulate this or that phrase, but subsequent this recommendation is critical only when reformulated variation of you cling in your case individually.
It is unimaginable to show an individual form of crafting, though the male is kind of in the position to realize.
Still, I need to confess, when the textual content is tough to look over aloud, it is going to be challenging to look at about by themselves. If ever the textual content is sung for a track, it will likely be simple and gratifying to browse. Make an attempt to browse through their texts aloud. Reformulated the locations where by you stopped browsing.
Special second precisely associated with the design unconscious hyperlink towards the bureaucratization in their private language. The person claims excellent, but one time in hand he receives a sheet of paper… Damn, whereby was I?.. Receives laptop computer open up within this Ward, the person immediately frightened that he’ll require flippantly. And fright commences to make this kind of momentum, which might have envied even a robotic bureaucrat. Out highly significantly, but its so dry and bland, what on your perfect thoughts this 1 diligently isn’t going to examine. What’s more, until such time as the tip.
If about absolutely serious facts to put in writing while not the ringing of seriousness it will become a whole lot more truly serious. Despite the fact that, for the reason that this textual content is check out.
And, most significantly, just remember. Humorous jokes and aphorisms nailed workshops suggestions of one’s textual content around the depths for the unconscious of audience. Certainly whether it is likely effectively, that the textual content is scan basically within a aspiration to become can be. And, appropriately, your strategies with him.
The aphoristic character with the textual content shouldn’t be required, but appealing. Furthermore, she likes me individually, so I’m able to not be silent.
So, an uncommon approach to maximize the memorability of meanings and privykaet into the creator. Additionally, they, as well as model, provide the textual content its individual distinct experience that has viewed him aspire to appearance all over again, but from the alternative angle. From this as well as the writer properly his feelings are disseminated, and therefore the audience fascinated.
If a different sentence is right to be used independently from their ecosystem, and in many cases community domination is simply not considerably off. It’s always relatively practical when on the textual content we can easily extract a quotation and also to run it even in discussions with people who the textual content not look at, and they’re going to even now shove.
Of system, I can not educate crafting aphorisms no prescription. Having said that, it is actually feasible to know by a mindful assessment in their private creative imagination with the existence from the aforesaid aphorisms, at a minimum in efficiency. And when the efficiency for the personal phrases signify, it is smart to test to acquire it to immediate total aphoristic act.
In addition, if still left as please don’t for the most part say, but it surely even now is intuitive, the ensuing phrase could also to some extent it is best to depart it textual content will probably be added exciting.
?Oh, my God! The horror! Since they can! That rascal! We’re going to not make it possible for! Oh my God! We are going to reveal them! They even uncover us! Disgrace on them! Unite with the battle from the villains! The amount of are you able to endure? ! Please don’t just sit there have interaction! Place all! Intruders in jail! The visitors in anger! Bastards! Bastards! Desman! Hitler! ?
Recently experienced some byaka: bachnia blachnicki at the time once more abaceeli, and that is on the spirit of bachnik Mechnikov. Yet another will be ashamed, and so they like drinking water off a duck.
And why? Considering batniki goats! Right here we provide them with the horns will poolmem! We are going to present them what is actually what!
I also remember we experienced a person bachnik, who also all believed they might baciti to not trouble. So, this baznicu sebaciel within the amusing. Now he can hardly stroll and largely for them selves.
Basically, which is all I desired to say with regards to the rhythm in the narrative. All of the similar, to show rhythm unimaginable. But when you meditate about the a multitude of previous paragraphs, and afterwards an extended the perfect time to prepare, then be taught it really is honestly.
The chorus may be the form of point that needs to be post similar to a refrain for your music. But even cooler he principal approach is expressed. However, if the chorus not simply repeats, and also modificeres as outlined by the existing context, then all tin even people that read through attentively, the concept continues to be do not forget.
The chorus is summarized the leading approach. Or not a grasp just superior. But very little briefly it is actually appropriate significantly more loudly. To scan by itself begged to get a tongue. How these kinds of in order to make? Uh-uh… Nicely… Style of like other aphorisms. Instruct them to complete the difficult, but while you will probably have guessed, it could possibly be realized.
Imagine, one example is, that the textual content must repeat in two seconds. Of course, loads of indicating is dropped, just what the hell in two seconds you prefer, but one particular sentence control to mention. Listed here, you will be questioned: ?what does one simply call the piece? ?. You only, and will need to automatically answered himself.
Answered. It appears lousy. Place this imagined experiment once again. And once more. And once more. Who the hell can instruct you, if you don’t private. Faster or later on, all of a sudden the solution is a thing that a lot of will take delight in. Below it’s workable in order to make a chorus. Despite the fact that not essentially: the chorus seriously isn’t a need, and decoration.
Theoretical writers will say, despite the fact that, to come back up with effective meanings, it can be important to examine a whole lot. And if possible thick novels. On top of that, if possible those that like it truly is this theoretical author. But it surely is rubbish. It really is attainable, in basic principle, you shouldn’t read through textbooks in the least. For your theoretical writers of each one of these publications scan, but all mega-meaning there’re decreased to idiotic feedback to most people ‘ reports. Each and every, as you can imagine, aspiration that a single working day he’ll expose all excellent novel, that can be deep responses to deep inquiries, but is someway uniquely idiotic reviews. That is the paradox.
Theoretical writers never consider, but for creating texts with sensible feeling must follow to assume. To perform this don’t just for the time of creating, as continuously. Proper, the perfect time to presume of folks lacking an individual route to succeed or establishment might possibly have a pair of hrs each day.
Thinking is drawback resolving. Researching to get a precise reply to on the concern, not murky reflection ?do I need if I can?. A variety of folks believe that presume. Consider so dependent within the ?search?. They are saying their over-the-top philosophical intelligence generates concerns for further more comprehension in their humanity. In such a they see a real philosophy including a deep peak of psychological accomplishment. The truth is, even a well-formulated dilemma is 50 % the solution, although the legitimate pondering could be the seek out just solutions. Not thoughts, no.
Accordingly, those that uncover as a minimum some solutions for your inquiries, irrespective of how depressing these solutions you will feel, following a yr or two all philosophical vapositori will keep up to now powering, this blind may be noticeable.
Is it viable to show anyone to imagine?. But, specifically, it will probably be figured out independently.
As I stated, your textual content has to be such as you to start with. Regardless of whether he isn’t going to like just about anyone on this planet, development remains to be likely. And when it arrives right down to it, your lyrics will like all 2nd and typically to start with.
But there exists a particular caveat, in the event the view with the reader even now price an item. While this viewpoint the reader cannot even consult.
This nuance it is really needed to compose granted the truth that the reader won’t are living in the head. So he will not know significantly of things which you understand. He would not determine what you explained yesterday, your good friend Bob, that which you arrived up with in 3rd quality, and it is really viable how one can configure the router he didn’t know. Consequently, a number of points within your textual content are possible to get unclear into the reader, not due to the fact you happen to be inadequately prepared textual content, and since the reader isn’t really needed for a correct knowledge within your textual content information.
To prevent this regrettable misunderstanding, it ought to be for the period of the composing and subsequent revision in the textual content to assume the typical concentrate on reader to look at the textual content not simply with your facial area but will also on his experience. And, in the event you imaginary crenelated a fraction with the absence of data experienced this information he immediately transmit specifically because of your textual content.
That is most likely the brief article for mathematicians it’s not essential to justify what ?Taylor series?, however, if the posting is to get a wide selection, anything with regard to the Standard which means of the exceptional mathematical buildings have continue to to inform as a minimum over the fingers. At a minimum within the type of lyrical digressions. Most definitely whether it is primarily based on a little something notable.
At to start with it could seem to be unusual that, since it seems, is aware of a possible reader. But nevertheless, knowing arrives genuinely immediately: naturally, he won’t know your biography (when you are continue to mysterious), not informed of one’s discussions, is aware College or university packages of arbitrary establishment, not study any scarce or exceptionally specialised publications. Generally, silly, not such as you. Though the dialogue you guide with it.
But the most crucial element shouldn’t be to go also: if a reader sees which you justify intimately to him fairly evident to him, he may possibly suspect that you simply preserve him to the silly and really indignant. Needless to say, we do not treatment with regard to the disappointment with the reader, but we treatment with regard to the perfection in the textual content. Which can be mirrored while in the inescapable fact that conceivable to us the reader fulfilled and satisfied.
Engage in dialogue with all the reader, while you can guess, you can not instruct. But to know it you could…

Today for brunch, I created a mash-up of two of my favorite egg dishes: Spanish tortilla, a thick omelet with potatoes, and Japanese tamagoyaki, a rolled omelet infused with a slightly sweet soy and dashi broth.
In place of regular potatoes, I use satsumaimo, a kind of Japanese sweet potato that is whiter and a bit firmer than American sweet potatoes. Of course, you can use whatever sweet potato you can find. I pre-cook the satsumaimo with a kind of delicate simmering technique called nimono before incorporating it into the omelet.
The recipe takes a bit of time to make from scratch, but the techniques are simple. I think it’s worth the effort and the perfect way to impress your family and friends with a fresh take on the usual weekend brunch fare.
Rinse the shiitake, kombu, and ginger and place in a medium saucepan with about a liter of cold water.
Bring to a boil and toss in the katsuobushi. Turn off heat, let cool for 10 minutes and strain. Discard katsuobushi and ginger.
Add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and sugar, 1 tablespoon each of mirin and sake. Add salt to taste. It should be salty and a bit sweet but not too overwhelming.
Soak the satsumaimo slices in cold water until ready to use. This removes some of the extra starch and prevents oxidation, which turns the sweet potato brown.
Drain the satsumaimo slices from the cold water and simmer in the broth from the previous step for 15-20 minutes until soft but not falling apart. Remove satsumaimo from cooking liquid, reserving some of the broth.
Heat about a teaspoon of the sesame oil in a small saucepan. Add in the sliced kombu and shiitake along with the sliced garlic.
Season with a few pinches of red chili powder and/or cayenne, freshly grated black pepper and sugar. Add a small splash each of sake, mirin, and soy sauce.
Whisk 1/4 teaspoon of yuzukoshō and the scallion in about 1/4 cup of the reserved simmering liquid. Beat in the eggs.
Heat a well-seasoned cast iron pan on a medium flame and coat with a thin layer of olive oil. Add the egg mixture, then add a layer of the satsumaimo slices. I had some extra sweet potato that I saved for another use. Then add the kombu and mushroom mixture on top.
Continue cooking on low heat until edges look slightly solid. Finish in the broiler (1-2 minutes). The eggs should still be a little runny in the center. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with pimentón, and serve. Enjoy!

After all of the deal structure components have been negotiated in a letter of intent (LOI), every business acquisition will go through due diligence resulting in an acquisition purchase agreement — something else that first-time sellers may not have experience with. Understanding the components of these kinds of agreements is important, as they’ll determine how much money you walk away with up front, as well as what you may be on the hook for later.
A purchase agreement lays out what will be included in the sale of a company. The transaction will either be an asset sale or a stock sale, so the purchase agreement will fall along one of those two lines.
The purchase agreement will dictate the terms and conditions of the sale of the stock or assets from one party to another. It will determine what risks the buyer will take on, what will be transferred with ownership, and what the seller will retain after the deal closes. All of this is negotiated and is generally worked out in the LOI before the purchase agreement is drawn up. Below, we will discuss three components of a purchase agreement that affect a seller.
One of the components that will be negotiated in a purchase agreement are the reps and warranties. These are assertions that the seller makes about the current state of the business, as well as any significant events that may have happened in the past. Reps and warranties will include financial and legal statements, information about assets, personnel information, proof that tax payments are up-to-date, as well as explanations of any legal or environmental issues that were resolved in the past or may be ongoing.
During this process, as during the due diligence process, it’s important to be as transparent and honest as possible. At the end of the deal, the exhaustive schedules in the purchase agreement will be written that will serve as proof of the claims you’ve made about your business, so don’t set yourself up for failure by falsely representing the state of affairs.
A purchase agreement will also contain certain protections for the buyer and/or seller. These protections, called indemnifications, exclude certain parties from responsibility for certain claims made against the business. For example, a seller may agree to indemnify a buyer against any claim regarding environmental issues that occurred under the seller’s ownership. Similarly, a seller may ask for indemnification for any activity involving the business in the future (once they no longer have any involvement or ownership).
What happens if a seller breaches one of the reps and warranties? If there is proof of damage, the funds held in escrow may be used to satisfy the damage claim. The funds will be held by an escrow agent and paid out if a valid claim is made.
What sellers need to remember is that the escrow amount, usually a percentage of the purchase price, is held for anywhere between 12-24 months and temporarily delays them from receiving a portion of cash from the transaction. The amount, length of time and consideration (cash, seller note, etc.) of the escrow can be negotiated but will be part of any purchase agreement.
It’s important to do your homework and understand key terms and conditions before selling your business, but DIY research is no replacement for getting advice from experienced advisors like the team at MelCap. This will help ensure that you get what you want from the sale and can move forward with whatever comes next in your life’s journey.

My house is so dirty, I can’t stand it. I MUST get it spotless by New Year’s Eve. MUST. Does anyone else like their house spic and span before the new year begins? Sometimes, I think I need therapy.
I met up with some teacher buds today for lunch and a movie. We had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) and it was yumbles as usual. We ordered a BBQ Chicken Chopped Salad, the Thai Chicken Pizza and the Greek Pizza. I wasn’t soooo fond of the Greek pizza, but the salad and Thai one were bomb!!
If you like sex and nudity, this is for you! j/k. Well, kinda. It wasn’t a terrible movie (I think I’m being too nice), but I would not watch it again. I don’t wanna ruin anything for you if you are looking to see it, but just be prepared for LOTS of ripping off of clothes. WOW. As usual, my movie buddies giggled their way through the film.

In the extreme South of Leinster , on the Hook Peninsula , the Norman family of Redmond built a great mansion in the early 14th century. The house and surrounding lands were confiscated by the Cromwellians and given to the Loftus family in 1666 , after which the name of the house was changed to ‘Loftus Hall’. This beautiful house is a must see on your tours of Ireland.
In the middle of the 18th century , the Honourable Charles Tottenham married Anne Loftus and went to live there. All went well until one stormy night , when a handsome stranger arrived on horseback seeking shelter from the weather.
He was welcomed in and , having eaten , he joined in a game of cards , playing partner to the teenage daughter of the house. She was dealt a wonderful hand and was winning the game , but a card slipped from the table and she bent down to retrieve it.
To her consternation , she saw that the stranger had , instead of a foot , a cloven hoof! She screamed , and he disappeared through the roof in a flash of fire. He reappeared periodically , much to the terror of the family , until the local priest , Fr Thomas Broaders , drove him away forever.
This is the oldest know Irish version of a cautionary legend against card-playing. It was based on the idea that heavy gambling was a trick of the devil to ensnare people , a point much stressed by parsons and priests.
The were often rumours of hauntings in very old houses , and Loftus Hall being such , it was easy for the legend to become attached to that place. The vulnerable but rather sinister old building was demolished in 1871 , and the new mansion erected on the site. Happily , no such hauntings affect the new building.

The family in the 13th and 14th century Lithuania represented a unit in many senses, from economical and productive to social, organisational, and legal. The average family consisted of five or six people. The remains of a 14th century house in the lower town of Kernavė feature a plank-bed, made of several benches, up to three by 1.7 metres. Since the average human of the time was about 1.65 metres tall, the bed could accommodate the entire family of five to six people. On the other hand, the family also had a broader meaning, the one that covered two or three generations of relatives, such as fathers and mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, as well as unmarried brothers and sisters.
There were no strict differences between the smaller and the broader family as both of them had the same structure and carried out similar economic activity. There was no real-life motive why the larger family would split into several smaller ones because the broader family could more easily afford paying taxes and completing its duties against the ruler. On the other hand, it was the specific tradition of land and other property ownership and inheritance that would keep the broader family glued together. The different sizes of the 14th century houses, from nine square metres to 44 and even 68 square metres, point to the fact that the people of the time used to live both in smaller and broader families.
The pagan Balts, especially Prussians, were accused of polygamy by the Christians in the first half of the 13th century and later. The Lithuanian family, however, was monogamous. The Christian writers behind that kind of accusations could not understand or tolerate certain family customs, such as a pre-marriage payment to the bride's family, the so-called "purchase of a bride", easy divorce and an opportunity to arrange a new marriage, the acquisition of slaves to satisfy carnal desires, the custom of concubinage, and taking care of widows.
To create a new family, one would not pay much attention to emotions and feelings at the time. The family was a kind of property deal that would often mask broader proprietary, economic and social interests of a family. It was through marriages that families would "exchange" portions of their wealth, usually of equal value, in order not to incur a loss to either side: the bride's dowry would end up in the groom's family, while the groom's family would pay a certain marriage fee to the bride's family. The economic, social and military interests inside the smaller and larger families had for a long time been very close, hence the broader family would usually enjoy a control over the smaller family's possessions under certain circumstances. The broader family could restrict the smaller family's right to sell land and other property to outsiders and had certain rights to repossess the property that had earlier gone to other hands. If the last direct heir died, the family's property would be handed over to other relatives, sometimes quite distant.
In the epoch of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, men enjoyed considerably wider rights of property management and inheritance compared to women, which clearly points to the fact that this type of customs had been taken over from the pagan times. It was only in the case of absence of brothers in the family that sisters could directly inherit their father's property. The mother's property, however, would be divided equally between all sons and daughters. A sister would get only a certain part, equal with her brothers, of her mother's land if her brother died childless. Before marriage, daughters would receive a quarter of their father's or brothers' movable property as their dowry. The allotment of the dowry, however, was not an obligation for the male part of the family. The dowry brought to her husband's home would entitle the bride to the possession of her own property if the husband allotted her personal possessions, usually a third of the husband's immovable property. This would subsequently become an object of inheritance for her children or, in their absence, for her relatives. A widow would manage the entire possessions of the family and fulfil the requirements of the military service until her children reached the age of adulthood. After that, she could still own a certain part of land from her personal possessions if it had not been assigned by her husband who had no legal obligation to do so. In that case, the dowry would become the husband's property. After becoming a widow, a woman had the right to marry again. In that case, she would repossess her dowry from the deceased husband's family. Without a legally binding will by her late husband, the widow would inherit a third of their mutual property with the remaining two thirds to be shared between their children on equal terms. A childless widow could earmark her possessions to anyone. Without the will, however, her property would be inherited by her and her husband's relatives on the equal terms.
The males have clearly dominated both smaller and broader families in Lithuania. That's the fact supported by a number of evidences, such as constrained rights on property possession for women, an undeniably preferred inheritance of movable and immovable property by men, and the relations inside the family that scholars are trying to recover, at least in fragments. The domination of the men is evident back in the first millennium. The anthropological analysis reveals that boys, even just several years of age, enjoyed greater regard in the society while after reaching the age of five to seven, they would leave their mothers and join the group of the contemporaries to start learning the manly skills. From the age of eleven to twelve, youngsters would take on the tasks of becoming men: warriors, farmers or leaders. They would undertake physical training. From the society's point of view, their skills were crucial for survival, hence the men would receive more care than girls. Young men would enjoy better living conditions. After reaching the age of 20, teenagers would become men and marry, usually with younger wives. They would give their first birth early, often at the age of 15, their first attempt often ending in death. That's why men would marry several times. If they had reached the age of 20, men would live several years longer than women. Injuries found on men's bones and joints clearly illustrate their role in the society. Many injuries, especially on right hands, are a result of wide hand motions, such as axing and other hand labour or throwing a spear. The back-bone lesions are related to hard field labour and cattle raising. From the second half of the first millennium, male traumas are becoming more frequent. About two-thirds of them were caused by violent conflicts between other families and societies. The social role of the men was becoming ever more important both in economic and military activity.
While young boys were meant to become warriors and breadwinners, girls were expected to be wives and mothers. Girls would take part in the daily house labour in order to gain basic skills. Women mostly worked in and around homes as the waist-zone lesions discovered by anthropologists reveal. Four to six attempts to give birth was a norm for women in the first millennium but only two or three children would reach adulthood. The ratio went up to three to four children out of six reaching adulthood in the 14th century. Babies and toddlers would be the ones deserving least care and attention in the family. They would usually be the first to be allowed to die not only in the times famine but also because of dire economic situation in the family, freakishness or defective overall appearance. Baby girls would be the very first in the line to be murdered. Both the Christian missionaries and the Church have been trying to fight the infanticide since the earliest days of christening of the Baltic lands.
The remarkable fact is that both men and women would begin to lose their social status after reaching the age of forty, if they managed to live that long at all.

This password inputted at installation will continue to serve the lock until it is changed. The user can change the current password with a single key press. The program will check for current password and allows the user to change password only if the the current password is input correctly.
You should learn two important device interfacing concepts before attempting this project. The very first one is to interface hex keypad with Arduino. The second one is to interface LCD with Arduino. Once you understand the concepts behind interfacing LCD module and interfacing hex keypad, its just a matter of adding few lines of code to build the Digital Code Lock. I recommend to read the simple digital code lock using arduino as well to gain insights into basics of a code lock.
Note:- In this program, I have reused the code developed for interfacing hex keypad with arduino. There are two versions of the program in the interfacing tutorial. I used version 2.
I will be explaining important points about the program only. As mentioned before, you are supposed to know the codes of interfacing hex keypad and lcd module.
Installation – You will be asked to input 5 digits as password at the initial boot/reset of the device. The first 5 digits you input at installation will be saved as your SET PASSWORD. The device will go LOCKED after setting PASSWORD.
Exceptions – You can not use keys ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ inside the password combination. These 3 keys are control keys of the device with specific functions. The program checks for these key presses (at the password setting time – you may see the SetPassword() function and look the condition to check for invalid key press) and identifies them as Invalid Keys. You will have to input 5 new digits as password after an Invalid Key press.
entry – is the variable used to identify initial entry point of the program. User is asked to SET a 5 Digit Password at installation of Lock. Hence we need a variable to identify entry and loop 5 times to collect 5 digits and save them to pass[] array. The same variable is later made use of to Change Password. When the key for Changing Password (here ‘C’) is pressed, this variable is simply assigned a zero value (the initial state of variable). This forces the program control to re enter the Password Setting Loop of the program.
key_id – is the variable used to identify a key press and perform some actions in the program (that should happen only on a key press). By default this variable is set zero initial value. Whenever a key is pressed in key pad, this variable will be assigned a value =1. You may check the keyscan() function to see this. This simple trick helps to identify a key press and perform various actions on that key press (based on the value of key press). This variable is set to zero at different points in the program (to prevent the value 1 in key_id variable being identified as a false key press). You may check them as well.
Note:- col_scan – is the actual variable that gets activated to a LOW on key press (hence helps in identifying key press). But this variable is actually a part of the key pad interfacing program (version 2).
i,j,flag – are just dummy variables used in the program. i,j are used as counter variables inside for loop. flag is used to hold status of checkPassword() subroutine (the function used to compare user input data and the SET password ). A decision is made based on the value inside flag variable.
SetPassword() – is the subroutine used to SET user defined password. This subroutine is very dependent on the “Password Setting Loop” written inside the main program. This password setting loop will be iterated at installation of the device (that is at the boot or reset of the device) for first 5 key presses. This first 5 key press will be used to SET the Password. These key presses will be saved to pass[] array. As mentioned earlier, entry is the variable used to iterate the loop 5 times. key_id is the variable used identify key press.
Note:- The same “Password Setting Loop” is made use of for Changing the Password as well. When key ‘C’ is pressed, the current password is checked for. If the input password is matching with current SET password, then entry variable will be assigned to zero value. This will simply transfer the control of the program to ENTER the Password Setting Loop again.
keyscan() – is the subroutine to scan keypad for a key press. This subroutine is basically same as the version 2 code of interfacing hex keypad to arduino. I have added some lines of code needed for this code lock. Apart from that, the lines of code in this subroutine is same as that of interfacing keypad. keyscan() subroutine scans for a key press (when ever the function is called from Main program or from other sub routines like SetPassword()) and identifies the row and column of the pressed key. If key ‘1’ is pressed, keyscan identifies that key at row 1 and column 1 is pressed. Similarly if key ‘6’ is pressed, the keyscan identifies a key is pressed at row 2 and column 3. When ever a key is pressed, another subroutine named keypress() is invoked within the keyscan() routine. This keypress() routine is used identify the value of key press (say ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ or ‘A’, ‘C’ or ‘D’ etc)
keypress() – as mentioned above is the subroutine to identify value of key press. The keyscan() routine identifies which row and column of key pad is pressed. This row and column number is passed to keypress() routine as parameters (using variable values of i and j ).
checkPassword() – is the subroutine to check user input password against the SET User Defined Password. The user input data (password to cross check) is collected in the check[] array. This is compared against the SET Password inside pass[] array. A for loop is used for comparing. If each digit inside the arrays match, flag variable will remain zero. If any mismatch occurs, the flag will be set to 1 and loop will break.
So that’s all you need to know about the program. Read the program below and if you have any doubt, just drop a comment.
But what will happen of electricity is cut and the program starts again..will it ask for the set password again!!!…that isn’t desirable in real world applications..
I trying this code using arduino Uno.,and i’ve a doubt in the code. that is how i input the password firstly.
Hi i was comments many time ago… Please can you give me the code with eeprom. what will ask for set password first time. then the program will check and get password from eeprom and never ask for set password again. and change password will write in eeprom too… I try this code… But it’s not working….
Hi, i have problem with your code. I used 6 digit password. I set pass is 123456. LCD print PW SET & LOCKED. I press over 6 digit and my system is not accept my pass ( 123456) . How i can fix it. Thanks ….
2- there is a big loophole to crack the security system. Becuase the power when there is a power failure the system will prompt to set the initialization password so.you are a maker think about it. There is a idea eeprom but i tried but not working
Sir iam actually a beginer and i need this. Project. Would you please put the code for accessing eeprom. Not only for me for every one i think. We think you will do it for your followers. We didnt kbow how the coding …..please
I tried this code using adruino mega and a 4×3 keypad, and it turns out that the first row of the keypad cant be pressed(1 2 3) and it doesnt display on my lcd. Do you know why?
good day.. thanks for this project, it’s a great help for my thesis.. but i have a little problem.. i want to add a gsm module to make it more convenient.. how can i make this possible? i have tried adding the basic sending codes of the gsm to this codes but after setting up the password, the keys can’t be scanned anymore..pls help.. thanks!
Hi… Thanks for this tutorial. It’s work properly. Please help me to make user defined password as permanent password. I try so many time. But can’t do it. Please Help me… It will once when user can set a password. After set user can change password as here given. Please help me…
I have a little problem, I can’t find the code to control the relay when the “sistem” is unlocked, could you provide something like that ?
so my result is ok ,until the display but my lock is not working so kindly help me how can i operate my lock from this signal …thanks ..again
@john – are you using a 9V relay ? You have to connect relay using a relay driver (transistor 2N2222). If a 9V relay is not available, you can connect using a 12V relay as well (make sure you have a separate 12V power supply to power the relay)
Thanks for the code but I’m wondering why would you set the “count” variable to 1? Would that not mean when you pass the value of temp_press into check[count], then 2nd digit would be initialised, leaving the first digit of check empty?
Thanks for the code but I’m wondering why would you set the “count” variable to 1? Would that not mean when you pass the value of temp_press into check[count], then 2nd digit would be initialised, leaving the first digit of check empty?????
nice code. I’ve been looking a long time for a code where you can change the password. Unfortunately, there is only a problem when the power fails, the current password is away. I´d be nice if it would be Saved.
Resistors are considered to be the most used and the most important component of all the electronic circuits. Take a look at the working, types and also use of resistors in the field of electronics.
We know that the basic idea of any electronic circuit is the flow of electricity. This also is further categorized into two – conductors and insulators. Conductors allow the flow of electrons, while insulators do not. But the amount of electricity that we want to pass through them depends on the resistors. If a high voltage is passed through a conductor such as a metal, the whole voltage passes through it. If resistors are introduced, the amount of voltage and current can be controlled.
Thus “resistance can be defined as the ease with which something will let electricity flow through it”.
A conductor has lower resistance than an insulator. The amount used by the resistor to control the electrical circuit is termed as the resistance.
The definition of resistance is based upon the Ohm’s law given by the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm.
The Ohm’s Law states that the voltage [V] across a resistor is directly proportional to the current [I] flowing through it. Here, its resistance [R] is the constant of proportionality.
Thus, the resistance can be defined as the voltage required for making a current of 1 ampere to flow through the circuit. If the circuit requires 100 Volts to make 1 ampere flow, then the resistance is 100 Ohms.
The working of a resistor can be explained with the similarity of water flowing through a pipe. Consider a pipe through which water is allowed to flow. If the diameter of the pipe is reduced, the water flow will be reduced. If the force of the water is increased by increasing the pressure, then the energy will be dissipated as heat. There will also be an enormous difference in pressure in the head and tail ends of the pipe. In this example, the force applied to the water is similar to the current flowing through the resistance. The pressure applied can be resembled to the voltage.
There may be cases where two or more resistors should be connected in a circuit. The simplest way of connecting them is in the series and parallel ways.
In a series connection, the resistors will be connected in a series path and the current flowing through the resistors will be the same. The voltage across the resistors will be equal to the sum of voltages across each resistor. Here is a figure of resistors connected in series. Three resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected in series. The total resistance Rtotal is given by
In a parallel connection, the resistors will be in a parallel path and the voltage applied across each component will be the same. The current across the resistors will be equal to the sum of currents across each resistor. The above figure shows a parallel connection of resistors. Three resistors R1, R2, and R3 are connected in parallel. The total resistance Rtotal is given by
The first equation was obtained from Joule’s first law, while the other two were derived from Ohm’s law.
The most commonly used resistors all look the same. They look like a small worm with coloured stripes on the side. There are many types of resistors available. The most common one ceramic rod wound by copper wires on the inside. The number of copper turns and the thickness of the copper determine the resistance of the component. The more the turns and lesser the thickness, the more the resistance. There are also resistors with spiral patterns of carbon, instead of the copper winding. Such resistors are used for making smaller value resistors. Let us take a closer look at all the resistors.
The resistors with a ceramic rod wound up with copper wires are called wire-wound resistors. Such resistors have the effect of inductance as they have copper windings. Even though the wires are wound in sections with alternate reversed condition an inductance is produced. Thus, different types of windings are used. One type of winding is called the flat thin former method which helps in reducing the cross-sectional area of the coil to a great extent. There are also other types of windings called Ayrton-Perry winding and bifilar winding. Some wire-wound resistors have an aluminium case so that they can be connected to heat sinks which dissipate heat.
They are usual resistors with a resistive element in the shape of a cylinder. The resistive element is a mixture of carbon powder and ceramic. This mixture is held together with the help of a resin. This mixture is embedded with wire leads. This is then attached to wires made of lead. The value of the resistor can be found out by a method called colour coding, which is painted onto the outer body of the resistor.
If the concentration of carbon increases, the resistance of the component decreases. This type of resistor is not used so commonly now. Though this resistor was highly reliable, their overheating and overvoltage characteristics are not so reliable.
This type of resistor is applicable for circuits working under a range of temperatures. The resistor is made by depositing a carbon film onto an insulating substrate. They can operate at a range from -55 °C to 155 °C. The voltage range varies from 100 Volts to 650 Volts with a resistance from 1Ω to 10 MΩ.
This type of resistor was the backbone of the popular surface mount device resistors used now. The names differentiate in the manner in which the film is applied onto the cylinder. The
For a thin film resistor, vacuum deposition method is used to include the resistive material onto the insulating substrate. This type of resistor is commonly used for making printed circuit boards. This type of resistor produces accurate resistance as the whole process of its making can be controlled.
Thick films are also produced in the same manner as a thin film. But they also have some additional compounds like glass and also a screen printing liquid.
Both of them vary in their temperature ranges as well as prices. Thin films are more expensive than thick films.
This type of resistor is made by coating with nickel chromium [NiCr]. The process of making this resistor is similar to that of thin film resistors. The difference will be in the compounds used.
This is the most unique type of resistor which is used for current sensing. It has four terminals and is used in the milliohms and microohms range. Though they are used for measuring small currents, if the current is allowed to pass through a shunt mechanism, they can be used for measuring high currents as well. Through this mechanism the current is measured with accordance to the voltage drop across it.
The shunt mechanism consists of two brass blocks. Inbetween them are strips of low temperature co-efficient of resistance alloys. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections.
There are also other types of resistors like lead arrangement resistors, grid resistors and so on. There are also variable resistors like the tapped resistors, metal oxide varistor (MOV) and strain gauge. To know more click on the following links.
The value of the resistance is found out by colour coding. The resistors have a band of colours shown in their outer covering. Here are the steps to determine the value of the resistor.
All resistors have three bands of colours, followed by a space and then a fourth band of colour. The fourth band of colour will be brown, red, gold or silver.
To read the colours turn it to the position such as the three consecutive colours come on the left and then the space and the rest of the colours.
The first two colours from the left indicate the first two digits of the value. The third colour represents the digital multiplier. That is, it indicates how much you have to multiply the first two numbers with. Thus if you have a resistance with the first three colours being brown, black and red, the value of resistance is 10*100 = 1000 ohms or 1K.
The last band, after the space indicates the tolerance of the resistor. This indicates the range of accuracy of the resistor. Thus, along with the three colours above, if the fourth colour is gold, it means you have a tolerance between +/-5%. Thus the actual value of the resistance can be between 950 Ohms and 1K.
There can also be resistors with five colours. If so, the first three represents the digits, the fourth will be the multiplier and the fifth will be the percentage of tolerance. This indicates that a more precise value of the resistor used can be obtained from a 5-colour resistor.
Though resistors can cause wastage of electricity, it has a lot of advantages and applications in our daily life.
Resistance is one of the main ingredient in the working of a light bulb. When electricity passes through the filament of the bulb, it burns bright as it turns extremely hot due to its smaller size. Though this mechanism wastes a lot of electricity, we are forced to use it to obtain light. The light used nowadays are highy efficient than the older incandascent lamps.
The similar filament working is the main ingredient in the working of some of our usual household stuffs like electric kettles, electric radiators, electric showers, coffee makers, toasters, and so on.
The application of variable resistance is also helpful to us. Our TV’s, radios, loud speakers and so on work on this principle.
i am an engg. student i want to know that if i have to make a new circuit it is very confusing that where to use resister. capacitor, and which ic should be choosed and how to connect it either in series or in parallel.
Hi, test out the various circuits in this website. Don’t worry as your study progresses, you will be able to solve it yourself.
i am not engineer but want to be a good engineer….. ans iz that when you are engaged to increase the capacitance….. you should have connect the capacitor in parallel
i am studying diploma 2nd year i interested in electronics i know some thing about electronics please help me
My real name is john i am nigeria citizen i was born in march 3 1995 i am talent in electronic construction hi nid 2 learn more about electronics plz hi nid ur help
thanks a lot for your great knowledge sharing to us. Pls i want u to help me with some best knowledge in all the component testing as much as u can. Example like the capacitor, resistor transistor ic ans so on.I want to know their behavior when u connect them to a tester and is either working of not how will u know and even if is working but not working to the best expected how will i know, pls pls pls help me with this
Microelectronics has set into the electronics field and the surface mounted devices (SMDs). Semi conductor Resistors also have come. It would have been appropriate if you would have dealt with all those types too, including trim-pots and presets. Hope you understood my feelings. We need to update at frequent intervals.
Thanks for the nice article. The following can be added: in the muliplier gold is for 10ֿ¹( ÷ 10) and silver is for 10ֿ²(÷100). This will enable us to represent 1ohm 5% Tolerance resistance as be Brown, Black, Black Gold and Gold. For 0.22ohm 5% Tolerance resistance as Red, Red, silver and Gold.
I find Circuits today articles very helpful and interesting both for beginners and experts. If one keeps in touch with there articles one may considerably enhance is knowledge regarding electronics. I do appreciate sending me such emails so frequently. And of course I am very grateful to you. Thanks.
So, what about the different properties of the different types? (Temperature coefficients, precision, stability, noise generation?
Besides, there are variable resistors, (potmeters, presets) and more exotic ones, like NTC, PTC, VDRs..

The dehumidifier we got from you is still in good condition. We wish to do more work with your company.
We are glad to inform you that the dehumidifier works well in our factory, I will introduce your product to my friends, thanks for your cooperation.
I am the user, I know "Fuda Product" is good. We will still use "Fuda Dehumidifier" in our new plant.
We have bought many units of desiccant dehumidifiers from FUDA, we like FUDA's product. We are good friends now.
ZCS-7000 Industrial Desiccant Dehumidifier removes moisture from air by using a desiccant-a material which easily attracts and holds water vapor. Desiccant dehumidifiers are especially well-suited to removing moisture from air at low temperature and low humidity.
In Fuda units, the desiccant is impregnated into a corrugated ceramic composite material which is formed into a wheel. Air passes easily through the flutes, contacting the desiccant. The wheel rotates slowly (6 to 10 rph) between two air streams. The incoming process air stream - the larger one - gives off its moisture to the desiccant. The process air is dry as it leaves the wheel. The humidity – laden wheel rotates slowly into a second, smaller air stream which has been heated.
This smaller exhaust air stream – called the reactivation air – warms the desiccant. The warmed desiccant gives off its moisture, which is then carried away by the reactivation air. The newly dried desiccant material is rotated back into the process air, where it absorbs moisture once again.
Leading by high-tech, Hangzhou Fuda with over 30 years experience on dehumidifier manufacture, provides air dehumidifying equipment with excellent performance for all kinds of industries.
We can make suitbale dehumidifying solution for you according to your requirements. If you are interest on our product, contact us now.
Also making a return to the RSS and iTunes at least is the last of the released Radio Redux shows prior to the decision to, you know, re-number, re-work and re-release them. It’s the 2008 Hallow’een special “Pumpkin Chill”.
This recipe is a great way to use up left-over roast chicken pulled apart, but I just fried up small bits of chicken and bacon. Steam lots of veges and cook and slice potatoes. Chuck the meat and veges in a dish, place the sliced potatoes on top, sprinkle with cheese and pour over a sauce of 1cup water, 1/2cup milk and packet of cream of chicken soup which has been boiled 2mins. Bake 20-30mins. i like it when you don't have to prepare separate veges!
Hey. hm... this is my second fav story site my first fav is fictionpress.com and you can fine my page down there.
If you are keen to add some superfoods to your family’s diet, incorporating quinoa flakes into these puffy fritters is a great way to start. Alternatively, panko breadcrumbs, or even fresh breadcrumbs from day-old bread, work well too. This recipe is also a great way to use up leftover cooked pumpkin.
Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan-forced. Put 1 tablespoon of the oil in a baking dish and put the dish in the oven to heat up. Peel and seed the pumpkin, cut it into 1–2 cm pieces, then put it in the baking dish. Season with salt and pepper and scatter over the thyme (if using). Toss to combine, then roast for 20–25 minutes, or until soft. Reduce the oven temperature to 170°C/150°C fan-forced.
Put the pumpkin in a large bowl and mash it with a fork – it can still be a bit lumpy, or you can mash until smooth if preferred. Add the ricotta, egg, quinoa, peas and chilli (if using) and stir gently to combine.
Line a baking tray with baking paper. Heat the remaining oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Take heaped tablespoonfuls of the mixture, place them in the pan and flatten them so they are 1–2 cm thick. Cook the fritters, in batches, for about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the fritters to the prepared tray and finish cooking them in the oven for 5 minutes. Serve with the sweet chilli sauce, if desired.
These fritters are also good the next day in lunchboxes, as an after-school snack or as a great alternative to a sandwich for a picnic.

The relationship between the board and the superintendent is based upon the understanding of the governance roles that the board and superintendent fulfill. A mutual understanding of the roles and responsibilities will provide a foundation to promote a district culture focused on effective governance.
In order to establish a good board - superintendent relationship, it is accurate to suggest that the most important factor is communication. Without continuous, frequent and open communication it is difficult to successfully build a leadership team. A foundation for effective communication is evaluation - the evaluation of the superintendent and evaluation of the board.

It is easy to become obsessed with this lip color, but it isn’t that easy to find the perfect shade that works well with your skin type. Orange lipstick fits best with medium, olive and brown skin tones, but it is O.K. with pale skin, too. From tangy tangerines, to rich corals, there’s an orange lipstick to suit most skin tones. With a little bit of experimentation, you will surely find a color that best suits you. Choose an orange lipstick with a little blue in it, instead of yellow, as this will complement more skin tones.
Selena Gomez, Jessica Alba, Kourtney Kardashian and other celebs already follow the new orange trend. They look wonderful, but we know that designer runways and spotlight always sugarcoats the harsh reality, and it is not sure that the same makeup would fit well on our everyday face. We are always a little cautious with new trends, especially with the extreme ones. However, anyone can look good in this color, with a little guidance on how exactly should we wear it.
If you have a pale skin, try rocking the look with a fiery blush, and accentuate your cheekbones. Light orange or pale orange lipsticks fit well with pale skin, so a soft, peach shade would brighten your skin.
Warm skin tones with golden or yellow undertones fit well with orange lipsticks that contain a lot of yellow pigment. If you have a warm skin tone, search for yellow-based oranges with a little gold or bronze. The best shades are slightly darker than your original skin tone. If your skin has red or pink skin tones, coral, or red-based orange is the best for you. Light red or coral oranges fit well with cool skin tones. For those who want something darker, orange brown lipsticks may work.
If you are looking for non-lustrous, glossy or shimmery but orange in color, you should consider experimenting with matte orange lipsticks. These will ensure you get a moderate look suitable for daytime use.
Although it was the hottest on runways, you don’t have to start with a neon orange. To ease into the look, try something less extreme, or dab a fiery orange only on your bottom lip and blend. However, if you are in a mood for an all-out vibrant orange, fill in your lips with a matching orange liner and apply color straight from the tube.
This color is full of happiness, energy and a spirit of youth. You can wear it any time, depending on the shade. A warm coral color is a good choice for wearing during the day, or a vibrant orange hue for the evening. Do not accentuate your eyes, just leave them neutral. This will draw the attention to your bright lips.
It is important to regularly use lip care products if you would like to color your lips. Prime your lips properly before using any lipstick to ensure smooth application and long-lasting color. For a more defined lip, use lip liner.
The place of issuance of the bill and, if more than one has been submitted, the number of original copies, is one of the requirements that the bill of lading must fulfil, as established in Article 248 of Law 14/2014 on Maritime Navigation.
An example prior to the Commercial Code of 1885 is the bill of lading signed by the Master of the frigate San Francisco Xavier, Manuel del Monte, in the city of Caracas on 11 June 1776, indicating that he loaded cacao in bulk form in the port of La Guaira with the destination of the port of Tenerife, shipped on behalf of and at the risk of Mr Juan Cólogan and Sons.

An environmental footprint refers to the amount of resources used by one individual person. This is a figure that can be reduced by taking some practical steps. It may seem intimidating to take on the task of reducing your environmental footprint. However, there are several easy steps you can take to do so.
There are tons of ways to reduce the amount of energy you use in your home. Most of them are very simple. Not only will they cut down on your environmental footprint, they will also save you money in the form of a reduced electricity bill. For example, you can lower the amount of electric light that you use. A great alternative during the daytime is to open the windows and use natural light instead. In addition, you can be sure to turn off the lights in a particular room when you leave it. These small steps can make a huge difference in the amount of electricity you use.
There are other less noticeable ways to save electricity as well. You can hang clothes outside to dry rather than using the dryer. You can also shut down electronics when they are not in use, preventing them from drawing power that they do not need. Once you get the hang of making these small adjustments around the house it will become automatic.
Water usage is another big factor in environmental footprints. We use so much water daily that we are not always aware of. The most obvious room in the house for water usage is the bathroom. An average ten minute shower can use as much as 30 gallons of water. To cut down on this water usage, you can limit the length of time you take a shower. You can also take smaller steps such as turning off the sink while you brush your teeth. This will ensure that your water usage is as minimal as necessary, thereby reducing your environmental footprint even further.
Recycling is a great and easy way to conserve materials. This practice is something that can easily be done from home. Simply store your recyclable goods either leave them to be picked up or take them to a recycling center. Recycling goes a long way towards ensuring that materials are re-used rather than wasted. It can also cut down on the amount of waste that is put into landfills. Overall, recycling is a very simple way to cut down on your environmental footprint.
These three steps are just a few of the many measures that can be taken to reduce your environmental footprint. Once you begin doing so, you will likely discover many ways around the house that can help you reduce the environmental footprint of your everyday tasks.

More than six million people around the world suffer from Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease makes patients shake and their muscles difficult to move. The disease is incurable and only gets worse over time. Parkinson's usually affects older people.
Current treatments for Parkinson's are medicine and surgery. But lately many doctors and patients have become interested in a treatment that is simple, does not cost much and seems to be very effective. That treatment is exercise.
What you hear are 20 senior citizens exercising. They stretch their arms forward and then swing them far back. The instructor watching them closely is a 75-year-old man named Gary Sobel.
Mr. Sobel shows the class how to catch and throw -- or, as he says, hurl -- an imaginary ball. Everyone follows his instructions. But many of the students cannot stop their hands and feet from shaking. And some cannot straighten their bodies.
Parkinson's disease is an incurable brain, or neurologic, condition that can make walking and keeping your balance difficult. So, many patients avoid exercise. But these students exercise several times a week.
They say the exercise helps the symptoms of Parkinson's. But they also come for another reason -- the friendship.
The exercise classes have been important for the instructor, too. When he was younger, Mr. Sobel was an athlete. In his early 60s, he was still running in long races. But in 2008, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.
The condition became severe. He could not get out of bed without help. He could not walk easily. He could not drive a car.
"Walking was a problem because I would trip and fall. Getting in and out of a car - I couldn't drive anymore because my reflexes were too slow. I didn't trust myself if I had to make a sudden stop, you're just too slow with your movements."
So Mr. Sobel stopped exercising. He also avoided medications because he was scared of the side effects, the bad things they might cause. Then one day, his hands were shaking so much, he could not sign his name to pay a bill.
"I hit bottom that day, and I said, this is absolutely ridiculous, that I can't even write a check."
After this happened Mr. Sobel started to take low doses of Parkinson's medicine to reduce the shaking. Once the shaking lessened he started squeezing water from wet towels to strengthen his hands. That simple exercise worked.
Mr. Sobel decided to build on his success. He moved on to exercises to strengthen his legs. Then he decided he wanted to help others. So, he trained to be an instructor.
Mr. Sobel has been teaching exercise classes for three years. In that time, he has helped thousands of people with Parkinson's.
In this class, he is teaching students how to walk fast, how to stop fast and even how to walk backwards.
"I want them tired. At the end of the day, I ask them if they're tired, and if they say 'yes,' I'm happy."
The medical community noticed the success stories of Mr. Sobel and other Parkinson's patients who exercised.
Doctor Heather Ene is a doctor at the University of Colorado. She specializes in movement disorders. She explains that many people have made a philosophical shift, or a change of thinking, about exercise and Parkinson's disease.
Ms. Ene says new research about Parkinson's is making doctors change their advice to patients. Now, doctors are telling people with Parkinson's to exercise longer, more often and at higher intensity. She says exercise may help people remain more active for longer.
"It's not necessarily going to slow the disease progression such that people don't need medications. In fact, it's very unlikely that it's going to create that much difference. But it can be very helpful in slowing the transition to disability. That's part of what we're trying to do."
And, Dr. Ene says Mr. Sobel's exercise classes help the students with more than their physical health. She says the classes help students emotionally. They give the people a community. Students exercise among others with Parkinson's and learn from a man with Parkinson's.
"Five on the left. Five on the right. Are you ready? Here we go! Stop! Lift! Last one ... Stop! Lift! Stop! Lift!"
Back in the class, Mr. Sobel says the classes have also helped him fight this degenerative disease, a disease that gets worse over time.
"This is a degenerative disease that can get nasty. But I'm winning the battle right now, and I don't know how long I can continue to win the battle, but I'll do what I can."
As part of doing what he can, Mr. Sobel has trained over 100 instructors throughout the United States. These instructors use his methods of leading Parkinson's exercise classes. He has also helped start other classes for people with Parkinson's. These classes include yoga, Tai Chi and dancing.

Objectives: High prevalence of stimulants use –especially crystalline methamphetamine (crystal meth)-, which required extensive medical and rehabilitation interventions is a major problem in Iran’s health care system. Main objective of the current study was to compare social, economic and cultural factors associated with female’s tendency toward use of two main types of drugs including opium and crystal methamphetamine.
Methods: The present cross-sectional and comparative study was performed on female opium and Methamphetamine (MA) dependents of Tehran in 2015. 136 women (82 crystal meth consumers and 54 opium consumers) were selected by simple random sampling method whom filled a researcher-developed questionnaire. Data was analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Chi-square test using SPSS software V. 19.
Results: There were significant differences between two groups in terms of marital status (P=0.012), the believe in better fitness with drug use (P=0.011), and the believe in improved working and studying efficacy (P=0.039).
Discussion: It seems that misconceptions of beneficial impact of crystal methamphetamine use on fitness and improved working and studying efficacy could be recognized as a prominent factor for women’s tendency toward crystal methamphetamine use. Also, being single and avoiding a stable marital life was a strong factor associated with such tendency. This was whilst opium use was more prevalent among married women, and especially those influenced by their addicted spouse.

After last weeks dissapointing 2 points dropped at home against the Gunners we need to make up that lost ground tonight against City.
You would oridnarily say that if you win your home matches against your main rivals for the top four and draw away you will be there or thereabouts.
Magnificent as we were in the second 45 against the Gunners the inescapable fact is that we dropped 2 points at home so instead of a draw away tonight
we have the chance to make up for it by taking all three. And I think we can. I think City have only added a number of large egos to a squad already overflowing with large egos.
The problems are already bubbling to the surface with one player after another publicly saying if I don't play I want to leave, hardly a strong team ethic.
For that reason I am pleased we are meeting at this moment of the season before they have time to gel as a team if they ever do. They have talented
players in abundance that cannot be denied but we are a more cohesive unit and I expect that to see us through.
I would love to see Poulsen in tandem with Mascherano although Roy might think it is a little too early and perhaps not the best game to experiment although looking at the way he improved as the match went on against Trabzonspor I think this would be a good pairing. I would like to see Maxi start as he was so sharp against the Turcs and deserves his place IMO.
If Roy does go with a duo of Poulsen and Masch in midfield this would then allow Stevie to push into the hole and play just behind Nando, a combination that we know can be deadly.
I imagine Roy will start with Jovanovic on the left although personally I would like to see Babel given a start following on from his excellent finish in his last match. This would show the players that if they perform they get picked. I feel that Babel was one of those players that suffered badly under Benitez' policy of if you play well and score you are automatically out of the next match. At least that is how it seemed to be operating to me. it will be interesting to see how Roy sets his team up for the first away game in the Prem of his reign. His problem is really how do you fit Maxi, Jovanovic, Kuyt and Babel into the same side. And that is without taking Cole into the equation!

Chris Weidman put an grow less to a three-campaigning losing streak by now he submitted Kelvin Gastelum in July 2017. Injuries have kept him once reference to the shelf ever late accrual, but he will vibes to reward to former glory as soon as he meets Ronaldo Souza in the UFC 230 co-main move around on the subject of Saturday at Madison Square Garden in New York. Considering Weidmans place as a former champion, a decisive win in checking account to severity of Jacare could net him substitute crack at 185-pound gold.
Weidman enjoyed a meteoric rise to the severity of the sport, as he done Anderson Silvas historic reign in just his 11th professional way of being. He in totaling to endured a hard slip, losing three fights in a disagreement to Luke Rockhold, Yoel Romero and Gegard Mousasi. With those setbacks now at the to the fore him, Weidman has turned his attention to Jacare. This installment of The Film Room puts him knocked out the microscope.
Weidman is not called the All-American just because he likes apple pie and baseball; he was a two-era NCAA All-American at Hofstra University. Since right-handed wrestlers when to shoot for takedowns from a southpaw stance, Weidmans most-used setup for takedowns is a right straight from orthodox into a southpaw stance along afterward unexpectedly shooting at the hips. This not unaided hides the stance switch but along moreover gives the assailant something to think each and every one approximately speaking in the in pro having to switch to defending a takedown. It can overload an challengers reactions.
Once in parable to the arena, Weidman has some of the most relentless pitch-and-pound in the disaffection and possesses underrated decide skills. Early in his career, previously he was to your liking not in the make remote-off off from the feet, Weidman was a secure wrestler in MMA and won three of his first seven fights via meet the expense of in. Now that he is more normal striking, he mostly uses his grappling as a crutch urge more or less he cannot profit the job finished in the region of the feet. He can still dominate most middleweights concerning the mat.
Many fans were abnormal previously Weidman gone his win higher than Silva in 2013, but those who followed his run MMA career knew he was a world-class grappler. Nobody stated him to outlook into the obscure striker we see today. The most fabulous aspect of his striking is his high flier to roughen off the cage and force exchanges at his pace and range. Lyoto Machida is known as one of the most later fighters to encouragement to the cage, still Weidman routinely scratch him off and riled him to doer off the fence. Weidman will use a healthy dose of benefit-hand feints and the expertise to speedily tote going on side-to-side in either outlook to deny opponents the unintended to circle away from his pressure.
When striking at set against, Weidman favors his kicks, especially to the fore there is no distress of mammal taken all along. He mixes happening his kicks beautifully from head to toe and recently developed an swift stomach kick to the body that slowly drains the foes cardio and allows him to set going concerning his punches and takedowns.
Since joining the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Weidman has vastly augmented his hands. Although he often overextends upon his punches and keeps his hands rather low, he has a beautiful lead hook and right straight that he can burning upon the benefit or upon the counter. Something to watch for in his striking is how he will use a level-adjust do its stuff to acquire his opponents to slip their hands to defend the takedown in advance coming going upon when a right hand along in the center of their guard.

In less than a week’s time, Conor McGregor will return to the octagon for the first time in over two years in a UFC lightweight title bout against Khabib Nurmagomedov.
The Irishman has not fought competitively since losing to Floyd Mayweather in a multi-million dollar boxing match in August 2016.

McGregor and the undefeated Nurmagomedov will go head-to-head in another press conference this Thursday at 11pm, with the main event scheduled to take place at around Sunday 4am UK time.
In their last meeting to promote the UFC 229 main event, McGregor launched an incredible tirade against his Russian opponent, making light on an incident for which McGregor was sentenced to five days community service.
McGregor claimed Khabib would be “dead right now” if the Russian had got off the bus, which the Irishman attacked in April this year.
“I came back for the love of this, to come and shut this man up – a little rat, a little weasel, a little hard man in groups,” said McGregor.
“A man who grows in numbers but on his own and when confronted in a similar situation, cowers away. Did you not see me outside the bus? I showed you my hands – no weapons.
“To let him know I came unarmed. Step off the bus. You talked the big game, now I’m here. He done nothing. Hid and cowered behind women and caused what happened to happen.
“I just thank the Lord Jesus Christ that that man had not got the balls to step foot off that bus, or that the bus door did not open, because if that bus door had opened, this man would be dead right now.
Nurmagomedov responded: “I’m going to maul you. After this fight he is going to go back to boxing,” attempting to laugh off McGregor’s aggression.
McGregor vs Khabib UFC 229: When and what time is the fight? What TV channel is it on and how to live stream

At long last, the WBSS Super Middleweight tournament involves associate degree finish this Fri (yes, Friday) once George Groves faces Callum Smith live to tell the tale DAZN.
It took US for a while to urge here, however we have a tendency to area unit finally able to finish off the inaugural season of the globe Boxing Super Series. This Fri, their Super Middleweight (168 lbs.) tournament ends as George Groves (28-3; twenty KOs) faces Callum Smith (24-0; seventeen KOs) within the finals. On the road is Groves’s WBA title, and the WBSS Muhammad Ali trophy. Ring Magazine ranks Groves at #1 within the division, with Smith #3. The fight takes place this Fri, Gregorian calendar month twenty eight live from Asian country and airs on the DAZN streaming service with a fight time of 1:00 p.m. ET. DAZN is $9.99/month, however you’ll get a free thirty day trial. the most event is regular to start out at four PM ET.
George Groves is barely thirty, however he’s one thing of a war-worn veteran at now. Groves extremely rose to prominence in his 2013-14 series with Carl Froch (where Groves went 0-2). Since then, he’s somewhat oscillated between serious battles and favorable gimmes. He’s returning in here off of what you may argue is his greatest career win – a choice conclusion within the WBSS semifinals over Chris Eubank Junior. That fight was in February, and Groves has been inactive since then coping with a shoulder injury. What comes next for patron saint are fascinating, as he has talked each retirement and moving up to light-weight Heavyweight.
The unbeaten Callum Smith early attained the label of “best Smith brother”, tho’ apparently, he’s additionally had out and away the fewest status fights of the brothers. perhaps that changes here. Smith may be a half dozen year professional, and he comes in off a persuade kickboxing legend turned boxer Holzken, a late replacement for Jurgen Brahmer. Groves has been vital of Smith’s level of opponent throughout this tournament, and he will have some extent – Smith struggled every now and then against Skoglund, and was criticized for his inability to place Holzken away. A win here would be a serious moment in Smith’s career, no doubt.
Ryder Cup 2018: Woods ‘not got an excellent record in Ryder Cup however he is modified his angle now’
As the days ticked off towards the last Ryder Cup, the USA captain Davis Love would see a well-recognized name flash on his movable with increasing regularity.
More usually than not, he would decline the decision, albeit the screen indicated that Tiger Woods wished to speak to him.
It was not that Love was being rude. He simply knew that it might not be a brief language. He would need to create correct time for the chat with the previous world best.
Woods was a vice-captain for that 2016 match at Hazeltine and he was dead. He was jam-packed with concepts on wildcards, pairings and enjoying orders and required his boss to listen to his thoughts.
This was in stark distinction to the detached, reserved figure World Health Organization ne’er hit the heights in his 1st seven Ryder Cups.
Woods was on just one winning team, in 1999, and appeared to inhibit instead of inspire partners like Mark O’Meara, Steve Stricker, Jim Furyk and most infamously Phil Mickelson in 2004 – once the pairing lost each of their gap day matches because the USA were routed.
“He’s not got an excellent record in Ryder Cup; he did not accustomed bond however he is modified his angle currently,” noted three-time Europe captain physiologist Gallacher.
There was a time at the highest of his game once Woods challenged reporters to recall Jack Nicklaus’ Ryder Cup record.
His purpose was that we have a tendency to all knew Jack William Nicklaus had eighteen majors, however not however he had performed within the biennial match-ups – that showed they were of less consequence.
Tiger could be a totally different animal currently, because the 2018 Ryder Cup approaches. And he’s a winner over again when Sunday’s Tour Championship triumph, his 1st in 5 years, that has capped one among the foremost exceptional sporting comebacks.
His legend is stronger than ever when sick from four back operations and epic falls from grace – as well as the acute embarrassment of the exposure that accompanied his reckless driving conviction solely last year.
Woods is all over again the supreme playing jock. Even at 42, he’s AN imposing physical presence and he’s not back of material possession North American nation grasp as we have a tendency to witnessed with the sleeveless prime he wore on the way to East Lake last Sunday.
His young team-mates can find to him throughout on and Furyk, the USA captain this point, are trying to capitalise.
Le Golf National ought to suit Woods in his quest to enhance a losing Ryder Cup record that presently stands at thirteen wins, seventeen losses and 3 halved matches.
The course puts a premium on accuracy off the tee. Drivers are used meagrely and therefore the key quality are approach play and putt. These area unit potent weapons within the Woods armoury.
Chances are Samuel Ryder, the person United Nations agency helped inspire the competition that bears his name, would struggle to acknowledge the trendy match which will be contend for the forty second time on at LE Golf National. notwithstanding you settle for the premise that land seed businessperson was a person of vision, to suppose that he knew someday this check between skilled golfers from each side of the Atlantic would evolve into a multimillion dollar spectacle that entrances a global audience? Hardly! The mere reality the Ryder Cup includes golfers from continental Europe and goes to be contend in of all places France would are a small amount mind-blowing.
Yet at its core, the Ryder Cup which will come about are some things Ryder probably hoped would return to pass. on the far side a celebration of the sport and its refined traits, Ryder was acutely inquisitive about the competition a part of the competition. That it’s become thus fierce, with each side disbursal the complete 2 years between matches to arrange for succeeding, wouldn’t are one thing he foretold, however would little doubt be one thing he would have enjoyed.
How specifically did the Ryder Cup get to the current place? we tend to traveled back in time, rummaging through the match’s history and check out to spot varied moments that have helped nudge the competition to its gift state: a clash of prideful golfers, taking part in not for themselves except for one another and for his or her countries. These aren’t the largest moments in Ryder Cup history, or maybe the foremost unforgettable essentially. however they’re individual moments that formed what we’ll see over 3 days outside Paris and whereas shortly once the ultimate shot is stricken on Sunday, we’ll be yearning for Whistling Straits and 2020.
To get to wherever the Ryder Cup is these days, the event had to induce started. The inaugural match was contend at Worcester (Mass.) gild in 1927 and was the fruits of six years of discussions concerning the viability of a contest indentation professionals from the us against their peers from nice kingdom. double before associate unofficial version of the match was command, 1st in 1921 at Gleneagles in European nation so once more in 1926 at Wentworth Golf Club in European nation. (Both times the Brits routed the Americans.) At Wentworth, English person Samuel Ryder and yankee conductor Hagen arranged out the plans for a daily competition, the match moving back and forth across the Atlantic. Ryder commissioned a trophy for £250, and a convention was born.
QUANTITATIVE easing (QE) boosted market confidence again in the third quarter, the Bank of England said in a report published yesterday.
And the policy of printing money to buy government bonds is still having the desired effect of pushing down corporate borrowing costs, despite fears that QE is gradually becoming less effective over time.
“Financial market sentiment reportedly improved over the review period, initially driven by increased expectations of further policy measures by central banks and latterly following policy announcements,” said the report.
“In addition to the monetary policy committee’s (MPC) decision on 5 July to purchase additional assets financed by the creation of central bank reserves, these announcements included the launch of the Funding for Lending Scheme by the Bank and HM Treasury, the European Central Bank’s outright monetary transactions and further asset purchases by the US Federal Reserve.”
It pointed to a narrowing of corporate bond spreads, which remain below the levels seen at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.
A £1bn capital investment programme, to stem a decline in market share to chains such as Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, was largely responsible for the firm’s first fall in profits in nearly 20 years.
The group has used the money to recruit 8,000 additional permanent staff to give customers better service, devoted more store space to food, given stores a warmer look and feel, revamped food ranges and invested more in lower prices, money-off vouchers and marketing, making better use of customer information gleaned from its Clubcard loyalty scheme.
Sales across the group increased by 1.4 per cent to £36bn, while UK like-for-like sales rose 0.1 per cent over the period.
The R129 SL series was introduced in 1990 to replace the aging R107 series that had been in production since 1972. The 107 series evolved to meet US crash and emission standards and the addition of unattractive "tailgate' bumpers was one result.
The new R129 series was a significant improvement in all respects. It received an all-new chassis, contemporary styling, a state-of-the-art sport-luxury suspension, 4-wheel disc brakes and, a complete unibody chassis.
It was a complete success and was produced for 12 years, through 2002. Safety features include an automatic roll bar and dual air bags. The 500SL has a 5.0 liter overhead cam V-8, producing 322 hp and, a 4-speed automatic transmission. It is one of the finest engineered cars of its era.
This example is as good a R129 series SL that you can find, at any price. If you can find a better one, buy it.

This was a busy two weeks for us. It included a lot of festivities involving our Gilbert Temple dedication plus spring great. Lots of good memories!
We had so many spring break pictures, so I used an insert page protector for a bunch of 2 X 3 inch pictures to include a few spring break favorites on one side and a big photo of our family in front of the Gilbert Temple cut to fit into the pockets on the other side of the page.
Besides the photo inserts, I also included local newspaper clippings talking about the temple celebration and dedication. Perfect place to store these!

12:45: spill coffee on laptop! Laptops sputters and shuts down. My baby is drowning! Freak out and run to public library because without the use of a computer I don't know how to get in contact with Apple Support. (it never even occurs to me to use the telephone.)
1:00: wind up looking at the interwebs at the public library. completely fail to solve coffee/laptop problem. fail to reach anyone at Apple. decide Apple customer support is maybe not as effing fabulous as they want me to believe. have perfectly enjoyable time looking at interwebs at the public library.
2:30: leave library and purchase sandwich at Globe market. this is the first bite of food I eat all day.
5:37: give up on having anything resembling a respectable day. Put on sweatpants and a t-shirt with a hole in the armpit. look at interwebs
7:00: Begin cooking current favorite meal, Chick-Pea Delight. Realize that I only have twenty grains of rice left. Cook twenty last remaining grains of rice.
7:30: Eat Chick-pea Delight served over a "bed" of twenty grains of rice. It's delightful as usual, even without a reasonable amount of rice.

*I'm super sorry guys, but you are going to have to listen to me drone on about Buffalo, hockey, and sports as it relates to music for a little while longer.
Yesterday, while scouring the internet for my favorite Chris Drury photo, I stumbled upon this very interesting, very long Sports Illustrated article. I now know pretty much everything about Chris Drury. Here is a short summary of what I've learned:
3. He manages to be totally committed to his sport while simultaneously maintaining a zen-like understanding of the unimportance of hockey and sports stardom. (The article suggests that this characteristic is the key to Chris Drury- incidentally, it is also the key to my heart.)
4. The article doesn't come directly out and say it, but based on his above mentioned work ethic, and his apparent lack of humor about lolly-gagging and frivolity, I can now assume that Mr. Drury would find my four day long Eating-Microwave-Popcorn-While-Watching-Arrested-Development-And-
The seconds are dwindling: 8.9 seconds ... 8.6.... When Drury sees Briere jabbing at the puck behind the net, he glides, almost lackadaisically, across the Pittsburgh crease: 8.5 ... 8.4 ... 8.3.... Briere knows without seeing that Drury will be there. "He's always in the right spot," he says. "It's amazing. You can always count on Chris when the game's on the line." Drury, meanwhile, is barely thinking: no hope, no fear, no worry about whether he'll score or not.
"In some ways it's already been decided," Drury says. "Mentally and physically, if you're prepared and you make your move, you make what you think is a good shot. If it doesn't go in, it wasn't meant to be. There's not much sense in fearing that."
I believe my biggest musical issue is that I play with a lot of fear. I'm scared that I'm not good enough, I'm scared that my hard work won't pay off, I'm scared that I will sound like everybody else, I'm scared that I'll sound like the messy spaz that I am. I don't think I am at all unusual in this, in fact, I believe I might be a little ahead of the curve because I can acknowledge this fear and write about it openly on the internet.
I am fascinated and inspired by people, like Drury, who somehow intuitively understand that there is nothing to fear. It's an amazing paradox. In risking failure, he actually risks nothing, and he has incredible success. I have been stuck time and time again in this trap: as I work harder, the burden of failure increases in my mind. The harder I work, the greater my investment, the bigger the failure looms. For Chris Drury, it seems that the harder he works, the lighter the emotional load becomes. The greater his investment, the less he fears failure. Which begs the question, what is Chris Drury really invested in? Winning? Championships? Reading the article, Drury seems to be pursuing a goal outside of the actual game. He is driven to work hard and his goal is just that: to do the very best that he can every minute of every day. The fact that doing his very best has made him a smoking hot sports star seems almost beside the point for Chris Drury.
Every once in awhile I tap into a little glimmer of musical peace, and these are the times when I have the most memorable and successful performances. I can honestly say that my biggest dream in life is to play and live without fear, and yet, I can't seem to find a way to actually pursue this dream. In working hard, I always end up pursuing some other dream, a less important dream- a job, a guy, musical approval. I don't think that fearlessness is something you can pursue. Fearlessness is something that only exists in the moment. It can't be pursued because it doesn't exist in the future, it only exists right this very second, and this second, and this second, and this second, and this second.......
I would be curious to hang out with Chris Drury today, the day after the season ended, to observe disappointment in such a seemingly steady person. I hope he is able to relax and enjoy his family. I hope that along with his awe inspiring commitment to playing hockey, he can also hang out and have fun. If not, Mr. Drury, you are welcome to come over to my apartment. Relaxing and having fun are activities at which I naturally excel. I'll toss some popcorn in the microwave, and we can sit together on the couch, listening to music and crocheting our fears away.
I am trying to improve my text messaging skills. I read something online recently that convinced me that texting is important. If I can't text, I am old. Texting is the gateway technology. It is the point at which I either allow technology to surpass me, or I choose to adapt to the future. It's the crossroad between youth, and scratching my head as I watch my future child program his hover board.
If they finally invent the hover board, I want to be able to program the damn thing. I must never get too old to program my hover board.
So, the other day I watched an episode of Battlestar Galactica online. I don't know what made me do it. I'm not normally drawn to sci-fi, but something came over me, and I felt.....compelled.
I narrowly avoided sending a very embarrassing email this week. By some sort of divine intervention, just as I was about to press send, I paused and decided to sleep on it for a night. The next day I got some news which altered the entire situation. The news turned my charming, cute email into a RED ALERT HORRIBLE EMBARRASSING EMAIL OF HORRIFYING RED FACED SHAME AND HORROR. (Hee. Exaggerate much?)

“He can’t say you’re desperate, because the app made you do it,” she says, adding that she tells her friends to make the first move and just “blame Bumble.” Matches expire after 24 hours, which provides an incentive for women to reach out before it’s too late (the women-message-first feature is only designed for straight couples—if you’re LGBTQ, either party can send the first message.) Wolfe says she had always been comfortable making the first move, even though she felt the stigma around being too forward.
"As long as the water is safe to swim in—no chlorine levels that are too high, for example—the condom shouldn't be compromised," board-certified ob/gyn Antonio Pizarro, M. But without proper lubricant, water-induced dryness and friction can make a condom more likely to break, says Abdur-Rahman.Young Indian women are hornier than ever and they know how to seduced their men.You can watch but please do not tell because they have a reputations to upholds.As the weather heats up, it's natural to take a lot of your indoor activities outside.Much like lunch at home seems way more appealing as a picnic, sex can become even more exciting when it happens al fresco.When something's plunging in and out of your vagina underwater, some of that water will naturally find its way inside you, washing away your lubricating vaginal secretions, and potentially drying you out.
You can’t watch as they smile, and that smile spreads up into their eyes and transforms their face into one of the most beautiful things you’ve ever seen – a thing that warms your heart and makes you realize you want to spend more time with the person. Unfortunately, the reality is nowhere near that fantasy.

I am pursuing research in the field of model checking, which can be broadly defined as a logic-based approach to systems safety and analysis. My work is supervised by Professor Wojciech Penczek from the Institute of Computer Sciences, Polish Academy of Sciences.
My stay abroad took place at the Imperial College, London, where I had an exceptional chance to work under the guidance of Professor Alessio Lomuscio, one of the leading experts in multi-agent systems verification, and together with his PhD student, Andrew V. Jones. During my stay I was a member of the Verification of Autonomous Systems at Imperial College, a group of researchers initiated by Andrew and brought together by the common interest in the advance and application of formal methods. It's a very friendly and inspiring environment.I felt quite welcome at Imperial College and believe that the cooperation is going to be fruitful for all the participants in the near and more extended future.
Description: The purpose of this work is to combine a few ideas. First, a general approach to the linguistic summarization of large data sets by using linguistic data summaries using Zadeh’s protoforms as proposed in Kacprzyk and Zadrożny (Kacprzyk and Zadrożny, 2005). Second, taking advantage of Kacprzyk and Zadrożny (Kacprzyk and Zadrożny, 2010) works in which an operational equivalence was shown between the derivation of linguistic summaries and database querying against a flexible query with linguistic quantifiers. Third, the recent proposals of Zadrożny and Kacprzyk (Zadrożny and Kacprzyk, 2006),(Zadrożny and Kacprzyk, 2009) on how to use fuzzy logic and possibility theory to represent and implement so called bipolar queries that make it possible to express mandatory and optional query conditions. In the project new types of protoforms of linguistic data summaries will be sought, in particular along the lines of bipolar queries, and general equivalence between the queries with linguistic quantifiers and linguistic summaries.

In honour of Canada’s 150th birthday, The CJN presents 40 profiles of some of the most prominent Jewish Canadians throughout our history.
Given his contributions to pre-state Israel, both as a kibbutznik and a Machal volunteer, it’s not a stretch to say that Israel wouldn’t be the same today, if not for the late Benjamin Dunkelman.
The son of Polish immigrants, Dunkelman was born in Toronto in 1913, to Tip Top Tailors founders David and Rose Dunkelman. But it was Rose – an ardent Zionist who opened their estate to visiting leaders of the Zionist cause – who undoubtedly influenced her son’s commitment to Israel.
Dunkelman first became acquainted with life in Palestine, when he volunteered to work on a kibbutz in 1931, at age 18.
Although he returned to Toronto the following year to help with the family business, he returned again to pre-state Israel in the late 1930s, to help develop settlements.
When the Second World War broke out, Dunkelman didn’t hesitate to enlist. After being rejected by the Royal Canadian Navy because of his Jewish faith, he joined the Queen’s Own Rifles of Canada.
Among his many accomplishments that raised him through the ranks from private to major by the end of the war, Dunkelman was part of the second wave to land on Juno Beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944. Throughout his career, he earned a number of commendations, as well as a Distinguished Service Order for his service in the Hochwald campaign in Germany. Two months later, Hitler committed suicide and the war was effectively over.
Dunkelman was offered command of the Queen’s Own Rifles after the war, but opted instead to return home and immerse himself in the family business.
But it wasn’t long before Dunkelman jumped back into battle – this time, as a member of the Machal, a unit of foreign Jewish and non-Jewish volunteers who fought for Israel’s independence.
In addition to recruiting Canadians to join the Haganah, Dunkelman was instrumental in breaking the siege of Jerusalem, which was completely cut off from supplies and on the verge of starvation. His efforts helped establish a route that allowed much-needed supplies into the city.
Dunkelman also led the army division that captured the Galilee and the city of Nazareth. Gesher Ben, a bridge on the Lebanese border, was named in his honour.
These stories and more are detailed in Dunkelman’s 1976 memoir, Dual Allegiance, but there was one story that Dunkelman chose to omit, one that was brought to light after the book’s publication, by his ghostwriter, the late Peretz Kidron.
According to Kidron, Dunkelman chose to omit a story that detailed his role in saving the civilians of the Arab city of Nazareth from expulsion, following their surrender in July 1948.
“Haim Laskov (came) to me with astounding orders: Nazareth’s civilian population was to be evacuated! I was shocked and horrified. I told him I would do nothing of the sort – in view of our promises to safeguard the city’s people, such a move would be both superfluous and harmful. I reminded him that scarcely a day earlier, he and I, as representatives of the Israeli army, had signed the surrender document in which we solemnly pledged to do nothing to harm the city or its population,” he wrote.
Dunkelman’s wife Yael, also a volunteer in the army, whom he met and married during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, told the Toronto Star in 2015 that Dunkelman was “a loving person. He was a humanitarian – that was the essence of it.… The idea of forcing civilians from their homes was never something he would ever be able to do.”

The Arts and Crafts movement was an international movement in the decorative and fine arts that began in Britain and flourished in Europe and North America between about 1880 and 1920, emerging in Japan (the Mingei movement) in the 1920s. It stood for traditional craftsmanship using simple forms, and often used medieval, romantic, or folk styles of decoration.

With all the expenses that parents have to incur, we know that sometimes school supplies do not fit into their budget. The employees at Infomax Office Systems have an annual school supply drive to help the students at different schools in Iowa. Donations are received during the month of August, and Infomax contributes the various school supplies — including paper, folders, pencils, pens, pencil boxes, rulers, tape, erasers, highlighters and backpacks — to students who then benefit from always having the tools they need to succeed. Supplies were collected in both the Des Moines and Ottumwa offices, and this year were donated to George Washington Carver Elementary in Des Moines and Wilson Elementary in Ottumwa.
For the seventh consecutive year, Infomax Office Systems volunteered at the Meals from the Heartland Annual Hunger Fight. The event was held from Wednesday, August 27 through Saturday, August 30 at Hy-Vee Hall in downtown Des Moines.
This year’s event had 15,000 volunteers with a goal of five million meals packaged. This event is the largest volunteer meal packaging event of its type in the United States each year. The Infomax team volunteered 2 hours of their time and packaged 37 cartons of 36 meals enclosed in each carton for a total of 1,332 meals. The event packaged 4.3 million meals which are now boxed up and ready to send to hungry children and families in central Iowa and around the world.

Heroes can’t be perfect. Sure, they may have extra cool powers that make them super strong, invincible, telekinetic, heck some can even control time, but they all have their weak points. Whether it’s Kryptonite or mentioning your dead parents (sorry Batman), every hero has a weakness they struggle with and Tony Stark has several of them.
You can’t be that cool, smart and powerful without having a few hangups. Tony Stark is one of the only Avenger members who doesn’t naturally have powers, which is, of course, where the suit comes in. Captain America makes spiteful jokes about Stark’s lack of abilities from time to time, but not actually being made of iron armor isn’t his only weakness. Throughout the movies and comics, Stark struggles with many faults that really have nothing to do with actual superpowers, but with him as a person! Of course, Stark still has some weaknesses, but he has overcome a good amount of them.
NYTimes.com – A. O. Scott reviews “Iron Man,” based on the Marvel comic about a man who protects the world in an iron armor suit.
Yeah, the spiderman symbiote suit was very tight due to the latex honeycomb pattern that’s applied to the fabric. But the result is absolutely breathtaking.
The biggest challenge making your own Iron Man power suit – that you can actually wear! – is how much detail. Every expects it to look accurate in terms of colour and shaping, and if you’re going to get inside it latches, strapping and so on is a must but… what else? Do you motorise the faceplate? How much lighting and depth do you give the unibeam? What kind of flexibility and motion do the knees, knuckles and neck need? Well, hopefully you’ll agree I went all out on this Iron Man build.

Busy week this week with some offensive outbursts in the AHL. Three games played will do that for you but the top line of Marody, Benson and Hebig has been coming on strong. Brad Malone makes a strong push to be the next callup in light of the Jesse and Kailer demotions. Give yourself some…
This morning, the Edmonton Oilers announced via their Twitter account that Cooper Marody has been recalled from the Bakersfield Condors ahead of tonight’s game against Colorado.
Fans have been asking for it for quite some time and it’s finally happened. Both Jesse Puljujarvi and Kailer Yamamoto have been sent to the Bakersfield Condors of the AHL, according to the Oilers’ official Twitter account.
Bob McKenzie put out his Bobcast on Friday afternoon and one of the topics he discussed was the future of young forward Jesse Puljujarvi. I’ll paraphrase the stuff that was interesting and then dive into it.

According to TSN’s Darren Dreger, Milan Lucic will have a phone hearing with the NHL Department of Player Safety for the sequence that went down with Mathieu Joseph at the end of last night’s game in Tampa.
Some transactions this week making waves. Another great week for Hawkey in the NCAA. Big returns from injury with both Bear and Safin hitting the ice again. Bouchard back to the OHL – The big news for the Oilers this week is that Bouchard is back down to London with the powerhouse squad they have there….
The Leafs D is ass; Pacific division is Oilers to lose; worrying about James Neal in Calgary; hockey reporters have wasted a lot of time not learning about hockey; Elias Lindholm, Kadri, Puljujarvi and more in this week’s Nation Roundup brought to you by Dailyfaceoff.
According to the Oilers’ Twitter account, Ty Rattie is ready to get back into the lineup after missing the last seven games with a midsection muscle injury. As a result, Cooper Marody has been reassigned to the Bakersfield Condors where he will look to continue the excellent start to the season he’s been having in…
To say this years Edmonton Oil Kings have been streaky would be, well, completely accurate. After starting the year with five consecutive wins, they dropped eight straight contests and now they’re riding a four-game winning streak. If things keep going like this, it might drive Head Coach Brad Lauer to insanity.
According to Twitter, the Edmonton Oilers have assigned Evan Bouchard back to the London Knights of the Ontario Hockey League.
Way too much! He didn't do anything wrong. About right. At least it's not a suspension. Not enough. Should have been a suspension. Meh. I don't care.

The popular Kershaw Natrix is getting four new looks in the new 2018 Kershaw lineup: one smaller version, two new handle materials, and one XL version. The Natrix will now be available as a smaller Natrix Copper version, an all black standard version, a carbon fiber standard version, and an extra large G10 handled version.
First and foremost, the Kershaw Natrix is clearly based on and inspired by the award-winning ZT 0777. With Zero Tolerance and Kershaw under the same roof, they’re drawing off the very best of one another’s patterns for inspiration across brands. This benefits both brands tremendously and also allows for more affordable lines under the Kershaw umbrella. Having said that, Let’s take a closer look at all four new Natrix knives.
The Natrix Copper is slightly smaller than the standard Natrix and features copper handles. Kershaw tells us that “Since copper is denser than stainless steel, this smaller knife has some heft.” And because the handles are actually copper, they will patina over time.
This knife also features a 2.75″ D2 tool steel, drop point blade. This high-carbon tool steel is highly wear resistant, tough, and offers excellent edge retention. It is not, however, stainless and does take a bit of extra care. The Natrix Copper is a manual flipper knife, and does not feature the Kershaw SpeedSafe assisted opening mechanism.
Kershaw tells us that “Some people just like it dark. If you’re one of them, the black Natrix is for you.” This knife is built in the standard Natrix configuration with a 3.25″ blade and a 4.25″ handle. The drop point blade is 8Cr13MoV stainless steel with a black oxide coating and the handle scales are 3d-machined black G10.
Overall, the black Natrix is an excellent knife for EDC. It’s 7.5″ overall and features a reversible deep-carry, tip-up pocket clip. It’s a manual flipper that uses KAI’s patented KVT ball bearing system for quick,smooth opening.
Kershaw calls this version the “uptown” version of the Natrix, because it features blue-gray G10 handle scales with carbon fiber overlay on the standard configuration of the Natrix. This version also features a titanium carbo-nitride coating on the 8Cr13MoV drop point blade.
Kershaw says, “An oversized pivot provides an attention-grabbing detail on the front of the knife, while our patented Sub-Frame Lock secures the blade, provides a dramatic, contrasting line on the back, and lighten’s the overall weight of the knife. A decorative backspacer adds another embellishment.”
For the first time, Kershaw is offering an over-sized version of the Natrix in the Natrix XL. It’s 8.75″ open with a 3.75″ drop point blade. It still looks and feels like the Natrix, only bigger.
Kershaw points out that in this version, “The blade is 8Cr13MoV, expertly heat-treated by Kershaw to bring out its high-performance qualities. Black-oxide coating on the blade adds blade protection and looks great with the olive-drab green G10 handle scales.” If you’re into the Natrix and always wanted a bigger version, here’s your knife.
Kershaw must really be feeling its oats with the Kershaw Natrix. Why else would they put forward four new styles for the 2018 lineup. As you can imagine, these all come in at different price points. If you’re interested in getting one, simply click the links of buttons in the article above.

In past projects, I have used a table similar to Table 3.5. This format is homegrown, in that it is something I came up with. I call it an application flow map because it shows me how a user interface will function (or flow) end to end. This technique also nicely maps the user stories to the view (the "V" in MVC), which maps to the controller and, finally, to the model objects.
In comparing this application flow map to techniques such as class diagrams or CRC cards, you will find that this map complements CRC cards and class diagrams. CRC cards list, among other things, responsibilities of each class, which is lacking in the application flow map. Class diagrams on the other hand, show relationships, cardinality, behavior (methods), attributes, and possibly more, which are more details than I like to have in this map.
By putting together classes in a textual and table format, we could also search for class names (in a large system, for example) and also sort these easily using a spreadsheet program or command-line utilities.
This table can also be altered for use with non-UI stories such as the Reminder Email: Employee user story. For example, the view and controller class columns can be replaced with a single column named Job, for instance.
Furthermore, you can extend this table by splitting the Tables Impacted column into four separate CRUD (create, read, update, delete) columns. This not only shows which tables are impacted, but how they are impacted, by the various collaborator classes. By adding CRUD columns, you essentially provide end-to-end flow of a user story (from the view to the database and back) in one row of our table.

When you’re looking for quality in a Vancouver carpet cleaner, you need to do more than just look for the cheapest price on the Internet. Your carpet is one of your home’s most visible assets, and as such you want to hire a professional that will do the job right.
First off, there’s more than one way to clean a carpet. Some services use a wet steam cleaning method with a significant drying time. Others are considered “dry” treatments, in that you can walk on them as soon as the cleaning is done. Some use powerful chemicals to do the trick, while others use only environmentally friendly products and natural cleaning processes.
Don’t just hit “I feel lucky” on your Google search, it’s important to investigate a Vancouver carpet cleaner before you commit. Talk with people who have used them before, or check online review sites. See if they have a history of good service.
Everyone wants to save money, but when it comes to carpet cleaning, the cheapest price isn’t necessarily the best option. That low price might be coming at the cost of inexperience or cheap cleaning chemicals that you may not want in your home. They might also be using it as a way to get their foot in the door, and once inside will find new problems to upsell you on to get you to buy more expensive services.
The price you see online is usually just a base price. Extra services will cost more, and you should be aware beforehand what those might be. Ask about what’s included in the quoted price. Do they move furniture? Do stairs cost extra? Be sure to ask these kind of questions before you make a final decision.
It’s hard not to be a little self-conscious about bringing cleaners into your home, and some of that caution is understandable. Make sure you hire a company that screens its employees and does background checks. A good company takes responsibility for its employees and will make things right if something gets damaged during the cleaning process.
Angelo's Carpet Cleaners have professional equipment and over 25 years of experience keeping Vancouver homes clean and fresh. Call them for a free estimate and ask them about their other services at 604.421.1855
Not everyone is a textiles expert and it can be a lot of information to process to understand the differences between how to maintain silks and linens. This is where a professional cleaner, like Angelo’s Upholstery Cleaners in Vancouver, can make a delicate matter stress free so you can go back and enjoy the finer things in life.
The first thing to know when it comes to upholstery cleaning is that there is no one way to clean upholstery. Every piece of furniture is different in both construction and material, and therefore, each cleaning project will require a different assessment based on the particular fabric construction, fiber content and dye stability of your item. It’s important for the individual in charge of handling your upholstery to know how to determine what material is being dealt with as well as the unique circumstance of that damage that has been done to it.
Upholstery is a fabric material that will undoubtedly undergo staining and wear over the course of its lifespan. Regular maintenance for dining chairs, cushions or curtains can make your home looking fresh after a scheduled professional cleaning.
Antique items are another item that will likely require cleaning services when you first bring your new piece home. Vintage upholstered furniture can retain its luxury decades to come with the touch of a professional cleaning.
Trust professionals that understand what it takes to do the job. At Angelo’s Upholstery Cleaners in Vancouver, our technicians will test the fabric before beginning to determine the proper way to clean your upholstery and apply their years of experience in the cleaning industry to ensure your product comes out only one way: better than before it came to us.
Angelo’s FabriClean offers special cleaning treatments includingspots and stain removal, DuPoint Stain Guard, pet odor treatment, disinfecting treatment, steam cleaning, dry cleaning, and sanitizing and deordorizing.

Managing in today’s complex environment is more challenging than ever. With multi-functional teams, virtual work environments, and dotted-line reporting relationships, the once “neat-n-tidy” hierarchical flowcharts we learned about in Management 101 are being replaced with what looks more like a spider’s web—a matrix, if you will. And all of this makes the “simple” job of getting things done, well, not so simple.
The trend toward matrix management has created the need for a new leadership skill set, one that helps managers to flex and shift their focus away from a traditional “command and control” approach to a more fluid and flexible “influence and collaboration” strategy.
Introducing the Matrix Manager Inventory: Leading in a Collaborative Environment, the timely assessment and training program that’s designed to help both new and seasoned managers to acquire and develop the ability to flex between “command and control” and “influence and collaborate” management.
With the Matrix Manager Inventory, your managers will become well-equipped to navigate the dynamics of matrix management, handle constant change with confidence, influence performance when there is no direct control, and achieve the results that drive organizational success.
The Matrix Manager Inventory training package offers a mix of self-assessment, workbook activities, and classroom workshop. Its primary audience is mid-level managers and project managers who need to manage globally dispersed teams. The Matrix Manager Inventory is also beneficial to executives, individual contributors, and consultants who need to perform successfully in global organizational environments.
“To see Ollie & Estelle sublimely happy and laughing all day long, the sun shining, the family and friends all well-wishing, was just heaven on earth “ - Natalie
Ollie & Estelle live in Sydney, Australia and so all arrangements for the wedding were carried out by e-mail and a couple of visits over the past year. They were very clear in what they wanted for their wedding which is very helpful for us . Their brief – arrival drinks, a humanist outdoor ceremony on our lawn, Champagne, canapés, sit down meal in the marquee, cocktail bar , live music in the evening followed by a campfire, camping overnight … No problem.
Ollie & Estelle and friends decorated the marquee with flowers, ivy and amazing origami light shades which they made themselves. Music was to play a big part in the wedding as Ollie is a musician and lots of their friends are too, so a mass of instruments and PA equipment arrived in the marquee.
The weather had been a worry but I was sure it would be ok and Saturday dawned clear and bright. Groups of guests arrived clutching instruments and camping gear and we had a real happy festival feel about the place . When Dele Sosimi and the Afrobeat band arrived I knew we were in for something special! Dele loved the setting and after he had carried out the sound check he said "we are going to make this valley rock tonight"

Variety Pot crock pot or in the ornamental plant traders, suggests that the popularity of container plants is popularity. You interested? See this tips first! The centers ornamental plants, or crock pot row now looks increasingly varied. Various basic materials, sizes, colors and models available to choose from. Obviously suggests that the popularity of all container plants is popularity. You are also interested to use them in the garden? See first tips below.
The word 'pot'-derived from English and Dutch-clearly based on an object that functions as a container plant. Vessel here can mean two. The first, ornamental plants planted directly in the pot, the pot after the previously filled with the media before planting. The second, but a pot "tools display", where the pot is "wrapped up" the original container plants (which are usually ugly). This is especially if the pot is an item that expensive, or rare antiques.
The crock is a container-usually made of clay-wide chat. Although the given name gentong (high, small talk), also classified in the family crock. Crock originally functioned as a venue more water, but slowly also used as container plants. Just like pot, ornamental plants can be planted directly, or with the pot, to include in the crock. Crock generally more used to water the plants, but legally-valid only if used to plant ornamental plants that use the planting soil media.
Any type crock pot and is now offered from a variety of basic materials, clay, mortar, ceramic, porcelain, plastic, even wood. Or finally finishing touch of any varies. Left plain according to the colors of nature, ornament, ornaments are given a prominent (such as profiles), combination with mozaic porcelain, stone, gravel. colored, and glazing. Overall this has been done in order to appear crock pot and interesting according to the tastes of each consumer.
But before buying, you should first consider the basic nature of container and ornamental plants that will be placed there, especially if the vessel is planned to accommodate the media as well as planting trees. For example, from the crock pot or clay have any bearing nature, cause the water leak out quickly so that the planting medium dry quickly.
So for the crock pot and clay should be chosen plants that need less water as many mirten. Or select the location of the pot a bit shady. If the trick is that you choose, be sure to select the type of plants that like calm (for example type in semi - door).
If the vessel is used to water plants (crock-pot and clay pot and a high wide chat), in the crock pot and clay should first be coated with cement paste to cover the pore-pore walls.
For crock pot or from the mortar, but is also berporus slightly more impermeable than the tebuat of clay. On the pot plastic / fiber is water-resistant and air. The weakness of the crock pot or plastic is the excess evaporation of water splash of water is obstructed so that the media often become a land too wet. As a result, the root-root plants will rot.
If using a plastic pot, make sure that the holes in the bottom of a pot quite a lot. And 1 / 3 of the bottom of the pot should be given the charcoal, rock or pumice stone and enhanced with a buffer of brick or iron. Thus, the excess water in the pot will easily flow out. To this crock or plastic pail more precisely, traders are often used as a decorative plant container plant water. But the water plant will usually grow more perfect when planted directly in the clay vessel the size of the security.
From the crock pot and ceramic or porcelain are also air and water impermeable. Although both are made from natural materials, after burning through the process, pores will moor. Show luxurious, expensive and heavy, this type is often used as tools display.
Meanwhile, the pot timber more suitable for ornamental plants that use the media chopping fern plant, elephant ear, or orchids, because the timber holding sufficient moisture. Crock of wood (ravine), can also water plants for the container, provided the inside be layering first with asphalt so that water-resistant.
Buy a crock pot or requires wise. In addition to the basic material, the size of the pot should be able to anticipate the growth of plants. After much time, plant size and shape will change. That is higher and more broad. Can be, and container plants are suited to appear at the beginning of the planting will not be proportionally longer. Then the vessel is too narrow will hamper the growth of plant roots which in turn also reduce the plant display perfection.
Physical form of the plants also need to adjust the shape and height of the vessel. For example, canopy trees and a broad rounded will appear elegant when the pot not too high and convex shape. Whereas plants that boast of a vessel requires a bit too high in order to appear balanced. Similarly, for plants that are to dangle down.
Model crock pot or should not be ignored, especially when things are trying to use as decorative elements of the garden. Avoid selecting a model pot size too crowded when the garden is limited. Form / model is strictly linear, simple in appearance, it will be placed after the prominent in the garden.
In addition to tools display ornamental plants, crock pot, and now starting work as an aesthetic element in the garden. Although no plant is empty, but if the materials, shapes, and colors chosen vessel and placed with the tasteful, the vessel is thus will appear as an ornamental and functional point of interest garden captivating.
For example, a tiny garden that has been able to mesmerize the eye. Simply "a gentong, crock, pot, or high, slightly smaller crops in the legs, green grass carpet
Similarly, if some of terakota pot or a clay plain and simple, consisting of various shapes and filled with ornamental plants from the same species, are styled in an artistic group. The results certainly make you proud!

If you mean is an agent (ie corporate name) linked to a resource (ie finding aid) from the Staff side, then yes most definitely. All of our finding aids (almost 1000) have Creators or Personal/Corporate names that we created in AT and appear in our current online guides. But when we look at them in the Public ASpace view, none of them appear anywhere (but they are there in Staff).
Ok, but are the resources published? They names won't show up unless the resources are published. Are the resources showing up in the public interface at all? And if so, is the agent name appearing in the resource page?
Using the wrap-in tag feature in AT, we created italics fairly regularly for unittitles such as <title render=”italic”>Ed’s Book</title>. This markup was migrated exactly as you see it in my example. In other words, it doesn’t actually display in italics but we used the AT tools provided. It happens anywhere we used <emph> tags whether it was unittitle or scope notes or anywhere else. We did not get any EAD export errors.
Ah, ok, got it.. The problem is that this is not HTML, so the browser won't render it. The EAD markup has to be converted in the view to HTML. This is the same issue with the <extref>, which has to be converted to valid HTML tags. There is a couple of tickets for this already...
Agents do not display in the Public interface, meaning no Creators or Personal/Corporate names appear in the search results or as an option to browse; nothing displays when the “Names” category is selected. It says “No records,” but they’re there on the Staff side.
Hm... For the agents to display, they need to be associated to a published resource. Do you have an agent that is associated to a published resource? Can you see that agent in the published resource on the public side?
HTML markup does not display; instead it shows the mark-up itself (I believe this is a known ASpace bug and being addressed).
   Similarly though, if a <unittitle> begins with an <emph> tag, the title does not display at all and neither does any of its children. If for example, the name of a subseries started with an <emph> tag, none of the folders in that subseries display.
•         Lengthy text in Scope & Contents Notes (eg) do not show paragraph breaks, but instead display as one long paragraph. When viewed on the Staff side, it does format properly when viewed as Formatted Text (not Raw).
     Perform an Advanced Search and view first set of results; then advance to next page of results. This second set of results is not based on the original search but appears to be the results of searching everything!
Yikes. I just replicated that. Definitely a bug...hard to believe nobody has caught that one yet. Make a ticket for that here :
Short answer is yes. This is actually a Solr configuration that would need to be made to return highlight text in the search results.
However, there is a feature request to have this native  in the application here : https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/66505844
There is no Go to Next Folder (eg Component) feature; in other words when viewing any folder, it would be nice to simply click a button to see the next (or preceding) folder (or item).
Ok, so is this in the public interface only? So, if youre looking at a resource in a folder, you'd like a button just to take you to the next folder rather than having to go back to the top level view and select the next folder?
The University of Pittsburgh has successfully migrated its data from AT to ASpace, meaning we have worked out any transfer problems so 100% of our records migrate. Now we are carefully reviewing the data in the Public ASpace interface and have observed the following which we’d like comments on:
•         Agents do not display in the Public interface, meaning no Creators or Personal/Corporate names appear in the search results or as an option to browse; nothing displays when the “Names” category is selected. It says “No records,” but they’re there on the Staff side.
•         HTML markup does not display; instead it shows the mark-up itself (I believe this is a known ASpace bug and being addressed).
•         Similarly though, if a <unittitle> begins with an <emph> tag, the title does not display at all and neither does any of its children. If for example, the name of a subseries started with an <emph> tag, none of the folders in that subseries display.
•         Perform an Advanced Search and view first set of results; then advance to next page of results. This second set of results is not based on the original search but appears to be the results of searching everything!
•         There is no Go to Next Folder (eg Component) feature; in other words when viewing any folder, it would be nice to simply click a button to see the next (or preceding) folder (or item).
I would appreciate any feedback you can give me. We’re at the stage of determining what we need to address versus what is a bug or other issue that the ASpace developers need to address.

The Guerilla Filmmaking class held at the University of Memphis wrapped last weekend and was a success. Students spent two days of intensive education focusing on developing, producing and marketing their independent films. Students of the class included Thomas Pilgrim, Stephanie Langner, Ryan Hartley, Timothy Sparacello, James Blaisdell, Lionel Quinn and Glenn McDonald.
The Guerilla Filmmaking course will be offered again during the Spring 2010 semester. Stay tuned to this website, or the University of Memphis Continuing Education website for specific dates.
In other news, the Memphis Film Society monthly mixers will be kicking off again in October. Exact date and location will be announced next week. Much like the original mixers offered by MFS, the evening will open with a featured speaker (a local luminary of the film industry), followed by a couple hours of mixing. Come out and meet others in the local film community. These mixers are a great opportunity for producers/directors to meet potential future cast/crew members and vice versa.

Combine the brown sugar, oats, flours, and salt in a large bowl and toss to blend. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles crumbs. Refrigerate while preparing the filling.
Combine the cranberries, sugar, the apple juice in a large pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring often for about 2 minutes. Stir in the apples and cook until the cranberries are softened and their juices thicken slightly, about 4 minutes more. Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish and sprinkle the topping.
Bake until the filling bubbles thickly and the topping is brown, about 35-45 minutes. Let cool at least 10 minutes before serving.

“…Guys, I can’t make this up. This Isa life just gets better with time. Keep going the course. I did not do this overnight, I have simply made good choices day in and day out. By doing this I broke some bad habits and created some good lifelong ones! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I started using Isagenix in July of 2017. I was a little over a year post-partum from having a C-section with my second child. I did not feel comfortable in my own skin, I was tired all the time and despite doing CrossFit for the previous 3 1/2 years and trying fad diets I was not seeing any changes in my body or overall health. I saw a post of a mom just like me posted by a friend, and told him I wanted to be her after photo. That woman gave me the courage to jump. If she could do it, so could I! I’ve officially lost 85 lbs. but I met my weight goal long ago. I chose not to set another one as feeling good was the most important thing to me. I am simply living a healthy lifestyle and have been on maintenance for half a year now. I continue to live out my new healthy habits day in and out.” ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Way to go, Lydia Hunt! We love getting to celebrate your success alongside you! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Results you can’t get anywhere else. #isagenix

“Everything changed in 2012 during Thanksgiving. My wife, Kelly, and I had just found out we were pregnant and that she had ovarian cancer. I resigned from my day job and took a job managing a restaurant at night so I could drive her two hours each way for chemotherapy several times per week. I ate on the run or at the restaurant but self-medicated with alcohol, ballooning to a whopping 336 pounds. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ When my family’s health improved, I went back to regular day work and decided it was time to take my life back. I had always been a gym junkie and was very fit, but this time, I couldn't shed the weight. I felt sluggish, lost, and like I couldn’t take care of anyone, including myself. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Earlier this year, Kelly and I started using Isagenix. We were initially skeptical, but then we were hooked! We had the tools and newfound energy to SMASH OUR GOALS! I have released 140 pounds and added 20 pounds of lean mass while Kelly has released 45 pounds.* (We celebrated her six years in remission recently too!) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I am a new happy person who doesn’t sweat the small things anymore! I get on the floor to play with my 5-year-old son and race him around the block. I am truly loving my journey and how reliable, easy and convenient this nutrition is. I’m more energetic, focused, and sleep easier. I have changed my can’ts into CANS and my dreams into PLANS.” ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Results you can’t get anywhere else. #isagenix

Reply Anonymous Anal all the Girls arse pussy tight Sure it's dirty, but when you are in a long term relationship and you've done the routine things for many years, anal will be better than pussu good pusy. Why is it better? Its tighter, it's warmer, has more texture and if your wife is relaxed, you can go much deeper. I can go balls deep only 7"tgiht you have to have the right angle and you have to go slow with Gitls of lube.
I've tried water-based glycerin lubes and always go back to vaseline. It makes a bit of a mess, but it stays slick for hours. Never go to vag after doing anal because most of the time you will get some poop on you. I don't mind as I clean up after I'm done. I always make sure I pee after anal so nothing goes up and causes problems. Anal isn;t for everyone I've gone so deep in my wife's ass, that sometimes I can feel her poop and it makes me come even faster and harder because of the sensation.
I have anal every time after getting my wife to orgasm. She usually rolls to the side, pulls her panty off, offers me her backside and goes to sleep. I usually have hours of gentle but rock-hard anal. She's never bled because I go slow with lots of vaseline. But I've gone so deep that my pubes sometimes are inside her. On a couple occasions, she had diarrhea the next morning because I guess the come and vaseline may irritate her insides, and a couple times, her anus may have been a little sore from the hours of anal the night before.
She lets me have anal because she can sleep through it. Sometimes it's a real turn on, when I;ve gone a little too deep; and she gasps and winces, pulls away from me, but lets me continue after she has relaxed and fall back asleep. Most mornings, the lube lets her go 2 easier if she has to, but sometimes she becomes constipated from my thrusting. Her anus has not gotten any looser and we do this 3 times a week! I consider myself a lucky guy. The only thing that could be better is if she lets me do anal doggy style while she's totally awake with the lights on so I can see the whole thing.
She's never contact because I go content with lots of comedy. I have club every time after getting my family to punk. I always en sure I pee after natural so nothing politics up and causes problems.
Market giant, Yamaha, is known for making high quality electronic instruments like digital pianos. Its pianos cut across all price points and pianists of all skill levels. Needless to say, whatever your budget or level of skill on the piano, there’s a Yamaha digital piano for you.
On our review today, we are going to be taking a look at 10 of the best Yamaha digital pianos we could come across. We made sure to make the selection an assortment so that everyone can get a Yamaha for themselves.
So, from console pianos, to portable entry-level pianos, to intermediate pianos at a mid-range price point, there’s something for everyone on our review. Come take a look.
The Yamaha YDP 181 belongs to Yamaha’s Arius series which is Yamaha’s line of Console pianos. The Arius pianos are known for their characteristic feel and look. So, usually, they come in a large, elegant size with a cabinet that makes them look like an acoustic piano.
For people looking for a family piano, the Yamaha YDP 181 is a fantastic choice. Its beautiful cabinetry and strong resemblance to a grand will add that oomph you want to your living space. Anyone who sets their sights on this piece will immediately peg your family to be a musical one.
Now this piano is really large. It measures 53 inches in width, 20 inches in depth, and 35 inches in height. So, you’ll need to find a dedicated spot in your home for this. It’s also quite heavy too. So, you’ll need some help while setting this up when you receive it.
We love how this piano strikes us aesthetically. It comes with a dark wood finish, also embellished with gold. In fact, the 3-pedal unit that’s included is also laid in gold as well. So, as you can see, this does not disappoint aesthetically too.
Now, as with Yamaha Consoles, this does not come with a lot of built-in tones or voices, there are just 14 in all. So, if you’re looking for a lot of tones, then you’ll need something else besides the YDP-181.
Furthermore, the sound engine on this unit – the AWM Dynamic Stereo Sampling System – is super so it reproduces the grand piano tone excellently along with the other tones in this model.
The touch also feels great, even though it does not come with little hammers in the piano like most other Yamaha pianos.
This piano doesn’t come with little hammers like other Yamaha models. The difference is actually slight but some advanced players might notice it.
The DGX-660 is moderately priced and the upgrade to the DGX-650. It comes with a lot of improvements in nearly all aspects from the polyphony to the available effects and a few other aspects too.
In its truest nature, the DGX-660 is what you’d refer to as a hybrid keyboard. That is, it’s the offspring of the union between a digital keyboard and an arranger keyboard. So, being a hybrid, the DGX-660 naturally features loads of songs, tones, styles and rhythms.
If you can’t afford the YDP 181 or you need something with lots of tones and rhythms and styles, then the DGX-660 makes a great choice. It comes with 554 sounds in total! So, from playing, to learning, to making music, the DGX-660 is everything you need to enjoy playing on a keyboard at a reasonable price.
Also, it’s a full-fledged keyboard with 88 keys. But even though Yamaha has portable 88-key keyboards, this isn’t one of them. This weighs 46 pounds compared to most portable pianos that weigh barely 25 pounds. So, this isn’t something you want to move around willy-nilly.
The keys on the DGX-660 are not marvelous but all the same, they are good enough. While there are no simulated ivory/ebony keytops here, the black keytops are finished in matte, at least. So, they feel decent enough. Plus, they are also velocity sensitive as well.
In fact, much better than the YDP 181, this comes with one of Yamaha’s most advanced sound engines, the Pure CF. This sophisticated sound engine faithfully reproduces the high quality sound samples that Yamaha obtains from its CFIII Concert Grand Piano.
Of course, we won’t forget the intriguing Intelligent Acoustic control feature as well. This feature helps the piano automatically adjust sound frequencies so that sound is always clear and balanced.
Check out the Yamaha P255. It is the upgrade to the P155. It looks good, and performs excellently too. In fact, before playing this piano, you will already be more than satisfied by the looks of this model. The P255 looks fine!
There are two finishes to pick from. You can choose between the matte black and the ivory white finishes. Whichever you choose, both of them are sure to attract eyes.
However, the P255 is somewhat heavy at 38 pounds which means that it doesn’t exactly qualify as a portable instrument. In fact, it is only 8 pounds away from the DGX-660 which we just looked at. And about 12 to 13 pounds away from the average portable keyboard.
But then again, with all the technology and engineering in this keyboard, we’ve got to hand it to Yamaha. It literally performed a miracle making this weigh in at 38 pounds.
Now, besides the aesthetics of this keyboard, we also love the layout of this keyboard. It’s simplistic in its outlook and comes with only few buttons. This makes the piano a good choice for a beginner since they won’t be overwhelmed by so many controls at once.
As for the number of voices on this keyboard, they are about 24 in number which makes the keyboard good enough for most piano players. However, we admit that some advanced players might need more.
There’s also a variety of accompaniments to enjoy on this keyboard. And with the Sound Boost, your performance will always sound crystal clear.
Furthermore, the keyboard is also great with a Graded Hammer Standard action which makes the keyboard feel heavier on the bass ends than it is on the higher ends. Plus, this also comes with simulated ivory keytops, so the feel is great too.
The Yamaha YDP163R is the Rosewood colored console piano also in the Arius series just like the YDP 181 that we reviewed earlier. It’s not as sophisticated as the YDP 181 definitely but that doesn’t mean that this piano does not pack some awesome features.
It looks pleasing and attractive aesthetically just like all console pianos in the Yamaha Arius series. So, yes, it also comes with an exquisite cabinetry. This is another fantastic family piano option for those seeking one. It is not as expensive as the YDP 181 so it is a little more within reach for most people.
We love the feel of the keyboard. Of course, any keyboard with simulated ivory keytops always delights us because they feel great to the fingers. Plus, there are 3 sensors on the keyboard which makes the keyboard super sensitive. You’re going to love it!
Now, although this keyboard does come with features that would be useful to both beginners and pro players, this is our advice. A pro player will enjoy the features that this piano has to offer much better than a beginner would. So, if you’re a beginner, this is quite pricey, so we won’t advise you to go out of your way for this.
As for the keyboard here, we are quite impressed that Yamaha uses its most advanced action on this model. The Graded Hammer 3 (GH3) action is a much better action than the Graded Hammer Standard which is Yamaha’s most affordable action.
Now, the Graded Hammer 3 is actually quite hard and so some players might not love this, especially for the beginners. But many advanced players will find this great to play.
In the end, it’s a great sounding keyboard and you will find it delightful listening to this as you play.
The samples used on this piano are high quality. And the samples were obtained from Yamaha’s world class Yamaha CFIIIS 9 foot long Concert Grand Piano.
The number of built-in tones on this piano are quite limited which might not be enough to inspire the pianist.
Next on our review, we check out the Yamaha YPG-535. It is fairly heavy, weighing in at 37 pounds. It weighs about the same size as a 4-year old.
But then, it is quite compact so it will fit into any space at all no matter how small. Whether you live in an apartment or a dorm, you will be able to fit this piano anywhere and conveniently too.
We have to mention though that this keyboard is deep. So, it sorta adds bulk to this keyboard. In truth, there are less bulky keyboards out there. However, we can’t promise you that they will come with as many features as the YPG-535 comes with.
Now as for the controls, there are so many buttons on the control panel – about 40 of them in all. So, this might be a bit overwhelming for the beginner. It seems like each function comes with its own button. However, if you ever get lost, there’s the Grand Piano button to take everything back to default setting.
The keys are a bit unideal. They are semi-weighted rather than fully weighted. So, they come with Yamaha’s Graded Soft touch – Yamaha’s most affordable keyboard action. Instead of hammers in this keyboard, this keyboard comes with springs. So, they definitely won’t feel like an acoustic piano.
But they are velocity sensitive all the same. So, you can switch your style based on how hard or soft you play. Furthermore, the sensitivity comes in 3 levels which means that you can adjust the sensitivity of your keyboard to your tastes per time.
The sound engine Yamaha used on this piano is its AWM Stereo Sampling. It’s not the best Yamaha has to offer but it sounds good nonetheless. And it excellently reproduces all 500 sounds on this keyboard effectively.
The Yamaha P125 is a great keyboard with 88 keys all fully weighted. Weighted keys are important as you know because they give the closest feel to an acoustic as it gets. It’s not just excellent for experienced players, it’s also great for beginners to learn proper piano skills.
The sound? Super great! Yamaha as usual does fantastic in the sound department. Yamaha uses high quality sound samples as obtained from one of its most famous and most outstanding concert pianos – the Concert Grand.
Of course, we don’t expect the P125 to sound as majestic as its parent piano – the CFIIIS. But then again, it doesn’t sound badly at all. No, that’s not doing this keyboard justice. This keyboard sounds fantastic.
And then again, we are quite impressed that the sound engine on this model is one of Yamaha’s best, the Pure CF. So, if you were looking to get something that’s close to a grand, this is a good choice.
This isn’t a furniture piece like the other console pianos from the Arius series, two of which we have reviewed. So, if you were looking to get something that would beef up your home décor a bit, then this is not the one.
There is no cabinetry whatsoever. It does not even come with a stand. It’s just a simple, compact keyboard that will easily fit into any living space.
Talking about the keyboard, the action is fantastic with the Graded Hammer Standard action (GHS). So, it’s heavier on the low keys and lighter on the high keys. Of course, that’s exactly how an acoustic piano would feel.
The Yamaha P71 is identical to the Yamaha P45. In fact you could say that they are exactly the same thing. This is in the P series which is Yamaha’s line of portable keyboards. And unlike the Yamaha P255, this is actually quite portable at about 25 pounds and is quite affordable too.
In fact, if you’re a beginner looking for an entry-level instrument to begin your musical journey, you’ll be making a great choice going with the P71.
The keyboard comes with 88 keys and they are all full-sized and fully weighted. So, it’s not just good for beginners, it’s good for advanced players as well. Beginners can train their fingers and advanced players can enjoy the near-acoustic feel the P71’s keyboard gives.
Yamaha uses its Graded Hammer Standard (GHS) action on this keyboard. So, this offers enough resistance especially around the low notes as you find in acoustic pianos. Plus, the keys are also velocity sensitive, with the sensitivity coming in four settings. It makes for a really pleasurable playing experience.
This keyboard only comes with 10 built-in tones which we know are not enough. But then again, this is a sub-$500 keyboard. So, we can’t really complain. In fact, there aren’t even enough sound effects here to help dress up your sounds. To cut a long story short, there’s only reverb. Bummer!
But there’s still something more to love about the P71. As we told you, this is a keyboard for beginners, primarily. So, it’s a good thing that Yamaha kept the control panel super simple. It’s easy for a first timer to find their way around the instrument even without knowing so much.
And, of course, this also features USB connectivity. So, the user can easily hook their keyboard to a computer or a DAW.
With the dual mode, this keyboard facilitates learning by making it possible for tutor and student to play on the same instrument simultaneously.
Built-in tones and sound effects are barebones and that might be limiting as a player’s skills advance.
Like we said, the P45 and the P71 are the exact same piano. The only difference being that the P71 was made for a particular online store only – Amazon. And it is also more affordable there. Let’s check out its significant features anyway.
The Yamaha P45 comes as a successor to the P35 and both keyboards look exactly the same. But, of course, the P45 is a tad more advanced than the P35. There’s a reason it’s called the “successor”.
The P45 comes with 88 full-sized keys. And these keys also come with the Graded Hammer Standard (GHS) action.
We really love the flexibility and versatility of this keyboard. Thanks to its shape and size, it can virtually stay anywhere, taking up only a tiny footprint. Whether you want to fit this into your home or your studio, the P45 isn’t space hungry. So, it will work.
And for traveling musicians who like to move around a lot, this works too. It only weighs 25 pounds. So, it can come with you on your road trips, bus trips, basically any trip at all.
Now, to the keyboard, we already mentioned the action. But how do they feel? Well, for a keyboard that’s marketed as an entry-level piano, there isn’t much to complain about. The keys are even finished in matte. So, they would absorb moisture in those times when you have to practice for hours at a time.
Now, as for sound, this does decently. It doesn’t come with a truckload of sounds just like we saw on the P71. But its sound engine is quite good – the AWM Stereo Sampling technology. So, whatever few sounds are here will definitely be beautifully reproduced.
Here is a fantastic value purchase if all the keyboards we have reviewed so far are a bit out of reach for you. When we began, we mentioned that Yamaha carries all kinds of keyboards for all kinds of people. From the beginner to the intermediate to the pro player that can afford to splurge.
Here’s a keyboard option for the beginning musician who cannot afford to spend so much on their first keyboard.
This is a sub-$300 keyboard. And what’s more amazing is that at this highly competitive price point, you still get this keyboard in a bundle. So, you don’t just get a keyboard, you also get an adapter for power supply as well as a stand.
Now, this comes with only 76 keys, making it our first non-88-key keyboard on review. It’s a decent option for the beginner, although we cannot assure that this is the best way to gain fantastic piano skills. But then again, in the beginning stages of your piano journey, you might not miss the other 12 keys. So, it might just be what you need for now.
Now, as we said, this is targeted at the beginning pianist. So, yes, there’s a learning function here. It’s called the Yamaha Education Suite and it can help you build decent piano skills.
We are quite impressed that Yamaha added a USB connectivity option to this keyboard considering the price point. So this means that you can hook this keyboard to you computer and transfer both audio and MIDI files.
Lastly, the library on this keyboard is massive. There are over 500 built-in voices, with 165 styles as well. Although we cannot vouch for all the voices here, we can definitely tell you that a number of them sound great.
And as our review slowly winds to a close, the deals get better and better. Check out the Yamaha PSR E-363. It is super affordable and especially targeted at the beginner.
Now, this comes with only 61 keys and we’re going to be straight up with you, we are not impressed. 61 keys are quite few, if you ask us. And if you were hoping to begin practicing on this, we doubt you’d enjoy it much. Piano tutors also might not exactly be enthusiastic about taking you on with a 61-key keyboard.
But that said, the keys are touch sensitive. We guess this is Yamaha’s way of compromising a bit and giving a tiny feel of an acoustic piano. It definitely won’t feel like an acoustic piano. It won’t even come close but it’s decent enough, thanks to the touch sensitivity.
The keys are not weighted, though. And that’s bad news because it means that it won’t offer any form of resistance at all.
For one, there’s a lesson function on this model. So, it means that the beginner can learn to play the piano right out of the box even if they’ve never seen a piano before. In a couple of weeks, you should have picked up some decent piano skills.
And then there are preset songs here also which will also give the player ample samples to practice with.
Again, this also comes with USB connectivity. So, you can hook this up with your computer using your USB cable and transfer all your files when you need to.
And finally, as we draw the curtain to a close, we review the Yamaha PSREW300AD. Yeah, we just reviewed something very similar two products back. In fact, the keyboards in both reviews are the same. However, this is a separate package.
In the PSR EW300 SA, the package is practically all encompassing. Purchasing that gets you the PSR EW300 keyboard, plus a stand and the power adapter.
There’s little to say about this keyboard, especially if you’ve already read the review on its sibling. It remains the same 76 key keyboard, of course more affordable this time, since it only includes the power adapter.
It comes with a lesson function as well. And with this education suite, you can practice one hand at a time, or you could practice each hand separately. In fact, the lesson mode also features a Touch Tutor which can also help to teach the player dynamics as well.
As for the sound, it’s good enough, thanks to Yamaha’s AWM Stereo Sampling technology. And like you saw in the PSR EW300 SA, there are over 500 built-in tones here which makes this keyboard quite delightful.
You can also hook this up with your computer or any music making software thanks to its USB connectivity. So, yeah, nothing changed between number 8 and number 10. This still remains a decent, competitively priced keyboard with great features.
We decided to go with the Yamaha DGX-660 as our winner for today. Yeah, we know that the YDP 181 is glamorous and all but when it comes to the practicality of things, the DGX-660 clearly trumps the YDP 181 and well too.
Come on, we are talking about a hybrid between a synth and a digital piano. There’s literally nothing you can’t do with this keyboard. It’s the perfect compromise between the two ultimate reasons to get a keyboard – making music (a synth) or playing music (a piano).
But do you really want to give up on the massive library of top shelf sounds, styles and rhythms on this keyboard? And let’s not forget the excellent feel of the keys plus its Sound Boost feature which just makes the sound off the charts.

Swiss residents will soon vote on an initiative that would guarantee a basic monthly income of 2,500 Swiss franks ($2,800) for all working adults in the country to combat income inequality across the nation. The initiative collected the 100,000 signatures needed for a referendum on the proposal, and to mark this historic initiative, a truck in the city of Bern unloaded 8 million five-cent coins, on Friday to represent Switzerland&apos;s 8 million citizens. The parliamentary vote has not yet been scheduled, but it could take place before the end of the year.
A basic income has long been a liberal pipe dream, but few countries have implemented pilot projects to test how it might work. In America, Democrats have long hoped for a minimum income, but it would be years before such a measure could be subject of a serious discussion. If the referendum passes in Switzerland and proves successful, it could spur Democrats to push for a similar policy in America.
So, how does a 2,500-franc monthly income in Switzerland compare to incomes in the United States? Let&apos;s take a look:
Median incomes in every state across the U.S. are much greater than the amount proposed in Switzerland. A person earning 2,500 francs per month would earn 33,600 francs per year, which is significantly less than the 2012 U.S. median household income of $51,413, but much greater than the 2012 poverty line of $11,170.
However, these are all median incomes, not minimum wages. The initiative in Switzerland proposes to give all working adults a basic income, not a basic median income. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average adult worker in Switzerland works 136 hours per month. An average Swiss worker would take home a minimum wage equivalent to $20.59 per hour ($2,800/136) if the referendum passes. Here&apos;s how that compares to minimum wage laws in the United States:
The effective minimum wage Switzerland&apos;s proposal would entail is twice the minimum wage of any state in the U.S. The national minimum wage is $7.25 per hour while California this year passed the first minimum wage bill in the United States at $10 per hour. In other words, Switzerland&apos;s initiative is much better than anything currently existing in the United States, and unfortunately, no such improvements are happening soon within the U.S.
According to the journal Climatic Change, 140 organizations funnelled $558 million to climate denial organizations between 2003 and 2010. Of those 140 organizations include market giants like ExxonMobil and Koch Industries.
Yet, the evidence of climate change is undeniable. It confronts us every time we see words like "super typhoon" and "tsunami" in the news, words that were rarely used before the last decade. Climate change haunts us everytime we find closed metro stations and collapased buildings due to a super storm in one the world&apos;s most populated cities. More than half of all global species are potentially at risk of extinction, global food supplies are threatened by extreme weather events, and water is predicted to be the scarce resource that will incite future wars.
On Nov. 8, Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Phillippines, claiming more than 6,000 lives and injuring a further 27,000. Nearly 4 million Filipinos were rendered homeless from the storm&apos;s impact.
Haiyan is widely recognized as one of the worst storms to hit the planet in recent history. While relief agencies struggle to understand its full damage, typhoon survivors have maintained their hope and vigor, including the mayor of Guiuan, a municipality in the Phillipines, who saved countless lives by evacuating his entire community hours after the storm.
On Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2013, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck southwest Pakistan, followed by another 6.8 shake on Saturday. The earthquakes claimed more than 800 lives. Recuperation continues in this seismically active region of the Indian subcontinent.
While the earthquakes have not been directly attributed to climate change, the creation of a brand new "island" off the coast of Pakistani province following the quakes has baffled the scientific community.
On May 20, a giant tornado with 200 mph winds took a 12-mile path through the Oklahoma City area, uprooting homes and impacting two elementary schools. Twenty four people were killed, and more than 100 others were injured. The week prior, as many as 10 tornadoes hit North Texas, killing six.
Crosses now stand in memory of the children killed in the disaster and rebuilding efforts continue in Oklahoma City.
Nearly 1 million people were evacuated before destructive Cyclone Phailin hit India in October 2013.
The cyclone, packing winds of 155 mph with gusts of up to 190 mph, hit the Bay of Bengal. The evacuation came as an attempt to avoid mass casualities similar to a 1999 cyclone in the same area. Whereas Cyclone Odisha claimed 10,000 lives in 1999, Phailin&apos;s destructions took 27.
Despite evacuation and relief efforts, the aftermath of the Cyclone had thousands marooned by rising flood waters caused by incessant rain in the aftermath of the Cyclone.state, Orissa.
In June 2013, a new study revealed that African droughts between the 1970s and 1990s was caused by pollution from the U.S. and Europe. This drought, the biggest to ever hit the planet, caused severe famines and killed hundreds of thousands of people during this period.
There were no comments on the terrible situation from major political leaders in the West, despite the fact that parts of Southern Africa including Namibia and South Africa continue to suffer from an on-going drought. One million people out of Namibia&apos;s 2.3 million population are threatened by moderate to serious malnutrition.
The Namibian government has estimated the harvest for 2013 will yield 42% less than that of 2012, and the numbers continue to decline.
In Mexico, Hurricane Ingrid, a Category 1 storm, converged with Hurricane Manuel, also a Category 1 storm, within hours to claim more than 169 lives in Mexico. Damage was estimated to cost more than $4.2 billion.
Tens of thousands of people were trapped in the aftermath of the dual storms, with over a million inhabitants affected in some way. Ensuing floods destroyed thousands of homes and shut down an airport, stranding tourists. Frantic looting and corruption followed the storms, adding to the misery of the aftermath and turning famous tourist spots such as Acapulco into a hideout for violent drug gangs.

Menasha facilities in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been recognized for the third straight year by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) Global Standards, a leading global product safety and quality certification program.
Menasha’s Neenah and Hartford, Wis. plants and its Yukon Plant, located in Ruffs Dale, Penn., all achieved “A” grade certifications for the BRC Global Standard for Packaging and Packaging Materials. The company’s Midwest Fulfillment Center, also located in Neenah, was awarded a BRC Global Standard Certificate for Storage and Distribution.
“The BRC Global Standards require we show continuous improvement in our programs and processes that support product safety and quality,” said Tim Lafond, Quality Manager for Menasha. “Very few U.S. paper packaging suppliers are certified to this prestigious standard, and Menasha is proud to have multiple facilities among this elite group.”

Its Packaging and Packaging Materials standard is also a Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) recognized scheme.

Dedicated to the new aesthetics, the International Place of the Emergent Forms distinguishes itself by an artistic transdisciplinarism and international programming.

CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - No one may see more clearly the impact of the opioid crisis in Northeast Ohio than one local funeral director. Mark Busch, co-owner, vice president and funeral director at Busch Funeral, said he witnesses the grief and "emotional devastation" overdose deaths cause families and the community daily.
"I've been a licensed funeral director for now over 35 years and in the past three years I've seen some of the most horrific family dynamics over the course of my career directly as a result of heroin epidemic," he said. "Those of us in funeral services are really seeing the end result of this tragic crisis that really has no boundaries."
Busch said the number of calls the funeral home gets about overdose deaths has been increasing in recent years, especially in the last year.
Busch went on to say that our community needs to join together to fight this crisis, he shared with us this website greaterthanheroin.com where different organizations come together with tools to fight heroin.

This week the Zambian government banned lion and leopard hunting across the board, citing that populations have abruptly declined in recent years.
Botswana has decreed a country-wide ban on sport hunting to begin on January 1, 2014. Botswanan President Ian Khama noted, “The shooting of wild game for sport and trophies is no longer compatible with our commitment to preserve local fauna.”
Kenya banned trophy hunting and dealing in wildlife in 1977. Trophy hunting was properly cited at the time by the new Kenyan government as “a barbaric relic of colonialism.”
Lions have disappeared from over 80% of their historic range, and their population declined by nearly 50% from just 1980 to 2002. The threats facing African lions today are numerous and reinforcing: habitat destruction and fragmentation, loss of traditional prey species, disease, and inevitable conflict with humans—to wit: unsustainable trophy hunting and commercial trade in lion parts.
The United States is by far the world’s largest importer of both commercially traded African lion parts and lion trophies. Over half of all the lions killed each year are shot by American trophy hunters.
As a grotesque example of the lack of empathy for wildlife of those who kill animals for sport, the majority of hunted lions in South Africa are bred like cattle in electrified wire pens, then released to be shot by rich European and Americans. Currently captive raised animals can be shot legally in some provinces just FOUR DAYS after being released from captivity. When animals are stalked in a confined area it is known as “canned hunting.”
With lion populations endangered throughout a significant portion of their range they meet the criteria of an Endangered listing under the Endangered Species Act. The United States government and Americans should heed the alarms sounded by African countries to protect their wildlife and move away from killing for sport.
Sign this petition to list the African lion as Endangered under the ESA. An endangered listing will prohibit the importation of lion trophies into the US and and remove one of the biggest incentives for participating in this blood sport which is contributing to the continuing decline of the species.
Needless killing of endangered species for trophies is inherently unsustainable, economically short-sighted, ecologically unsound, and morally wrong.
Done! I just signed the petition. I will never, for as long as I live, understand the need to kill these beautiful animals. Barbarians!!!

Today I spontaneously went and watched the brand new Star Trek movie featuring the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch. I can’t even remember the last time I watched a Star Trek movie but I know it was part of my childhood and I enjoyed the Enterprise Crew’s adventures. I haven’t watched many SciFi movies in the last years, but I am in a mood for action and superhero movies recently, so this fitted in perfectly.
I loved the movie! There was a lot of shooting, fighting and blowing up, possibly a bit too much, but that was expected. As usual, the Enterprise nearly crashes on some planet or is otherwise destroyed and I know that in most movies, there is a good ending. I was still on the edge of my seat and anticipating what would happen next.
There were also quite a bit of hilarious moments where you just had to burst out laughing – many of them involved Mr. Spock. It took me back a few years – because I remember it was like that in the previous movies as well.
The story is interesting, though I cannot say whether it is original or not. I certainly enjoyed it and couldn’t foresee some of the twists. (But I usually never can because I’m not trying. Where’s the fun in knowing everything?) The actors were good, especially Benedict Cumberbatch and the guy who played Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto, apparently). I am not too fond of the Kirk actor, but I cannot put my finger on it. Maybe he’s just not THE Captain Kirk but an younger, more reckless version.
In any case, I am very glad I got to see that movie and I feel like I want to re-watch some of the older movies now for good times sake. I just finished watching the Batman Series and might be tackling Superman or Captain America next, might as well throw in a bit SciFi along the way.
If you’re not a fan of SciFi and can’t relate to the whole starship theme, this is not the movie for you. But in any other case, especially if you’re a fan of Cumberbatch, go and see it!

Healthy pregnancies and healthy newborn children, combined with a measure of economic security, are an aspiration for all working mothers. Maternity protection at work supports this aspiration. Its goals are twofold: 1) to ensure that a woman’s economic activities do not pose risks to the health of the woman and her child, and 2) to ensure that women’s reproductive roles do not compromise the economic security of their households. Maternity protection at work encompasses a host of different components ranging from maternity leave, health protection and non-discrimination to social protection and breastfeeding.
Principles and rights related to maternity protection at work have been embedded in three Conventions on maternity protection of the International Labour Organization (ILO). These rights are also firmly established in a host of international treaties relating to human rights, women’s rights, rights to health, and the rights of the child. Almost every nation echoes these commitments in its national legislation.
Nevertheless, while maternity protection is widely regarded as part of the core values of our societies, many women, both in the formal and informal economies, continue to face maternity-related threats to their health and economic security. Many women lack access to a period of paid leave before and after childbirth, and many others continue to face dismissal and discrimination at work because they are or may become pregnant. Working conditions, and biological, physical, and chemical agents associated with productive work can potentially pose risks to reproduction in the absence of information, monitoring and evaluation. The ability of new mothers to breastfeed their child according to international health recommendations may be interrupted by productive work when breastfeeding support is lacking. Bringing up children without jeopardizing parents’ access to, participation in and advancement in economic activity, remains a challenge when quality and affordable childcare arrangements are not widely available.
While the situation of women working in formal, standard jobs is uneven, for great numbers of women working in atypical, non-standard and precarious jobs and the informal economy, maternity protection remains well beyond reach. The absence of any form of social protection deprives these women of appropriate maternal and infant health care, thus forcing some of them into catastrophic health expenditures and poverty. Clearly, more action is needed to bridge the distance between international aspirations for maternity protection, as reflected in the Millennium Development Goals and the Decent Work Agenda, and the realities. The world of work is a promising entry point for scaling up interventions aimed at improving maternal and infant health, addressing income and social insecurity and poverty.
bring together information and tools, expertise and knowledge concerning each and every component comprising maternity protection at work into one place;
serve as a resource and a guide for actors ready to launch information and education campaigns and to plan, design or monitor action that will bring about real improvements in maternity protection at work.
The Package can be used by governments, trade unions, employers’ organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), researchers and practitioners, United Nations (UN) officials and others. The information is intended to be accessible to a non-technical audience, with resources for further technical information noted at the end of each module. Numerous examples of actions in improving maternity protection at work in all types of economic activities around the world are highlighted throughout the Package, for guidance and inspiration. The message of the Package is that the aspiration of maternity protection at work for all is both desirable and possible. Even in the most challenging situations, commitment and the will to act can bring about results and benefits, contributing to equitable economic growth, social cohesion and Decent Work for all women and men.
French Catholic bishops have decided to establish an independent review into sex abuse in the church. They will also receive victims in south-western pilgrimage city of Lourdes on Saturday and promised "zro tolerance" for paedophilia from now on.
A panel will be asked "to understand the reasons which led to the way these affairs were handled" and make recommendations as to how to handle the question, the Bishops' Conference of France (CEF) said Wednesday.
Members will probably include historians, magistrates, specialists on children, church sociologists and a canon-law expert, CEF spokesman said on Thursday.
The statement said the commission's work would include "collecting accounts of victims in order to better understand the reasons that led to these acts" and help prevention efforts.
The most senior French Catholic cleric to be caught up in the abuse scandal is Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, who is to go on trial in January for allegedly covering up for a priest accused of abusing boy scouts in the Lyon area in the 1980s.
The Senate rejected the idea last month but ordered an "information mission" on abuse on "all places that deal with minors".

I'd thought birds molted their feathers more in the spring, but that's not true for most species. The spring is when they need their energy for breeding, nesting, and raising babies. It would make more sense to conserve the extra energy involved in molting till the late summer and fall, when those hard chores are done.
Which is probably why I've had a good feather week: red-tailed hawk (found by Jose), long-eared owl, magpie wing and tail feathers, ring-necked pheasant (! - I thought it was a snake at first and I jumped away from it), kestrel tail and wing feathers (wing feather found by Quickie), nighthawk (found by Steph). Treasures!
Karen S and Gil hauled over to ride the other day with me and Jose, and she clued me in on the mostly late summer-fall molting. And as is the karmic bird wont of Bird Biologist Karen when she comes here, we saw a pair of eagles. I don't think we've ever NOT seen eagles when she comes.
I also gave the dogs the slip the other day and hiked up the creek to visit the long-eared owl roost. Without all the general chaos of 4 heavily panting mouths and 16 feet crashing through brush - just me creeping slowly and quietly along - I spotted one of the owls hiding deep in a shady, cool cottonwood. There were probably more (I've flushed at least 4 before), but I just sat and watched this one for a while, and he watched me, not looking too concerned.
Then I said thanks to my lucky owl stars and slipped away, leaving him in peace, picking up a little long-eared owl feather on the way out.
I had a friend once who, when I enthusiastically said I was going to do my first 50-mile endurance ride, said, quite derogatorily, "WHY?"
Rather taken aback at first (I mean - who WOULDN'T like to ride for 50 miles?!), I replied, "Well, you know how you like to go on a little trail ride, well, I can go on a little trail ride - for 50 miles! It's fun!" But she was never convinced. Personally, I think her kind of riding is boring (or maybe she's boring?). I think cross-country riders are insane. I think dressage is dreadfully tedious (and of course I'm dreadful at it). I think endurance riders are quite normal (especially those who ride with broken bones, too soon after surgery, when they can't even walk, etc). Of course those are just my opinions, and of course they are right.
Sometimes you wonder exactly what your horses think of this sport we've picked for them. (Well, sometimes we actually do have a good idea what they think of it...)
STORMY (Thoroughbred, retired racehorse - 3 wins and 4 seconds and $45,000, pack horse string leader, Dude Ranch Wrangler horse, Big Eater): 50 miles - are you guys crazy? I can run 6 furlongs in 1:09 and change but 50 miles? No way. I'd die after 5 miles. Although now that I'm not quite in my slim fit racehorse shape I'd die after 2 miles. Because I'd get so wigged out at all the horses I'd have to race past and beat. You guys are nuts.
PHINNEAS (1 LD, 3 50's): I don't know, I kind of like it, because I look gorgeous for 50 miles! (Or 60 miles if my rider misses the ribbons).
QUICKIE (11 seasons, 2150 miles, 45 for 47, 1 baby - Dudley): Been there done that. I don't want to have any more babies, dudley broke the mold. I don't want to do any more endurance rides, I just want to stay home and hang out with Rhett and Jose and eat.
DUDLEY (one 50): I was Fat, and everything was fine. Then I lost weight and I did a 50 and my feet hurt afterwards. I'm going to be a dressage horse and win a Gold Medal in the Olympics. Or maybe be a Performance Artist or Comedian or a Great Houdini Escape Artist. I can already do many funny things and I can escape from anywhere.
RHETT (11 seasons, 3365 miles, 4 wins, 4 BCs, 9 100's, 62 for 68): Like it? I guess so, because it's easy and I'll beat all of you.
DIEGO: Endurance? Work? I just want to look cute and get kisses and I sure don't have to wear a saddle to do that.
What can I say? You get told that you're sooo Handsome all day every day, you don't know any other way. Mom says I make Owyhee County look good, and it looks pretty dang nice already. But I don't let it go to my head or anything, it's just what I am. The other horses were all jealous at first, but they are finally getting used to my gorgeousness.
Now while I am one especially good looking Thoroughbred ex-racehorse from the side, I do have to admit that my Mom avoids looking at me from the front and the back. My belly kind of bulges out and it kind of swings back and forth, bloop, bloop, as I waddle around. Someone around here mistakenly said that I was so fat I looked like I was a pregnant broodmare. But I am not FAT. Fat is what Dudley was last winter, so I heard. I was quite paunchy (okay, like a pregnant broodmare) a few summers ago, check out this picture! Mom was pretty appalled then, but I was pretty proud because I worked hard to get that way. You just never know when the world will run out of grass or hay, right? So it pays to stock up. Besides, a 17-year-old is entitled to a little spare tractor tire, right? And it just makes me more horse to love.
But it's just my belly that sags outwards a wee bit, (and only when you look at me head or butt-on)(see me now in my fly mask) and I've been working out daily to start toning it up. As you heard before, I am now busy with many jobs: the Oreana Bookmobile, the local Postman, the Building Inspector. I'm also the Trails Assessor and the Dog Walker. It's my important job to make sure the trails are all still in place around here. And sure, Mom takes all the dogs out for a walk in the evenings, but I take Spigot out for a special extra walk during the day. (Psst - I also still work hard at Eating Hay when I can get to it - but don't tell anybody about that job.) So not only am I a Good Lookin horse, I am a hard working Good Lookin horse.
In my life since I was a racehorse and my mom was my groom, I've heard it all: Drop Dead Gorgeous, Freaking Handsome, Stormy Stud Muffin, The Most Beautiful Horse on the Planet... and I accept it graciously. You be the judge. Am I all of those things or what?
One gooood-lookin' Handyman has moved into the neighborhood. Actually he's been living here since March, but he just started picking up some odd jobs along Bates Creek.
He wears many hats: he is, so far, the Oreana Bookmobile, the Building Inspector, and the Local Mailman.
Need "Winterdance - The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod", one of my Top Ten Books Ever, delivered to a neighbor? Stormy is the Oreana Bookmobile.
Need to check up on the progress of the buildings on Connie's new property? Stormy is the Building Inspector.
Need to drop off a letter at a neighbor's so they can take it to the post office on their way into town? Stormy is the Local Macro Mailman.
And you know how, when the UPS man drives up into your driveway and the dogs run out to bark at and/or greet him, and the UPS man gives them all treats (so they don't bite him)? Well, Stormy expects YOU to run out and greet HIM with treats, not because he'll bite, but because he just did you a delivery favor and because he's just soooooo good lookin'.
He's pretty pleased with himself and his important new jobs. Especially when there's a bucket of carrots waiting for him when he gets home and gets off work.
I love riding in our Owyhee back yard, which stretches all the way to Nevada and, heck, probably to Mexico and Canada if you know where all the fence gates are, but it's great to cover new trails too.
This was still in our back yard - just 18 miles down the road by diesel truck and trailer, (10.57 miles as the Raven flies) to the top of Bachman Grade. We could have ridden there, and Steph's rides have gone there before; but Rick's horse Surri is still young (four) and isn't in condition to do long or hard rides yet, and it's good experience getting the horse used to loading up to go ride, and riding over new territory - and we all wanted a change of scenery.
We left in the morning so it would be cooler - and we'd be higher, 5900' instead of 3200', in a juniper forest in the lower hills of the Silver City range of the Owyhee Mountains.
We followed an old road to the south, up and up with a view over the Jordan Valley and more layers of Owyhee Mountains to the west, and the Oreana valley to the east. Much of the ground was littered with small natural obsidian (no flakes, no worked pieces), and we threaded through some big rocky outcroppings. Jose loved the very tasty lupines, and he really does like to stop and look at the scenery. (Or... is he looking over his shoulder for cougars?)
The horses got some hill climbing in, and we all had a nice hour and a half ride - a picturesque alternative to the high desert.
This heat wave on the Eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains was thankfully replaced with days of dark clouds, thunderstorms, scattered showers, and heavy foggy mist - and, the temperature dropped 20 degrees (hooray!!).
Bobbi Richine and I postponed riding on Thursday for the weather, and Friday at noon we decided to give it a go.
I'd visited her and ridden with her a few years ago at her place near Larkspur, but she'd since moved to another fabulous place in the mountains outside Woodland Park. She's nestled on 34 acres up against thousands of acres of Forest Service land, pine- and fir-forested Rocky Mountains, at 8400 feet. I asked her how she ever discovered this place: "I looked all over the United States before I found it!" It was a big fixer upper, but now it's fixed up, and a little slice of heaven.
Bobbi used to own Rocky Mountain Training Center, and had dozens of endurance horses coming and going for sale at any one time. She also had a bed and breakfast. She's done with all that, (for now, anyway...), and while she still sells a few horses here and there, she has about 5 right now.
Three horses were waiting to be saddled as I drove up; 14-year-old Sophie was riding with us. Bobbi had recruited her from the dressage and jumping world to endurance. Sophie had competed a bit in the ring, but it wasn't really her cup o' tea... "Everything had to be perfect. You had to do this perfectly, you had to sit this way perfectly, you had to wear this, you had to do that." Which is precisely one reason why I wouldn't even be allowed in a show ring. The other reason is, I'd have to ride with my Raven, and I expect I'd get a few points deducted for that. Not that I'd have any ring skills in the first place.
Anyway, Sophie just started endurance riding with Bobbi less than a year ago, and she loves it. She sure looked at home on the forest trails. And superb trails they were - soft two track, or single-track trails, winding around through the forest, very few rocks underfoot, with some great hill training. My mount (and the Raven's - residing in the saddle bag) Catnap was really huffing and puffing up the hills and sweating. It was a cool day though still and muggy - with dark clouds all about, and you know what muggy and still can mean in the mountains on a summer afternoon.
I was quite happy to be going out for a ride with someone who said she had no desire to ride in a lightning storm, either. These were two riders I knew wouldn't lie to me when I asked, "Was that thunder?" (Since I can't hear it until it's much too close.) Bobbi decided that, since the clouds did look ominous all around, we'd do the shorter 7 mile loop and see how the weather held.
We trotted along the trails, gaily zipping through the cool and quiet forest for a couple of miles, when we came to a fork in the trail, and Bobbi said... "Uh oh."
I could tell by the tone in her voice that the Uh Oh had nothing to do with horses or trails or wild animals. "What!" I asked. "Thunder?"
"Yes!" OK, so we took the trail that led toward home, and even then I could hear a rumble of thunder, which meant that it was pretty close. I wasn't nervous yet, until Bobbi said, "We can go up onto this ridge where we'll have a view of Pikes Peak." A view - great - on a ridge in a thunderstorm... uh oh...
Thankfully the thunder, which I could clearly hear now, appeared to be over the ridge to our right (nevermind the fact that lightning can strike 9 miles away from the cloud), and I wasn't seeing any flashes, though the clouds dead ahead, as we climbed, were DARK. And we still had a ways to climb...
We hit a warp trot, and, suddenly, there's a log over the trail - log! Wait! I recalled something about "Catnap likes to jump" being said before I got on, which made me think I'd just go around any logs, since I don't jump, and suddenly, here comes a log, but wait! I don't know how to jump, but then it was over before I could say anything (and I should mention, this was about a foot high, though Catnap leaped though it was 3 feet high), and we landed galloping after the other two, wheeeee! and for the next 50 yards I forgot about being afraid of lightning.
We finally reached the top of the ridge, where we got off to lead the horses down. (Down, yay! ... though lightning doesn't always strike the highest points, it's still a mental relief to lose altitude). We still hadn't seen lightning, and in fact, the thunder had died off too. We stopped for a few pictures in a little meadow with Pikes Peak in the background, then we mounted up, just when raindrops started to fall. Bobbi and Sophie put on raincoats, then we continued zipping along the trails, with go-go little Catnap in front - with "two more jumps coming!" Bobbi yelled behind me.
AHHH! OK the first one was 10 inches high, which Catnap trotted over, and the next one was a big whole 16 inch jump, which we were flying at and we leaped over - really, I have no idea how to sit these things, so I just didn't worry about it - and we landed and kept cruising right along.
And quickly, we were back at the home gate, with the rain already coming to a stop. Almost a shame to be done already, but, we'd lucked out with the storm, and it was probably for the best, since it was still heavily overcast.
Catnap and I closed the gate, and our horses walked the last bit of downhill. Just as the road flattened out, there was a big rumble of thunder ("OK, I heard THAT!") which ended with a loud CRACK. "I saw two lightning bolts," offered Sophie, and Bobbie said, "Well let's just get moving!"
As soon as we picked up a trot, the raindrops started falling again, and, escorted by another loud crack of thunder, we whipped around the corner and up the little hill to the tack shed. Just as we jumped off it started raining in earnest. We quickly pulled the saddles, and jumped under the little roof shelter just as the heavens opened up, and it DUMPED rain. Like a monsoon, it poured in buckets and sheets and it beat on the roof like a thousand drums.
We turned the two mares loose (and fed the gelding, who didn't care about the rain, as long as he had grain to eat), one of whom crowded with us under the roof. A bright lightning flash brought a loud crack that made us all jump, humans and horses. And it just kept dumping, 15 minutes of momentous unadulterated rain. And it was a cold rain - without a raincoat, I'd have been quickly soaked and very chilled. (Reminded me of another thunder/lightning/hailstorm I'd been caught in unprepared in the Sierras, with 3 horses...)
Finally the rain let up a bit, and we ran to the house, where Bobbi whipped up some coffee and tea, and we watched from indoors as it dumped another unbelievable monsoon drenching of rain.
When I left later, the sun had come out briefly, darkening the deep blue storm clouds to the east, and making sparkling the surrounding crisp cleansed forest - the forest smells so perfect after a rain.
I inhaled and inhaled till I got a mountain high, to hold onto that aroma till the next time I'm back home in a forest.
It was very dark and quiet at 4:45 AM at the barns full of dressage, jumping, cross-country and reining horses at the Colorado Horse Park; nothing but the sound of hoofbeats as 10 Junior and Young Endurance Riders warmed up their endurance horses around their barn. At 5 AM they headed across the grounds, led by flashlight by Dr Carter Hounsel, to the starting line. Someone asked last night if we shouldn't share the excitement of the sport and honk a car horn to wake everybody up - an endurance tradition at ridecamps - but we decided to let the other disciplines sleep.
It was in the mid-50's and quite breezy, and a few girls were shivering in their short sleeves, though the day would quickly warm as soon as the sun came up. Better to be a bit cold now, than have to stop and tie a jacket onto your saddle out on trail.
There would be 5 loops, of 12, 19, 12, 19, and 12 miles. In addition to the heat, another big challenge of the ride would be the altitude: Parker, Colorado is at 5800 feet.
Though the start was scheduled for 5:30 AM, Ground Jury President Robin Oscar decided to delay that by 15 minutes because he felt there wasn't quite enough light on the ground. Though this was the first time any of the girls had ridden exclusively with other young riders, with no adults along on the trail, none of them outwardly showed any nerves. From the adult point of view anyway, it looked to be a tall responsibility; Bill Stevens said, "I wish my daughters (Heather and Jennifer) were a bit more nervous, but they said, 'Oh, it's only a 75!'"
There was no water at this start/Vet Check/finish as had been promised (it was supposed to be brought out yesterday evening), "the first crisis of the day!" said Carolyn Hock, mother of rider Frances Chase-Dunn. "Cowboy" Mark Dial left to take care of it. Cowboy was here as a Steward, "but I'm also here to make sure all these girls get through the ride." He was in the middle of a vacation from his work in the UAE and obviously enjoying the heat wave here: "It was 120* when I left there!" The water truck and troughs arrived promptly in half an hour.
It was expected that the girls would complete the first loop in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Ellyn Rapp and Jeremy Olson, who hauled two horses from Illinois for Iowa riders Caitlin Massman and Jordan Fleege, coached their girls to start off easy (take about an hour for the first loop), pick up the pace toward the end, and finish near the top. "That's the plan, anyway," Ellyn said. Jeremy and Ellen had owned these horses, but "they belong to the girls now; they've been working hard for us." Jeremy and Ellyn have 14 horses in training in Illinois, but are looking to move to Florida.
Effie Conner of Arizona coached her daughter Morgan, 16, on pacing: "You're a small group; you're already in the top ten; don't rush it!" Morgan and her mom were at the final episode of a 10-day camping vacation with their horses in Utah. Morgan was riding her mom's horse Whistleddin for the first time on an endurance ride. It was the first ride where Morgan was riding beyond 55 miles; so far she had a perfect 23 starts and 23 finishes.
While we waited, Anne Pfeiffer - some of you may remember her as the "Animal Tacker" lady from Texas - began handing out some of her famous snacks, that are known to fuel tired and hungry and grouchy (or energetic and happy and hungry) crews and officials and photographers. The morning started off with her specially made chocolate covered strawberries shaped into little animals. White chocolate for breakfast? You bet! I had several!
Right at 6:45 AM, the first group of 7 girls crossed the busy road (traffic stopped by Cowboy) and came into the vet check, followed two minutes later by Jessica DiCamillo, then 8 minutes later by Kirsten Kimbler and Frances Chase-Dunn.
All horses passed their vet check, though Frances' horse, Dixie Love, was asked for a second trot-out. This probably caused a few heart palpitations, not least to 17-year-old Frances.
Frances flew in with her parents from California to ride this mare, owned and hauled here from Illinois by Jan Worthington. It wasn't just another ride on just another horse: Dixie Love had a perfect 61 for 61 record. Frances was feeling "a little pressure!" especially since this was her first ride on Dixie Love. Dixie Love trotted out well the second time and passed the vet check and would continue on down the trail.
By the end of the 30 minute hold, all unnecessary layers of clothing were peeled off by riders and crews, as it was already in the mid-70's. The next loop would be 19 miles, to an out vet check (the next two vet checks would be there) at a picnic area in the Douglas County Park Open Space. In 1944, Douglas County began buying private land and setting it aside for outdoor recreation, and to protect wildlife habitat, natural resources, historic sites, scenic views and Douglas County's rural heritage. With riding areas and open spaces slowly shrinking around the country, this is one area that will be safe from development.
Everybody loaded things up and drove the 3 miles down the main road to the Park. The crew spots were set up around the picnic area, and everybody waited under the shade. We could see the girls, little dots in the distance, as they climbed up onto a mesa, and as they came back down later, then as they passed within a mile of the park. They had to ride down a creek a few miles where they picked up a token (hair bands) before they could turn around and come back into the vet check. There was enough water in the creek for a good drink and horse-sponging break going both directions.
Six of the girls arrived at the vet check together, though Caitlin Massman's horse CHF Adios pulsed down first, followed a minute later by Heather and Jennifer Stevens' horses RSA Count LaQuen and Phil. Sixteen minutes was the spread between first and last. A couple of horses were asked to represent near the end of the 40 minute hold before they could continue on the next 12 mile loop.
Morgan Conner's horse was one of these, and he vetted out lame. Morgan was, in one word, one BIG word, Devastated. The first elimination of the day, and her first elimination ever in four seasons of riding. She was assured by everybody, "It's happened to me, lots of times," "It happens to everybody," but she was inconsolable. She couldn't muster up the energy to clean the sweat off her horse's face, which her little crewing sister willingly did. Turns out Whistleddin's right front pad had gotten a slit in it, and the space between the pad and sole filled with rocks and sand, and made his foot sore. John Crandall offered his advice on shoeing and padding, and veterinarians Dr Ann Christopherson and Dr Carter Hounsel came back to check on the horse a few times. It was lameness that eliminated him, but "I wasn't thrilled with his metabolics, either." said Hounsel. Whistleddin appeared to be fine; it would be a young girl's heart that might take a little more doctoring over the next few days.
It was now in the 90's, the 19th straight day over 95* on the Front Range, a record. Tomorrow was supposed to be 100*, so we were lucky the ride was today. "But," said Steward Holly Ulyate, "as they say here, 'At least we don't have to shovel it!'"
A saving breeze helped keep the officials and crews comfortable under the shade. Dr Jim Baldwin appeared to have the enviable knack of quickly falling into a doze at will anywhere he sat down. Anne Pfeiffer, after having set out fruit and nut snacks for the second vet check, then deviled eggs and chicken salad and green salad (all homemade of course), then brought out her equipment and made frozen smoothies for everyone - what a treat on such a hot day!
The horses and riders had it harder on this third loop (these trails a repeat of what they'd done) because of the heat, and they slowed down and spread out more. Caitlin Massman, 17, was first to come cantering in, with her crew yelling to slow down coming into the vet check, a strategy to take note of. It was only Caitlin's 9th endurance ride, and both her and her horse CHF Adios' first ride beyond 50 miles. She knew Adios well, however, having been his only endurance rider in his two short seasons of endurance rides.
Five minutes behind Caitlin was Jessica DiCamillo on Crestwind Premiere. From New Mexico, Jessica, 15 - the youngest rider of the group - has already passed her 3000 mile mark in endurance (3715 miles to be precise, including the completion of 5 of 7 100's). "Woody" just turned 7; Jessica trains him by herself, and has ridden him in all of his 22 rides, including two 100-mile finishes. Jessica and her mom Karen were the recipients in 2004 of the Bill Thornburgh Family Award Winners - top mileage parent(s)-child(ren) team - with 2410 miles.
Three minutes behind Jessica were sisters Heather and Jennifer Stevens; they were followed a minute later by Kirsten Kimbler, with Jordan Fleege and Frances Chase-Dunn a minute behind her. Ahslee Van Raalte rounded out the field 8 minutes later - a spread of 27 minutes between first and last. Ashlee, 21, was impressed with her mount Sirloki: "he's such a cool horse!" Sirloki is owned by Ashlee's neighbor Jan Worthington. Ashlee didn't have so much pressure on her as Frances did, riding a horse with a perfect record, although it was Sirloki's first ride beyond 55 miles.
This third hold was an hour, with all the horses squeezing under the disappearing shade - the sun was now directly overhead. It gave the horses plenty of time to rest up and eat, and it gave the riders time to rest - and treat wounds. 17-year-old Elizabeth Russell's horse DJB Double Trouble rammed her knee into a metal post, and Elizabeth followed that up by stepping in a hole. She would have toughed it out, but was brought an ice pack and made to sit icing her leg. DJB Double Trouble came from Texas endurance rider Darolyn J Butler; Elizabeth, also from Texas, first rode him in October 2003, and has ridden him exclusively since then, winning the 2005 Junior title at the AERC National Championship at Fort Howes on him. Elizabeth's parents, Kate and Jim, don't ride, so "it's all her," said Kate. "She trains the horse by herself."
After the last rider, Ashlee, left the vet check at 12:48 on the 4th 19-mile loop, we all packed up and headed back to the Colorado Horse Park for the 4th vet check, and, after the final 12 mile loop, the finish. For once I wasn't thinking about myself in the heat, but the horses: there wasn't a single tree within a half mile of the vet check - no place for the hard working horses to get out of the sun. There was a small tent set up for the vets and officials; a few crews brought human umbrellas; and Jeremy and Ellyn had thoughtfully brought a tent for their two horses, but the others would just bake.
The crews wanted (and the riders wanted it) to go meet the girls out on the trail somewhere, anywhere, just once, maybe even just one person with one car full of water for horses and riders, but it wasn't allowed. The girls carried water bottles with them, but, as Elizabeth said, "Sometimes I felt guilty drinking it - I wanted to pour it over my horse!" They all agreed later that there wasn't enough water on course for such a hot day.
At the vet area we all squeezed under what shade we could find as we waited for the riders. I kept generously dunking my hat in the water trough and pouring it all over me; Jeremy stuck his feet in a cool bucket of water. While we waited, Jan Worthington got a call from Ashlee on the trail. Sirloki had lost a hind shoe, and Ashlee couldn't get the Easy Boot on him. Jan wasn't allowed to go out on trail, so she could only wait. The shoer fired up her hot forge (!) in preparation for replacing the shoe when Ashlee came in.
Caitlin Massman had done the 19 mile loop 2 in first place in 2 hours and 16 minutes; she maintained almost exactly the same pace, coming in first off the same 19 mile loop (retracing their earlier steps) in 2 hours and 13 minutes. Jessica DiCamillo was a minute behind her, with the Stevens sisters another 13 minutes back. Heather, 20, riding RSA Count LaQuen, had 2470 endurance miles to her name, and had completed 9 of 10 100's. She and her horse had most recently placed 5th in the 100-mile Fort Howes ride put on by the Stevens in their home state of Montana. Jennifer, 17, had 1420 miles including 2 of 2 100's; she was taking Phil on his first ride over 55 miles.
Seventeen minutes later came Kirsten Kimbler. Earlier this year, Kirsten, 18, was the recipient of not only the 2007 Arabian Horse Association Youth of the Year award, but also USEF's 2007 Youth Sportsman's Charter Award, and the 2007 Junior Equestrian Award. While Kirsten has completed 1200 miles in endurance over 6 seasons, she's also won multiple AHA National Top 10 awards and Top 10 Awards in Youth Nationals, in hunter pleasure, showmanship, hunt seat equitation, and Sport Horse Under Saddle, to name only a few disciplines. "She's tried them all," said her mom Kelly. Kirsten is the second oldest of the four endurance riding Kimbler girls.
Following on Kirsten's heels was Jordan Fleege. Jordan, 17, is just getting started in endurance; she had only 150 long-distance miles to her record, (plus 160 LD miles), but one of those included a finish in a 100 mile ride. She was pacing her horse RCF Blade Runner well - it was his first ride over 60 miles.
Next, Frances Chase-Dunn, then Elizabeth Russell arrived at the vet check; it seemed to be a long wait before Ashlee VanRaalte arrived (44 minutes behind the leader) on Serloki. She had gotten the Easy Boot on his hind foot; they came trotting in down the grassy hill looking good. After taking a few minutes to cool down at the water trough they entered the vet check; and within a few strides of trotting out, it was obvious Serloki was quite lame, making the second pull of the day. No need for that shoe anymore.
After a 40 minute hold, the riders went out on their last 12 mile loop, Caitlin Massman and CHF Adios leaving a minute before Jessica DiCamillo and Crestwind Premiere.
The trail took the riders on a 4 mile loop to the north, back along the fence past the vet check, and across the busy road for a longer 8 mile loop. While crews were not allowed to "crew" for their riders and horses at this spot close to camp, they were finally given permission to have a "courtesy stop," where they could walk out to the spot, taking only the water they could carry by hand. This was very welcomed by both horses and riders, with the sun still roasting everything not in the shade.
A pile of people walked across the street to the finish line, in the middle of the cross-country course. There were many cross-country riders out walking the course they'd be riding over beginning on Saturday.
The first 12 mile loop of the day had been covered in an hour by the leaders; it took an hour and 8 minutes before we saw the first two riders coming in sight for the final hundred yard flat grassy straightaway: Jessica DiCamillo and Caitlin Massman. Both horses were galloping, and while Caitlin's horse CHF Adios seemed to be digging hard and running harder with his ears pinned, Jessica's horse seemed to effortlessly maintain his length lead, down the stretch and across the finish line.
Both girls had big smiles on their faces after they pulled up, both having obviously enjoyed their ride - competitors, but friends too. "Thanks for riding with me!" Jessica said, and Caitlin answered, "Thanks, that was an awesome ride!" Winning time for the 75 miles was 7:48. While the two girls and horses and their crews walked back to the vetting area to cool down and vet through, the rest of us stayed to wait for the other finishers.
On this loop the riders spread out even more. Twenty-six minutes later the Stevens girls came across the line - not at a sprint but an easy canter, followed 15 minutes later by Kirsten Kimbler and Junior CAHR. Eight minutes later Jordan Fleege and RCF Blade Runner arrived at the finish. Carolyn Hock got a call from her daughter Frances Chase-Dunn out on the trail; she and Elizabeth Russell had slowed down and were taking their time coming in, because their horses were tired. A pleasant cloud cover immediately dropped the temperature 10 degrees as we waited 44 minutes for Elizabeth, (her horse stopped to grab some grass along the finish strip) and Frances to come in, to the whistles and applause of the waiting spectators.
More cheers at the vet ring when all the horses had passed their completion exam - a very fine 80% completion rate for the first ever 75-mile Junior and Young Rider Endurance Ride. It was a race, but most of all a learning experience - shoeing, lameness, metabolics, pacing, trotting out, arriving at vet checks, managing yourself and your horse in the heat with minimal help. Whether they finished or not it provided the girls with a taste of Junior/Young Rider competition, with an eye towards International endurance competition in the near future.

The EC reads the power button and with no battery and no power you got no EC.  Even if you did have some brief amount of EC while a cap discharged the power button signal is a one shot and holding it longer than about 200 ms will not do anything more until  4 seconds.  At 4 seconds the EC turns off the voltage regulators to the host and waits for you to release the button before restarting the state machine that runs the button logic.
Waiting 10 seconds is still a good idea to make sure all the caps have discharged but holding the power button will have no effect on how long that takes.

People living in drylands usually adopt their lifestyle to the prevailing harsh environment around them. Their rudimentary living conditions generally reflect that human lifestyle and environmental factors are intertwined. People in the arid region are used to some variability in their environment as is to be expected from people who live close to nature. However, when this variability extends to the level so as to cause stress to the population, it can be termed ‘crisis.’ The objective of this study has been to identify the critical values in hydrological, meteorological, environmental, and socio-economic factors that can trigger the onset of crisis.
The study area is the interior drylands of New South Wales in Australia. The region has suffered a number of severe droughts in the last three decades. The amount of data available from direct measurements, remote sensing, secondary sources, and questionnaire survey is phenomenal. Since the volume of data to be dealt with is enormous, and a large part of it is unstructured in the form of textual data, application of data mining tools have been adopted in this study. The standard data mining strategies of classification, clustering, text mining, and association rule mining have been applied.
Essentially, data mining is a black box approach that cannot be conceptualized, but it has found many applications where the problem is too complex or overwhelming with myriad of information. The findings of this study do not unveil any causal relationships as is typical with data mining techniques. Nevertheless, they provide some association of conditions that can forewarn an impending crisis for planning mitigating measures.

(The stages of mesothelioma, the definition, the symptoms, the life expectancy aspect, possible causes, the link to asbestos exposure and many other things related to our lungs.)
Thank you for visiting my mesothelioma prognosis website. I hope some of the information I have compiled here can help you with whatever you, or someone you know, is going through.
Does exposure to asbestos cause that awful disease? Yes. Mesothelioma is caused by asbestos fibers, which are impervious to fire. They build up in the body over time and cause the cancer known as mesothelioma because they eat away at the body’s protective mesothelial tissue, which covers the heart and other organs.
Mesotheliomas are a very rare tumor disease of the mesothelial tissue. The mesothelium is a two-layered membrane surrounding the internal organs. Between these two layers there is a small amount of liquid so that the organs can slide past each other as they move. When the cells of the mesothelium, the mesotheliia degenerate and become malignant, a malignant mesothelioma arises.
The first descri ption of a mesothelioma was made in 1767. At the beginning of the last century (1931) the mesothelioma was first classified. A distinction is made between an epithelioid, a sarcomatoid, and a biphasic tumor subtype.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma grows in early stages of development, usually in the form of multiple relatively small nodules, preferably the parietal pleura. In the case of far advanced tumor stages, a tumor plate, up to several centimeters thick, is found, which encases the lungs.
In the case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma two macroscopic growth patterns are distinguished. On the one hand, the multinodular type occurs with mutually delimitable tumor nodes with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters, with the preference for the underfoot and the large net. The diffuse type with formation of plaque-like or extensive thickening of the peritoneum results in a tumor plate up to several centimeters thick, which can wallow the other abdominal organs.
Unfortunately, the diagnosis of a malignant mesothelioma is often made in an advanced stage of the tumor.
In rare tumor diseases, such as malignant mesothelioma, treatment should be carried out in specialized centers with appropriate experience. The diagnosis should also be validated by a medical treatment center with the proper expertise.
Asbestos is a group of fibrous inorganic crystalline minerals, so-called silicates, occurring very naturally in the earth’s crust. Due to their excellent insulation properties and heat resistance, they were used extensively in the industry until the end of the 1970s. In certain regions of the earth, e.g. In Turkey / Central Anatolia, there are also natural environmental pollution caused by asbestos, which can lead to increased occurrence of breast cancer (pleural mesothelioma).
Inhaled asbestos fibers can only be disposed of very slowly after deposition (deposition) in the respiratory tract (respiratory tract). They cause pulmonary fibrosis in the pulmonary fibrosis and have also carcinogenic properties. In addition to lung cancer and lung cancer, breast cancer is the most common asbestos-related cancer disease recognized as occupational disease. In the following, an overview of the asbestos-induced malignant diseases of the lung and the riboid (pleura) and its diagnostics and therapy are given Focus on breast cancer (malignant pleural mesothelioma).
Asbestos is a substance belonging to the category of fibers. They are elongated bodies in which the length is larger than the width. We have two distinct types of fibers, natural ones, that is, that are found in nature (asbestos, zeolite, sepiolite) and artificial ones (slag wool, rock wool, ceramic fibers), which are mineral fibers, man-made through of technological processes, and which today have almost been completely replaced.
Its handling and installation determine the release of fibers, which can become airborne and – once that makes contact with us – penetrate and progress along the airways.
Asbestos, therefore, given the size of its fibers, is a substance that is dangerously easy to inhale. These fibers are also bio-resistant, ie, before being destroyed by the body with which they come into contact, they need a long time, so they can cause damage.
Asbestos was widely used, especially years ago, because it is resistant to fire, it is an excellent sound-absorbing, and is also a dielectric. Its acid resistance properties, microorganisms and wear, its flexibility and the ability to be “woven” into very ductile structures, make it very used at the industrial level. For example, we can find it in railway cars, ships, in the asbestos-cement and in the textile industry.
There are different types of asbestos, which cause different types of diseases. Its fibers, for simplicity can be divided into two large groups:
• serpentine group: is represented by chrysotile (white asbestos or gray), and is much more used than other types of asbestos. In fact, it corresponds to about 93{63af36d31133a8cdc4f5f7c962b70216b35c57d40566735cb1212e9c5fb4c63d} of world production, and this is good because it is less harmful than the second group. It is produced mainly in South Africa, the Russian Federation, Canada, Yugoslavia, Europe (Corsica, and more than half only in Italy, especially near Turin).
Crocidolite, or blue asbestos = iron silicate. The most dangerous of all. It is of Australian origin, and was used in England for the construction of gas masks for military use.
Amosite or brown asbestos = iron and magnesium silicate. Dangerous, but less of crocidolite. It trovavanegli employees to shipyards in the USA and Canada.
Exposure to asbestos was surveyed and examined in about 3,000 kinds of activities. The main ones are:
Industry of friction materials (rolling stock, train, ships) and the production of brakes and clutches (especially elevators);
We must point out that there are countless types of asbestos exposure, not as frequent as those mentioned above and defined for that reason “unusual.” Sources of contamination do not work may be due to the proximity of places of production, for use in old houses and workshops of asbestos structures, brought home on the clothing fibers by miners or industrial workers, and environmental contamination.
Biological Activity Nootropic, with modulatory actions through allosteric potentiation of AMPA specific receptors, reduction of glutamate receptor desensitization and potentiation of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity. Anxiolytic following systemic administration.
Aniracetam is anampakine nootropic of the racetam chemical class purported to be considerably more potent than piracetam. It is lipid-soluble and has possible cognition-enhancing effects. It has been tested in animals extensively, Alzheimer's patients, and temporarily impaired healthy subjects.
Aniracetam are related to improved mental performance. This includes an increase in memory and possibly even enhanced learning capacity. This may actually occur differently in each person; Some will see strong effects and begin remembering everything while others may just simply beginremembering small and subtle details.
Aniracetam is also considered be very helpful as a focusing agent. Many users note that their attention.Span is increased as well as being able to focus and concentrate much more easily. This also serves to improve mental fluidity, making even simple, routine tasks such as reading and writing (and holding conversations) seem to flow much more easily, without expending as much effort as before using aniracetam Supplements.

The University of the West Indies (The UWI) will today host an inter-faith service at The UWI Chapel on the Mona campus to kick-start the celebration of its 70th anniversary.
In a ststement to the press, the university said it is celebrating its evolution from a university college in Jamaica in 1948 with 33 medical students to an internationally respected regional university with near 50,000 students.
“With four campuses in Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Open Campus with sites throughout the region, the university has demonstrated its relevance and quality as a site of excellence in the Caribbean. It has won the respect of universities globally, enabling the establishment of partnering centres in North America, Asia, and Africa. Its alumni are found in all areas of public life and have brought the university tremendous honour through their regional and global achievements and contributions,” the statement said.
The anniversary milestone, it said, is an occasion for reflection as well as a projection for the future with an emphasis on social justice and the economic transformation of the region.
The university said it's also time to celebrate students, faculty, administrators, alumni, governments, and partners in the public and private sector.
“For the past 70 years The University of the West Indies (The UWI) has provided service and leadership to the Caribbean region. Since its inception in 1948, The UWI has been a pivotal force in every aspect of Caribbean development; residing at the centre of all efforts to improve the well-being of our people,” said the university.
ST GEORGE'S Slayers defeated The University of the West Indies (UWI) Runnin' Rebels 77-72 to capture the 2017/2018 Sports Development Foundation (SDF)/JABA Southern Conference National Basketball League title at National Arena last Saturday.
The Slayers managed to outscore the Rebels in the last 60 seconds after the two were locked at 72-72. The win also allowed the Slayers to avenge one of their two defeats suffered at the hands of the Rebels.
The Slayers, the Rebels, as well as Urban Knights and Pembroke Hall Warriors will oppose the champions of the Western, Central, and Eastern Conferences in the National Championship Play-offs.
“We got the players to train and were well-prepared for our opponents, especially a few new players. The key players were getting a bit tired in the third quarter and also they were in team foul trouble, so I had to pull them out to give them a breather and it gave Rebels the opportunity to capitalise, as they drew level at 58-58,” Robinson said.
“When the scores were locked at 70-70 only a little over 60 seconds remained on the clock, as they tried to mark Mark Rodgers out of the game due to his excellent shooting. But with the talent we have in the team, we were able to get the better of our opponents,” he added.
“We had a very good chance of winning the game but our shooting was a bit off in the closing minutes, and also a few fouls cost us the game,” Matthews said.
He added that the Slayers played extremely well to win a very good game. He said he is looking forward to the All-Island National Championships Play-offs quarter-final knock-out, where his team has a very good chance of winning.
The first-quarter action was dominated by Slayers through the effort of Mark Rodgers, Aundre Rose and Anthony White, as they outscored Rebels' leading shooters Jonathan Mitchell, Kimani Ffriend, and Ramal Carbon to take a 25-18 lead.
Slayers went into a 10-point (33-23) lead in the early minutes of the second quarter, but Rebels played themselves back into contention by cutting the lead to 38-34. They went into the half-time break with Slayers up 44-39.
A very interesting battle ensued in the third quarter with the Rebels tying the scores at 58-58, which brought excitement and loud cheers from the fair-sized spectators who were in attendance witnessing a thrilling showdown. The lead changed hands with the Rebels closing the third quarter leading 61-60.
The fourth and final quarter produced another keen battle between both teams, with the lead changing several times and the Rebels going up 68-65 with five minutes remaining. The Slayers rallied, however, to eke out a 69-68 lead with three minutes remaining, and kept their composure to clinch a thrilling 77-72 win.
Michael Rodgers was the principal scorer for Slayers with a game-high 29 points along with seven rebounds, and Aundre Rose added 18 points. For the Rebels, meanwhile, Jonathan Mitchell sank 18 points, Kimani Ffriend scored 16 points and had 12 rebounds, and Ramal Carbon added 16 points and eight rebounds.
Meanwhile, in the third-place play-off, former champions Urban Knights clipped Pembroke Hall Warriors 78-77 in a thrilling encounter. The principal scorers for the Knights were Omar Barnes with a game-high 27 points, Fabian Sutherland with 14 points and 14 rebounds, and Jerome Thomas with 10 points and 12 rebounds. For the Warriors, Damion Young got 25 points, Andrew Bell 14 points, and Andrew Whilby got 11 points and nine rebounds.

Since 2001 the thoroughly independent Club Fandango company has been at the forefront of unsigned music in London, promoting up-and-coming new bands across virtually every notable small venue in London ranging from 80 to 800 capacity.
Set up by Andy Macleod (Pointy Records) and Simon Williams (fierce panda records), Club Fandango began with a now infamous Tuesday night residency at the Dublin Castle in Camden which ran through the naughties (and indie boom time) from the spring of 2001 to the autumn of 2009 and became a byword for an edifying night out for bands, industry and gig goers alike thanks to early and pivotal gigs by the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Death Cab For Cutie, Bloc Party, The Futureheads, Hot Chip, Razorlight, The Killers, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs and other bands beginning with 'K', like KaitO. All of a sudden Tuesdays were the new Fridays and Thursday simply didn't know what to think.
Along the way there was unbridled gigging passion and, inevitably, unhinged expansion. There were the quite-frankly-seminal runs of nights such as the BBC 6 Music gigs at the Water Rats and the BMI sessions at the Borderline. There have been the trips up north to In The City, down south to The Great Escape, and along the road for The Camden Crawl. There has been the fanzine (Zine Fandango), the record company (Label Fandango) and the urban - if you will - festivals (A Fistful Of Fandango) and Pandamonium - the annual 5 night stand in the first week of January. Snow permitting.
And Then? After a decade of dossing on other people's (dance)floors, Club Fandango found a home it could call its own. That home was The Bull & Gate in Kentish Town. They moved in on June 1st 2010 and thought about re-naming it Pub Fandango. In September they threw a splendidly successful month-long housewarming party which doubled up as a 30th Birthday celebration for the venue itself. The esteemed likes of mybandsbetterthanyourband, We Got Tickets, Steve Lamacq's Going Deaf For A Living, Amazing Radio, Stuntfox & fierce panda all signed up for the ride to create a welcoming home for great new bands to come and peddle their melodies.
And just as the Bull & Gate was rediscovering its former glory news broke that it was to be sold and turned into a Gastro Pub. Fandango tried to resist and asked Coldplay to come back and play on the roof in protest but not only were there healthy and safety implications, the band were too busy, and in May 2013 Fandango threw a week of sold out shows called Play Your Respects to say goodbye to the place culminating in a Ed Harcourt singalong around the old piano. It felt an apt way to say goodbye.
Since leaving the Bull & Gate, Fandango has emerged bigger, brighter and bouncier with some new partnerships in place - namely with INgrooves (Digital distribution and Publishing), AIM (AIM Awards Warm Up Shows) and London Met University plus the regular live showcases with fierce panda and disorder. The aim is still to discover the next generation of fantastic new bands and take them from playing to un homme et son chien on a wet, windy night at Buffalo Bar to a sell out show at Brixton Academy and hopefully manage, release or publish a few of them on the way.
Now in her 18th year, (yes you thought she was a he), Fandango is excited to announce it is launching not one, not three, but two exciting new ventures. Firstly RADIO FANDANGO, not just because RADIO FANDANGO is the greatest name for a radio station ever, but because Radio Fandango is going to try and entertain, educate and inspire audiences across the country through the best in unsigned music, artist-curated shows, industry podcasts and live sessions.
And secondly, the SCHOOL OF FANDANGO - a brand spanking new free resource to provide guidance, mentoring and real practical advice to help new bands and solo artists meet challenges of an ever-evolving wild west of a music industry.�
Indeed, over the years all walks of music industry life have tapped their toes on the Club Fandango boards: A&R men, publishers, managers, journalists, press officers, DJs, lawyers, agents and even rival promoters are often to be found checking out the entertainment. Other punters include rock enthusiasts, generally clever people and, most important of all, new band's burgeoning fan bases. The basic truth is that you can go down to a Fandango show and see three to four carefully hand-picked new bands and if that doesn't represent a good nights entertainment, we bally well don't know what does.
Also before they were famous... can you guess? Daggers, Snowfight In The City Centre, Freerunner... And lest we forget - Satan's Cock.

MSA membership is open to Driver & Vehicle Standards Agency Approved Driving Instructors (DVSA ADIs) and all road transport trainers are welcome including motorcycle, lorry, bus, off road and theory trainers. Trainee licence holders, potential driving instructors and those training to be ADIs (PDIs), driving school proprietors and other interested parties may also join. PDIs are welcomed into MSA membership and on qualification are converted to full members at no extra charge.
The MSA is run on behalf of members by a Board of Management, who are all working driving instructors, elected in each of the association's 10 regions. They are paid no salary for the work they do. The regions and nations also elect committees who organise local events including meetings, seminars and social events. The MSA is a company limited by guarantee there are no shareholders and any profits are used for the benefit of members. The association employ a small staff based in Stockport.
The MSA prides itself on the information available to members. Most information is first published on the web site www.msagb.com and distributed through the association's social media feeds on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
MSA GB also publishes printed literature and our flagship publication Newslink has recently changed from a newspaper to an A4 magazine, a-style which reflects the current trend in professional publications, to be commentary and advice vehicles, rather than 'newspapers'. The new design coincides with something else that's new: the MSA GB logo, which you can at the top of this page.
MSA GB represents individuals who have difficulties with other bodies and represents driver training interests to Government departments and agencies. The association is also a member of: PACTS (the Parliamentary Advisory Committee on Transport Safety); and RoSPA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents). European involvement is as the British representative to EFA (the European Driving Schools Association).
The association includes a number of services in the membership fee including Public Liability Insurance in the sum of ten million pounds (£10,000,000) and Professional Indemnity insurance in the sum of five million pounds (£5,000,000) for MSA GB and for members engaged in any driver training that they are competent to deliver either through qualification or experience.
The MSA is always open for business our phones are manned from 9am to 4:30pm and if we can't answer your question straight away we will call you back and make sure you have whatever help and information you need.

Music is part of every culture in the world and has been throughout the history of mankind since the beginning. Over the hands of time music has evolved together with the medium through which it is played. For the ones old enough to remember the days of vinyl records or the collectors of our days, you will love this new effect from PhotoFunia. This effect gives you the chance to see what it was like back in the day of the vinyl record store selecting your favourite one from a row of records to take home with you. In addition, you can even add your own picture to the cover of the record perhaps to bring the current pop music back to the times of vinyl records. Give it a go and share it with your friends and family!
I’m on tour this week promoting my new book, Little Elliot, Big Fun. I love school visits. I love seeing kids’ pictures of Elliot lining school hallways. I love the excitement the students have about this little character that means so much to me. I enjoy meeting educators around the world who are passionate about books and about inspiring their students. It’s a very special feeling to be so welcomed by complete strangers wherever I go.
This morning, however, I did not feel welcome. I arrived at a school where the principal’s main concern was that I not talk about one of my books. They were referring to Worm Loves Worm, written by the talented JJ Austrian, and published by Balzer + Bray.
Worm Loves Worm is a book about inclusion. Worm and worm want to be married, but all of their friends have some input about what a real wedding (and a real married couple) should be like. They try to go about things the traditional way, but in the end, they have to do things a little differently, because what really matters is that worm loves worm.
The book is obviously about same-sex marriage. Though I am one of the people who made this book, I can safely say without arrogance that this is an important book. It’s important for children of same-sex couples to see their family represented in books. It is equally important for children who are not in such a family (especially for children that have zero exposure to LGBT people) to be able to see people (albeit in worm form) who are different from their family.
How come? Why should it matter that these kids learn about a family that they don’t interact with? If someone doesn’t believe in same-sex marriage, why should they be forced to read this? Why should an educator or parent Continue reading →

I’m still feeling overwhelmed by all of the beautiful pieces that Elliot is (literally) hanging out with. I need to get back to the show to see everything up close and personal, without hundreds of people crammed into the gallery. I’m proud to call some of these artists my friends.

Today is the day that I have everything I’ve ever wanted. Who knew it was possible? There was a time I didn’t think it was.
I’m back in Seattle this week, celebrating my book release at Elliot Bay Books, going to my friends’ wedding, and spending some much needed time with old friends who I haven’t seen in a long while. I was having dinner with one friend, who is amidst a life-changing project. She relayed to me how tumultuous it’s been since she made the decision to really commit to her dream, how one minute she experiences euphoric highs, and the next she’s weeping in the pits of doubt. Her story sounded very familiar to me.
It wasn’t long ago that I had a full time job in graphic design, a career I was proud of that paid the bills and also served as a creative outlet. But it wasn’t my dream. I was telling other people’s stories through branding, but not my own. It didn’t fill me up the way creating a drawing did. What was I making that spoke my own truth? What would I leave behind? How on earth could I get a deal making a picture book, the one thing that gleamed like a beacon in my daydreams, when the odds seemed so slim.
I was a failure. I would try to make a painting, and it didn’t come out how I wanted it to. Or I would start and never finish. Or I would write down ideas and never start. Or I wouldn’t do anything but sit and stare into space and think about how it was all totally impossible. I prepared myself to accept that it probably would never happen for me. That being a grown up meant facing realities. That it was vain to put faith in one’s talent. That it was folly to think you could live up to your heroes. How arrogant. How stupid.
But amidst it all, there was Elliot, a friendly face that I would doodle in my sketch book. He was so kind and forgiving. He did not judge these hostile feelings. His heart was so pure that he glowed in my darkness. He was the innocent part of myself that I managed to protect, the vulnerable child that didn’t quite fit in. He was so little, but pressed on. Into Elliot, I poured my empathy, love and hope. I couldn’t deny him these things. When I finally started to create finished drawings of him, I felt as though I was fighting for my life. He was the key to keeping my dreams alive. I would give him my hands and eyes and heart. I would make something just for me, something that made me happy.
In hindsight, it’s all quite clear. When faced with the prospect of real happiness, our inner demons are unleashed. The saboteur whispers in your ear, “no, you can’t.” But what it’s really saying is: “No, you can’t try to be happy because what if you fail? We will never recover.” But those are convenient lies. I did try, and I did fail, but it didn’t break me. I tried and tried and tried and tried, because what’s the use in giving up? Eventually, I tried and I won. I’m not even talking about my book deal. I’m talking about the magical day that I finished a drawing of Elliot and I was proud. I felt transported to a time when I was little, just making drawings to give to my Mom. It felt easy, and made me smile. I loved Elliot so much. He felt alive, and that meant my dreams were alive. And yes, I decided then that I would muster the audacity of pursuing my dream, because if I didn’t, then why was I even here?
Today, I have a book. It’s about my friend Elliot, whose little spots and big heart saved my life. He means so much to me, and I hope that you all take very good care of him.
Part of my preparation for the move has been to spend time with the people who have made my years here so worth-while. Recently I was at dinner with friends, and one of them asked me “So, what did you learn from living in Seattle?” It was a good question. I did not have an immediate answer, but I promised them that I would think on it.
So, the date is BOOKED! Dan and I are leaving Seattle on November 12 on a one-way flight to NYC. If any of you dear readers are currently living in New York, or know someone who is, please let me know if you hear about any great apartment deals! We are aiming for Brooklyn, but also open to Astoria and parts of Manhattan.

The competition will feature four crews led by Zaytoven (with Zaytoven Global), Mija & Kenny Beats (with Don’t Think), Kranium (with Frequent Flyers), and Fuego (with Fireboy Sound Crew). And make no mistake: these crews will rep hard their individual cultures and backgrounds. Loudest response from the crowd means a win for that crew. The rules are simple, but the competition will be fierce, and we’ll be looking for the crew with the dopest sound and most entertaining presentation (because what’s a presentation without a little personality?).

The Immitation of Christ: Chapter XXXI - Of the neglect of every creature, that the Creator may be found
O Lord, I still need more grace, if I would arrive where neither man nor any other creature may hinder me. For so long as anything keepeth me back, I cannot freely fly unto Thee. He desired eagerly thus to fly, who cried, saying, Oh that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away and be at rest. What is more peaceful than the single eye? And what more free than he that desireth nothing upon earth? Therefore must a man rise above every creature, and perfectly forsake himself, and with abstracted mind to stand and behold that Thou, the Creator of all things, hast among Thy creatures nothing like unto Thyself. And except a man be freed from all creatures, he will not be able to reach freely after Divine things. Therefore few are found who give themselves to contemplation, because few know how to separate themselves entirely from perishing and created things.
2. For this much grace is necessary, which may lift up the soul and raise it above itself. And except a man be lifted up in the spirit, and freed from all creatures, and altogether united to God, whatsoever he knoweth, whatsoever even he hath, it mattereth but little. He who esteemeth anything great save the one only incomprehensible, eternal, good, shall long time be little and lie low. For whatsoever is not God is nothing, and ought to be counted for nothing. Great is the difference between a godly man, illuminated with wisdom, and a scholar learned in knowledge and given to books. Far nobler is that doctrine which floweth down from the divine fulness above, than that which is acquired laboriously by human study.
3. Many are found who desire contemplation, but they do not strive to practice those things which are required thereunto. It is also a great impediment, that much is made of symbols and external signs, and too little of thorough mortification. I know not how it is, and by what spirit we are led, and what we who would be deemed spiritual are aiming at, that we give so great labour and so eager solicitude for transitory and worthless things, and scarcely ever gather our senses together to think at all of our inward condition.
4. Ah, me! Forthwith after a little recollection we rush out of doors, and do not subject our actions to a strict examination. Where our affections are set we take no heed, and we weep not that all things belonging to us are so defiled. For because all flesh had corrupted itself upon the earth, the great deluge came. Since therefore out inmost affections are very corrupt, it followeth of necessity that our actions also are corrupt, being the index of a deficient inward strength. Out of a pure heart proceedeth the fruit of good living.
5. We demand, how much a man hath done; but from how much virtue he acted, is not so narrowly considered. We ask if he be strong, rich, handsome, clever, whether he is a good writer, good singer, good workman; but how poor he may be in spirit, how patient and gently, how devout and meditative, on these things many are silent. Nature looketh upon the outward appearance of a man, grace turneth its thought to the heart. The former frequently judgeth amiss; the latter trusteth in God, that it may not be deceived.

In the printing market, 98% of pages are printed using digital technology, but use technology that is essentially 100 years old. One of the main reasons is that when modern digital printing applies ink directly to paper, the wet ink penetrates the paper and many of the pigment particles end up beneath the paper’s surface becoming inefficient absorbers of light. Nanography, differs from other printing technologies, especially from Inkjet printing, because it uses an innovative system and printing process that employs Landa NanoInk, a proprietary water-based ink with nano-pigment particles that measure tens of nanometers in size.
The nanography process begins with Landa NanoInk, which is water-based and contains pigments with a diameter that measures in the tens of nanometers. This ink is ejected onto a conveyor blanket that is heated. Every row of ink ejectors adds a unique colorant, CMYK or CMYKOVG. The water quickly evaporates, causing the droplets of ink to flatten out and blend into a dry, super-thin, polymeric film. This color image, about 500 nm in thickness, is transferred from the heated blanket onto the paper or other surface. This image layer in abrasion resistant and laminated to match the glossiness of the paper it adheres to. The image that is produced has dots that are exceptionally round with edges that are incredibly sharp.
One of the biggest advantages of nanographic printing over ink jet and other types of printing is that the nano-pigments in the ink are excellent at absorbing light. Thus permits images with ultra-sharp dots of extremely high gloss fidelity, high uniformity and a broad CMYK colour gamut
The nanographic printer create images that are up to ten times thinner than other printing processes.
printing method also doesn’t require special paper or paper with special coatings. Nanographic images can be successfully transferred to nearly every type of paper available, without special primers or coatings.
The main disadvantage to nanographic printing is said to be the price of Nanography printers, however this technology has the capacity for the lowest cost-per-page of any digital printing method available.
Four naographic printing press models are currently available from Landa, and more are being developed. They are gradually penetrating the digital printing market and are in the process of developing print technology that is higher quality, less expensive, and more efficient than current printing methods.
We can say that Nanography is destined to become the first digital printing process that can compete in the mainstream market. Nanographic printing may never replace ink jet printing as the most common type of commercial digital printing, but their products are unique and they are constantly working on developing new technology.

Sixteen local middle and K-8 schools have earned awards from the Long Beach Unified School District for significant growth in academic achievement. The district’s Office of Middle and K-8 Schools recognized each of the winners at a recent Board of Education meeting. The Pyramid Awards, recognizing the cooperative efforts of parents, school staff, the principal and students, went to schools that demonstrated significant gains on state tests and other measurements. Nine of the schools were recognized for more than tripling their schoolwide growth target on the state Academic Performance Index (API) or for maintaining the state’s ultimate target for all schools, an API of 800 or above. These schools met state and national achievement goals in English and math, and closed achievement gaps by meeting growth targets for all subgroups of children. The schools are Bancroft, Cubberley, Hill, Hudson, Hughes, Newcomb, Rogers, Stanford and Tincher. Seven other schools were recognized for demonstrating growth toward meeting multiple criteria for student performance. Those schools are Avalon, Hoover, Lindbergh, Monroe, Powell, Robinson and Sutter.

I have slightly more than a week of my holidays left. I am actually excited about the new year. Last year I was very focused on my studies, but this year I would like to enjoy being a student as well. That's why I became a Buddy for Erasmus Students, I hope to meet many people from all around the world and have a lot of fun. And yes, I still want to pass all my exams - Priority Número Uno :)
So before this years starts again, I'd like to evaluate my year by going through all my goals I've enumerated in the Blog Post New Chapter. Oh and a cool thing I'd like to share with you - yesterday I went to buy a book, but of course I failed, because I came back with three books and many others small things - but one of the books is actually a Diary with 365 questions, so that's a question for every day and you answer it during 5 years and realise how much you really change. I love the idea ! Apparently some questions are easy, others are more philosophical. I am absolutely in love with it :)
It's really awkward that this was my Number One, haha ! Whatevah :) So yes, there are many handsome guys at uni, in my group there are two handsome guys. However, one smokes and the other one has a bad hygiene, hahah I am way too honest sometimes ! But I didn't mention any names :) So I met guys this year but none of them was real Boyfriend Material.
This year, I met many new people and I enjoyed it a lot ! It was fun to listen to different opinions and laugh at different jokes. Oh, uni is music for the soul :) However, I didn't meet a real Soul mate. I met one girl with whom I wasn't real friends, we didn't feel the need to contact each other all the time, but when the summer came we wanted to hang out, that was fun ! We think about several abstract things the same way and we laugh at the same things, so she might be a nice person. Time will tell :)
I also met another person, this time it is a guy. It was really strange how we met, because we met through a dating app. I always was like "UH NO, Dating Apps are for losers" haha ! Seems like I'm one of those Losers now, but I actually don't really care. So yeah, he had original ways of seeing the world, but unfortunately he was only a soul mate for one season. Let's call it a Spring Soul Mate
It is still far, but I'm one step closer :) I nailed my first year at uni ! I am so proud of it, but Mom seems to be even prouder of it, because she tells it to Every Single person she meets. It's like "Oh ! Hi ! This is my daughter - she passed all her exams at uni." and I stand next to her like "Jupp, that's really awkward, Mom", haha !
I have new ideas for the future, which I'm happy about, because I feel a little bit safer :) But I don't plan too much, so we'll see which move will be the smartest at that certain period of my life.
I am still bad at this, haha ! I didn't go to any party this year, but I went to live parties ! Hell-o ! That's much more spectacular ! I saw Ed Sheeran, 5 Seconds Of Summer and One Direction LIVE ! That's much cooler than a party in my opinion.
I know that's not the point of this paragraph. So no, I didn't go to any party this year :) I'll might go this year, but I am not seeing forward to it, haha
I love the way I described it in my old Blog Post. I think I'm still the same person, but I have new opinions and ideas. I still do the nerdy things I used to do when I was bored in High School like baking and knitting. I am quite proud of it. That's original after all !
I am still a fangirl, maybe I have less symptoms than I used to have in High School, but I am still slightly shaking when I buy tickets and I am super happy when I hold them. Being a Fangirl should be a profession, that cost a lot of money, stress and emotions !
This is actually true ! When I exercise regularly I feel much better. I feel calm and I am much more confident. Feeling confident is making my days brighter. However, there are days when I lock myself up and it makes me anxious and I absolutely can't change it. It happens and it's time to get used to it.
So yes, I didn't have gym class anymore. THANK GOD ! I absolutely hated it in High School, haha ! I only liked Korfball - the most unknown ball sport EVER, haha ! #AnythingButOrdinary It wasn't aggressive which made me like it. However, I was so into the game that I got aggressive myself ! Hahaha ! Once, I wanted to catch the ball and my friend, who is much taller than me, wanted to catch it as well and he pushed me and I fell against a wall. Yes, you read it correctly ! It makes me laugh now, but then something cracked in my back and I felt tackled for real that one time, BUT I still love Korfball :)
This year I should start choosing a country where I would like to spend some time to study to learn one of the languages I study in real daily situations. I am excited about it, but also a little bit scared. It's gonna be fun, Lexie, don't worry, it's gonna be fine. (You see that's how I talk with myself. One part of me is scared and the other one comforts it, haha !)
But I travelled to London this year ! It was only for one day, but we did a lot and I absolutely loved it ! Oh, and as a Buddy, I will "travel" by meeting people from all around the world who travelled with their culture to Belgium ! :)
You see, during one year many many things change. I feel less awkward while speaking French for example. I still don't enjoy talking French with people who have French as their mother tongue. I think I should get rid of my perfectionism, but whatever. That's how it is. However, that girl I spoke about in the paragraph Soul mates is one of the people I speak French with and I don't feel awkward. That's probably because her mother tongue is Flemish.
A new thing is that I love to think about French. I like to speak French in shops and other institutions and use all those grammatical constructions. I remember when I was in year 2 - I hated French at school and I thought "Omg, I will never study this in the future". See, that's how we change. I love what I'm doing now :)
I'm still anxious and I actually think it got worse, but I am more confident, less shy, more chatty, less grumpy, more flirty & happy ! :) That's actually true, no joke
Well, that's one thing I failed at this year. I really didn't have the time to write that much and when I did, I preferred to do something else than sitting at home in front of my laptop. I'm both sorry and not sorry about it. I still like to write, so I hope I won't abandon this blog.
Afterwards I realised that the guy in the flower-printed shirt and the artist on my iPod were both the one and only John Mayer, haha

Bill came to visit his mother and found her cheerless and unhappy. She said she is tired of boring lonely life, but there were no men around that could attract her. Worried about his mom, Bill said that maybe he could help her and gently rubbed her hand. Aroused with his words, she helped him to remove his shirt and they sweetly kissed before enjoying hot and passionate sex.
The vision of her son masturbating made Hillary nearly wild. He noticed her and tried to hide his cock, but she begged him to go on. She said she wants to see him doing it, but then she sat next to him and squeezed his cock in her hand. It throbbed in her fist and Hillary couldn't restrain herself from sucking it and then enjoying it with her voracious cunt.
Rodney's mom polished the sideboard wearing a short silk robe. Each time she bent down or rise on toes he saw her sexy thighs and wished to lick them. Finally his patience worn thin and he asked her to sit next to him. A couple of kisses made her feel nearly wild and she allowed him to strip her and enjoy her body as long as he wished.
Samantha was washing dishes, when her horny son approached her from behind, lifted the edge of her robe and pushed his hand between her sexy hips trying to reach her pussy. She turned around and he flung her robe open revealing her nude body, then forced her on her knees and gagged her with his stiffening cock before drilling her pussy in the doggy style.
A year has passed since Ellie divorced her husband and couldn't stop dreaming about sex. Afraid to deal with the strangers, she strongly decided to seduce her son. The right moment came, when she saw him jerking off in the bathroom. She went inside, removed her robe and got into the tub smiling to her stunned son, then got on her knees and wrapped his perky cock with her lips...
This 31 yr old mom of 5 decided to start running last year. I just ran 2 marathons and am ready for more...right?! Come along with me as I pretend to know what I'm doing... Goofy Challenge 2012!!
I am glad you made it back safe and sound!!! I should have turned around with you...my quads would have thanked me! I am glad you are back up and running. I am sure there will be many more good times ahead!
I'm so jealous that you have people to run with - I only have one running friend, and she's way too fast for me to run with, you two could hang though:)
Big thanks and love to my wonderful husband and 5 little kids. Having a running mom isn't always easy, but they deal with me and cheer me on. I couldn't do any of this without their support.

The last time I met Vasanth was on the sets of Rhythm. And, after watching him, I came away with the feeling that this man was the ultimate perfectionist -- nothing was too small to capture his attention, nothing so trivial that he wouldn't fine tune.
The other day, I saw Appu -- Vasanth's latest directorial venture. And the first thought I had was, no way, the man I met couldn't have made this film.
It is not as though there were glaring deficiencies in this remake of the Sanjay Dutt-starrer Sadak -- the disappointment comes from the fact that the Tamil remake, with Prashant and Devyani in the lead, simply fails to grip. You expect more -- much more -- from the man who made Keladi Kanmani, Nee Paadhi Naan Paadhi, Nerukku Ner, Aasai and Poovellaam Kettupaar.
The story itself is simply told. A young man, taxi driver by profession, has a chance encounter with this sweet young thing. Later, he encounters said SYT in a brothel and is determined to save her, irrespective of what it costs, or takes. Fuelling his angst is the recurring memory of his sister, who was forced into prostitution but opts for suicide as the preferred escape. Events, thus, lead to the inevitable blood-soaked ending.
Why a remake? Vasanth's forte is strong, original storytelling -- why then would he want to do an almost frame-to-frame remake of the Mahesh Bhatt original?
And why Prashant? Of the three young heroes at the top of the Tamil film tree today, Prashanth is the one who fits into the chocolate box slot. His knowledge of karate notwithstanding, he doesn't come across as the macho, two-fisted hero the film demands.
In fact, there are only two areas about the film that merit mention. The first is music -- always something to look forward to in Vasanth films. And the other is Prakash Rai, who brings his own flair to the role of the eunuch brothel-keeper played in the original by Sadashiv Amrapurkar. Rai appears to find in Vasanth a catalyst that always brings out the best in him -- he had, earlier, turned in a chilling performance in Aasai, the film Vasanth made for the Mani Rathnam banner.
Somehow, when you get done watching this film, what you are left with is a question in your mind. It is no secret that Vasanth is an ardent
K Balachander fan -- the director acknowledges KB as his guru and brings his name into any conversation at the drop of a cue.
Appu is made under KB's Kavithalaya banner -- and, while it was on the floors, there was talk of misunderstandings between Vasanth and his mentor.
You watch this film and you wonder -- what were those misunderstandings about? And were they, in some way, responsible for the lacklustre film Vasanth finally turned out?
Manufactured with high quality semiochemicals and constant release carriers, this attractant is species specific, residue free and effective for attracting targeted insects for more than 45 days in the fields, perfect for monitoring or mass trapping.
Ips subelongatus is capable of attacking both apparently healthy trees and stressed trees but they most frequently occur on trees that have been stressed by other factors such as wildfire or other pests. Repeat attacks by this species can affect the growth and rate of timber production, occasionally leading to dieback or death of a host tree. Characteristic symptoms of attack by Ips subelongatus include: sparse crowns of larch trees with partly dead tops and branches; wilting of needles; fading of foliage from green to yellow and finally to red; resin flow from entrance holes; the presence of small round exit holes, pitch tubes, reddish frass on the bark surface and a gallery system with central chamber and radical larval galleries under the bark (EPPO, 2005). As with other conifer bark beetle species, Ips subelongatus is a vector for blue-strain fungi which hastens the death of trees and discolors the wood resulting in loss of timber grade and value.
Pherobio Technology has been committed to developing, manufacturing and marketing high quality insect attractant for ips subelongatus/larch bark beetle for years, which is well-known as one of the largest professional manufacturers and suppliers. Our insect pheromone product comes in low price, easy operation and excellent performance. Now, take action to check the pricelist with us and try our customized service.

The primary goal and foremost aim of our company is to develop high standard, reliable and effective lifting instrumentation that complies with all the specifications and configurations imposed by industrial standards, regarding safety and quality while assembling, designing and selling. Throughout every manufacturing level, quality control effectively plays a major role. Our quality policy is divided into 3 stages, foremost being inspection of raw materials and other accessories, secondly, the middle stage where our quality auditors looks after employment of right and latest machinery that is being used to develop lifts, whereas the last and the most vital being final product inspection, in terms of specifications, design and custom made descriptions(if any), to ensure and deliver flawless product range to the client.
Every multistoried building be it a hospital, car parking complex or mall requires an effective transportation system, which is why the upright circulation is completely dependent upon Lifts that assist easy mobility between floors carrying staff, guests, luggage etc. To provide ease to the people to get technologically advanced and superior grade Lifts along with well-built Doors, Shine Elevator is supplying its offered range on time. Some major factors that tell why we are the best in the market are listed below:
A rally after the shooting of Jamar Clark on Nov. 15 had turned into an encampment at Fourth Precinct headquarters by Nov. 19.
Two women who say Minneapolis police officers hit them with nightsticks during a Nov. 18 clash between protesters and law enforcement at the Fourth Precinct police station are suing the city, alleging excessive use of force and violation of their free speech rights.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court last week, is the first to come out of protests that followed the death of Jamar Clark, who was shot by police Nov. 15. The lawsuit details a confrontation on one of the most tense nights of the 18-day encampment at the Fourth Precinct. Earlier that day, police had moved protesters who were camped in the police station entrance, and hundreds of demonstrators rallied outside the building.
One of the plaintiffs, Carrie Athanasselis, went to the precinct that night out of concern for her daughter’s safety, according to the complaint. She and her daughter, Camille Williams, were standing with about 10 protesters in an alley near the side entrance to the police station — away from the majority of protesters gathered at the main entrance.
Officers, who are not named in the lawsuit, asked them to move back, apparently so a van could pass, the complaint said. The van then stopped in the middle of the alley and officers began forcefully moving protesters, allegedly hitting Williams and Athanasselis in the face with nightsticks. The lawsuit also claims an officer grabbed a phone Williams was using to record the incident, threw it on the ground and hit it with a nightstick.
The lawsuit says the plaintiffs complied with orders to move, but the city responded in a subsequent legal filing that they did not. Joshua Williams, an attorney for Williams and Athanasselis, said the video recorded on the phone ends as the police force begins.
“The officers in this case said, ‘We need you to move,’ ” said Williams, who is not related to Camille Williams. “And my clients and the group were compliant. And for whatever reason, the cops decided that they weren’t moving fast enough, and decided to start pushing and beating them.”
Williams added: “From our perspective and we think from a constitutional standpoint as well, using any kind of force in this situation simply wasn’t justified. Let alone hitting my clients in the face with nightsticks and breaking their phone.”
A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, John Elder, said the department does not comment on ongoing litigation.
The city wrote in its initial legal response that it “denies that protesters complied with officers’ orders” and also denies an allegation that the van was purposefully positioned to block the view of the incident from other protesters and the media. The response also rejected the lawsuit’s assertion that the alley protest was peaceful, but did not elaborate.
“Plaintiffs’ injuries, if any, are caused by Plaintiffs’ unlawful, unreasonable, or illegal acts,” the city’s response said.
Clashes between protesters and police occurred elsewhere at the precinct that night. Police Chief Janeé Harteau said the following day that, while most protesters were peaceful, several threw bottles, rocks and large bricks. Police responded by firing special chalk rounds to mark suspects and deploying a chemical irritant.
“The case really isn’t about the physical injuries here,” he said. “It’s about police officers thinking that they can use excessive force with impunity.”
In addition to excessive force and battery, the lawsuit claims the officers violated First Amendment rights by retaliating against political speech. The suit seeks damages in excess of $50,000 — a standard clause in civil complaints.

A Home Equity Line of Credit, or HELOC, uses your home equity as collateral. A HELOC offers a line of credit from which you can draw as needed, as opposed to a typical home equity loan which gives you the entire amount of the loan up front. You can pull money from your line of credit during a specified “draw period” (usually between 5 and 25 years), paying back only the money you use plus interest.
When this draw period ends, you repay the loan’s principal either in one lump sum or according to a payment schedule. Since your home provides collateral for the loan, failure to honor a repayment agreement could result in foreclosure. Since the interest rate on a HELOC is tied to economic indexes such as the prime rate, it is variable and will change over the life of your loan.
May allow you to deduct the interest paid from your taxes, depending on your specific financial situation
Getting a HELOC is similar to getting a first mortgage, but less rigorous and time-consuming. However, you shouldn’t rush the research before signing on the dotted line. Consult with a variety of lenders to make sure you’re getting the lowest rates you can, being sure to compare the annual percentage rate (APR), which tells you the cost of credit on a yearly basis. While shopping around, make sure you also compare other associated loan expenses such as points and closing costs.
Also comes with easy to use step by step instructions so you can have your contour on point every time!

Today Ryan was working. He’s a junior in high school and based on that I’m guessing that he’s probably 16 or 17 years old. This is also his first job. We’ve chatted a few times before and he seems like a pretty good kid. He’s working to save up money to buy a car. He recognized me as soon as I walked in and asked me if I was going to get my usual Spicy B.M.T.
“Yeah, it’s right up there on the menu under ‘Local Favorites.'” as I pointed to the entry on the menu behind him.
So far things were going along pretty well although I did feel bad for him because just two weeks ago he had to explain to me that he didn’t know how to add points to my Subway card since they hadn’t trained him on it yet. Apparently the “training” they provided him was minimal at best.
“So first you put a couple of small ladles of marinara sauce on both sides of the bread. It’s over there by the vegetables in the bin with the lid on it.” I helpfully pointed out.
“Yep, that’s right. Now normally a Pizza Sub gets 12 pieces of pepperoni but I would like double meat so that’s 24 pieces all told.”
“Well my manager explained to me that for double meat, you should add half the original amount of meat so half of 12 is 6. So it should get 18 pieces of pepperoni total.”
“I’m not sure. But that’s just how my manager explained it to me. I was confused about it at first too.” Ryan helpfully offered.
“I mean if it’s called ‘double meat’ that would mean you get twice the amount of meat than a normal sub right?”
Something was obviously not registering with him. Now I know he is new, but this seemed like a pretty fundamental concept that I’m sure he will encounter more than once in life and it seemed unkind to not help him understand the math of doubling something.
“So if you were to have a hundred dollars and I told you that you could invest it with me and I would double your money- how much money should you expect to get back?” I asked.
“Exactly right. So how many pieces of pepperoni should I get if it normally comes with 12 and I want ‘double meat?'”
“Yeah, I see what you’re saying but that was just the way I was trained. But tell you what- since you’re a loyal customer, I’ll put 24 pieces of pepperoni on it.”
“Cool. Thanks.” I had reached the end of my explanation and I could tell that he still thought he was doing me a favor by giving me an extra 6 pieces of pepperoni.
So after all that conversation, the rest of the process of making the sub went fairly quickly. He added the shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the pepperoni and then popped it in the oven for a minute to heat it up.
“No, I’m good. If I could just get a little bit of oregano on top that would be perfect.” He added the oregano and then finished wrapping up my sandwich and took off his gloves as he moved to the register to ring me up.
“Oh yeah, sorry about that.” He then proceeded to fiddle with the register and added a charge for extra bacon and “double meat.”
“Oops. Sorry about that.” Ryan pressed a few more buttons on the register and finally it totaled the right amount.
“Cool. I know how to do that now.” Ryan seemed positively happy that he had at least one function of the register down.
I inserted my card into the reader and waited while it was approved. But something still bothered me. “So can I ask you a question?”
“On your menu behind you, there is a section about extras and there are two separate lines that seem confusing. One reads ‘Double Meat’ and the other says ‘Deluxe (50% More Meat)’ and it’s cheaper than the ‘Double Meat’ option. Do you think that maybe your manager got confused when they were training you?”
Is there a lesson to be learned from all this? Maybe our schools are doing a terrible job of educating our children. Maybe there is a stifling of independent thought at fast food restaurants. All I really know is that I can now understand why they call themselves “Sandwich Artists” and not “Sandwich Professors.” Artists don’t usually have to be good at math.
I can count on one hand the number of people that I would consider my closest friends. So it is with particular enthusiasm that I look forward to when I get to spend time with them. This year, our schedules happened to align just right so that one of the couples that my wife and I are closest to were able to spend time with us over the Thanksgiving weekend.
Working out even better than expected, they arrived just as most of our other guests were getting ready to leave and it provided a convenient excuse to usher out the stragglers. Plus there were heaps of leftovers so we didn’t have any great reason to leave the house which in turn left plenty of time for what I can only call “hanging out.”
Usually this entails the women talking about kids and the newest trends in fashion and decor while the other husband and I progressively get drunk and occasionally play video games. There are no pressing concerns, no particular rush to do anything really. The only real obligation is ensuring that their child doesn’t hurt himself and also goes to bed at a semi-reasonable hour. Other than that, plans are fluid.
So how do we spend our time? Mostly we talk, catching up on each other’s lives and recounting stories of the old days. It is this time that I think is the actual highlight of Thanksgiving for me. A time to relax with close friends after preparing for- and then hosting Thanksgiving dinner. While spending time with family can be fun, there is a certain relief when your relatives have gone back to their homes and you can truly just enjoy the time off from work in the company of good friends.
Another friend of mine is often fond of saying “just guys being dudes” when remarking on hanging out and while I generally question his wisdom in most other affairs of life, I do think this phase encapsulates something profound- even if he just invokes the phase when he’s about to say something particularly sexist or offensive.
There is a lot of happiness to be found in being able to talk about literally any topic with someone of the same gender that shares most of your views about the world. Need someone to vent to about your wife’s constant nagging about not cleaning the house enough? Check. Want to complain about your neighbor’s dog shitting in your yard again? Feel like grumbling about your job and how you think you’re being under-valued? Want to discuss the existence of God or maybe just the latest Marvel movie? Check. Check. Check. A good friend can fulfill all those roles and more.
They can also be honest with you and tell you when you’re off-base or getting too fat or generally being less than your best. That is the true value of a good friendship I think.
None of us live in this world in complete isolation. We all have areas where we can do better, be a better husband, wife, brother, sister, daughter, son- or maybe just a better person in general. A good friend helps knock off the rough edges that we all carry throughout life and bolster the good that’s already in you. They’re not afraid to tell you that you’re being unreasonable or completely agree with you that soccer is a totally ridiculous sport.
So “Cheers” to friends and friendship in general… I would pour a beer out but that would be a complete waste. Instead, I’ll drink the beer and think up of a strategy to finally beat said friend in Call of Duty. Now that would be something that I would truly be thankful for.
As promised, when I last left off, we were just getting to the fun parts of having family over for Thanksgiving. So in no particular order, here are a few of the many reasons that Thanksgiving will always be interesting when family is involved:
Someone in your family will show up late. In my family, it used to be my sister. But now that we have extended family from both my and my wife’s family, it’s a toss up to see who is going to arrive the latest. My dad and I have started to take bets on when the last person or family is going to show up. Usually the time ranges from just a few minutes late to “we’re already seated at the table before we hear the doorbell ring for the last time.”
Someone in your family will inevitably will start a conversation about guns or politics. This will leave the rest of the family in a conundrum as to whether they should engage said family member in what everyone initially hopes will be a productive, civilized discussion or whether they should ignore the bait and hope that someone else will artfully steer the conversation towards less polarizing discussions like maybe the mashed potatoes needing more salt.
Someone will probably make a “semi-racist” or homophobic comment. The handling of that comment largely depends on whether it might have been a thinly veiled attempt at humor or actually is a racist or homophobic comment. Either way, it will definitely make other people uncomfortable.
Someone totally misunderstands an argument or mishears a snippet of conversation and then unleashes a whole diatribe on why that person’s viewpoint is incorrect. Only after some heated discussion, is it ascertained that, in fact, both parties agree and there is no philosophical difference.
If your family is anything like mine, at some point someone will bring up sad memories of dead relatives who are no longer with us and will comment how the dinner is just not the same since Aunt Tillie passed and took her secret recipe of sweet potato casserole to the grave with her.
Usually someone will comment upon another guest’s dish or food offering and claim that when another relative used to make it, it tasted different. Not “bad” mind you, but “different.” This will lead to a whole discussion of recipes and ingredients and preparation methods that ultimately leads to one relative stating that maybe the secret ingredient was simply “love.”
Regardless of clearly set boundaries, someone will predictably be found in the normally off-limits rooms of your house. I’ll go upstairs to use my bathroom, only to find that the guest bedroom doors are now all mysteriously open. Or I’ll go downstairs to the basement to get some ice from the chest freezer only to discover several nieces and nephews going through every box in the place.
Normally, there will also be at least one instance where another adult will discipline or scold a child that is not their own for bad behavior only to be second-guessed by the child’s parents. Even if the offense was something pretty straightforward like running with a knife or trying to use scissors to cut the place mat, the offended parent will say that their child doesn’t normally do that and is probably just learning this behavior from one of their older cousins.
Someone will have done inexplicable things to your bathroom. Whether it be odd toothpaste stains on the mirror, or floating bits in the toilet bowl, often you will find yourself asking “what exactly were they doing in here?” Why would someone need to have partially eaten a granola bar in the bathroom and then casually toss the remains in the trash? Why are there 3 used hand towels now on the floor? All good mysteries.
And finally, what would family be without bringing up embarrassing memories of each other and airing them out for the rest of the family to be entertained? “Remember that time that you got drunk and pissed on Bobby’s motorcycle?” Or “that used to be our favorite game remember? We would dress you up and then put make-up on you and make you watch My Little Pony” Thanks Sis. I could have lived with not remembering that one.
Here is the second post in my series about Thanksgiving (Yes, I know it’s now past Christmas, but things have been hectic.)
As the saying goes, “You can pick your friends, but you can’t pick your family.” Never is this more abundantly apparent than on Thanksgiving- or any other major holiday for that matter. In our family, we have hosted Thanksgiving dinner for the last 4 or 5 years or so and while my wife and I have enjoyed hosting, it does give some interesting perspective on things.
First, the whole process of hosting starts well before that Thursday. Namely, there is the annual shopping trip to the grocery store to buy all the ingredients and food that is going to be served. Conversations need to be had to determine the exact menu and who will be cooking what casseroles, etc. Then an accurate headcount is needed to know how big of a turkey we should buy to ensure there is enough food for the traditional meal as well as the all-important leftovers.
In our family, this is usually where the confusion starts. “So exactly how many people will you be bringing to dinner?” I ask my sister.
“Well, that depends. We could have as many as 4 extra or they may not come at all. I’ll let you know soon though.”
Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but it does make a difference in terms of planning when I have to figure out if we need chairs and table space for 13 or perhaps up to 17 people. Then I start asking my wife about how many of her family are planning on attending. This leads to another whole conversation.
“So my brother and his family are coming. Actually, just his family since he has to work, but his wife and kids will be here. And my mom and dad and my other brother will be here as well- so that makes 6 from my side.”
Okay, so the attendance situation is mostly figured out. Now back to the menu. Since my wife is from Ethiopia, we can’t get by on just making the traditional Thanksgiving meal of turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, stuffing and deserts. No, in addition to all the American fare, we also have to have traditional Ethiopian dishes available as well. This itself is another whole process.
Luckily, I have been deemed unfit to cook any Ethiopian food by both my wife and mother-in-law. However, this does mean that starting a few days before Thanksgiving, my kitchen will be taken over so that they can start preparing their favorite Ethiopian cuisines. Did I say kitchen? I also meant my garage- since while my wife loves to make her ethnic food, apparently some of it is too pungent to cook in the house. So I get the additional job of setting up an electric burner in the garage so they can work their culinary magic.
So finally, the big day actually arrives. My dad, who came down a few days early and is staying with us, gets up around 6 AM and plants himself in front of the television. I get up at a more reasonable 8 AM to start preparing the turkey for cooking. My dad, politely offers to help. I flatly refuse. Mostly this is because his idea of cooking is that anything can be cooked and should be cooked using the microwave.
Now with everything prepared and as “ready” as it can be before family starts arriving, it’s the waiting game. And then finally, after what seems like eons, the doorbell rings and family and friends start to arrive. Time to kick things into high gear.
We start mashing the potatoes, finish cooking the stuffing and warm up the gravy. Then with a little fanfare and flourish, all the food is set out in serving dishes on the tables. Having won the plastic vs. real plates battle this year with my wife, we set out the “real” plates in a stack and heap the forks and knives into a pile next to them. Then after the Thanksgiving blessing has been said. It’s finally time to eat.
In our family, the order always starts with the oldest male. After that, it’s a toss-up between next eldest male or women with young children that need plates made up for them. Either way, I usually end up somewhere in the middle of the pack. I slowly make my way around the tables, taking reasonable sized portions of most the food laid out. I do admit that I often skip some of the Ethiopian dishes because they rarely agree with my stomach but I make an effort to get a representative sampling of both cultures’ cuisine.
Then when everyone finally finds a seat and most of the children are safely regulated to the kid’s table, the conversations begin. If your family is anything like mine, this is when things begin to get really interesting. So interesting in fact, that I’ll decided to include that part of Thanksgiving in a future post. Until then, I hope each and every one of you had a great Christmas and have a safe and Happy New Year!
I decided that I would break with my normal routine today and write a non-sequential blog about some things that are happening around the world that I think are interesting and noteworthy that all loosely deal with space. Don’t worry, I’ll still finish up my Thanksgiving series before Christmas- probably.
The United States is precipitously close to an all-out war with North Korea because two megalomaniacs have decided to have a pissing contest. Some experts theorize that North Korea has missiles that could possibly hit Hawaii in 20 minutes or even possibly strike the U.S. mainland itself. We should be a lot more concerned about this political situation than we are.
Some dude is attempting to launch himself 1800 feet into the sky on a homemade steam-powered rocket that he built out of spare parts to prove that the Earth is actually flat. I love the description of one of the photos that states Mike Hughes is a “daredevil and limousine driver“. Just imagine the conversations that you could have with that guy as he’s driving you around downtown in a fancy limo. And you thought Uber drivers were interesting people to talk to.
A startup company in Japan is trying to create artificial meteors- mostly for entertainment. The basic premise is to launch a satellite into orbit that will be able to launch pellets made of different metals into the lower atmosphere where they will burn up from fiction and create dazzling artificial multicolored shooting stars. Sure, there are some drawbacks, like it has the potential to cause a chain-reaction of collisions in space which could probably wipe out GPS and communication satellites, but you would have one hell of a party to remember.
Lastly, we are in the midst of some unique lunar events. Namely, starting today, we have the opportunity to witness a “supermoon trilogy” over the next couple of months. Basically the full moons for the next three months will look slightly bigger and be slightly brighter. Not like huge and super bright, but a little bit of a difference “that is barely perceptible to the human eye.” So news flash: It doesn’t really look that different. But take some time over the next couple of months and check out the moon anyways. It’s still kind of cool- even if it is over-hyped.
So another Thanksgiving Day is over. All your relatives and friends from out of town are safely on their way to their respective homes and the last of the leftovers are almost gone. Now it’s time to relax for one more day or maybe gear yourself up for another week of work. Oh well. The time off from work was nice while it lasted and I hope that your Thanksgiving Day was as good as mine. This post will be the first of a three-part series.
My dad has a saying that life’s all about the 3 F’s: “faith, family, and friends” so I thought what better way than to organize these posts into those 3 categories?
I’ll just come right out and say that I think I’m agnostic. While I was raised as a devout Baptist, recently I have been having some pretty serious doubts that the Bible is the inerrant, inspired “Word of God”.
For example, all those stories of Moses and the Israelites trekking through the wilderness led by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night just seem made-up. If the stories aren’t made-up, God would be still doing all that magical stuff to convince people that he actually exists today.
I mean if those tricks worked before to convince a whole people group to follow him, I would think that in our day if some supernatural skywriting that said “God Exists” inexplicably appeared in the sky every day for a year in different colors, God could gain a lot more converts than his current method of recruitment.
All that to say, I’m coming into a transitional phase in my life where I have to really start questioning if religion is going to be a large component of my life or not. So far I’ve worked out an agreement with my wife that I’ll go every other week to church and I mostly honor my side of the bargain, but around the holidays it feels especially amazing to be able to just sleep in on a Sunday and not have to worry about setting an alarm to wake you up.
What does this have to do with Thanksgiving you ask? Well for one, it’s awkward when every year you are volunteered to pray for the meal. What should I say- “I’m actually in between religious schools of thought at the moment, is there anyone else that would like to say the blessing?”
What makes it weirder is that my dad always loudly declares that I should say the blessing because I’m the “most holy.” I’m pretty sure that is his way of making sure that he doesn’t get chosen to say it. My alternative theory is that my dad just wants to get his money’s worth after paying for me to go to 4 years of college to only end-up with a bible degree.
I don’t want to make a big deal about saying the prayer though or cause a scene so I dutifully have everyone gather around the table and then have them hold hands while we bow our heads. Then I rattle off a perfunctory prayer that goes like this:
“Dear Heavenly Father. I thank you for this food and the hands that prepared it. I thank you that we can spend time together with family and friends. I thank you for your son Jesus Christ. Amen.”
Most people seem genuinely relieved when I’m done that I haven’t recited a decidedly long prayer or gotten super spiritual either. Although next year if I’m picked again, I might just start messing with people by praying for an excessively long time complete with long silent pauses or include as many big fancy ridiculous words as I can. Either that, or maybe see how many times I can work “meow” into the blessing like in Super Troopers.
I don’t want you to leave you with the impression that I am some type of anti-religious zealot now or that I’m ungrateful though. On the contrary, I have a great life and truly can’t number the amount things that I am thankful for.
But here’s a few: I have a beautiful wife that loves me unconditionally. I have a decent job that lets me pay our bills and own a house that I can be proud of. I never have to worry about where my next meal is going to come from. I am surrounded by friends and family that care deeply about me.
So overall, as much as I may not like it, I guess I’ll continue to make an exception once or twice a year to give the traditional holiday blessings. In my mind, I’ll just take those few moments to stop and think about how truly great and blessed my life really is.
So I begin by saying that I myself am right at the cusp of being a Millennial. And actually depending upon which source you reference, I might be a Millennial. What I can say definitively is that there are certain characteristics of this Millennial generation that I hate. So at the risk of jumping on my soapbox, here are some of the reasons that I hate (or secretly envy) Millennials.
They seem so fucking cool. Whether it’s the newest local pizza place or the coolest style of shoes, they intuitively know what is the hippest, trendiest “thing” and live for the moments when they can showcase this knowledge to those around them by casually introducing whatever the newest thing is into conversation. “You mean you haven’t heard of eel skin wallets? They are way more durable than leather and feel so much smoother.”
They understand credit card reward points and know how to use them. “You should really get the Bank of America Sapphire Preferred Platinum Freedom Unlimited Card” they say as they take the card out of their wallets to pay for their meal. “You get triple points if you use it at the race track or Target AND you can redeem your points for travel and free lap dances” they continue as they tap their metal credit card on the table for extra emphasis.
Millennials have a strange compulsion to give everyone nicknames- often nicknames that have only the faintest trail of logic. “Frank” becomes “Hotdog” which then becomes “Weiner” which in turn is changed into “Weines” which evolves into simply “W” which is then finally shortened into “Dubs.”
They live and breathe memes. Not a day goes by that they don’t try to introduce you to the hottest meme or internet video. Whether the meme has anything to do with the current conversation or you protest that you’re really not interested in seeing a cute kitten with a sock stuck on its head doesn’t matter. You will still be subjected to it anyways.
They claim they want to be fiscally independent but are all still on their parents’ cell phone plans. If you question why this is the case, they will inevitably tell you that it’s “more of a trade” since they pay for the family’s Netflix account.
Millennials as a rule are some of the most politically correct people that I meet- except when they’re making a joke to troll each other. Then all bets are off and some of the most sexist, racist and stereotypical comments can all be made as long as you say it ironically.
They are comfortable with paying an outrageous amount of rent for apartments in the hippest neighborhoods. Sure, you pay an extra $250 for parking a month and your friends have to pay to park in a garage when they visit, but at least there are 12 different bars in walking distance.
Conversely, when buying a house, Millennials love to refer to it as an investment property and spend months searching for a house “where the numbers work.” Sure the neighborhood might look like urban Detroit, but they are positive that the neighborhood is on the rise and that their return on investment is guaranteed.
Millennials are surprising cavalier about their romantic relationships. Whether they are dating for a few weeks or a few years, the relationship can always be broken off with minimal fuss and someone new can be found through Tinder or some other dating app.
And finally- and perhaps most annoying of all, Millennials are so damn optimistic. No matter what situation they are currently in, they earnestly believe that it will get better. They will get the promotion. They will achieve their dreams. They all believe that the world is their proverbial oyster. Ah, the uncrushable and enviable spirit of the young.

Under the name “Gebrüder Claas” (Claas Brothers), the firm became well known all around the world. So who were the company’s founding fathers, August, Bernhard, Franz and Theo, and what were they like?
Without the legendary knotter, the story of CLAAS would probably have taken a very different course. But what exactly is a knotter?
Join us on a journey through the past century – on the path leading from the knotter to today’s LEXION machines, the world’s most powerful combine harvester.
Experience the fascinating story of CLAAS at first hand. Join us on an exciting journey through the history of agricultural technology in the CLAAS company museum.

If there is one thing I have been most indecisive about since starting this blog is the layout and appearance. I am finding so very difficult to find the one layout and look that I am truly happy with. Maybe it's because littlebitsofnice doesn't have a direction, because it's a collection of random moments, thoughts, spaces, places, stuff, likes and...well...bits (of nice! *geeky giggle*).
Blogger is really good for that. It does give you freedom to do nearly everything you want in all aspects and parts of the blog from playing with the width, colours, fonts, sizes, all of it regardless of what original theme you start with. I just feel there is something missing but I can't figure out what that is exactly.
Wordpress, where littlebitsofnice has been "cloned"(I am still deciding where home will be), is different. The themes seem a lot more intricate and crisp (make sense?) but you can do a lot less with them and therefore I find it harder to find the theme that will be just right. Indeed very little modifications can be made and whatever extra you could do has to be paid for. True, it's not expensive, but I love to change things constantly, I get bored quite easily and I am still unsure where littlebitsofnice is heading...I am therefore a bit wary of buying those themes and/or extras and then think "hmmmm".
I thought about checking out other platforms but I made myself stop because it was just getting ridiculous. I can't have the same blog, as I have no interest in having more than 1, in 3 or 4 hosting sites. I have also been looking various other blogs that I read and enjoy, not only for their content but also for the way it looks and that therefore provides me with the full blogging experience (know what I mean?). Here are a few:
http://joannagoddard.blogspot.co.uk/ - She changed her layout recently. For this one I am actually not sure it it's the layout or the fact that I love her content so much.
http://abeautifulmess.typepad.com/ - my favourite - although I did like it when it was slightly "messier".
So here we are, theme change take 5, with a different theme for both littlebits Blogger and littlebits Wordpress, both very similar to each other.
What do you think? Better, worse, good, bad? Lost cause? Do you have any good tips on personalising your blog in either one of these sites? Do you have a "random" blog and if so how did you choose your look to reflect that?
It’s pretty cute…my daughter calls yoga “woga.” :) I love yoga and the difference that it has helped me to make in my life. Of course I have lapses like all normal people, but I do try to do it every week day. I used to try to save my yoga time for when the girls were asleep at night or during naps, but then I decided that I wanted to make it a more “public” part of my life for them. I was only putting it off till nap time because then I could have a more centered practice without four girls literally hanging off of me like a jungle-gym. :) But I decided it was worth the swap to make it more public to them, because I want yoga to be a part of their lives, too.
I feel deeply about caring for our bodies. I feel that they are marvellous gifts and that we are truly responsible for taking good care of them. They house our spirits and are deeply connected to them. At one point, I was trying to do “yoga time” as a structured activity that included them…sometimes they liked it, but sometimes they didn’t and would get frustrated as I would gently try to correct their little poses or tell them to keep going. One daughter began to push away and really didn’t want to do it anymore.
I felt somewhat discouraged, because I knew how good it would be for her. In pondering about it, what came to me is that children, and all of us, really, learn best by example, not by being pushed to do something. So I changed the way I did yoga time. Now, I just put on some calming music and start to do yoga in the middle of the living room. I don’t say anything, really, but a calm settles over the house, and often the girls are fascinated and quiet. I often comment to myself how much I like how this pose makes me feel good, or I try to remember to keep a pleasant smile on my face even when I’m trying to stand on my head. :) Usually, within a few minutes, the daughter that I was originally worried about will come and do yoga alongside me, trying to copy what I do. Often the other girls will join in, too, but even if they don’t, they usually dance or twirl to the music. All of us end up using our bodies in good ways without me having to push at all. The key is that the example is established!
It makes me think about other aspects of parenting…of course there is a certain level of expectation that we should have for our children and what they should and should not be doing. But truly, our own examples are the loudest teacher! If we tell them to stop yelling at each other, but we yell at them, what are they learning? If we tell them to pray, but we do not pray, what do they think? They will be more likely to want to do it themselves if they see us doing it cheerfully. :)
I must have the mentality of one of our children…I’ve started doing woga w/ you too, only after you start doing it :o)I Love you!
I love woga! What a fun family activity. I wish we could come over and join you!By the way- I keep forgetting to mention this, but thank you SO much for sending your yoga videos! It was such a pleasant surprise getting them in the mail. You are wonderful and I love your videos!!

In my work with clients putting estate plans in place, determining their future expenses can be devilishly difficult.
We have to consider and plan for a wide range of life possibilities, estimating the costs of those scenarios and measuring them against the client’s resources.
The tricky part comes from planning for contingencies around surprises and other unknown variables. Will my client live a long life free of illness and disease? Or will they come down with a life-threatening illness early in their retirement years? Similarly, how should an estate plan be structured to deal with such unknowns?
For such situations, we call on experts to assist us with the financial vagaries of the future. At Generation Law, we work with Lifecare Innovations. They run a Cost Projection and develop a spreadsheet analysis of possible client needs over time and the probable cost of those needs.
With their analysis in hand, we then work with our client to ensure that their resources are well structured allowing for all possible contingencies.
Of course part of the planning process includes putting powers of attorney and strategic directives in place to ensure that the wishes of the client for any care are executed to their specifications, taking such potentially problematic issues out of the hands of well-meaning family members.

Furthermore, recent legislation such as the Dual Citizenship Act highlight the link between emigration and the legal aspects of our lives. Also, to complement the information within this section, one needs also take a look at the genealogy of the Maltese surnames and the transport/trade realities which Malta faces.

The first time I saw Sisterlocks in 1994, I was AMAZED. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at. Once I was told they were permanent, I backed off. I was not ready to give up my wonderful weaves permanently. I had a serious case of OPH (other peoples hair). I decided to take the class so that I could service a few clients that were considering locks. In February 2006, I was off to Oakland to learn everything I needed to know to become a Sisterlock Consultant. That's when it bit me, the Sisterlock bug. In that instant, I had to have them, not only did I have to have them but I wanted every sister that I knew to have them. I locked 3 clients within 3 weeks, my 4th and 5th clients came 2 weeks later. I finally received my locks on 4/27/06, which led to 3 more clients. By my 3rd month lock anniversary, I was locking and loading. Having my locks, and for the first time in my life and wearing my hair short and natural. Any questions, comments, or chit-chat that you might have, drop me an email and I'll answer them time permitting.

The new iPhone is out but I don’t even have a slightest desire to get a new one. Even after NTT Docomo now also starts offering the new iPhone. Although I’m excited that iPhone is finally available on NTT Docomo but I think am going to wait until the next iPhone 6 is out. I’m using iPhone 5 now and pretty happy with it.
I’m going to wait at least until my 2-year contract with Softbank ended next year around fall. That reminds me that I do still have my Docomo phone but I don’t use it as much as I use my Softbank phone. I only use my docomo keitai phone for emergency calls since their signal is FAR better than Softbank one.
I must say Softbank signal sucks! I hate it but what can I say about 5 years ago I wanted to get the iPhone but it was not available on NTT Docomo, yet. So I decided to give it a try without cancelling my contract with NTT Docomo. Now I don’t have to wait anymore but I’m not interested on getting the iPhone 5s. I’m going to wait until the iPhone 6 is out. From my experience upgrading from iPhone 3 to 4 and 4 to 5, upgrading from 5 to 6 will be quite worth it.
Anyway, talk about the new iOS 7. I confess that I’m not really fond of the new iOS 7. The flat design is not for me or maybe I’m just not used to it, yet. And another one, the green icon colour is ANNOYING. I wish there’s a way to switch the icon. Just don’t like the bright green at all, why not use darker green instead of the bright one. It hurts my eyes sometimes.
Enough about the design, one thing I like from new iOS7 would be the Photo section. It’s really nice and easier to use. I like that now I can finally brows the videos folder. Photo and video section is more organized, I LOVE it. I also like the camera application. It’s a nice improvement.
So far I only updated my iPhone 5 with the iOS 7. I’m not ready yet to update my daughter’s iPad, I’m worry that she might complain just like she complained her YouTube app being taken away back then.
I’m not talking about adult’s complain, I’m talking about pre-schooler which cost me ¥30000 yen just to fix the iPad screen because she was too UPSET that her YouTube was gone and she threw away the iPad until it hit something and the screen cracked!
I have so many interest that I can hardly list them :p Outgoing, loving and love shopping especially sales month. I like summer and love Autumn so much.

Now this is the commandment—the statutes and the ordinances—that the Lord your God charged me to teach you to observe in the land that you are about to cross into and occupy, 2so that you and your children and your children’s children may fear the Lord your God all the days of your life, and keep all his decrees and his commandments that I am commanding you, so that your days may be long. 3Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe them diligently, so that it may go well with you, and so that you may multiply greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has promised you.
4 Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. 5You shall love theLord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 6Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. 7Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.8Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead, 9and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
12take care that you do not forget the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery… (Deuteronomy 6)
Keep, then, this entire commandment that I am commanding you today, so that you may have strength to go in and occupy the land that you are crossing over to occupy, 9and so that you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your ancestors to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey… (Deuteronomy 11)
28One of the scribes came near and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, he asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ 29Jesus answered, ‘The first is, “Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; 30you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.” 31The second is this, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” There is no other commandment greater than these.’ 32Then the scribe said to him, ‘You are right, Teacher; you have truly said that “he is one, and besides him there is no other”; 33and “to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength”, and “to love one’s neighbour as oneself”,—this is much more important than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.’ 34When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’ After that no one dared to ask him any question.
[This] is a point that has been made many, many times. We all have a hermeneutic. We are all interpreting the text to some degree. We are all privileging--deferring to--certain values, doctrines, creedal commitments, traditions, or biblical texts. Something somewhere is trumping something else. In a document as multivocal as the Old and New Testament this is unavoidable.
So we all have a hermeneutic. The only question is whether you are consciously vs. unconsciously using a hermeneutic.
The deepest arguments I've observed in church come down to this. There are times when self-interest, winning for its own sake, holding the power, and so on, have largely been eliminated. Or, at least, we have seen them clearly and have them under control. But something else has meant an irreconcilable difference has persisted. In our hearts we have felt of each other: "you know neither the scriptures nor the power of God… you are quite wrong." (Mark 12:24-27) And sometimes we have said as much to each other.
The text this week describes the fundamental difference in hermeneutic between Jesus and his opponents. Mark takes good care to list all Jesus' opponents in Chapters 11 and 12: "the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders," (11:27) the "Pharisees and Herodians," (12:13) and the Sadducees. (12:18) Although "the whole crowd was spellbound by his teaching," (Mark 11:18) he was attacked by the entire religious establishment.
But there is one scribe who is not listed among them. Through him, Mark makes sure to remind us what is at stake, for Jesus tells this scribe, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."
We have come to the centre of the gospel and its hermeneutic, for Jesus' first words in this gospel are, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news." (Mark 1:15) And here, talking with this scribe? We are "not far from the Kingdom of God." It has indeed come near.
In one sense, Jesus is no revolutionary in this text. Both he and the scribe lay out their understanding of what is most important, by quoting Scripture.
Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. 5You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. 6Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. 7Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.8Bind them as a sign on your hand, fix them as an emblem on your forehead, 9and write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord. (19:18)
And the scribe makes it clear. In a clever rhetorical strategy, Jesus' hermeneutic is validated by one listed among his opponents:
“to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength”, and “to love one’s neighbour as oneself”,—this is much more important than all whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices.
It is this understanding which has brought the scribe "not far" from the kingdom of God and wins Jesus' approval.
Even this hermeneutical hinge is not new. Hosea 6:6 has already said, "‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice." Micah 6:8 has already said, "the Lord require[s] of you… to do justice, and to love kindness..." What everything swings on, and what kills Jesus, is his agreement with the scribe, his absolute committment to privileging love:
… by citing the second command, Jesus is making a profound theological move which seriously defines the first command and reveals his theology. The God to be obeyed is the God of love and compassion and, by implication, that understanding will determine what loving God and keeping God’s commandments means. There is no room for a tension or opposition between the two, no divided loyalties. Where love and law conflict, law gives way, or, better, love always goes beyond and, in that sense, fulfils the law. It controls law and not vice versa.
In the gospel of John, (John 7:53 – 8:11) the hermeneutic of the scribes and Pharisees who bring the woman to Jesus, privileges Law. The Law says the woman must be stoned. Love is not part of the equation. The woman is reduced to a test of Jesus' holiness before God; she is dehumanised.
Jesus is all Love. He does not condemn. It is almost as an afterthought that he says, "Go and sin no more."
What hermeneutic drives us as we meet our neighbour in need? When we meet this woman, do we even see her as neighbour, or as someone in need? So often, I think, we want to get people right with God, (according to our definitions of right,) whilst ignoring their need: Do the right thing, and then we will help you.
Jesus' approach simply asks, "What do you need?" And then, and only then, "You know, if you change the way you live (repent) you will find you are much closer, and much more open, to the God who wishes only to bless you that you may live long in the land."
I began this post with Richard Beck's assertion that we all have a hermeneutic. Beck suggested "a fundamentalist is a person who thinks he doesn't have a hermeneutic."
What is interesting to me in this phenomenon is not that we are all engaging in hermeneutics, acts of interpretation. That is a given. What is interesting to me is how self-awareness, or the lack thereof, is implicated in all this.
Basically, fundamentalism--denying that you are engaged in hermeneutics--betrays a shocking lack of self-awareness, an inability to notice the way your mind and emotions are working in the background and beneath the surface.
I think statements like "this is the clear teaching of Scripture" are psychologically diagnostic. Statements like these reveal something about yourself. Namely, that you lack a certain degree of self-awareness…
[What is at] issue… [is]… emotional intelligence, the degree to which you are reading the bible with a degree of self-awareness.
This emotional intelligence goes beyond interpretation. It affects how we relate to our neighbour. It determines who we see as neighbour. It affects how we love God. It is the measure of our conversion.
Emotional intelligence— emotional maturity, indeed— will determine how free we are to abandon the safety and certainty of rules, and step into the uncertain realm of love, where there are no boundaries on our responsibility, and no points at which we can limit love. It is to enter the realm of Spirit not far from the Kingdom of God. In a sense, this maturity, this conversion, ceases to be a hermeneutic, and becomes a way of being. It is who we are— or not.
What do we privilege? Do we place law over love and compassion, or love and compassion over Law? Our behaviour is psychologically diagnostic. It measures our conversion to the way of the Kingdom of God. It questions our emotional maturity. But in the gentleness of God, Jesus never condemns us. He says, "You know, if you change the way you live, (repent) you will find you are much closer, and much more open, to the God who wishes only to bless you that you may live long in the land."

Thank you for the insight especially the notion of being self aware and how we our own agendas, emotional intelligence, and compassion interplay. Very Zen like and Christ like.
My comments have to do with the practice of what you teach, which I hope is not unfair here. In my experience, agreeing with you does not free me to actually do what Jesus calls for. For me, it is difficult to be free to love over law, for I even make “love over law” a law. My own need for some Archimedean place from which to judge others, some “secure” place other than the Holy Spirit is strong. I even immediately leap to self-satisfaction over my agreement with you. I find I must often be in prayer and self-examination in order to be able to put certain people above my law, and am frequently in the position of asking forgiveness, even from those I judge to be off base, because my actions toward them did not come from a place of compassion, but from my “better law.” I live in the South of the United States and experience that it very easy NOT to have compassion for certain folks, for instance, Confederate flag fliers and those who obviously are proud to be in the lineage of white privilege, most particularly the ones who are vocal about being “Christian,” even though they need to be delivered from their fears and hatreds. There are many competing Jesuses and few seem to be based on a hermeneutic that has any degree of self-awareness. For me, your focus is an ongoing work, which adds to the “problem,” for if I did not have such a hermeneutic of suspicion about myself, it would be much less effort and I could be so much quicker and more satisfied bringing swift and righteous judgment to or about certain others. In all honesty, I do hate having to give that up and do so by degrees!
Thank you Chad. A valuable comment! Practice is long and slow! I do find it begins to heal me, perhaps most of all by increasing "my hermeneutic of suspicion about myself!"

The concept of data mining and profiting off that data mining isn't anything new. And while some companies engage in some rather disreputable practices to do this, Global Test Market seems to be doing just fine with the whole “consent to disclose” thing. More importantly, in some cases this may help you as some companies will offer to do more specialized product testing once they've identified you as their target demographic.
Sometimes survey invitation links direct you to other survey companies, rather than keeping things in-house, which can feel a bit like spam. As is common in the industry, you can sometimes get stuck filling out lengthy qualifying questions which take up to 30 minutes just to see if you’re eligible for a survey. Needless to say if you find out you are not then this is extremely frustrating.
While it might be hard to believe at first, American Consumer Opinion will pay you real, actual money to share your opinions and complete online surveys. Once you join their online opinion panel, you’ll be asked to offer opinions on new products you have tried, test out new advertising campaigns, and tell companies what you think of their marketing techniques and slogans.
Rewards vary based on the survey type and the company conducting the survey. You may get paid online through PayPal or a Visa gift card, or get free products so that you can try them and provide feedback. To get the best out of online surveys, it is recommended you join several websites (10 to 20) so as to give you sufficient invitations daily at the best time frame. Regularly check your email and be honest while giving your opinion. Don’t give up if you don’t get selected for a survey after the first screening process, as it will take a while before you get selected based on your demographic.
One nice feature is the ability to shop through Vindale, as they often have offers available through affiliate links. Before buying something new, like an appliance, it is worth signing into their easy to use website and checking if you can get it for less through Vindale. There’s also a popular daily consumer survey paying $1.50 which you can complete every day, for an easy and reliable boost.
Each of their surveys you complete will be worth between 100-5,000 points depending on the length and subject. There are a variety of different topics to cover like consumer goods, healthcare and travel, just to name a few. Once you reach 3,000 points you can start redeeming rewards. You have to call and redeem points over the phone, and it typically takes a month for the rewards to reach you.
CashCrate gives you the opportunity to make extra money by watching advertising videos and you can win prizes by playing games and contest on the site. A particularly good feature is its generous referral program, which is head and shoulders above much of the industry. If you refer your friend, you’ll get 20 percent of their earnings! If that referred friend refers someone else, you will also earn another 10 percent of what that person earns. It’s in your interest then to sign up, sign your friends up and get them to work to make you some extra money from surveys.
It’s a very well-known scam. You cash the check, then they ask you to either wire some of that money back to them as some sort of fee or buy something for them and send the item to them. So, you deposit the check, then wire some cash to them thinking that the check you just deposited will cover that. A few days later, after you already send them the money, the check will bounce and the money you send to them will come out of your own account.
In addition to filling out online surveys for money, you can get rewarded for other actions, too. Some of the best paid survey sites are ones that offer lots of ways to make extra money other than earning money for surveys you take! The most popular websites maintain their following not only by offering various types of incentives but also by providing plenty of different and engaging ways for members to earn money. The purpose of these offers is to turn you into a loyal and active member of their community.
Amazon gift cards and PayPal are obviously popular choices, so naturally like most sites MySurvey had those. These guys did not stop there though. At the time of writing (I double checked) they also offer various sweepstakes, gift cards to restaurants, you can donate to charities like UNICEF through them, they have iTune gift cards, their very own merchandising products and also Starbucks, Walmart and Tango gift cards among many more options!
And lastly, let's discuss privacy. In some ways, Pinecone Research gets it right – they use the information to verify you are not a duplicate or in any way defrauding them out of a valuable opinion. After that, they only use your personal information for developing metrics and usage statistics – not giving it out to every third party that comes along. More importantly, they take consumer information privacy seriously. When they compile their reports for their clients, they scrub all data of any identifying information.
By only sending you questionnaires you are already qualified for, Pinecone wastes far less of your time than many sites which require you to fill our qualifying questions before starting each survey. However some users have said they don’t receive very many surveys, which could be a consequence of their careful filtering. Equally the site retains the right to remove you from their panel if you no longer fit their desired demographic, so make the most of your membership while you have it!
Pinecone asks for your address because your first payout is sent via check to your address. After a few surveys they offer you a paypal option. As far as sending products to test, these are related to the survey you take. I have been with them for a year and they have only sent a few things for me to try out. In the survey, they ask if you would mine trying the product and you can decline. Pinecone is a great company to do surveys with. I highly recommened them!
If longevity is a sign of quality, and let’s face it in the world of business it usually is, then there’s no doubt about Zoombucks deserving to be inside out 2018 paid survey sites top 20. This company has been carrying out paid survey panels since 1946, so just think how many consumers they’ve helped since then. Things have changed since the forties, so you won’t have to sit in a draughty hall, you can answer all the surveys over the internet. There’s lots of surveys to choose from as well, and they promise quick pay outs.
Everyone has an opinion, well now Opinion Plus will convert your opinion into cash in your pocket thanks to its intuitive and easy to use paid survey site. It scores highly because the surveys are tailored to each individual user, and yet they still send regular invites so you won’t be waiting around for something to do or, even worse, filling in surveys that you aren’t eligible for and won’t get paid for. They send payments via PayPal only, but their payout rate is among the best that we’ve seen.
A well known survey panel, Valued Opinions is owned by leading market research company ResearchNow and is open to people in more than 20 countries around the world, including the USA, UK and Australia. The site uses a range of different languages and has around three million members busily filling in surveys and questionnaires. Most surveys taken will reward you between $1 and $5 and take up to around 20 minutes to complete, asking you about marketing, brands and products and even news events. There is a steady rate of invites to surveys, but you won’t always be qualified for them, which can become tiresome.
I have been using Survey Savvy for almost 2 years and for a while they were paying out pretty good for access to my e-mails and junk mail. Recently I had problems with them and some (not very bright) account manager that could never tell me if my pc was hooked up. I realized it wasn’t when no money was going to my account. I’ll stick to the $1 surveys for now. Opinion Outpost and My survey have been pretty good. I close out of the site if I am disqualified for 4 surveys in a row. But I just cashed out Opin Outpost for $60 and I am almost up to $50 on My Survey. It takes me about 2 months to earn these.
5. Global Test Market Panel – (Available for 14+ USA, UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, Singapore and France residents only): Global Test Market survey panel is one of the largest market research panel.

Unlike some of the other sites, with Inbox Dollar, you essentially sign up to take advantage of whatever Inbox Dollar makes from their advertisers.  They will send you emails which they get paid per receipt of you reading them or clicking a link.  In turn, they give you a cut.  Not to ruin your day but it's a rather small cut.  The links that end up paying out the most usually have some stipulations attached – such as signing up for a service.  This can end up being a lot more hassle than its worth and we recommend you pay VERY close attention to the stipulations.
As the technological and cultural landscapes change in the coming years, getting paid to complete online surveys may be one of the easiest and most rewarding opportunities presented to you, a consumer, in the digital age. If you want to get cash for taking surveys that will help your favourite brands meet your needs better, register at OpinionWorld and get started right away - there is nothing to lose.
You won't get rich doing these things but it's legitimate and you'll get paid in the end. For example, you get a penny for each email you click. You get a penny for a video stream. You can earn dollars for fulfilling offers but those aren't nearly as quick as reading an email. They are upfront in what you get paid so you can decide if it's worth it.
The surveys are based in target demographics. You DO get kicked out of slit of them. If you are 25-40 with a kid in a house and white you will find more of them want your opinion more than the next person. This is the target group. So people who make real money at this fall into that group naturally and do not know why the rest if us can’t make money doing this.
There have been some reports of technical glitches on the site preventing users from receiving their earnings, but customers services are contactable and said to clear up most issues for workers. Valued Opinions has a unique “badge” program, allowing its most active members to work up five levels of achievement from bronze through silver, gold and platinum to the top tier of diamond, by carrying out extra mini tasks.

For now, view it as a support tool and not as an alternative to personal interaction.
That is why we actually had people order leads, and we called them. We called more than one bunch of leads as well. This at least would give us a feeling of consistency or lack of it. The MLM Lead companies we chose were highly consistent in quality of lead, and people who truly were looking for a business. It took us 7 months to complete the research on MLM leads.
How do you choose mlm leads that are genuinely interested in starting a home business, just like you? Where can you find an mlm lead generation company that takes you and your business seriously—one that actually cares about your success whether you are a leader with 50,000 people in your team or just starting out? You've come to the right place—a place where we make it easy.

I am a Network Marketer myself and I think I have seen more than enough in this industry. I have struggled and experienced all the pain in getting the right people to join my business or buy my products. I've spent a lot of money on getting leads, buying solo ads, buying this and buying that just to grow my business. But I came to realize it, all doesn't work... the tendency is, you can buy leads but how many people have the same list of leads as yours? Now, have you experienced calling bought leads? - I DID! Nobody ever answered me. It was very difficult I must say.
Business Presentation – Once the prospect completes your lead capture page webform and hits the “submit” button, their browser should be redirected to your business presentation. That way they’re getting all the information about your business right away even before you talk to them. That makes your prospecting job easier when you contact them because they’ve ideally already viewed the information. The URL of the business presentation is typically programmed into the lead capture page webform.
Biz Opp Leads are leads that we have captured when people fill out a form through a number of home business lead websites.

Call us right now so you can start making the contacts you need for success.

In private video training, Vince says if you want to grow your a thriving business, start or grow your current business, get you books sold, or get more clients for your speaking or coaching business, then you are in the right place at the right time. No longer do you need to do 1-one-1 recruiting, make phone calls from home all day (personal calls), home events hotel events, three-way calls, or learn to use the internet via Social Media and YouTube. You can do social media yourself, but why not leverage your time and effort to give yourself more personal time freedom. With a system like this you will never run out of customers and prospects. At 30 years old, Vince lives in a nice home on a golf course. works out of home, and is always with his family. He’s been working similar businesses now full time for 7 years, since age 23. What do we sell? We sell the number one thing that everyone on planet earth needs, website visitors. If you don’t have visitors, you don’t have a business. We sell traffic.
You need a stream of high-quality prospects that are searching for a home business opportunity and here’s what Luciano has done. I know he sounds like a member of the Italian mafia but I always love to talk to him because he’s so passionate about his business and work. I’m very careful about buying leads or that industry because it can go downhill fast. I only share this because I’ve worked with Luciano on a project and trust him.
The database should provide information about businesses and individuals who have willingly offered their personal information through telephone interviews and opt-in Internet forms. Because of this, you know that the opportunity seeker email leads that you will receive are open to the business opportunities that you will be offering them and will not be annoyed when you call them with your proposal.

Since I had only ten weeks to complete it, I used after effects. THE OTHER EDEN is my first paperless movie; and I thank Professor Chris Jackson for helping me learn this excellent program.
I wanted to do something like Frederic Back's CRAC! which was rendered beautifully in pencil, and I think that the shot with the polar bears comes closest to the look. I can only wish that I could do a film that is as amazing as Back's work, but this is sufficient for what turned out to be eight weeks' work. The "pencil" rendering was actually done with the program's 'hair' filters, put in 3D, rotating at high speed in different directions. And I used Photoshop to create all the original artwork. Though it is flat artwork most of it is actually working in the third dimension.
Chris Jackson said that I was using the program in a manner that hadn't been originally intended, and that this was a good thing.
AE is a vast improvement over FLASH; it is even better now in the new edition (you can make 3D jointed puppets.)
Thanks, idragosani. I wanted something funereal, with 'hymn' overtones; luckily for me the Unique Tracks site had a nice recording ofBizet's L'ARLESIENNE for sale. I edited out the slower sections with Audacity and just used three repetitions of the theme.
I grew up 'with an orchestra' since my father was a professional musician, and I was exposed to all types of music at a very early age. This definitely has helped me as an animator.
Beautiful film Nancy. As for "L'Arlesienne" de Bizet, it threw me back to elementary school, with my teachers from France who turned this music into a Christmas song about the 3 wise men. We had to sing it at Christmas every year. And for some reason, they had these wise men travel by train to see the newborn savior...all it needed was a disco beat.
Another question about this subject.Now you mention Flash and AE.If I want to do full animation 2D.Which one is more easy to operate?
and "The way of the Mantis",I was astonish for the effects on this last animation(It was AE or Flash?)
THE WAY OF THE MANTIS was a senior project created by two of my RIT students, Jed Mitchell and Joe Daniels. It is done in MAYA. Joe and Jed made a plug in that allowed Joe's brush work to follow the movements of the computer generated figure. It's something like the effect in the "Lorenzo" short that Disney did a while back, only the two students spent about $500.00 on their version!
Thanks, Jean. I never knew what to make of this film, since I produced it so quickly. I think that the online exposure is the best place for it, since it only was accepted into two film festivals out of the ten I sent it to (including the late Ottawa festival)
Oddly enough it did not even get into an enviro fest in Toronto. Possibly because it did not have a happy ending?
Funny, as I watched it I thought it was like watching a dream...and then you announced it as a nightmare at the end! Lovely what you can do with AE, can that be combined with traditional 2D?
Is there anything about you that your future partner would want to know before becoming involved with you?
You'll find that TMA's women clients are above average in attractiveness. Many of them are truly beautiful.

Whether you’re an Eagles or Patriots fan, this past Super Bowl Sunday was the best time to grab a great bowl of chili at Bear Trap’s 1st Annual Chili Cook-Off.
Bear Trap member Lyle Hohnstine introduced the cook-off to management and once they received the ball, they ran with it. “It was a great idea and he really helped generate interest throughout the football season,” said Manager Bob Webster.
“We couldn’t have pulled this off without our membership and event manager, Suzette Noecker, who promoted this event, sending out e-mails and posting information on the Internet,” said Webster. “She even helped come up with names for some of the chilis.”
“This event was great because it started a rivalry,” said Noecker. “Contestants not only wanted to have the best chili but they wanted to have the most creative names as well.”
Twelve contestants entered the arena to submit their masterpieces for the contest, but only one could say they had the best Super Bowl chili.
Michael Middleton, the first Bear Trap chili cook-off champion, wasn’t shy in divulging his secrets to a great chili.
“My theory is that it takes at least two days to prepare and cook the chili,” said Middleton. “As far as a secret ingredient, I like to use Middleton’s chili mix.”
“I like to cook the chili first and then let it cool overnight,” said Middleton. “Then I like to cook it once more, which is really nothing more than a re-heat.”
With all the preparation that goes into a competitive chili cook-off, the reward seems to be well worth it. “This was my first chili cook-off and I have to say it was a lot of fun,” said Middleton.
The cook-off was determined at halftime by the restaurant chef’s and by popular support. Out of 20 overall points possible, no chili scored over 14, and no one scored less than 11 — making the cook-off almost too close to call.
“It was hard to pick a winner because they were all great, but I’m partial to Texas-style chili, so that’s how I voted,” said Bear Trap bartender Brendan Ambrose.
Every chili was great, but their names were even more interesting, and somewhere downright entertaining. One chili, When My Husband Still Had Hair, was particularly intriguing because, at first glance, one couldn’t figure out why it was named that.
It was soon after that it was explained that it was a really hot chili — a humorous jab at her spouse.
Julie Schroek placed second with her unorthodox “No Beans About It,” which of course didn’t have any beans, winning a tall bottle of Tabasco. Elspeth Hohnstine pulled down a third-place finish with her sweet “It should’ve been Pittsburgh” chili, winning a grab bag of goodies. Ronan O’Brian grabbed 4th place for “Grin and Bear It.”
“Everyone had such a good time that I’m sure we’ll do it again. Maybe we’ll have a March Madness chili cook-off,” said Webster.
Physically, you are the farthest person for me, but in my heart, you are the closest person. When will we create another amazing holiday together? The awareness of being loved and respected warms my heart. I want to destroy it by making jokes on you! Our friendship is genuine and strong. Come back to me so that I can be complete again.

Good shootin' Frank, and thanks Chad, shot as called, not bad. Y'all have a great day and take care!
I did the walk up and was a little off, but I will take it. anything on the bale of hay will be fine with me, because the swamp behind my target has put my range under water, so any arrows that miss the bale won't be found in the four feet of water.
Shot as called,,Jet Warthog 50#/28",,,same ole same ole arrows 25yrds is angled,,20-15yrds were to close to matter
20 is an inch left and 25 and 15 are 3 inches high and together. Thanks CD and y'all have a great day.
I think I'm finally beginning to gel with this 55' Grizzly. I'm a hunter and not a target shooter so if I can consistently keep this up I'll be plum tickled when season gets here. I always strive to get better but consistentcy in the kill suits me fine. Left to right, 15, 20 and 25. Great day to everyone!
Sorry to stink up such a fine string of good shooting. My 25 yard FS was high left. The 20 was left and a little lower. The 15 was high and still left of my POA. Consistently bad today. My release and follow through were bad on the 25 and my aggravation affected the next 2. Hopefully tomorrow will go better.
I could not post my picture. Just as well. I was shooting my deer target and the FS was on the lower neck and the other two were on the shoulder. 4” apart at the greatest gap.
Can’t post photos again. Maybe next time. 25 was 5” left 20 was 5” right and 15 hit the mark. Thanks CD.
Rushed home and barely made it in time to shoot before dark. Got the shot in, typed a novella and posted just to find out that the crack I’m hooked on WON’T LET ME POST A PIC! DAMN!!! Just what is there to look forward to. I know I don’t pay for this but DAMN!!!!

I had my birthday bash at Monkey Business, Hampstead on above date. We had an absolutely fabulous night! Martin is a wonderful host and MC and kept the pace going throughout the evening. The acts were diverse but all hilarious in their own way. The intimate setting acts in its favour as it feels like its all happening in your own living room! Even the little bit of 'admin' that played out added to the humour!!I highly recommend Monkey Business for any kind of event; you are guaranteed a great night out!!Thanks also to Martin for getting everyone to sing happy birthday to me...truly personal touch. I will be back for sure! Pav Sent Monday 8 May 2017

I am (sadly) back in the US now, having just returned from my trip. I just wanted to tell you again what a wonderful time I had at your comedy club last Saturday night. I saw a lot of comedy over the course of my week there, and your club had some of the best performers I saw, truly. You made me feel welcome, you were a great emcee, and I really appreciated you taking the time to speak with me. I hope I may stay in touch with you, and I will certainly thank you in my dissertation. I really had a blast with you and it was definitely one of the highlights of my trip. At some point, I may want to interview you by email - would you be open to this? Regardless, thank you so much, again. It was wonderful meeting you - you're incredibly charming. :)

Hi Martin ,Very well done for getting Omid Djilli who was so funny and brilliant , and the other acts were also great .
Hello Martin.We had a great day from start to finish.Loved getting involved. Magda filmed my part in it and we couldn't stop laughing. He was great and so were all the other acts. We'll definitely be back and hopefully with a small army. Wasn't what we were expecting. Was a nice touch that you meeted and greeted every one on the way in, made it more personal and got every one involved. Great meeting you mate and we'll be seeing you again soon!Do widzenia Craig Watson Sunday 26 June 2016
Dear Martin, thankyou for an absolutely amazing evening. I still can't believe that I got to see the No Frills Twins, and meet them . . . And sing with Vanessa on Aran's beautiful guitar!! It was a truly memorable evening where one of my biggest dreams came true, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart for making it possible!
Hi Martin,Thanks for your email. The opening night was amazing experience and such wonderful quality of live comedy. Simple feedback 'Great comedy evening'.I look forward to attending more events organised by you and Monkey Business Comedy Club. As I won two tickets in the draw at the end, I would like to make my next visit soon. Can you kindly suggest how do we get those tickets and next set of gigs?Looking forward to hear from you. Regards,Pooja sent Tuesday 8 March 2016
Dear Martin,My brother and I visited your comedy club yesterday and absolutely loved it!Unfortunately we forgot all of the names, so I was wondering if you wouldcare to e-mail them to me? And if I ever find myself in London again, I willbe sure to swing by one of the venues.Kind regards,Renee van de Wetering (The Netherlands) sent Sunday 10 January 2016
Hi Martin We had a lovely time on Saturday night. The venue was excellent. . Christian was great and Rachel is very talented – I was singing her “I’m amazing” song all the way home! Best regards James Hurst sent 23 /11 2015
absolutely awesome show you did really well and look forward to seeing u again soon ! Dot Lea sent Tuesday 8 September 2015
Thank you Martin, we had a great time, no doubt we will be back again. Keep us in the loop about any change in venue.
A real variety of acts with both established comedy veterans and bright new talent topped off with the legend that is Harry Hill. Hill on great form, took the audience in to his playful, surreal and extremely funnyl world. Just a brilliant show.
You are a warm and generous host and I think it was a really lovely evening. Kind regards Stephen Diplacito
Martin…always a good evening and we’ll see you again soon. We liked the Israeli guy and the tally skinny blonde one!
Hi Martin,We all had a great time, thanks for the laughs. We were extremely drunk too so apologies if we got too raucous. matthew jlow sent Sunday 11 January 2015
Just wanted to drop you a quick note to say thank you. We went to bamboo last night to eat and watch your comedy. We were with 2 other couples, had great food and the comedy was fab. A great venue and very well organised.Thanks, happy new year Simon Baskind sent Thursday 1 January 2015
Hi Martin,It was an excellent evening, my friend and I are visiting from Jersey, we don't have comedy clubs on the island, it was something different for us to do and very entertaining.We laughed all the way back to the hotel!Thank you for a great memory to take across the channel.Heather Brown & Dom sent Sunday 8 June 2014
Hi Martin,Thank you so much for your hospitality. We girls had a great time.Hope to visit again sometime.
I just wanted to say thank you very much for a fab comedy night on Saturday just gone. It was my birthday and we'd travelled all the way from wigan,and wow you had Lee Nelson. I was a bit gutted that I didn't get to meet him, but I know how busy he must be!
The night you put on I thought was fantastic, it was great value and all the comedy acts were great. I don't think there's anything else you could possibly do to make it better than it already was!
Thank you for such a great night! We all found it hilarious. A pleasant surprise, we were looking for a comedy club and were handed your flyer earlier in the day so a perfect end to the day, even if we did have a mad dash across London to catch the last train!
The musical guy was my favourite! . I'd definitely see him again. Could you remind me of his name please? (she is talking about Jay Foreman)
Thanks for your mail. We all had a great night out with you. Although annoying that group provided the performers with a perfect destination for humiliation and vitriol. So not all bad.See you again.Rob Dyke sent 10 February 2014
No need to apologise. I had a really fun evening and I have to hand it to the comedians they did a sterling job of handling the disruptive elements.
Thanks for a wonderfully entertaining night, the line up was awesome and it more than made up for New Years Eve.
Haven't laughed like that for ages, we all had a great night. Sorry if at times we were a little loud! No doubt you will be seeing us again and we very much look forward to it
My girlfriend and I came to the club for the first time on Saturday night and really enjoyed ourselves. All of the comedians were fantastic,
We would like to reserve tickets for the Friday 14th Valentine’s Day Special at The Oxford. Many thanks Jonathan
It was the best comedy night that we have been to for ages. We particularly liked Arthur Smith ( always great) and Pat Cahill. Great atmosphere.
We had a fun time last night! We enjoyed all the acts, and in particular, Rob the Canadian and the Norweigian girl were distinctive. It was a nice intimate atmosphere,
Classification: UNCLASSIFIEDHI Martin. The evening was great and I was impressed with the range of acts that you had and their differences which was very refreshing and in ways they all made me laugh. The 2 youngest were so funny. I found it quite frustrating when some in the audience were a little disrespectful to the acts but that is the nature of it and at the end of the day they will learn. I will definitely hope to come again. With kind regards Tina Biggs sent Monday 6 January 2014
Thank you for a very funny night. All the acts were very good even though my friend spent half the night asleep! Too much fun. Will defiantly be coming back soon.See you again soon.Thanks again.Chris House sent Sunday 27 October 2013
Thanks very much for Saturday night, it was a really special birthday and everyone had such a good time.All of the acts were great, and Daniel Simonsen was on top form! Hopefully be heading to see something at the new venue in CG.
Very enjoyable Martin – I thought warm up acts were good and Daniel Simonsen hilarious Cheers Richard seddon Sent Monday 14 October2013
Good on ya. Thursday's gig was Awesome!x Have a confession for you Martin. Don't think we paid for the tickets cos we arrived late & had to rush back to the Hotel. Please send me a bill & I'll cough up or I can pay double next gig? I could even dance for the money i.e. my debut Stand up is on Friday, 6th Dec @ Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff! (Don't think I'm quite your lineup calibre, yet!) It was such a laugh on Thursday @ your gig. Sooo surreal! At one point we were all singing joining in the chorus with that brill solo acoustic guitarist & singer singing something about preferring Jif to Cif when mum (as in Jaquie's mum) linked arms with me on the Chesterfield & swaying back & forth to the music (she really enjoyed herself - not bad for an 82yrs old woman, aye?) and Cynthia started to sing, "Praise the Lord, Jesus Christ! Praise the Lord!!" Bloody Brilliant. Can't wait for the next gig.xRhian Stewart Sent Saturday 12 October 2013
Thank you for your lovely email. I have had a fantastic night and will definitely join you soon again. Can you kindly send me the name of this German comedian again. He was just amazing.

Hi Martin, Thank you for the email, so nice of you ! Me especially but all the other ladies really enjoyed Last night, all the acts were great in their individual way! Look forward to the next time :-) Vivi x sent Sunday 1 September 2013
Totally loved it. I've been coming to Monkey Business for about five years. In that time I've seen a mind-blowing stream of comics pass through your doors - including Stephen K Amos, Lee Evans and Scott Capuro. I've probably belly laughed more in your club than throughout the rest of my whole life! Which doesn't say much about my life, but is testament to the quality of your nights. Even though I've seen his act five times now, Wes Zaharuk the film noir clown has me in hysterics every time (and usually covered in reams of toilet paper, cigars and exploded banana too). I think what you've built is unique and you should keep doing it forever. You must have inspired me, as I've recently taken to the open mic slot myself. Hope you have a good week. Sam and Faye sent Tuesday 21 May 2013
Thanks Martin. We had a good time. Nice venue. Good food. Would come again. I really liked the first guy from glasgow Stephen Carlin. Smart and very witty. The new guy Luke Stephen from essex has promise too. Didnt really enjoy your headline act Scott Capurro though sorry to say. I found his mockery of jesus christ in really bad taste.

Hello MartinI came from Sheffield and it was my first time at a comedy club. What a deft and busy man you are. Definetely doing positive good - you have systems in place of course.Feedback: I liked so much where do I start.Personally, I really appreciated the concessionary ticket that you allowed me. Then there was the deft way you handled seating people into a crowded room. The acts were all funny in different ways and not smutty at all.Adam Hill has very pertinent jokes for today and great stagecraft no wonder he is so popular. Maggy did well too as the warm up. And the positive note he finished on was great "Touch that frog" - kiss it if you dare.Next time I'll get there earlier and sit in the room.Thanks for asking. It made sure I followed my intention to give you feedback.
Martin,we had such a great night on Saturday - good variety and the whole party loved it.Thanks very much!

I wanted to thank you for a great evening on Saturday.That was my daughters first comedy show and she left with sore cheeks from laughing and smiling the whole night.The highlight of the evening was surely FOIL ARMS and HOG, even with the tech issues,which they creatively worked into their routine.You burst my daughters comedy cherry perfectly and for that I thank you.

Hi Martin Was a good night on the whole. Gordon Southern and The Noise Next door are great talent. It’s a shame that that woman did what she did getting up on the stage like that. I’ve never seen anything like that before. I think anyone who invades the stage and acts aggressively towards a performer should be removed. Anyway, this won’t deter us from returning, its always a good night! Cheers Karen Walsh sent Monday 18 June 2012

hello martin,i came to your comedy night on saturday with Vikas and had a brilliant time.. I was wondering if you'd be able to put me on the mailing list for future nights?thanks
I really enjoyed the show on saturday, and im sure I ll be coming soon again :) I am very interested in the thursday secret show, and I would like 3 student tickets, if possible.
Hey Martin, good to meet you - Last night was good fun and we will definitely come back for another visit
Thank you very much for hosting us; it was a great evening and there was substantial positive feedback. The show was superbly organized and the acts were excellent, we will definitely be returning in the near future. Thanks again for your generosity and accomodation. Cheers!
Yes we had a brilliant evening. I think that was the best line up of acts I have ever seen at monkey business. Thankyou!
I thought the cream of the crop was the act just before the interval - staged, atmospheric performance with trickery, very convincing after 3 pints.
Having said that, the most enjoyable performance was from the MC, but that doesn't take anything away from the acts - you just happened to be on fire! :)
I hope all's well with you. Just wanted to drop a line and say thanks so much for a top night at Monkey Business on Saturday. It was my first time seeing standup at the Oxford and I really bloody enjoyed it, as did the wife (grub downstairs was good, too).
Also really liked the mixture of old-hands and newbies - of course some were more successful than others but that's to be expected, isn't it? Anyway, well done you for giving them a shot. We'll definitely be coming back soon..
I now live in Berlin with only occasional visits to London. I have stayed on the mailing list as it is always good to keep abreast of what is going on for the rare occasions I am back.
I thought I would drop you a quick mail to say well done and thank you. Well done for organising the best comedy nights in the capital. And also a big thank you for the effort you must put in.
The Steele's miss is The Oxford's gain! I used to live in Kentish Town so I really hope I can get to a gig around Christmas time.
Keep up the great work. I know from friends who have attended your shows that it is very much appreciated.
Although it's been ages since we had a chance to visit the club, we've had some great times there and have happy memories of the place because of everything you created, and they can never take that away from you.
Something about this whole situation reminds me Bill Hicks' marketing and advertising rant, and when Hicks gets angry at the corporate whores of the world I know whose side I'd rather be on!Good luck with the new club and keep doing what you're doing. The world would be a dull place without people like you. peace Jef Smith sent Monday 24 October 2011
Martin, had a fantastic night on saturday at the richard steele, have recommended monkey business to all my friends. Unfortunately I live in belfast so will have limited opportunities for future shows, but when next in london will def be there. keep up the good work,
Anyhow, my friends and I thought last week's show was really good. Abandoman and Patrick Kielty were the most popular, but the other comics were also good.
It would be great if you could get the likes of Lee Mack again, and Scott Capurro. Is Lee Hurst still performing?
Anyway, I shall continue to enjoy Monkey Business, which tends to be one of the more consistently funny comedy nights in town - keep up the good work!
Thanks for the email. Really enjoyed the show last night but was a bit disappointed that Lucy Porter only played for 20 mins, I thought she was meant to be doing a longer set. The last time I saw her at Monkey Business she was on for nearly an hour.
Anyway, it was still a good night. I do think it's Sir Richard Steele's loss that Monkey Business will be leaving, but it will also be The Oxford's gain. Wishing you all the best at the new venue.
Had a great time last Thursday, Lots of funny comedians last night, Highlights for me would be Jacques Barrett and the noise next door..
The evening was fantastic, good crowd, relaxed atmosphere and last but not least great acts and very skillful MC! and to cap it all the unplanned appearance of Lee Nelson, what a bonus!!!

Yes we had a great evening, we always do and the big wedges of chocolate cake we had at 4am when we got back to the hotel went down a treat! That was a really nice touch.
I personally liked the first two comedians best and I would definatley go see them again - If I'm honest I think Yusuf's material seemed a bit tired but you can tell he's good at what he does and so hopefully it'll give him a kick up the arse to up his game!

Hi Martin, Thanks for a wonderful evening although for you it must have been chaotic! I think you did an excellent job at keeping the audience entertained whilst waiting for the acts to show up, which ultimately was pivotal for a good evening.

It was so good there are a load of my mates aiming to go this coming Friday and I'm organizing another group of us to go back again in Feb it was honestly top quality!
Thank you for the lovely evening, my friend and myself really enjoyed it and I will be bringing some more friends to Monkey Business club soon :-).

Hi Martin,One of the best line ups so far.The tubby geek guy will improve and the American guy should learn not to be too pc.When Henning When mentioned the jews did he know that North London is awash? Nobody took offence, I think everybody agreed with everything he said. I will now be the man from the Stasi it seems but that's ok as I know how to play that part,I've given many tours around their headquarters in Berlin and other related areas.We are going to try and come more often this year as it looks like we'll need cheering up more often.Many thanks for a great night,Chris Burrows sent Sunday 16 January 2011
I had a very good evening thanks – highlights for me were Martin Hill, Geoff Boyce and Kate Lucas. Also Henning was v clever.
I wasn’t so keen on the self-deprecating Star Trek guy – he is funny, he could be funny on a different subject than his own failures – it’s kind of discomfiting.
Thanks for a great night, was really bloody funny I tell ya! My girlfriend loved it as a surprise date :)
We all had a really great time actually at your New Years Eve bash. I thought the last 2 acts Patrick Monahan and Abandoman were top quality. More of the hip hop in future!
I thought it was an excellent night, quite a surprise, excellent value for money and loads of acts - I liked the venue ....it was intimate and different .
Huge Thankyou for the superb show on new years eve, was absolutely fab! If you've never been to Monkey Business i highly recommend you do, Especially to see Abandomen, they r fantastic!! Once again Thankyou for a great evening! See you in the New year!!

We had a great time at the 'Singles' night on Friday despite the fact that we didn't meet anyone!! My friends asked me to email you to say that the veggie buffet was excellent! Normally veggie food in pubs is full of fat but you managed to get the balance just right.
It was a lovely atmosphere and you did a good job as MC. We thought that two of the stand-up acts were very good but would rather not say which ones . Overall they all did well to make the evening very enjoyable and we will certainly come back again soon!
Hi Martin - . We did have a good time last night. We've been before to Monkey Business, and it was fun overall with some real highlights, but others that didn't really work out. Loretta Maine was excellent - really hilarious and very perceptive. We enjoyed David Mills's act a lot: would like to see him again. We found Christian Rilley and Sean Hegarty both funny in part but let themselves down. I have to say I find Stephen Hawking 'jokes' pretty passé, pathetic, low and childish, and a decent comic really out to be able to do better. As for Ian Cognito, a bit disappointing. Didn't really hit the mark most of the time.
Thanks again for a lovely evening. I've been to a few different comedy clubs but yours by far is my favourite, top acts with a warm atmosphere and I love the intimacy of Monkey Business, not to mention the value! (How DO you do it?)
It was my first time there and it was very good and I would definately recommend it. Hope to see you again soon.
Thanks Martin! I was visiting from Toronto and really wanted to see Andy Zaltzman perform, so I was delighted to find the opportunity. My friend and I were very impressed with the entire evening, from the intimate venue to the caliber of the talent, and I particularly loved Henry Ginzberg (and of course, Andy.) It was my first trip to London, and definitely one of the highlights of my week. Thank you for a wonderful evening and I will be sure to hang onto my membership card for the next time I come around.

Hey Martin there ended up being five of us on Saturday night, we got some good seats upstairs and we had a blast. Being Monkey bussiness virgins we didnt know what to expect but we loved all of it. There wasnt one comic who dissapointed. Tom Wrigglesworth and Abandoman were so funny.We will be sure to make a trip down from the dark depths of norfolk for another show soon. Cheers
Thanks for your efforts in arranging what was a brilliant night. The venue was a little eccentric but produced a very intimate atmosphere which I really think enhanced the evening. We all had a great time.. thanks very much for arranging the cakes as well .. very much apprieciated! We'll certainly make every effort to attend future events.
I would like to bring my netball club to one of your nights for our Xmas social, probably Dec 4th as abandoman are on that night. There are about 20 of us Regards,
Brilliant gig Martin. Particularly abandoman and the hairy chap Tom Wrigglesworth) I'm one of the three you were talking to when catching your cab. You mentioned lenny henry soon...I'd be interested in that too.
T'was extremely funny, Victoria and I had a brilliant time! Our evening took a turn for the worse when we left the pub, but that is another story! Ho ho
enjoyed the evening although having arrived early it was a bit bum numbing to sit for nearly 4 hours. We should have taken advantage of the breaks.
Hi Martin,Saturday's line up was very good Milton Jones even better than the last time and the guy on last was a worthy second.
Great to be there Martin, I really enjoyed it. Milton Jones was great and the supports particularly Jen Brister
Nice pub downstairs and the only criticism is that you’re so popular hence room was very crowded. In all nice one and will definitely be back!
We had a great evening on Saturday; Zoe and I thought the venue was a good size for a comedy night and the food was really good actually.
We thought that you were particularly good as a host (both in welcoming guests) and as the MC for the evening.
Clearly there was a vast difference in the experience each act had but overall a great night. In particular we enjoyed the second female act, and the last three male acts.
Hi martin, please reserve 2 tickets for me for lenny henry on tues 28th. thanks. last night show was amazing !!! thanks alot xxx Sam
And thank you for making a lone lost lovelorn female from Ireland feel so welcome to the charming environs of Chalk Farm!! It was a great night - and a wonderful venue.
I've just got back from a wonderful visit to your comedy club. I enjoyed it very much! Thank you. :D
Thank you for a great night at Monkey Business last night. Would it be possible to reserve tickets for Lenny Henry?
Thanks so much for a great night. What time does Saturday start and can we reserve tickets as we are hoping to bring a big crowd?
I really loved your gig yesterday with Patrick Kielty and Alex Zane.I went home feeling very merry .
We had a fab evening and look forward to another show soon! Can't get over how the magician guessed the random word out of the book ...amazing.
Once again a big thank you for saturday night. i come to the club as often as possible and you always have the best acts.
Hi Martin, many thanks for having me! You have a wonderful room and a great crowd - I hope to be there again soon.
I really loved the Monkey Business show last Saturday with those two amazing comics Jack Whitehall and Lee Nelson.
Thought the singles night was a success, my mate and I had a great time and will come along to the next one if we're free. Good job!
I just wanted to drop a note to say thank you for last night’s show. James and I enjoyed ourselves so much, and met some lovely people both during and after the show.
I enjoyed it, And you handled the no-show so well that for a while I thought it was all part of the act . I (We) esp liked the guy Anil Dessie who did the iimpressions. I will keep an eye out for him in the future. And do keep me informed of whatever's coming up at the venue. We all live around the area and will def pop in again.
last night was my 1st time down and I really enjoyed it, great surroundings and nice people there too.
i liked the variety in the acts, but the "in betweeners guy" did fully die on stage .. hahah was that done purposely to make the next guy look even better ? or was he actually that bad ?? hahah, ironically it was a funny talking point on our way home.
Thanks so much for an amazing night at The Monkey Business; everyone had a fab time and said how brilliant the acts and the venue and of course you were!! We shall definitely be visiting again so keep me posted on the happenings!Hope you enjoyed the rest of your weekend
Thank you Martin, we had a fantastic evening on Saturday and very much enjoyed your chosen line up. It was really good to be back and we especially enjoyed Zoe Lyons and Josh Howe! Love your club and the fact that the comedians sometimes hang out in the bar afterwards - all testament that the comments they also make to you on stage that you have a great club with good atmosphere and nice audiences are true!
Hope to continue to receive your emails - bit gutted we missed out on the secret Omid Djalili gig as that would have been great. Enjoyed one at Carmel club with you that time when Stephen Merchant turned up though so as you say, it is all the luck of the draw.
Great to meet you last night, and thanks for a fab night. Really enjoyed it, despite the small crowd!
We hadn't heard of any of the line-up but thought it was a great night - Chris McCausland and Jay Foreman were particularly good and I'd really have liked to have seen a longer set from Chris Ramsey (he seems like the kind of act that could well get picked up for TV soon). Very impressed, we'll be coming back soon! Cheers Simon Carter
Thank you so much for a lovely evening. My wife thoroughly enjoyed it and it made for a good birthday evening. I'm sure we'll be seeing you again in the future.
I thought last night was a success and a great way to spend a Monday evening. It was a bit of a shame that Mr Burns didn’t show up but I still think it was well on the money. All the acts were entertaining and all the people with me enjoyed themselves also (although apparently you did chide a friend for talking even though it was a couple sat nearby… apparently). Anyhow, thanks again,
Thanks for the email, very enjoyable evening on the whole, and I do like the general relaxed informal nature of the evening. Had seen Ian Cognito a few years back, and thought he was excellent, and he certainly didnt disappoint this time either.
From a personal point of view, enjoyed all the acts apart from he performance of Jaik Campbell. Given his list of plaudits and reviews that you've put up on him, he came across as a new act trying out some flaky material at an open mic night. Assume we just caught him on an off-night.
Just want to say thank you and that i thought Monkey Buisness on the 30th Jan was amazing and I loved every minute of it!
We will definately be coming again very soon as we purchased lifetime membership and thinks its brilliant.Thank you again. See you soon!
'Thankyou so much for a fantastic evening. You helped to make my birthday very special, not only with top class comedy acts but a birthday cake and a beautiful bunch of roses! I cant wait to come back again! Gem x'
Lovely to meet you yesterday, as I said above I had an awesome time and I felt so special! Im so sorry about my family fidgeting around at the beginning!!!! Cant take them anywhere!!!Speak soon
Thanks so so much Martin we had an amazing night, all the acts were very funny and high quality. Especially, as you probably know, the guy from Malawi. We'll definitely come to any night he does. However, we shall all be regulars regardless and again thanks v much. See you very soon!
Thanks for you email. Jenny and I enjoyed the show on Thursday very much, it may have been a compact venue but you couldn't argue with being close up to the action!
The buffet was delicious.My only regret was that I diden`t get around to giving you a kiss at midnight for making it my most enjoyable New Years Eve I can remember. You looked very smart tonight. Love Katherine Ross xxxx sent Saturday 2 January 2010
Congratulations for a fun, successful boxing day comedy party. My mates who came along had a real good time .... thanks also for the opportunity to perform.... Never performed at that level before- probably showed but, hey, it was good- you sure know how to organise a party! Hope I get the privilege to perform there again - all the best
What a sentimental and sensational review of the year, well done. And I am sad to realise I have missed so many good gigs, Reg Hunter, Marcus Brigstocke, Shazia Mirza, and many others. I have been working between London and Manchester for the past year to try to get a documentary idea off the ground, unfortunately it's not happening yet. The coming year will be more London based so hopefully can catch more of your shows.
Thanks for a great evening! It was really wonderful to see Russell Howard at your club who is one of my favourite comedian`s . I loved Lee Nelson`s performance too, and you Martin are just about the coolest guy I know for putting these superb shows on
My son (twas his 24th birthday) wanted to leave halfway-but that’s nothing to do with the performance-he has Aspergers syndrome-and it was amazing to get him in such a crowded room in the first place-so you did exceptionally well. The pre performance wait was far too long for him
Was sad to miss later acts –If you want some negative feedback- I was not impressed by your main acts use of the ‘f’ word- why is it so necessary? I did not find him funny in the least. –But that is just me-
I liked the principle of what the girls were trying to do-they were excellent-just the script needed honing....
Thank you so much for last night, not only was it a great night anyway but you made it really special so thanks for the cake and flowers. I thought all the acts were great and apart from your usuals, Jon Kudlick was really really good and definitely worth asking back. We will definitely come back so keep us informed about good nights.
Thank you. We really enjoyed it and will be bringing friends along in the future! We don't live in London anymore, but it's wonderful to pop down and see life, rather than fields and cows....Helen Simson sent Monday 30 November 2009
We had a fantastic evening, thanks very much. We all thought the German guy, Henning Wehn was the best followed by very surprisingly Nick Helm whose last singing part of the act was brilliant,not so sure about the beginning part..we were a bit confused..
Thank you for an excellent show the 17th. You are a very good MC. The four performers and you were all brilliant and very hilarious. You can be sure that I will return there next time I'm in the UK. A very recommendable club.
Thanks for a great evening last night. My boys really enjoyed it. Like you said, it is always a bit hit and miss with an open mike evening but I personally find it exciting as you don't know quite what the next act is going to bring. I would love to come to one of your Steels nights so please keep me posted.
Thanks so much for last Thursday - Stephen Merchant was really good, and Lee Nelson was awesome. Was an excellent night!
Thank you for your email, I really really enjoyed Thursday night though it was great value for money and a great intimate venue! Steven Merchant and Lee Nelson were hilarious and most of the open mic acts (particularly the guy with the long curly hair and Johnny of course!) were incredibly talented and confident, I think its great that you have them on the same bill as such established comedians as I think its a real confidence booster and they all stepped up to the challenge - cant wait to come to the next one! Thanks Carly Mond sent Monday 12 October 2009
Really enjoyed the comedy night last night. That Lee Nelson who was brilliant, as was Steve Merchant. Emma Lawlor sent Friday 9 October 2009
Hi Martin, just wanted to say thanks for the gig last night, I had a really good time. Frisky and Mannish were amazing.
My suggestion, time permitting etc would be to open up with an act who is not so well know. This would be a good way to warm up the crowd, but more importantly these small shows have the potential to help up and coming talent.Best of luck, Tiago Toress sent Sunday 20 September 2009
I came to the Monkey Business comedy show with two friends on Saturday night and we really enjoyed ourselves! It was a shame that Ricky Grover wasn’t there but some of the other acts were really funny – Simon Munnery, the guy at the end with the guitar Ronnie Golden were especially good. and Alexandra Clark (who I had never heard of until that night)
Im mainly based in New York but will come back to London (in fact, my flat is nearby your venue, so please do include me on the mailing list and I’ll definately return to the Monkey Business when I get a chance. Thanks for organising!
Yesterday was my first time at Monkey Business and I really enjoyed your show.Magnus Betner was excellent,and so were the other two acts on the bill.

Was at the show last night and would again like to say a massive thank you for the fabulous show last night. Lee Mack was his usual witty self and Sean Hughes was fantastic... the place was rocking and the atmosphere was fantastic!!!
Am e-mailing to enquire whether or not you still have seats available to see Rhod Gilbert and Reginald D Hunter next week. I know you mentioned last night that there were still seats available and if there are still seats available for both nights i would be very interested in securing some places.
If you could let me know the availability of both gigs that would be fantastic...i believe both gigs will be at the Adelaide??? is this correct? If so where abouts is the place situated as i am not a local resident and will need to find appropriate travel to and from the venue accordingly.
Hi Martin, fab show tonight with Lee Mack & Sean Hughes. Love them both & have been going to see Sean since Red Rose Club comedy @ Islington Labour Club Finsbury Park 20 years ago made me feel old when that baby in the front row wasn't even born then! look 4wd 2 cu @ Adelaide on Thursday for Rhod Gilbert. Friend of mine is doing his pre-Edinburgh show @ Enterprise 2moro night if u are around. Sure u r busy but if not wd be good to buy u a beer when u not on duty so to spk. Hope you have a good wk Julie x sent Sunday 26 July 2009
Just a quick line to let you know what I thought of Saturday’s show. What a gem Hannah George turned out to be….really engaging and very funny. Enjoyed Daniel Simonson and Old Spanish Man too. Daniel could do with a bit more material though. His dry delivery really suits him though.
Unfortunately I found Marcus Brigstocke to be surprisingly unfunny for most of his overlong set. I know you said he had new material but I can’t help thinking that maybe his old material might have been funnier.
I felt as though I was just sitting through somebody’s rant rather than enjoying a comic of some repute. Maybe we just caught him on an off night but based on this performance I wouldn’t put myself out to see him again. Thank god for Hannah George to save the day.
We had a fantastic time and will definitely come back ;-) Sadly we've got plans on the 18th (shame as I love Lucy - see what I did there?) but we will return, keep it up! ;-)
Having searched hi and lo for he who is known as Reginald D Hunter, it was a pleasure to be there last night! I think I enjoyed it even more to be able to see 'a work in progress' :-) The club itself was very friendly and the addition of great food was a real bonus! Gotta say tho, you might want to give the stage a little 'attention' - I don't think the pallets and carpet are working as well as the perfomers would like! ;-)
Anyway, gutted we won't be around next week to take advantage of the special offer (cos we already have a couple of friends who want to come with us), but I have no doubts we will be back soon.Thanks again Mike O Sulivan sent Saturday 11 July 2009
Hi Martin I had a brilliant time last night & it totally made my day that Reg D Hunter said I was a "worthy adversary". I'm sorry if I said too much & was too gobby but I was manic & still in shock after having the car crash at lunchtime. 2 crashes in a week is a bit much to handle & I'm chatty anyway but its just made me even more hyper! I was really looking forward to Marcus Brigstocke tonight but unfortunately I can't make it as I've got to go up to Newcastle to see my dad before he goes on holiday tomorrow. He's really worried about my two accidents & wants to be reassured I'm ok so I'm just on way to KingX now. Hope you have a great weekend & thanks again for a brilliant night last night. All that laughter was just what I needed julie xx sent Julia Mellon Saturday 11 July 2009
Just in terms of feedback - we had an absolutely brilliant night. The crowd was lovely, the comedians were superb and it was a really happy and friendly atmosphere. I will definitely be returning in the future and recommending you to friends.
It was lovely to see you again last night. I hope you managed to sort out your phone, despite your worries last night you still made it a great night for everyone!! I hope the gig on Saturday goes well, I think the Mancunian guy was awesome. Love and best wishes x,
Hi Martin, thanks so much for the gig on Thursday night, it was a fab atmosphere and me and the fella really enjoyed the evening.
Rhod Gilbert was absolutely brlilliant. I thought Simon Brodkin was also extremely good - a highly original talent.
The only downside was that Rhod should not have apologised at the end. It was a brilliant gig and I think he was just a bit put off by the 4 pretty young girls in the front row who didnt seem to get it (maybe it was a bit intellectual for them!). I loved it and I think everyone else did. From a very amused 40 something in the second row.
Please pass on my compliments - I'm sure the recording went really well. Janet Morrison sent Friday 19 June 2009
I came to the gig at Deep Red last night and thought both acts Rhod Gilbert /Simon Brodkin were extremely good.
Thanks also for holding two tickets on the door for me last night. Coming to the show was certainly a good impulsive move!
Hi Martin great to meet you last night & really enjoyed it. Both Rhod Gilbert & Simon Brodkin were fabulous just sorry didn't get to buy you a drink- will have to rectify that next time. Don't know if any of pix are good enough for your website but will send to you anyway though the day cos it takes ages from my blackberry just to do one & I'm not a very "techy" person anyway. Take care & thx again for a "lorra laughs" as Cilla might say!
Well,You get twice as much leg room on a RyanAir flight, but not nearly as much pleasure! It was definitely worth the back and shoulder ache from the tight seating. Had a brilliant night – what a masterclass! Will probably see you Thursday my good man...
Had a really good evening – Lee Nelson was great. Reg was too but it seemed like he had to rush off very suddenly, which was a real shame.
Enjoyed the show and thought the atmosphere was good (no baying blokey groups). Hoped that Reginald D Hunter would have done a longer set as he was the comic I'd especially wanted to see but Simon Brodkin's set made up for it.
It was my first time at the venue and it was a very enjoyable evening, especially ian cognito whose ira voices were quite impressive given that i'm from belfast -he's a top comic !!! I will certainly be back on a regular occurance.
Thanks Martin, it was a great evening, could I reserve two tickets for Friday the 3rd of July please? Tom Gilbert sent Sunday 31 May 2009
Thank you once again for an intensely brilliant Saturday; was great to see you again and all the acts were fantastic!
Had a great evening last night would it be possible to reserve 6 tickets for the 18th July as We would all love to come to the show again
I thought I'd just share some of my thoughts. It was my first time at the venue last Thursday and I really enjoyed myself. Although the venue is somewhat 'cosy' it had a very positive vibe.
I think that considering how busy it became, the barman could have some assistance as his temperament declined significantly and this is not really conducive to an evening where people are coming to have a laugh! Having said that, the cocktails were delish!
The list of acts was very long and whilst I wanted to stay to see them all I couldn't because of the distance to travel home. Would it be possible to start earlier?
Finally, congratulations to all the acts we saw, even to those who are still 'a work in progress', it's wonderful to know that there is real talent out there.Best wishes Gill Hunte sent Tuesday 28 April 2009
Just to say that the penultimate act on saterday night was great........but that last guy, he was deeply offensive and repulsive! I think 3 members of city socialising left before the end.It was a real shame as I feel the last act spoilt an otherwise good night! thanks Jo Skinner sent Sunday 26 April 2009
We had a really nice evening, thanks. Not sure how well Scott Capurro went down (excuse the pun!), but I thought he was great. Broke every taboo going. We'll be back for more.
Thank you for a great evening! Barry and Stuart were fab, although slightly terrifying. Thought I was going to die! May have embarassed myself slightly...

Hey Martin, yea it was a very good night. I was part of the young guys at the front and we all seemed to have a good night. Was a shame that Brendan Burns didnt turn up but it still turned out very good. Will defiantly turn up for future shows.
Friday night was absolutely brilliant! I brought 5 mates, and we all agreed it was the best night of standup we'd seen. They loved the venue and were amazed at the standard of the early acts - obviously they had fairly high expectations of Russell Howard and Stephen Merchant, but thought Freaky & Mannish(sp?) and Adam Bloom were amazing.
I had a fantastic evening on Friday, and would definitely come again. I look forward to hearing about the next show!!
Just a very quick note to thank you very much indeed for a superb evening on Friday. We thought the Red Bar was a great venue and not only enjoyed the splendid line up but our special seats you found us in the alcove which afforded us great views! In fact I would prefer to sit there any time!! I can imagine you were very chuffed with the audience reaction and the programme you put together at very short notice. Steven Merchant was indeed a coup.
Thought you may also like to know that I recommended your club and it was discussed on Radio London early on Saturday morning! This was in the context of the breakfast show presenters, Simon Lederman and JoAnne Good asking for a good musical guest as Elaine Paige had dropped out. We had said during the evening to one another how much Jo (a feisty lady who used to be in Crossroads years ago) would enjoy Frisky and Mannish as she likes the Puppini Sisters and burlesque. Therefore I texted in to recommend F&M, saying of course that we had seen them at your excellent club the night before. Jo was indeed very interested and asked Simon what Monkey Business is when he told he had been along to Monkey Business and agreed how good it was as a club. He named the Richard Steeles as a venue so you may have him on your email list.
I hope you approve and that it earns me a few brownie points - but there again one good turn does deserve another and you did us proud last Friday and cheered us up no end after a rotten week at work. We will see you again soon.
Martin, I've been to several of your shows the past year and this one definitely won the prize! Russell Howard and Steven Merchant were AMAZING! My jaw hurt on the way home.
THANKS! I'm heading back to the States at the end of the month and I will really miss Monkey Business!
Once again, thank you so much for possibly the most fabby night ever! I felt I had to email, everything was just brilliant, my chums absolutely adored it too.
However, I feel awful, awful, awful about the the money situation with my group; I warned them, but they're used to trundling about using cards instead of cash, so I don't think it sank in... It was awfully good of you to let them in and I am (literally, some might say..!) in your debt.
It's bizarre how it sort of escalated to comedy-heaven with the addition of acts, but it was the best kind of bizarre-ity. Thank you so, so much and you truly are a magic-man.
Thank you so much for a fantastic time last night! Officially and honest-to-goodness-ly my favourite time of the month! A real treat to see you stand on your head..!
I have been in your comedy club a couple of weeks ago with my indian boyfriend... Do you remember? Enclosed a picture of us for my jewellery brand and in real : )
I was thinking that I really need to tell you that I had one of the best nights in my life in your comedy club. Especially the very personal way you treat your guest has been smashing and wonderfull!!!
Life is too short to not tell this when you feel it! Keep going with your great energy, I will come back when I am in London next time, I live in Hamburg/ Germany at the moment.
Can I please book two tickets for Sat 28th February under Catherine Brydges, if there are any spaces left?
Thanks, and the show yesterday was absolutely brilliant, I had a great time (I was the one who wanted to meet Andy Zaltzman...!)
We were just wondering if Frisky and Mannish have a website or anything, they were great! Quite surprised not to find anything about them on the internet...
the show was brilliant and we had a brilliant time - thank you for squeezing us in! the venue is really lovely too!
Thankyou for your email, i really enjoyed saturday night, a great way to see in my birthday! And most of all... thankyou for my cake!! It was delicious.
Did not know what to expect but i loved it! people were friendly and i was unusually comfortable despite the size and area i was sitting in being very small and being bang up at the front of the stage - which actually made it even better!! never laughed so much at stand up especially Nina Conti and Omid Djalili both just grand -even shed a tear they were so funny!!
The two acts that were on before Stewart Lee (Pete Jonas and Vikki Stone) were fantastic. I think the blend of the two comedians was perfect and we will definately seek these two out again.
We intend to come to Monkey Business more often in the future and become regulars at your great club.Keep up the excellent work
Penny and I loved the Comedy club and will certainly be returning, loved the atmosphere and found the acts v funny – gutted I cant come to the Reginald d hunter night due to other arrangements but will certainly be returning
Yeah we loved it last night, thanks. Top night out as usual and looks like you've got a new convert as well. Happy faces all round!
Just came home from Monkey Business. I've been many times, but thought I'd email this time to say what a fantastic job I think you do. The crowd was impossible but the acts were top notch. The audience didn't make it easy for the 2nd guy, who could have been great but there was just no warmth from the audience.
So, really just wanted to let you know that Monkey Business is the best comedy club in the capital, we had a really good night, and that the crowd were pretty shocking !! We've tried so many comedy clubs, but your place is the one we keep coming back to and will do in the future. We've never been disappointed so keep up the great work.
Thank you for your message and for being a great host on the night (and for not letting that drunk woman in;-)) We had a fun night and will definitely be back!
Thank you, Martin, for giving my daughter and I the chance to attend Thursday's Harry Hill gig. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening.
I thought that Simon Brodkin/Lee Nelson was superb and am sure that he will go from strength to strength in the coming months. The quartet was also extremely talented and I wish them all the best for their continued success.
I'm a massive Harry Hill fan so obviously he stole the show for me but I thought the two previous acts were excellent too.
Thanks for putting on a super night last night at the Steeles with Harry Hill - it was really really good!
Another top night! And thank you so much for squeezing my mate in when you were already chocka, very much appreciated. I'll make the cakes a regular thing, have you got any favourites?
I am the curly haired girl that you said reminded you of an actress in a soap. I loved your show with Harry Hill yesterday.Well done for making it a great night.You are lovely.
Thank-you for a great night on Saturday - I'm so glad we chose your comedy club! The acts were fantastic and the atmosphere was friendly and cosy! I will be recommending your comedy club to all my friends! Thank-you again, I hope to be back v.soon!
Thanks Martin – it was a great night and great acts. I know my friend Nicole will be interested in your comedy nights – her email is attached, pls add her to your list.
Just wanna say a HEEUGE thankyou!! It was absolutely BRILLIANT!! I had a great evening. I hope to come there again one day. It's just hard with living so far away. Do you know of any places nearby like hostels or inns? Cos me and my friend were like staying in a place next to the theatre in the middle of town, she had loads of maps and it was really confusing!! I can't believe you know Marek!! Hahaa. AND GREG!!
We had a great time! Vicky Stone was awesome - and Russell Howard didn't disappoint - he was wicked.
Hope you had a good birthday. We had a great time last night, the fact that the show was put together with an hour's notice is unbelievable, very impressed!
Yep, it was definitely a good cosy friendly gig with great acts (the reason I went!). Good food too...
Thank you very much for a fantastic evening with great acts! Excellent value for money too. I can’t think of a way to better the evening and everyone there with me enjoyed it immensely.
,I’ll be sure to check for upcoming shows if I or a friend fancies a night out with. I’ll be sure to recommend Monkey Business in the future!
Thankyou very much for putting me on the reserved list (on behalf of Amnesty) for the Harry Hill / Simon Brodkin gig.
It was great and very well run. I hadn't been to your Richard Stelle venue berfore. It was just right for pub comedy, and it's a good decision not to serve from the bar whilst the comics are on.
I just wanted email and thank you again for putting aside the tickets for my family. They told me they were literally crying with laughter! Congrats on such a successful night.

Hi Martin, we had a great time, it was a brilliant night! We'll definitely be coming to the night in October you mentioned with Stephen K.Amos,and Lucy Porter, but most likely see you before then anyway.
hi Martin. thanks for a very memorable evening. i felt so sorry for scott capurro as that idiot in the corner ended up upsetting him quite a lot, but i'm glad he had the last laugh. lee nelson was extremely funny also.
Hope yr weekend was good, was thinking I prefer monkey business much more than Jongleurs - used to go there all the time, but now MB is my place of choice!!
I've only lived in London a couple of months and I live 5 mins from the Steeles but what a find. I had my second night last saturday (Milton etc...) and it was better than the first. I have friends visiting reularly so it's great I can show them a brilliant night without having to call a cab (first yours then down to Marathon for an extreme kebab!!) I have a friend visiting this Saturday so I'm planning to go again. Please keep me informed of upcoming acts. I had to miss Harry Hill as I was out of town but I would love to catch him next time as you said he might play again...... Thanks again
Thanks for a great evening and for saving tickets for us This is the second time we’ve been to Monkey Business. It’s really good to see new and well known comedians in such an intimate atmosphere. Harry Hill was top notch, it was really good to see him doing stand-up (his way!). If possible please do express our thanks for a brilliant evening to all the performers.
Hi Martin The Harry Hill night was great last week. What was the name of the girl who was the first warm act? I thought she was great. Clare Tindell sent Monday 28 April 2008
Thanks again Martin for the Harry Hill tickets, last night was BRILLIANT, we'll definitely come again. Frances likes Simon Munnery but I am a pure Boosh babe - Noel Fielding's pretty busy this year, but keep trying. Or Julian Barratt - even better, ha ha!!
Definitely keep me posted on any other events ... although, not sure anyone else around is quite as good as Harry! :-) Clair Sherer Sent Friday 25 April 2008
I attended the show last night in Chalk Farm and was really impressed with the acts. I've just been to one comedy show in Dubai and I was not amused.
I was the half Moroccan - half Sri Lankan girl from last night (which resulted in you attempting to wrangle something funny about the country. Sadly, neither country has much to offer on the comedy front other than our lovely camels, copious amount of ganja, and gay child hood prostitution).
I have to say in the two gigs I've done for you now I've been very impressed with your commitment and support for new acts. I've been doing comedy (ok, trying to do comedy!) for about six months now and I've been impressed with the high standard of comics coming up the ranks. There's a lot of outstanding new talent - and none moreso have I noticed this than last night in Chalk Farm.
What strikes me about your Thursday night gigs is that you have such a strong and genuine conviction for giving new acts - whether established new acts like Nick Helm or new new acts like Gemma Whelan and myself - an outlet to practice the incredibly skillful art of comedy. Yes, there are other open mic nights and venues but I've never seen anyone who has quite the same vision as yourself about the importance of nurturing new talent. Hence the reason for this mail - to say thank you for the opportunity, and thank you for your new talent 'mission', because and assuring the future of comedy.
Just wanted to say that! I realise on my own part after 10 gigs I have so much left to learn and discover in terms of my own 'comedy voice' (the holy grail)! I'm almost returning to the drawing board with most ggs so I know what I've got to do before I'm anywhere near up to scratch - but with enough determination I hope to get there in the end.

Many thanks for a great night last night. All my fellow companions agreed it was a fab night out and we will definitely make a point of coming back soon.
I'm sorry that you had a few people attempting to spoil the evening. Your efforts to minimise the audience conversation during the acts was really appreciated and DID make a difference! In fact how you conducted your role as "MC" was highly admed by all my group and essentially it made the evening such a success.
Very best wishes for great 2008, and I look forward to another night out at Monkey Business very soon.
Martin A great night was had by all. Thanks Very much. We will see you again soon.Cheers David. Sent from David Williams Monday 3 December 2007
We really enjoyed it - I especially liked the Norweigian guy and the extremely loud posh bloke with all the hair and the penetrating stare!
thanks so much.. We had a fabulous evening. I thought Reginald D.Hunter was remarkable - for my part worth the whole night to hear! Sorry mate - didn;t go much for act 2 but then maybe I just missed what the material was! Good luck with the Comedy Club - always such a great hit on the head. Am away for the winter now so no need to put me on your auto mailing list for the moment please (always rushed in internet cafes; best to avoid too much stuff in the in box) but I consider the Steeles my bar in London, so be assured I will be back, and I will be at the club again.
So, my dear, my crew had a great night; my boyfriend had a beautiful party; he said all he saw were smiles.
Just a few comments: first time at the pub and comedy club and overall an excellent evening. The pub itself is great, with its welcoming atmosphere enhanced by its most original decor. The food too was very good and reasonably priced although the drinks were a tad on the expensive side (£4.10 for a gin and tonic). As for the comedy itself, I felt this was also of a generally good standard. Having watched numerous comedy shows before - most recently at the Comedy Store in Leicester Square - I felt that last night line up was of a comparable standard. The notable exception however being the first act who was simply attrocious. It seemed like it was her first time and she looked completely out of her depth, with the vast majority of her jokes falling flatter than the proverbial pancake. The following 3 acts however were excellent so overall I would gladly recommend your establishment to my friends.

Hi Martin, Alan & I really enjoyed our evening on Saturday. We were comedy stand-up first-timers and it was a smashing introduction. It was certainly varied and the standard was pretty high. The young lad was a bit raw round the edges but you're probably right about him being pretty good in future - and what a brave kid! The guy with all the props was very Tommy Cooperish and very funny. The gay guy was a bit OTTP with the gay shtick - but funny too. And, of course, Adam Bloom was the cherry on the cake. Thanks for a great evening - we'll be back.Best wishes, Dot (Norma's sister/Leo's auntie) Sent 24 April 2007

Hi Martin,The Fielding / Le Strange gig on Saturday was great! The performances were on top form (this was Noel at his best, and though I haven’t seen Gary before he was brilliant) and it was a great crowd.I will definitely be back to Monkey Business.
Just thought i'd say thanks again for a wonderful night, I would have emailed sooner but i've been very busy this week.
Noel was outstanding once again and i felt very privileged to be in the room, I also appreciate the hard work you must put in calling and emailing everyone, i'd love to buy you a drink next time.
Think I might arm my mates with a pad next time, but chuffed to bits that Noel turned my mate's 20sov note into a little work of art - and he's got the badge of my retro clothing shop! Only just started and celeb endoresement already, that's pretty good!
Good news is I'm renting a room out hopefully to someone nearly as fab and groovy as maself so I'll be dragging their sorry arse to Monkeybusiness every Saturday as part of their tenancy agreement - when can we see the line up for 2006??

Hi Martin,Just wanted to say how much I enjoyed Monkey Business last night. Of course I came initially to see Harry Hill, but I really enjoyed Lee Nelson! I thought he was excellent. I've come across so many characters like Nelsey at home, mostly they sit outside Macdonalds late at night. Made me feel very much at home.Cheers,Chris Basu Jan 2005
Just wanted to say that I thought last night's show was the best I've been to. My husband, Tony, was the guy in the baseball cap who wouldn't play along with Lee Nelson but was wetting himself when Mark Blake was on. It was brilliant value Great Entertainment.
Along with friends, we visited your club on Saturday 26th March (We were the ones from Wales) I would just like to thank you for a fantastic evening. That was THE best night I have had for a long time and I feel that we should offer encouragement in order that you keep up the good work. If possible could you include me on the emailing list. Living so far away, I can't promise that we'll be frequent visitors but I shall certainly make a point of being there every time I visit London.
Brilliant show on Saturday. I haven't seen 'Alan Parker' for years and he was great as expected and John Sparkes another blast from the past all topped off by Andy Parsons. With best wishes
there both nights. My friends and I had a great time, and the place is so friendly that even when it was so packed, that was just a chance to talk to loads of people rather than get annoyed as seems to happen in other clubs! Noel Fielding was brilliant, and seemed very happy to meet people afterwards and
Great night last night and what a turn out! The acts were all good and Simon Munnery was excellent I must say.
My only problem is obviously that too many people were in the venue and you obviously know this so I don't need to keep on about that. Poor Sam. I guess that you were trying to please people and make them happy by letting them in.
Also I understand that Noel had an extended set, which was fabulous, it was just that I wasn't sure when he would end and so I thought I would have to walk out of the gig in order to get the last train home. I began worrying about the time rather than enjoying his jokes. That isn't your fault but perhaps you could start off earlier?
But overall it was a brilliant night out for my friend and I and we thouroughly enjoyed ourselves. It was lovely to meet you, you are such a friendly person! :). We shall definitely come again (In fact can you put us on the waiting list for december 10th? I'm, quite sure those tickets will go easily)
Thanks for your mail - and yes I know it was heaving in there last night but I wouldn't have missed it for the world!

I just wanted to say a massive thanks for last Saturday it was truly fantastic. Noel was on fire as per usual and the new material he did was brilliant. The turn out was unbelievable and can you tell Noel thanks for the extended set and that if it had run into 3am I doubt many people would have minded lol .Also I heard that his gig on Friday was rudely interrupted by hecklers which is awful but at least on Saturday (even though it was impossible to move) many were fans and enjoyed the show. It was the first time I had ever seen Simon Munnery and it won't be my last, he had me laughing really hard throughout his set.Lots of love

It was a great show on Saturday night, the comedians weer great. However, just a little bit of feedback in that I did think the venue was a bit overcrowded and it was quite uncomfortable in there as a result. Apart from that, great show.

The weather last Saturday did at least dawn brighter and drier than Friday. We had planned an absolute belter of a day, at least in terms of climbing. The charge sheet of cols was to read: Port de Bales, Superbagneres, Hospice de France and Portillon. We only managed the first two in the end, but they're still "HC" (Hors Categorie = beyond classification = as hard as you can get) climbs.
The Port de Bales was a superb climb, alternately shaded, twisting, wooded, open, and donor of lovely views of mountains and lush farmland. I loved it, despite an aching back towards the top and an aching knee all the way up. It was also 19km long. The P de B is best known perhaps for last year's incident on the Tour de France when Schleck the Younger's chain unshipped itself, leaving Bertie Booster free to build a lead that, with wry coincidence, was his margin of eventual victory. That chain came off allegedly because Andy was preparing to attack, and so selecting a bigger gear. Attack! On there! These boys aren't human. Still, we made it to the top in a reasonable state. The descent was nice too, but then again I love virtually all descents in the dry, being a lot more circumspect in the wet.
We reprised last year's luncheon arrangements in Luchon (we stopped there on the Raid Pyrenean), viz. a slice of pizza and a can of coke, from the same shop too, on the very pleasant tree-lined main boulevard of Bagneres-de-Luchon, to give it its full title. And then we tackled the climb of Superbagneres, a 16km pull up to a ski-station, a cul-de-sac. That didn't augur well, as neither of us are big fans of the up-and-back. From the moment we hit it, neither of us seemed to have our mojo. Mendip Rouleur's greater discomfort was on the ascent (I won't go into detail, but let's just say I now know that it's not only bears who repair to the woods for that particular activity), whilst mine was on the descent. As climbs go, it was ok, views, switchbacks and the like, but it just didn't have the magic of other ascents. We managed a coffee and hot choc respectively at a pretty exposed summit cafe, and then came the descent.....it was fast, sweeping, dry and should have been fun, but halfway down I knew something wasn't right. I was unfeasibly cold given the number of layers I was wearing, and I was feeling lightheaded to the point I was worried about blacking out. Now, descending a mountain on a bicycle at speeds up to 80kmh and with unprotected corners is not a good time to lose consciousness, even for a couple of seconds, so I stopped for a few minutes to eat and drink, and carried on. MR and I reconvened in Luchon where the temp was 19c and I was still freezing.
A piece of Gateau Basque was hurriedly consumed, but did nothing in the short term, so I had to sit behind MR on the 25km back to base. At the time, I thought maybe the previous weekend's virus-type thing had returned, brought on by the exertions of the 2 HC climbs, but now, looking back, I realise it was a classic case of 'bonking' - blood sugar drops to levels where you can't maintain power output. Cold, shivering, energyless, I should have known really, particularly as when we got closer to home I perked up a bit (the Gateau Basque hitting the system!). Thanks to MR for escorting me back at speeds approximately half of what I'd normally expect along what was basically 25km of fairly steady downhill. I thought I'd eaten plenty, and probably had a moderate amount during the ride itself. However, I'd been woefully short on the carbs front in the previous evening's meal - it just goes to show, you really can't mess with these mountains.
Sunday was our equivalent of a leisurely round of golf - we planned to do just two cols of any significance, the Hourquette d'Ancizan and the Aspin. The weather was a notch up again on Saturday, making it a superb day to be out on a bike, and even better, we had a good run on the flat (45km) before the first climb of the day, a leg warming distance denied to us the previous two days. We even had a quick stop in Arreau for no particular reason other than that we fancied it. After some debate, for neither of us were over-burdened with energy at this point, we decided to stick to our original plan and take the eastern approach of the Hourquette (10km at 10%). And boy, were we rewarded for that decision. It was superb, the best of the 3 days for me. On the lower slopes we were brought to a halt temporarily by a "Tour Pyrenean de Volants Anciennes" - old cars driving over various cols, including (cars not cols), Citroens from the '50s, restored La Poste vans, open-topped Mercedes that would be the vehicular equivalent of ladies-of-a-certain-age, and the inevitable 2cv's. What a great moment that was, good humour all round.
And the rest of the climb continued in the same vein. It was narrow, quiet, well-paved as usual, shaded (which was welcome), had the most unbelievable views at the top, but the best thing for me was that my legs started working for some reason. Whereas all my previous climbing had been fairly laboured, all of a sudden it was, well, if not easy as such, then certainly pleasurable. I put it down to the entire packet of jaffa cakes i consumed in a 10 minute period the previous evening, after a 3 course meal where I'd had two helpings of main course. Hardly surprising I guess - just doing some maths and assuming an average hourly calorific consumption of 700, I needed 5 days worth of extra food to fuel those 3 days of riding. God knows how the professionals keep it up for 3 weeks at a time.
Anyway, the descent of the Hourquette was fast and furious, calmed only in the last few km by hundreds of daytrippers, and after a quick ice cream we started the Aspin, the bases of each being only a few hundred metres apart. Climbing form was maintained up there, but it wasn't novel, having covered the same ground on the Raid. That time, however, the descent was in the wet, whereas this time it was dry, and if the Hourquette was the best climb of the trip, this was head-and-shoulders the best bit of downhill - long, clear bits of road to really build up some pace, corners both tight and wide to keep it interesting, and vehiclar overtaking opportunities, which I particularly love. I don't think the speedometer dropped below 50kmh at any point, and sat between 60 and 70kmh for a lot of the time. C'est magnifique.
We celebrated by finally managing a civilised lunch at a lovely cafe in Arreau, galettes and salad all round. From there it was a 45km cruise back up the D26 valley road to Bertren, on an archtypal lazy summer, Sunday afternoon, to complete the riding for the trip.
This post is already too long, so I'm going to leave it there, and put one more on tomorrow that picks up a few final reflections on our 3 days.
So me and Mendi Prouleur (as I prefer to read his hashtag) have just returned from three days of riding in the Pyrenees. We both agreed that we're boring both ourselves and our select and small (but beautiful) audiences with posts that consist of little more than a route description, so this one is going to be, well just that.....but this is the Pyrenees for goodness sake, not Somerset or the Peak District.
I will, however, divide the account into two, and resist telling you, for example, detail of the content of our pre-flight sandwiches on Thursday. The riding started on Friday morning, having managed to assemble our bikes on Thursday night. I'd been tracking the forecast all week, and it had been one of those occasions when I'd been hoping it was going to prove inaccurate. It didn't. To be fair, when we left Bertren, it wasn't actually raining, merely damp and misty, but a warm kind of damp and misty. So warm in fact that when we started our first climb of the day just after St. Beat, the Col de Mente, I had to stop after a km to remove my base layer (a term we cyclists/runners use to unnecessarily glamorise what is basically a vest). The sweat was pouring off, and not having done sufficient research on that particular col, I overcooked it on the lower slopes. I did, however, settle into a rhythm, and we wound our way to the top. As we congratulated ourselves, looked at the various signs and plaques, and had a feed, the rain started to fall increasingly hard, and with every extra 30 seconds we were there, an extra layer of clothing was added, mindful as we were of the descent.
And a jolly wet descent it was too, more wet than jolly truth be told. And directly at the bottom the ascent of the Col de Portet d'Aspet starts, which, whilst clearly not easy, isn't the beast it's sometimes made out to be. Far out it ain't. Obligatory photos for the second year running at the Casartelli memorial, and a rest at the top to delve into our very capacious, sensible saddle bags (which, let's face it, would get an admiring glance or two on an audax) in a search for more layers of clothing, prefaced another wet descent, a merciful few minutes of dryness, and then a wet sprint along the valley floor to St. Girons. Our vision of lunch had been something like: seated at a characterful roadside cafe in the middle of town, doffing our cycling caps to all those murmuring 'chapeau' as they wandered past on their French way, ordering a cheeky croc-m'sieur and a couple of slices of strong coffee whilst the sun bathed us in its rays of bright light (it's its height in the sky you know). The reality: a sandwich and coke wolfed down at the front of a supermarket, lingering as little as possible so as not to freeze too much.
The weather in the afternoon changed......for the worse. It was bouncing off the road, necessitating a short period of respite in a bus shelter that had clearly seen less innocuous activities than waiting for public transport if the assortment of medical items on the floor was any guide. We got on our way, and bagged another couple of minor cols before finishing the day's climbing off with the Col des Ares. I achieved a minor and rather sad ambition here of getting to the top of a not-insignificant col in the big ring of my bike. I'm sure my knees will take their revenge later in life. At the top of the Ares we commented how ironic it would be if, when we dropped into the next (home) valley the sun were shining and the roads dry, and our hosts greeted us with increduality when we recounted our tales of storm and cloud. And guess what? Irony ruled, and we did have a final dry couple of miles home. However, the black-streaked faces, dirty kit and general air of being pulled though a hedge backwards convinced those at base of our war stories.
I'm going to leave it there for now, and pick up Saturday's story later. The weekend might even be a tale of three posts, and I shall explain the title of this one in due course. Let's end on a note of me being an ar$e. Brain was definitely in neutral when I was unpacking for the day, and could I find the cash and credit card I'd taken out with me? Could I heck. They weren't anywhere to be found, so we had to drive back over two cols (and this on a day when we had to go down 25km to Luchon in search of our evening meal anyway) in search. They weren't there. That's because they were on the floor of our room, around 1 metre away from my bed. Still, greater humblings were to come the next day...
Events have conspired against any meaningful riding this weekend. Those events have been the non-return of BH bike (the mythical bottom bracket not having yet appeared, and I must confess I'm getting a tiny bit nervous given I've got to have the thing back by Tuesday lunchtime at the latest), and some sort of virus or something that's left me feeling achy and energy-less. I'm interpreting this as fate telling me to have a rest before the exertions that are coming.
So, it's a short post this week, in anticipation of two pretty meaty ones over the next couple of weeks. On Thursday Mendip Rouleur and I fly to Toulouse and then travel on to the Pyrenees for 3, possibly 3.5, days riding up Pyrenean hills. The temperature at our base in the valley was 36c yesterday, and it's still forecast to be upper 20s next weekend. Can't wait. The biggest challenge is picking the right cycling gear, as although it might be warm in the valleys, the weather at the top of the higher cols can be quite, quite different.
We're back on Bank Holiday Monday, so next update on here will be a week Tuesday, just two days before I depart again on our London-Paris jaunt.
Had BH been available tonight I would have hit the hills - it was sunny, reasonably warm, and the number of opportunities to go out after work are dwindling rapidly. (Partly because I'm on hols for the best part of three weeks v soon, so it's not the worst situation in the world). However, BH wasn't available, still being at the bike hospital, because it has an unusually small bottom bracket, and the bike Drs. Dave and Dave (Big & Little) are currently struggling to find a donor. They tell me they've put out a special appeal, and they're confident we should be well on the way to recovery by Friday night. (I'm bursting to use a smiley emoticon here, but I've resisted through all previous posts, so I'm not going to succumb now). I almost asked to see the patient, but realised just in time how sad that would have been. So I didn't.
So to the garage it was for today's dose of exercise, and the turbo trainer therein. I'm not entirely sure why the word 'turbo' is used in their description - essentially they're static trainers with a magnetic flywheel being used to create resistance against the back wheel of the bike, so simulating being out on the road with its wind- and rolling-resistance. Anyhow, with the Pyrenees only 8 days away now, I decided it was time for one of my copyright sessions for Improving Your Climbing. It's probably not that unique, but sometimes it's nice to think you thought of something. Here's the recipe:
-several phone directories under the front wheel to create an upward angle between rear and front wheel of about 8%. I know it makes no difference to the resistance, but it replicates the body shape you're in when you climb
- biggest gear, good resistance on the trainer so that pedalling at about 70-72 rpm produces a power output of about 90-95% of functional threshold of power, or if you don't know that, about 85-90% of maximum heart rate
- watch as small songbirds fly into the garage to bathe in the puddles of sweat that have now gathered all around
- pretend that you're chasing the leaders of the Tour de France up an Alpine or Pyrenean climb of your choice as a slightly pathetic means of staying motivated (the most modern virtual reality trainers can now either be pre-programmed to reproduce classic climbs by altering the resistance and its duration, or you can download routes from your satnav that you've previously ridden, and again they'll be re-produced by the trainer and its software. When I win the lottery...)
- collapse into the shower utterly exhausted, but knowing that only 60 minutes in the torture chamber has produced some genuine gain. And indeed a loss - 909 calories in my case tonight.
Ok, it's not as interesting as a real ride, but it's efficient, and just occasionally efficiency beats beauty.
..it would have been more prescient if I'd written that last Sunday wouldn't it? Back to that in a minute.
I was torn about my subject matter this week. This blog was initiated principally to chronicle four key events, and the preparation for them, for which I was going to seek sponsorship this year. And yet regular readers will know it's covered more than that, albeit that most of the subject matter has resolved around athletic pursuits of one kind or another.
This week, however, there has been very little that feels blogworthy on that front. Sure, me & Mrs K have had a very pleasant ride of 16 miles along the Middlewood Way this afternoon, one of those new footpaths and bridleways that sit where once there was a thriving railway line - the Macclesfield to Marple line in this case. And yes, as threatened at the end of last week, I did get a long solo ride in - 83 miles in 4.5 hours yesterday. Not quite as far as I might have done, but I did manage to simulate the effects of 'bonking' (depletion of glycogen stores for any non-cyclists; why on earth that word was chosen I don't know, but then again, from an etymological and chronological point of view I don't know for sure that it doesn't pre-date the more modern meaning) by not eating breakfast, and only taking 1 bottle of energy drink and 3 small cereal bars with me. This clearly wasn't enough, and I crawled the last 10 miles home. And there were indeed 3 deeply exciting turbo-trainer sessions earlier in the week as I get to within 10 days of leaving home to go and do some Pyrenean riding. I've also continued the bike prep, with both the Pyrenees and the London-Paris mounts needing new chains, cassettes and bottom brackets. My wallet winced. Better safe than sorry though; whether in the mist of the midi-Pyrenees or the flatlands of the Pas de Calais, I really won't need a mechanical.
So yes, there was all that - and then there were the riots. I'm not going to talk about them directly - there's been plenty of that too, and as the news media loves and needs stories to justify its existence, there's been no shortage of analysis, discussion and debate this week. Which, frankly, has left me nearly as infuriated as the events themselves - for each individual out there rioting and looting, there's a different combination of factors at play, whether they be opportunity, anger, gang-influences, resentment of authority, a genuine sense of grievance, and probably dozens more. But it's all too easy to identify the causes, as many have, and come up with instant, easy solutions. In fact, it becomes a kind of media-entertainment to do so, made respectable by cloaking it with the label of 'analysis'. It seems to me that a package of changes is necessary to change attitudes and behaviour, and it'll be some combination of those changes that act on each individual in a slightly different, but still positive way.
What really struck me this week was the final manifestation of the breakdown of the covenant that seems to have existed for some decades between the governing and what might loosely be called 'the middle class'. This is absolutely not party political, as my sense this week was of a disbelief from those on all/both sides of the Right/Left divide that this should be allowed to happen. It could be argued that for some decades the covenant that has existed has suited many in the middle, whether they be, as I say, broadly Left or Right-leaning. That covenant was based on the one hand of the 'middle' allowing the governing classes (particularly Tory but Labour too over the last couple of decades) their wealth, their knighthoods, their cosy post-political career lordships, ladyships, quango positions or non-executive directorships. In return, the Left broadly got a social democracy with the health service and welfare state (though not as strong a model as many Scandinavian countries), whilst the Right broadly got a market-based economy and average levels of taxation and interference in private lives in comparison to similar western states. Both got law, order and, despite our deeply-ingrained British cynicism, a basic trust in those governing us, whether they be politicians, bankers, civil servants, police or healthcare professionals.
To me, it feels like we're all disappointed and shocked. We've known for a while that politicians are 'in it for themselves', whether that be petty nest-lining like the expenses scandal, or the professionalisation of politics where power is the only end, where politicians have had no other meaningful career, and principle takes its place at the back of the stage. The Left is disappointed, or at least it should be, for despite the significant increase in tax take as a proportion of national income that happened under the last government, our great institutions of healthcare and education manifestly lag their equivalents in many other western democracies. The Right is disappointed, possibly for the same reason, but certainly because it feels that the welfare state is too big and government at all levels lacks humanity and empathy. And both sides are disappointed, with both our futile foreign interventions (Afghanistan and Libya), our flawed bankers (and they are deeply flawed, believe me, as I saw the excesses of HBOS from the inside), and then, last week, the police, who clearly, manifestly, weakly, failed to prevent disorder and law-breaking. Police by consent by all means, but primarily with the consent of victims rather than law-breakers. I actually heard one policeman comment (don't think it was Sir Hugh Orde, but what a prize ar$e that man is) "if we'd done things differently, a lot more people would have got hurt". He was referring to the rioters. Let me just see if I'd have minded..... and as for Greater Manchester Police, they couldn't have had a clearer warning of what was about to happen if Frank Gallagher himself had turned up at Force HQ on Monday with a megaphone, shouting "it's all going to go off in Salford and the Arndale tomorrow". And whether you want to choose the excesses of the BBC or the tripling of student fees, there are countless more examples of the middle Left and the middle Right feeling let down.
And where does that lead? To revolution in many places, but we don't do those in the UK do we, so we'll probably just settle for a good grumble instead. Which is what this has been....
...to yesterday's exertions. Today I had planned to do a good long ride - there have been plenty of short sharp rides lately, and no little amount of climbing, but I wanted to remind my body what it's like to ride for 5, 6 hours or more.
No chance. I am so beaten up after yesterday. Everything is sore; I genuinely feel like I've been beaten up. With 1,722 feet of ascent and descent in 7.3 miles, and the underfoot conditions as I described them in yesterday's blog, I guess that's hardly surprising, though not having done any 'proper' running since the marathon probably hasn't helped. I suppose I could have sat on a bike today if my life had depended on it, but it wouldn't have been much fun.
Instead, I have been preparing my bicycles for both the Pyrenees, and the the London-Paris ride (mustn't forget that's the 'La Manche' element of this blog - what am I going to call it once that's done?), which was the bigger job. Pedals needed swapping from SPD-SL to straightforward SPDs (apologies non-cyclists), sturdier wheels needed putting on, the rack re-fitting, and the back brake needs sorting out - have had to engage Dave & Dave (Little & Big) at the splendidly-named "Bikes" in Macclesfield to assist with that one. (As an aside, these two guys are so authentically Maxonian that when the Joy Division film "Control" was being shot locally these two were briefly employed to help the actors with the local dialect; they are diamonds of the finest calibre). I also confirmed that the seat post on the 'best' bike, the BH, comes out too, so that confirms I hope that I'll be able to do the necessary dissembly required to get it in a bike box.
I've managed to do some stretching and some core exercises this afternoon, so the day hasn't been totally wasted from an exercise point of view. And I did manage a couple of rides round variations of my flattish Cheshire Loop this week, so it's been 7 days of maintenance rather than progress. Right, am off to plan an interesting 100 miler for next weekend, which is definitely going to be done, rain, hail, shine or indeed fell races.
Every year the Macclesfield Sheep Dog Trials are held (cue jokes about most of them being found guilty). They are held just a couple of fields away from our house, and each year we say we really ought to go and support them. In addition to the sheep dog element there are plenty of other honest country pursuits featured too - corn dolly making, tug-o-war competitions, and ethnic minority lynching. Ok, I made the last one up, but this is the kind of event much favoured by the kind of folk who think the Countryside Alliance are a bunch of townie do-gooders. Anyway, there are two staples of the weekend, the Sunday night concert in the Grand Marquee (this year featuring the Grumbleweeds - how are we going to resist that?), and the Saturday afternoon fell race. Well, this year I decided to support the event by having a go at said race - the Teggs Nose Fell Race.
I made that decision 43 minutes before the event was due to start; the rain was holding off, I decided that the bike-mechanicing currently needed could wait till tomorrow, and so it was on with the running lycra, vaseline and trail running shoes. Five of my English pounds later I was be-numbered and on the start line with about another 100 or so hardies. Slightly surreally the man getting us under starter's orders was Nicholas Winterton, though I think he adds a 'Sir' these days. So, one speech later we were off on the 7.5 mile course.
And it turned our to be the hardest 73 minutes of physical exercise I've had in ages. Typically, everyone went off at a mad pace, and I was soon to regret it when we hit the first hill. Let me try to paint a picture. Apart from the first and last mile, there was literally no flat surfaces. At its most benign the course took us through thistle- and nettle-dominated farmers' fields, where dodging the cow pats was as challenging as the terrain. At its most evil, the uphill was like mountaineering and the downhill was steeper than a ski jump. It was a battle just to stay on two feet, and I don't think many of us managed it, needing the assistance of our backside to descend. In between the uncomfortable and the benign were the footpaths of Teggs Nose Country Park, twisting, turning, and going through endless gates. When the sun came out the flies were attracted to us in the same way you see them round a cow's behind, and when it didn't the atmosphere was muggy and repressive. All in all, it was fairly hard work, and there were times I wasn't completely sure I was enjoying myself. Particularly when I slipped in an especially muddy gateway, caking my lower limbs in an bovine-related digestive by-product.
However, I made it back it in one piece, and it only took about 10 minutes to decide that I'd really quite enjoyed in. If I have a go next year I'll probably do a modicum of extra preparation. I think the winners did it in about 53 minutes to my 73, but hey ho, there were plenty coming in still at 93 minutes. It wasn't cycling, and I'm not entirely sure how much cross-training benefit there was, but it was better than the turbo-trainer!
Don't let people push you down. Don't let them persuade you. Stand ABOVE the crowd. Live the life you KNOW you want to, and when you do, push everything to the limits. Life is short, and you only live THIS life once.
I'm sorry that I haven't been blogging for a very long time. Although, I have been out of New York for a while. Maybe I should greet more properly for the ones that cannot speak or understand the French language.
Hey guys! I'm taking a self vacation in Paris for a while! It's just so that I can get away from the stress and industry in New York. I haven't been talking to anyone for a while... Je vais vous prêter ma voix.
To Lenna: Comment va la vie!? (How's life!?) I'm sorry I haven't been calling you... Although I have been reading you posts... I guess that counts, minus the response... I've got a large wheel of cheese for you. I'm sending it sometime soon... That and some clothes I've picked out for you...
To Jeremey: Um... Paris looks nice... It's old world, people smoke (DON'T START SMOKING), and everywhere I go it smells like perfume... Some of the perfume here smells like lilacs and some of it smells terrible. Be good, and don't cause trouble for Lenna...
Sorry 'bout the whole not-posting-thing. I was in California visiting Sky and her aunt. They're both good. AND SKY IS COMING HOME!!!! H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS YEAH!!! I think Drew's not happy about it though. He liked being the only teenager in my life. Poor thing. She's bringing her aunt with her. they're going to live with us when I get out of May's and move back in with mom.
Oh, yeah. My mom is getting better. She's been going to parenting classes and therapy, and has apologized for everything. Father's day pasted and she didn't shed a single tear about dad. She even got a better job that pays, like, three times her old salary. She came to California with us to see Sky too, so everything's good with that. She's oficially our mom again (including Sky). We have to get a bigger house to fit Sky and her aunt, but with mom's new job. I have to keep my job until we're back on our feet, but mom said that was only temporary. She's really stepping up. Jeremy's the happiest of all though.
Sky's aunt is like 50-something, and AWESOME! She's the most awesome old lady I've ever met. No wonder Sky didn't want to leave. She's like the not-related-awesome-aunt-who's-actually-your-parents'-friend person in the family. We also found out about Sky's mom and dad a little. I'm not going to tell you what we found because it's not my information to tell. Maybe Sky will.
Well, good news, I got a scholarship to the dance school that May's in. The original person who got the scholarship was evidently not appropriate for the school. They got into a lot of trouble and caused chaos pretty much everywhere he went. I was second in line from the audition.
The bad news is that my mom is starting to be a mother again. That probably sounds bad for me to say, but when you know someone as one thing for your whole life, then they completely change, it's hard to deal with. My father left right after I was sent to the hospital, and my mom got all depressed. I mean, I love and hate my mom all at the same time, but she's being a mom for the wrong reasons. She's using it as a way to distract herself from the fact that she's stuck in a life she doesn't want to be in. She yelled at me for taking care of Jeremy the other day, claiming it was 'her job' and I was being selfish. I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF JEREMY SINCE EVER!!! How dare she? She can't just walk into our lives after all these years and pretend that she automatically gets the right!!!
I'm recovered enough to function, thank god! I got Drew to stop being such a bodyguard, sorta, and start being my boyfriend. Sorry, that word just doesn't fit him well. He's still paranoid about me 24/7, but hey, it's his nature to be protective. I swear, he litterally growls at any guy that takes interest in me. We were walking around Broadway today, and this group of guys came past and looked at me, and Drew over reacted. If you saw the glare he was giving them, you'd know the definition to the expression, 'If looks could kill-'.
Jeremy and I are moving in with May. You see, my dad evidently decided to just get up and leave my mom. Not that anything about her attitude has changed by it, but I just don't want to be there when she decides to snap. I already called Sky. She agrees with the whole deal. She's in California. Sky has been roaming slowly on the road to recovery. When she went out there, she found her ACTUAL aunt. I'm happy for her, but I'm worried that she'll like that family so much better that she won't come back to New York. Yeah . . .
*sigh* Okay people that's gonna move in, don't do anything stupid at my place.. Use common sense. AND TRY TO KEEP IT CLEAN! That includes the little boy... Abide by these rules...
3. If you bring over other friends (You gotta tell me) and they piss me off then all ya'll gotta go.
hi this is jeremy and lenna just got out of the hosptial and i'm really happy because she's gonna be okay and she can still make me chocolate milk when she gets better so because i was happy i ran around the house in my Nemo underwear until i got tired and so then Lenna called and told me that we're going to move in with her friend May and then i went and found Soggy Pup and told him we were moving to a new place and that we should be happy and then we went on the computer and i played three games of solitare and won all three and then Soggy Pup fell off the chair and i got so upset that i fell over too and then i went to go find the baby sitter so she could put a band aid on him
Why is all of this happening? First Sky leaves, then Lenna gets injured and Jason is a bit pissing me off. Lenna, you better get Sky back in New York. I don't give a d*mn if you slap the living h*ll out of her.. I'll help you find her if you wish... But, I don't think my services are any use to you....
As for Jason... D*mn. I haven't seen him in a while... Well, you know in the day time. At night, this guy is everywhere. Okay first he goes to some high end bar. Next night, goes to some high end restaurant... You get the point... Also, the same guys that were with him the one night, are always with him... What the f*ck! I'm still tracking down where he's going to every night. Not to mention I've order some equipment for it too...
Lenna get your butt out of the hospital right now. It seems as though we need to take care of somethings.
Well, I was walking home from school, late. I had stayed after to finish a test. I, quite stupidly, decided to take a different way home, and where we live, there’s gang violence. I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. A bunch of meat-heads were huddled around and talking, and I didn’t realize they were there until I stepped around the corner noisily. BIG MISTAKE! The thugs were obviously doing something illegal, and thought that I would nark them out. Let’s just say, there were a bunch of deadly ‘equipment’ in their possession. In the end, there were no guys at the corner anymore, and a very bloody, and broken me. A couple ladies were on the way to a friend’s house and they noticed me. Thank god too. Any longer in the condition I was in, and they would have had to call in a murder investigation team. I was transported to the hospital, and had to go through surgery to have the bullet taken out of my shoulder, and to stop the internal bleeding from when they beat the crap out of me. Now, all that’s left is a few broken ribs, a broken collar bone, a broken left wrist (I’m typing with one hand), and a bunch of bruises. But I’m not all paranoid about sounds behind me or anything, if you were wondering. Not much emotional trauma for me. Drew on the other hand . . .
OH YEAH!!! Drew and I are together now. He‘s been watching over my shoulder ever since he found out what happened. It’s getting kind of annoying. I love him and all, but really, a girl needs her space. I think he blames himself for what happened. He thinks it happened because he wasn’t there to walk me home like he usually is. Now though, he won’t leave me alone AT ALL! Think about it. If Drew were with me that day, he would’ve been attacked too. What good would that do? They’d just get him AND me. Drew’s buff and all (A FREAKIN’ 6 PACK! SCORE!), but there were like eight guys. He’d only be able to handle himself for like 3 seconds. *sigh*
Jeremy’s fine. After a lot of lying, he is completely oblivious to what happened. (And I made sure he couldn’t read this post) He’s almost 8 now. Breaks my heart.
Sky on the other hand. She left for California right after I came back. She’ll return, it’s just that life isn’t exactly ideal for her right now. Abusive beau, negligent parents, and drugs. Yeah. My parents are being negligent to all three of us, but Jeremy never really knew them, I’ve known them all my life, but Sky was adopted by them. She feels betrayed. Her biological parents didn’t want her, and now her current parents don’t want any of us. And to think they were once good parents . . .
Lenna, anyone out there, I need some help doing some work. Come see me at my place sometime tommorow. It's really important. It's about Jason.
Yesterday night (I'm sorry I didn't take anyone along with me) I was watching Jason come out of his apartment and so, I followed him. (Yes, I was stalking him) I don't think he noticed I was there... I hope not.. On the safe side, I kept my distance. He walked for a couple of blocks and stopped to take a look around. I swear, I turned around until he continued walking. He took a turn into an alley, so I just entered some random corner store and watched from the window if he was gonna come out. Turns out, the only thing that came out was a black SUV. I figured he was in there.. I waited till the SUV stopped at an intersection.. I pulled over a cab and told the driver to follow it. Sure enough, the ride lasted for quite a while. About fifty minutes.... Anyway, the SUV stopped at some random bar. I waited till he got out, and well, I was right... He was inside the vehicle... Well, he came out, went in the bar with five other guys in black suits. (Note the five guys were much older) I went inside a few minutes after he went in. Still kept my distance.
Lemme tell you, this place is huge! I've been in a bar once. But, that was nothing. This place had class..... Uh, anyway, back to subject, I took a seat by the wall and just eyed him from the corner of my eye. (I didn't drink any alcoholic beverages) He went into some back room so, I just decided to get up, and walked back there. Yes, I got stopped and I told him I needed to use the bathroom. Which, I went in the bathroom and locked it, not to mention checked if there was anyone else in there with me. (Nope no one there.) So, I pretty much tried to listen through the vents.... I got soft mumbles... And the words that came out, didn't make anysense... I just called it quits. Went out the bar and went home with something to think about.
I need help. I kissed Lenna a couple days ago and she is completely avoiding me. I've tried calling her many times, but it goes straight to voicemail. I REALLY hope this is NOT her way of telling me she doesn't like me back. This is really awkward. I shouldn't have done anything at all. This could completely destroy our friendship. GOD I'M AN IDIOT!!! I've never actually met her friend May, but if it means finding out where Lenna is, then I'll go out of my way to ask.
If you're thinking, 'Have you tried going to her house,' then, yes, I have. Her parents are the ones that answer the door. I asked them and they told me they haven't seen Lenna since yesterday morning. Not that they care. I really hate those people for treating Lenna, Jeremy and Sky the way they haave been. One day they justt woke up and decided not to care anymore. Nice. Now, Lenna does most of the parental work for Jeremy. She has to pay for most things. Like the bills. The only reason she still lives with her parents is because she's 16, and can't legally live on her own. Sky helps out sometimes, but I think Lenna wants her to be a normal teenager. Sky doesn't complain about that. Neither does Lenna. *sigh*
Okay. Well, As far as I'm concerned, Jason and I have been going out for 2 weeks.... And there's a problem... I think... Um, there's more than one problem. It's two technically... One, he said something to me about some buisness of his... I really don't know what the f*ck that's all about. Two, he says that I could be in trouble if I hang out with him... I really don't know what the f***ing h*ll is going on!!! This all happened when he saw me heading back to my aparment and he stopped me. "I think, we should hang out anymore. I don't want you to get hurt." That was what Jason said. WTF? Really? So, I asked him why ("Why? Is it that bad of an ordeal?"), all I got from him was: "It's something I wouldn't want you to know about. You'll hate me for life." He hugged me, kissed me, and walked away without saying anything.
Can anyone tell me any leads to what they think is going on!? For all you guys out there. I'm trying to avoid anyone I meet. I'm not in a very good mood. More of depression than sadness...
I'm Lenna's friend, as she has told you. I wasn't going to post until like this weekend or something. Oh well.
On a somewhat better note, ever since I joined the basketball team, girls have been flirting with me more. Lenna seems pretty freaked out by this. She thinks that I'll replace her with some cheerleader. She should know that I don't like any other people but her. I don't even like her sister, and she's popular for crying out loud! Most guys would be thrilled to have a bunch of girls all over them, but I've only got my eyes on one . . .
GOD I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS SECRECY ANYMORE!!! Lenna, if you're reading this, come to my house when you get a chance, okay? We need to talk.
Hi. I'm May.... May Cruz... Lenna didn't probably tell you that new comers were gonna start blogging, but now you know. (I don't know why I should just get a facebook account... I think it'd be cooler. But now, with all those freaks out there... yeah) Anyway, I moved in from Santa Barbara, CA at the end of January. It was on the twenty ninth I flew in to New York. To tell you the truth, I f***ing love it here! I miss all the glorious sun and heat, but I can deal with snow. Um, I actually flew in cause I got accepted at a dance academy... For ballet.... I'd like to do something other than ballet. But, I'll see if I'll change my mind. My parents are back in Cali, and my sibling, (my amazing brother) is at MIT up in Boston... I gotta skyline apartment in NY. (thank you mother and father) and I got great friends: Lenna, Samantha (We haven't told you about her yet), Sky (Kinda)........ Jeremy.... Not to mention my dream guy Jason.... Jason Raskolnicov. Jason plays the guitar. Both classical and electric. To be honest, he's soo talented at it... AND he has the most AMAZING green eyes I have ever seen. He's Russian for your information. We haven't been going out as much as you'd like to suspect, but he's really fun and cute to hang out with. Not to mention the 2 pack abs.. Now that's something to brag about. He doesn't take steriods just to let you all know... Well, I gotta go guys. Jason's waiting for me to got out tonight. I'll be posting some other time.
A little girl named, Malory, has evidently stolen the heart of my dear seven year old brother (note the dramatic voice). She is a cute kid, but she is being really mean to Jere. She and her friend Cameron were harassing him because he told her he liked her. No, actually this is what he told me exactly, "Lenna, what's a naz*? Because Malory's mommy told me I was one when I asked her if I could marry Malory." I bet the look on my face was priceless. IT IS NOT EVEN THAT TIME PERIOD ANYMORE!!! So many bad words went through my head in that second, all directed towards her mom. I will not stand here and LET that b**** call MY baby brother names like that without actually making sure he was first. I AM LIVID!!! Drew and I went downtown this afternoon when I left Jere with Sky. He told me that my face was going to stay that red if I stayed angry. Ooh when I next see her . . .
Oh yeah, Drew. He is still acting really weird around me. Today he was staring at this couple making out, and had an unreadable expression freakin' plastered to his face. IT IS SO ANNOYING WHEN HE DOESN'T TELL ME WHAT IS GOING THROUGH HIS HEAD!!! I am his best friend, and he should be able to tell me everything. Why isn't he? *gasp* Maybe he's found a girlfriend that he isn't telling me about. Ooh when I find out . . .
Anyway, like a month ago I tried out for the scholarship program at one of the professional dance schools near here. I didn't make it, but I did meet a very interesting person. She's about my age, and she is in the school's top dance class. We've been talking a lot more lately and have found that we have become very good friends. So, let me see, my social group has grown from just Drew and me to Drew, my new dance friend, and me. I'm not going to tell you her name yet because she wants to introduce herself. I gave her the user and pass, so now she will be posting as well.
And did I mention that after my parents fought, my dad left and hasn't been home since? No? Well now you know. I don't really care though, they stopped caring about us YEARS ago.
today lenna told me that she didnt like the name jerry. i told her that malory liked it so thats what i wanted to be called, but she still said she didnt like it. so now my name is jer wich threw me off today because i was in math and my teacher started calling me up the board but she was calling me jerry so i didnt go up and i got in trouble because i wasnt answering to my name and then malory laughed at me and that made me feel bad. then i told teacher that i was jerr now and not jerry but she kept forgetting and spelling my name wrong and i was so confused and i started crying and then cameron went up to me and punched me in the face and called me a crybaby but im not a crybaby. i started to cry harder and then malory started laughing and she was calling me a crybaby, so i just went and sat on the swings and sniffed and wiped my eyes and a nice little girl name lilly came up and sat next to me and told me that she crys a lot too. so now my new best friend is lilly and we played soccer together after school until i had to go home because sky came and grabbed my arm and started scolding me for not telling her where i was going and for dragging this little girl off to play a boy sport and how that was so sexist so i started crying again. and when i got home i went and got a glass of milk and spilled the whole gallon on the floor because i was crying so hard because cameron and malory were calling me a crybaby and that i had a new friend named lilly who i was treating sexist and how i didnt know what sexist meant. so i took off my shirt that had milk all over it and my shorts and went and sat on the couch with my knees up to my chest and practiced my times tables all the way up to one hundred and then i felt better and went and brought my milky clothes to lenna and she washed them and got me some milk and a sippy cup. then everything was all better and i was in my Nemo underwear so that made me happy and i started skipping down the halls until i tripped and fell and slapped my cheek against the floor and started crying again and rocking back and forth on the floor and practicing my maths in my head. then lenna found me and put me in the bathtub and hosed the milk off me.
So I figures since we are going to tell our whole life's story on here, we might as well describe somewhat of ourselves.
Hair- Long, dyed dark brown with some blonde streaks, straightened every morning because of natural waviness (used to be all blonde)
hey hey i found a ch-cheese puff on the floor and i ate it and it was gross and i told lenna and she laughed an called me a dummy
Okay so I told my closest about our blog and they wanteed to join. So now this thing is more of a me and my friends type thing. I also let Jeremy post aswell since he seems pretty interested in it, but he sucks at the whole 'grammar and spelling' thing, but he IS only in first grade, so please don't say anything about it and spare his feelings.
Anyway, Drew has been acting all weird lately and it's kind of creeping me out. We've been friends since who knows when, but I can feel something changing. (Oh yeah, Drew is going to start posting too) We have never let anyone else interfere with our close relationship, and I really hope that doesn't change. He's never really been interested in hanging out with anyone but me, but ever since he made it on the basketball team people have been noticing him more. He tells me it's anoying and he tries to ignore them, but what if he is starting to want to be friends with people other than me? I wouldn't be able to take it. It hurts just to think about it. I asked him about it the other day, and he told me he would never let anyone get inbetween us. Sky already does it enough. They CAN NOT STAND each other. And it's kinda weird to be stuck in the middle of your adopted twin sister, and your best friend who is practically your brother. I ahve known Drew longer than Sky by the way.
If it isn't the other people that are making him act differently around me, than what is the reason?
hi i'm jeremy darmona. i am 7. my sister lenna told me that i needed to learn to tipe. i can't spell, but i can tipe. she set me down in front of the computer and told me that i was gonna learn to tipe. that was two weeks ago, and i did wat she told me, 'cause sometimes she bonks me on the hed litely. so does sky.
anyway, i was at the park today, and i saw this girl malory that i really like. i want to marry her, only her mom said that she didn't want her daughter to marry a yellow-haired nazi with devil eyes. i didn't know what a nazi was, so i told her that i wasn't one and i still wanted to marry malory. she said that jews dont marry nazis. i was mad so i bit her and she chased me over the park until she fell over breathing really funny and i kept running.
then i ran into mister parker's dog and he started to chase me, and then i ran up to the apartment and ran into sky. she didnt look really happy. i asked her to give me a band aid because i fell on the side walk and cut my nee. she said i wasnt bleeding so i didnt get one. then i got a cup of milk and every thing was all better.
then i sat around an thought about malory and how her mom had called me a nazi and how i didn't know what that was. i got mad and fell off my chair and spilled milk everywhere, and lenna ran in and picked me up and carried me over to the sink and she wiped my face with a rag. i told her about malory and she told me i was a moron. i don't know what a moron is, but i thought that it meant that i was smart, and i like being called smart, so i told her thank you and went to sleep on the couch with my blankie and soggy pup and sucked my thumb.
So as my sister has told you, there was a drug testing thing at my school. I was lucky! You know what, I hate homework. And hooca. But.... If you belive that u are so right. Anyway I am bored and need a drink, so I am going to a party tonight. I am bored and I have better things to do. So . . .
Yesterday nothing out of the ordinary happened. We went to school after dropping Jeremy off, picked Jeremy up from school, dropped him off at Mrs. Daniels's house, went to work, came back at 7 p.m., picked up Jeremy, and went home. As I said, nothing out of the ordinary.
Today though, was interesting. The senior I told you about, he evidentally did end up going to jail. I need to look into how long his term is . . . Anyway, because of him, all the kids in the school were called up one by one for drug testing. It was quite amusing actually. The kids that looked like they were about to pee their pants were obviously the druggies. When I took the test, the nurses looked at me suspiciously.
