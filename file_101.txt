When that one shows up as an actual title three months from now with a badly-Photoshopped cover of a cross with a face, I will thank you.
If that becomes a real one, it will take the honor of greatest title ever from ‘Pounded by the Pound: Turned Gay by the Socioeconomic Implications of Britain Leaving the European Union’. Second place is obviously ‘Heavy Metal Unicorn Lawyer Sings Into My Butthole Legally’. Wait, that latter one sounds like it could be a Jacob/Joe Slipshine, which makes it better…I’ve decided to flip those two in my rankings.
I was particularly fond of Slammed in the Butt by My Hugo Award Nomination, which he used to troll the Gamergater trolls trying to troll the Hugos by nominating him for one. 🙂
This has become my headcanon, only it has burst through the walls of headcanondom and become reality. Sorry, Willis, if that’s not what you were planning, but there are four lights and all.
When I was younger I wanted to legally change my name to drop my middle name. Nothing wrong with “Michael”, it just didn’t speak to me. Maybe Jocelyn J. Brown is Joycelyn L. Brown’s nom de plume. Why not?
I wanted to change my name for the longest time (especially after making what retroactively feels like a huge mistake and using my real name online), and for a long time I thought I could only do it when I got married b/c LOL WHY QUESTION THE PATRIARCHY
then I finally got married and just changed the spelling of my middle name to match the otherwise same name of a character I like (plus his name as a compound middle name)
He’s probably this universe’s Mister Rogers – which is to say, among other things, a minister of a different christian sect.
Yeah, I’m pretty sure Raidah is trying to get it in Jacob’s head that he and Joyce want different things out of life.
What do Joyce’s siblings have to do with what she wants in life? Raidah’s just being a percussion instrument.
I was talking more about her bringing up Jacob’s brother right after she talked about her own career ambitions, but yeah fair. I was unclear.
If your siblings haven’t really done anything worth while with their lives, there is a chance that your family doesn’t put much emphasis in achievement in general and YOU won’t amount to much.
Maybe its true, maybe its not. (I’m sure people can come up with examples that either prove or disprove the idea.)
That’s the ideal. However, America’s a lot like the rest of the world socially, in that there’s a TON of social pressure to ‘take after your parents’. It takes a LOT of effort to fight that, and the fact that it’s legal to do so, here, still doesn’t make it easy.
Not necessarily “take after your parents”, unless your parents have the kind of family business that tends to get passed down.
More that basic social class stuff does matter more than we like to pretend. And family does drive social class. Best predictor of income is family income.
She literally reminded them in the last comic that she’s there for her MRS degree, not to do anything with her life.
What Raidah is trying to get in Jacob’s head is that Joyce is beneath him. That she doesn’t have wealth or status, nor a path to wealth or status, whereas he does. Because that’s what Raidah’s priorities are, and she assumes that they’re Jacob’s too.
She also believes that she’s the best suited to get to what she KNOWS Jacob’s goals are – becoming successful at law, live up to his brother’s reputation, and making his family proud.
My impression was that Raidah raised the subject of Jacob’s brother’s work with transgender rights hoping to inspire some good old fundie hate speech from Joyce.
Good thought. It could be a two-fer. She’s definitely pushing the “you and Joyce want different things” angle, but angling for the prejudice works too.
I could see that with the transgender issue, except Raidah doesn’t actually give Joyce a chance to respond before changing the subject completely (at least as far as anyone at the table knows, unless Raidah has done some serious cyber-sleuthing on Joyce’s family)
More than anything, the obvious read to me is that she’s pushing “Jacob, you come from a good family (in terms of wealth and status) and you are going places (in terms of wealth and status). Joyce is neither of those things. Joyce is lesser. Joyce is unworthy of having you, unlike me, who you already know enjoys a similar position of wealth and status.”
It is super showing Raidah’s priorities on her sleeve, to the point that she assumes they’re everyone’s priorities.
And there is an aspect of Jacob that wants that, but not in the sense that he needs to be part of a ‘high power’ couple to be fulfilled. He wants to be successful, but his version of successful isn’t about being above others, it’s about achieving his own potential. What he needs is a partner who supports him and his goals, not someone who further adds to his wealth and status as Raidah is selling.
I’m not so sure Jacob’s vision of success is as clear. I want it to be, because I like him, but we haven’t seen enough to be sure Raidah isn’t somewhat on the right track.
Personally, I don’t want Jacob to be that shallow, but I would like to see the dude have some flaws, if only for the sake of character.
The whole “he helped strike down those anti-transgender laws” bit, maybe Raidah presumed that would be a subtle dig to make Joyce feel uncomfortable, considering her fundamentalist upbringing?
Its so obvious what Raidah’s doing that there’s practically a giant neon sign above her head that says “CONDESCENSION”
Using SOMEONE ELSE’S CLOUT to do so….And possibly hide behind. Who wants to hear about Raidah’s family?
Every time I think I can’t dislike Raidah any more than I already do, she makes another condescending comment to prove me wrong.
You know Raidah, you might think you’re winning this exchange, and to be fair Joyce doesn’t deserve to win, but you just seem petty. I hope Jacob realizes what is going on here and leaves with neither one of them, he really doesn’t need either one. I don’t know, maybe I’m not giving one of them enough credit but neither one are very endearing at the moment.
I was on the fence about this whole thing, but after the last couple of strips I’m firmly on Team Joyce on this one. It’s not even Joyce or Sarah’s fault breaking up Raidah’s relationship if Raidah ends up doing it herself.
And Joyce is honestly going about her ‘business’ in the best way possible, especially since finding out Sarah’s plan. (Tellingly to me, since finding out, she hasn’t talked up Sarah and is continuing to not badmouth Raidah or take shenanigans action.) She likes this boy. He has a girlfriend. She continues to be friends with the boy because they have shared interests. His girlfriend shows up unexpectedly to a group lunch. Joyce is perfectly friendly and conversational.
Like, I honestly really really have a hard time faulting Joyce’s actual behavior with Jacob. Whatever her thoughts/feelings/wishes, she’s conducting herself as Jacob’s friend. She’s not pushing anything, getting petty or passive-aggressive, or anything.
I know, right? Raidah’s being pretty horrible. But then again, I’ve never really seen Raidah be anything but a sneaky snake in the grass. As grumpy as Sarah can be, at least she’s always been honest with her misanthropy…
Also, I honestly don’t get all the Joyce hate I’ve been seeing here lately – even when she was trying to talk up Sarah to Jacob, she wasn’t pushing him to break up with Raidah, just doing her best to make Sarah sound good… which, frankly, isn’t a bad thing to try and do on behalf of someone you consider to be a close friend. (And really – Joyce loves almost everyone she hangs out with like they’re her closest friends, probably because Becky’s the only real friend she’s ever had, until now.)
Same here, re: the Joyce hate. People keep referring to her hitting on Jacob in front of Raidah, and she’s really not. She hasn’t hit on him once. She’s been his friend, and some of their friendliness might drift into friendly flirting, but that is absolutely not the same as hitting on someone. Raidah is able to tell that Joyce likes him, but if Joyce isn’t hitting on him (which she really isn’t), she’s not really guilty of trying any shit.
I would absolutely call her behaviour flirting, personally. Joyce-level flirting, anyway, which alternates between far more smooth than I expected to… about as giggly and freaked out as I expected.
And she now knows the plan was for her to “seduce” (in the heaviest quotation marks there!) Jacob away from Raidah. She knows that and is FINE with that- in fact, she seems actively scheming about it. And I don’t much care about Raidah, and in this case I feel like she’s somewhat irrelevant as an individual- Joyce doesn’t know her and has no reason to care about hurting her. But she’s showing a complete lack of respect for JACOB’S wishes and that is a terrible sign for any sort of relationship. Jacob has stated he’s happy with Raidah, and Joyce is just fine with trying to sabotage that- even if it’s in innocent Joyce fashion.
Yeah, I also don’t really see anything much wrong with what Joyce is doing… So far to me she just seems like she’s continuing to be Jacob’s friend, which is nice, because I think they can be really good friends!
I mean, she’s being relatively subtle about it – though not so subtle that everyone but Jacob isn’t aware of it, but she’s not just continuing to be Jacob’s friend. Her intentions are clearly romantic.
You can certainly decide to just be friends with someone you’ve got a crush on because they’re already with someone else. It’s not always emotionally easy, but it can be done. That’s not what Joyce is doing here. We see that in her attitude shift when she realized Joe and Sarah thought she had a chance with him, in that smile when she told Sarah not to worry about tricking her, in those expressions when Raidah showed up at this lunch.
It’s not quite that clear-cut, though. It’s necessary to remember Joyce is a Grand Master at the art of living with cognitive dissonance. She is attracted to Jacob, and she has become consciously aware of that as Sarah’s plot was revealed to her.
But I don’t think she is actively trying to seduce Jacob away. Rather, she believes that because Raidah is unworthy (note that her negative opinion of Raidah is derived, not just from being Jacob’s girlfriend, but from her treatment of both Sarah and Dina)–and in Joyce’s mindset, the unworthy don’t get good things.
So she’s expecting “Jacob + Raidah” to fail regardless of what she does. Her interactions with Jacob, both prior to and after Joe’s revelation, are built as much around making sure he sees the new option once that happens–she’s simply switched from backing Sarah for that role to herself.
It’s a subtle difference, and certainly some others involved would likely not see it that way. But to Joyce’s mindset, if simply being a better/better-suited person than Raidah is enough to destroy their relationship, it was built on sand to begin with.
What might shock her, though, would be Jacob being in some way unfaithful to Raidah (even just a kiss)–her expectation would be that he would formally break it off first, then begin a relationship with Joyce instead. Her straightforward view of the world very, very often fails to incorporate or account for the fact that people are complicated.
It’s possible, I suppose. It seems to me though that from the very start she’s more dismissed Raidah than decided to cut her out of Jacob’s life because she wasn’t worthy. That was Sarah’s motivation, but Joyce has never really said anything about her, just how good Jacob and Sarah would be together (back when she was still living vicariously through that fantasy.
It seems to me that what Joyce is doing isn’t all that different than what “nice guys” do when they like a girl but don’t say anything: hang around them, be friends, and hope the girl sees how “good” they are for her.
The biggest difference I see between her behavior and that behavior is I can’t really see her freaking out if Jacob broke up with Raidah and then dated some other woman without considering Joyce.
But other than that, it seems pretty much the same behavior, and not something I’m used to hearing supported.
I don’t think it’s quite the same. Joyce seems to intend a bit more of active role than passively waiting to see how “good” they are.
That “bring it on” look between her and Raidah isn’t something I associate with the typical “Nice Guy” approach.
Except she’s not saying anything to Jacob or even sharing that look with Jacob so it’s still counts as being “nice”.
That said, I don’t think she’ll react like those guys do if things don’t go her way, but that’s the only thing that strikes me as different.
To be fair, I’m a guy so I don’t have first hand experience with that behavior, so my understanding of the concept may be off.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comments saying Joyce is just being friends/friendly, which seems exactly how that behavior in guys is generally portrayed.
Likely not action against Raidah, but she’s not going to just wait around being friendly and hoping.
Both she and Sarah have a strong tendency towards being as toxic to themselves as possible, but at least with Sarah it’s tragic. There’s already too many people like Raidah (uppity peons) in all social classes of the world.
Joyce is a better person than Radiah, but none of them deserve Jacob. He is too good for both of them.
the more I think about it, the weirder the concept of “deserving” a specific person gets. like, Jacob deserves to be treated better than what either of them are doing right now, but… in a sense, *nobody* deserves Jacob, because Jacob is a person, because that sounds like it would mean he should date the person who “deserves” him regardless of his own feelings?
We’ve met the missionary, and Jordan is the trans-writer (do I have that right?), but who’s the blogger have we met him yet?
Jocelyne is the trans writer/blogger (Joyce knows her as “Joshua”). We have not met Jordan yet – Jocelyne once referred to him as being “too Jordan” to show up at Freshman Family Weekend.
We also heard a mention of Jordan when Joyce overheard her parents talking about possibly taking her out of school…
Her parents referred to it as the ‘jordan’ situation, and it appears as if there is some family conflict involved.
My suspicion is that “Jordan” is the one who’s had the nerve to openly stand up to their parents and disavow the whole situation – and therefore is probably the healthiest.
How that look in terms of life trajectory, I don’t know. Could be anything from ex-evangelical White Dude Atheist to a scientist who accepts evolution to someone who spends his spare time volunteering with NARAL.
Jocelyne is actually the writer (though her family still knows her by her deadname), so she’s probably the “blogger,” since she has a writing website. Jonathan is the missionary. Jordan is the Mystery Boy.
Is “deadname” an accurate term if the name itself is still very much in active use? I mean, my deadname is toootally fuckin’ dead and has been for pretty much my entire adult life. (Actually I have two.) But it just seems like a term that doesn’t fit for Jocelyn’s shitty situation.
I think it’s fair to say her parents are deadnaming her. Jocelyn has really only demonstrated a tolerance for being called “Joshua” when her parents are around; she even gave Ethan the proper name for her blog. I suspect she’s tolerating being deadnamed by them to avoid becoming “a Jordan situation,” or worse, because she doesn’t want to lose Joyce the same way Jordan obviously has.
People very often have to deal with being deadnamed by their parents/around their parents LOOOOOONG after the name has been officially dead in their life.
Sorry, does it count as being deadnamed if you’re not out to the person? I’ve always read “deadnaming” as an active, passive aggressive swing at a trans person but maybe I’m wrong
I’d say the name itself is her deadname regardless but if she hasn’t yet come out to her parents yet I’d hesitate to call what they’re doing deadnaming. I’m pretty willing to accept the passive voice “before I came out I was being deadnamed constantly” but I feel like the active voice “they deadnamed me before I came out to them” attributes undue malice and kinda cheapens later, actual malice? My parents called me by the only name they knew before I came out — it’s after I came out that they started deadnaming me.
Well let’s be fair, if Jocelyne would come out to her parents about the trans and deadname stuff then she’d Actually become Dead to said parents.
I (occasionally) refer to my legal name as my deadname in spite of its continued use because it is a name I am actively trying to make dead. The fact that I cannot yet make it dead in certain contexts does not negate the fact that it is The Name That Should Be Dead.
See, now I have to ask: since I took part of my deadname and made it my current name, does that make said current name a zombiename? Because that sounds neat.
Yeah. Joyce might have decided she actually likes Jacob, but frankly, if she’s making a play for him, then she’s drastically changed her playbook. She didn’t act like this toward Joe before their one date, she didn’t act like this toward Ethan… (And I’m taking into account the way she behaved *before* finding out that Ethan is gay, and was trying to repress it.)
Other than occasionally giving him a flirty smile, (something she might not even be aware of, given that her mother clearly would never approve of her learning to flirt,) I have yet to see her treat him any differently than she does her other friends, other than being a bit more respectful of his personal space, which could possibly be attributed to the fact that she hasn’t known him as long.
Honestly, the habit she’s always had of bouncing after *everyone* like an overeager puppy, just tells me that she really was badly in need of a chance to make new friends. And frankly, if this *is* flirting, it’s a vast improvement on the way Walkyverse Joyce went about it. (The secondhand embarrassment, it was horrible…)
Yup, agreed. Being a friend where some interactions can be read as flirting is not the same thing as making an open play for someone. For contrast: think about Malaya picking up Joe. THAT is making a play for someone. This is friendly flirting.
That would be a reasonable assumption if we didn’t know her intent, which we very much do. (seen in this strip), and while different from Malaya’s (incredibly direct) approach, Joyce is still making a play on Jacob, albeit in a passive, more subtle, (arguably less effective), and long-game sort of way
Arguably, it’s more effective – since Jacob is attached, he’d reject any direct approach out of hand and likely cut off further contact.
There’s a difference between ‘making a play for’ and ‘getting into position’, though. Joyce is doing the latter. She believes that Raidah is a toxic individual, and that Jacob, being ‘good’ will eventually realize this and break it off on his own–at which point, she wants to be the one ready to help him move on.
It’s not honest, which is unfortunate and arguably criticism-worthy, but she’s not actively sabotaging the relationship–note that we’ve never seen her down-talk Raidah, directly or indirectly, to Jacob.
She is not actively sabotaging the relationship. She in fact pretty much completely ignores Raidah’s existence when she isn’t right there. Her approach seems to be the generally more effective one of building an emotional romantic style connection between her and Jacob.
So why not call her out on that instead of being passive aggressively awful about her career goals and siblings?
Also as pointed out below, Raidah doesn’t exactly have much reason to be enthused about a Christian missionary sibling.
Because she’s trying to manipulate Jacob away from any potential interest, not actively and visually cause drama. (Not to say she’s anti-drama, I don’t know, but I don’t think she wants to be seen caring, or feeling threatened, or letting it be anything but beneath her.)
She’s a would-be lawyer. Being passive-aggressively awful is a needed skill where she wants to go. :p
She honestly wasn’t really any nicer to her before that, when she was just Sarah’s friend. Raidah’s gonna Raidah.
She didn’t mind Joyce actually until this happened. She was helping her pick out her dress and jacket, etc.
She was still talking down to her. And she was talking crap about Sarah, to Joyce, too. She’s never really been a good person.
Agreed. I’ve defended Raidah before because we’d only seen her through Sarah’s eyes or in situations where her worst was brought out. I wanted to give her a chance to become more well rounded and see what she was like, but what we’ve seen since hasn’t inspired confidence.
I mean we’re in yet another situation where Raidah is opposite someone she has pretty understandable reason to be unpleasant to aka a girl who is trying to seduce her boyfriend.
Joyce is completely in the wrong and Raidah is more justified – though Joyce’s methods are still better than Raidah’s.
I’ve despised her since her interaction with Dina. I really don’t get why people care if Joyce steals Jacob from her, either for Sarah or herself.
I don’t think Joyce is doing the right thing trying to break them up. I don’t want her rewarded for doing something I think is lousy. She needs to learn a lesson about boundaries and her rom-com based understanding of relationships. Winning Jacob this way wouldn’t be good for her development.
Best case here, as far as I’m concerned is this blowing up in everyone’s face and Jacob ditching them all – Joyce for messing with his relationship and Raidah for showing her true colors in response. Except then we see less of Jacob.
It’s a complex situation, which I like. Thing I like least about it is that I suspect it’s going to kill Joyce/Jacob and I do like them together.
I care because I don’t think doing the wrong thing for the wrong reason is ok simply because the person you’re trying to mess over is a jerk.
Also, I’m against people trying to break up relationships, generally speaking. I will say I’m a little weird about that, tho because I think I view cheating as better than trying to sabotage a relationship. I think it’s a matter of who I place the blame on in that circumstance. But that’s neither here nor there.
I also don’t like the deceitfulness of it (again, weird considering I would feel better about cheating than sabotage). I’d rather Joyce tell him she has a thing for him and let him chose to hang out as friends.
I’m almost disappointed by how transparent she’s being. Raidah was one of the more nuanced ‘villians’ (mostly because Sarah isn’t exactly a shining example of heroism either).
I would agree with that, but I would also say that she is someone who in most situations conceals her percussion-instrument personality behind the forms of earnest politeness, to the extent that people who are not directly on the receiving end of her attacks think of her as nice and polite and courteous, and can’t comprehend why anyone would see her in any other light.
“He was a part of the team responsible for abolishing enormously shitty local laws! HIS POWER IS NOW INFINITE!”
And, well, I do think it’s an important accomplishment! Harrison sounds like a cool guy going off this. But, well… I admit I don’t know a lot about how this kind of legal action gets done, but it really sounds to me like Raidah is overselling his accomplishment. Jacob’s hyping him pretty hard, too…
Depends on the state laws, I think; over here where I live, the Republican-controlled state congress offered to repeal their infamous “bathroom bill” (which also forbade cities in the state from passing anti-discrimination legislation) if the cities that had passed anti-discrimination legislation prior to the bill repealed theirs first, IIRC – then when the cities in question did so, the state congress went back on their word and kept their bill on the books. The state Supreme Court is Republican-controlled as well last I checked, so if I’m not mistaken in my state’s case, an attempt to remove the bill through litigation might need to be fought all the way up to the federal-level Supreme Court.
I thought congress only referred to the national one (as it’s a congress of the states), and the state legislatures had different names?
My state has, as I recall, both a State House of Representatives and a State Senate, for whatever reason. Hence, State Congress.
Basically any legal action’s a collaborative process. Even if there’s only one lawyer, there’s probably a paralegal too. Harrison could have been anyone from the one giving oral arguments to someone working with the clients to doing research to writing the motions the judge sees. All of which are important, and he could have been in any of those roles in any combination.
It’s a lot more impressive in conservative (or conservative leaning) areas. I believe Indiana is generally more conservative, if Willis hasn’t steered me wrong?
And Pence caused another spate of HIV infection because funding programs to cut down on needle sharing wouldn’t mean the gay druggies were being properly punished or something. (Goes to scrub previous sentence from soul)
I know they voted for Obama in one of his elections and that at least one swing district is in the state so I’m not sure about it in general. I defer to anyone else’s expertise.
I did just start off with a silly joke, but I -also- defer to everyone else’s expertise! So, thank you all for being so informative, I appreciate it a lot!
State as a whole is red. But even the reddest states are more purple than red or blue, once you get down to the county level, especially if you look at maps that are morphed to account for population rather than land:
There’s a graphic a bit before the halfway point that really shows why ‘red vs. blue’ is a horrible metric. If Harrison’s district includes Northwest Indiana, or Indianapolis, for instance, it’s much easier for him to take a progressive stance.
‘Red’ being permanently associated with the Republicans is a relatively recent thing, only going back to the 2000 elections, where the whole rigamarole kept the coloured maps on screens a lot longer than they would have been. Prior to that, the colours flipped with each election.
FYI this actually happened in real life, the 7th Circuit ruled that transgender students can’t be discriminated against. The 2nd Circuit ruled the other way however, so the ruling is only valid in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin until the Supreme Court resolves the split.
If that’s Hively vs Ivy Tech, I don’t think it actually did. It was a landmark employment case, but as far as I can tell it only applies to sexual orientation, not transgender discrimination.
The Missionary was the asshole brother that Joyce RIGHTEOUSLY snapped at right? Back when she was visiting her folks?
Yup, she’s probably not exactly head of John’s fanclub still, but I’m not expecting she’d want to get into that right now. Ironically, that’d actually probably score points with Jacob, hearing about her laying into him.
It’s weird that Jacob has this amazing brother who Raidah is all ‘imagine living up to that’ and he’s just… unfazed about it all.
Raidah’s going into law, right? With her behavior and the way she fawns over Harrison, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if she’s just using Jacob as a stepping stone to future business connections.
Yeah, she does seem a bit “it matters more who you know than who you are” here. Which is a shitty way to live one’s life.
Harrison is likely significantly older – through law school and playing a significant role in important cases. Not too likely to be interested in a college sophomore. Unless he’s a creep, of course.
Also, what is it with Raidah’s weird insistence on bringing up how amazing Jacob’s brother is? This is the second time she’s done it unprompted. If she’s so enthralled with Harrison why doesn’t she go hit on him?
Living up to Harrison the knight in shining armor seems to be the thing Jacob is invested in. Bringing him up now is defenitly a move to guilt-trip Jacob in some way. Either about spending time with people with less lofty ambitions, or about shallow activities like eating out with a group of people who cannot further his career, or something.
Yeah, she’s using him to motivate Jacob. He probably let her know of his hero worship of his brother early on and she’s picked up on it.
Also – yeah, I can’t fault Raidah for not being overly enthused about the missionary considering all the crap they’ve pulled.
Yeah, she invited Joyce to come to her mosque on Friday after Joyce and Jacob came back from the latter’s church – cue Joyce immediately backpedaling about 10 feet away from the couple.
With what I know of the Muslim community here in the Midwest, I’d be surprised if many of them act nearly as judgmental as she has been shown to. Mind you that is based on my own subjective experiences and a very limited sample size of individuals (a few dozen or so, including a couple imams I’ve spoken with before).
Also, her acceptance of Dana’s habits plausibly speaks volumes regarding how much piety she may approach her religion from, much more so than the frequency with which she may attend mosque, if she also partook. Using intoxicating or mind altering substances is seen as haram, though I’ve seen some debate as to whether medicinal use, such as medical marijuana used purely as prescribed by a doctor, fall under mukruh instead.
I knew a few people at school who wouldn’t touch alcohol because it was forbidden, but were fine smoking pot. I expect that partly because illegality rendered debates pointless seeming at the time.
Raidah doesn’t believe in angels, so her level of religious belief depends on how important literal angels are to the Islamic faith.
I have no idea, but I assume Muslims believe in angels, and if so, that would imply Raidah is less religious than she seems.
More relevantly is a Christian who mocks the kind of Christian who’s really into literal angels flying around affecting daily life less religious than other Christians? Which is more I suspect what she meant.
I’d say so. You can believe in an all knowing, all powerful being who created the universe, but you can’t belive in that being having helpers? I’d consider that less religious. And if you don’t believe in that all powerful being, then you’re definitely less religious.
But, again, that depends on how important the belief in those beings being literally existing is to the religion.
For all I know, she might belong to a group of Muslims who don’t believe in angels, in which case she’s fine in that regard.
But if they do believe, then she’s definitely less religious than those who profess to believe in them. At least in regards to that particular version.
Though IIRC she didn’t actually say she didn’t believe in angels, she mocked Joyce’s belief in angels. Which is subtly different.
I mean, angels show up in the Bible, in the Old Testament (or the Torah) and thus are in the founding texts for Christianity, Judaism and Islam. That doesn’t mean that they’re always understood the same way.
I read that scoffing not as “there are no angels”, but “she’s one of those who take it all literally and think everyone has a guardian angel and whatever other nonsense goes along with it.”
The whole point of the statement is to contrast her to Joyce, and the only thing said is that Joyce believes in angels. Therefore, the contrast is Raidah does not believe in angels.
Any subtlety and nuance you see there is in your own head as there’s not enough given in the statement to assume it.
That said, that doesn’t mean you’re wrong. Raidah is talking to people who know her so the nuance might not need to be spoken out loud to them. But as an audience who wouldn’t know that, the simplest solution is the most likely one: that she doesn’t believe.
“You can believe in an all knowing, all powerful being who created the universe, but you can’t believe in that being having helpers? I’d consider that less religious.”
It’s not necessarily a case of “I can believe in God okay, but angels are too much to accept.” Remember that these things are *factual* in the minds of the people who believe them. There’s nothing irreligious in the position, “Could angels conceivably exist? Yes. Do they in fact exist? No.”
Mind you, there’s 28 million Christians in India. I had to deal with all sorts of people of the Joyce-esque bent who are CONFUSED when they find out it’s one of the largest Christian communities in the world.
I’m thinking specifically about abuses missionaries have pulled in South Asia. Since I’m fairly sure Raidah’s descended from there, I can see her not being super enthused.
Yeah, christian missionaries have a strong reputation on the international scene for being complete monsters with the people they are proselytizing to.
Even the ones doing more humanitarian things like building schools or hospitals sometimes have conditions (like you have to convert, go to a service, listen to them proselytize, etc.) or try to convert people on the side.
Not all religious denominations proselytize in the same way (or even at all for that manner, especially these days) – most Christian missionaries these days either come from, are one step removed from, or are connected to various US Christian organizations, which can sometimes be a little…”special”…in the beliefs they export.
I get that. But if she is really mad about that then she is basically saying that her faith is better. Which is just stupid whatever way you slice it.
Well, if she’s specifically calling out Joyce’s-missionary-brother-with-a-cool-car-that-he-got-by-spending-church-tithings-received-from-the-poor, or people like him, then yeah I feel like Raidah’s mosque – as a member of which Raidah feels free to express sentiments in favor of trans people – is probably better than Joyce’s church, whose members recoiled at the idea of associating with someone they had known for years, once that someone turned out to be a lesbian.
Raidah may have better politics but she’s a shittier person, and I wouldn’t want to go to her mosque or Joyce’s church.
But Raidah has absolutely no idea what kind of missionary work John does or how he got the car. Yes, he is a gross person and deserves to be judged, but she doesn’t know that. She doesn’t know anything about Joyce’s family, she’s just doing everything she can to try and make them sound bad to Jacob.
Raidah surely knows from Jacob that Joyce is a fundagelical. She probably knows exactly what kind of missionary* he is, and the fancy car probably confirmed her suspicions.
*in any event, it’s not like there are that many kinds of missionaries and they all have a lot in common.
OTOH, given Raidah’s general classist attitudes, I might take her comment literally. The “cool car” improves her opinion of the missionary brother.
Being angry about the behavior of fundagelical missionaries overseas is actually a pretty reasonable reaction, especially if you hail from a part of the world they’ve preyed on.
If you mean it’s stupid because she’s somehow insulting christianity in front of Jacob, she’s safe there. As an Episcopalian, he cannot think fundagelicals make christianity look good.
Doesn’t need to be in Raidah’s book, she just needs to make Joyce look like a less attractive option.
Plus, “apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”. We know Joyce has changed a lot of her viewpoints from her upbringing. Raidah does not – she might well think Joyce still subscribes to many, if not most, of her church’s less-than-savory views.
That makes about as much sense as judging Raidah for things that other Muslims have done or believe.
That’s not near the same scale of equivalency as Raidah hypothetically judging Joyce here for the beliefs of her church, it would probably be significantly closer to judging Raidah for the doctrine from her mosque.
I don’t follow you? You mean if she’s angry about missionaries, why take that out on Joyce? Because Joyce is part of the group and apparently believes the same shit as the missionaries?
But i’m not sure that’s what Raidah is doing: i think she’s either expressing her own opinion of missionaries (which i agree with, despite her being shitty) or she’s trying to bait Joyce into revealing to Jacob just how batshit and nasty Joyce’s religion is, and by association, Joyce herself.
I doubt it wil work because Jacob already knows she has a lot of batshit notions and he knows she’s shed a number of them, and that under it all Joyce is kind.
It’s also probably the same thought process Roz went through in the Infamous Gender Studies Bongo Blowout. Even if Raidah knows Joyce is changing, she doesn’t know how much and does know that for a very long time, Joyce was all-in on every harmful policy her church held. And I don’t blame Raidah for being wary about someone who’s at most six weeks removed from that.
Like wasn’t her last interaction with Joyce her literally bolting across the room to get away from her when she learned she was Muslim. That hardly inspires confidence that one isn’t a bigot.
@Emily: Raidah did imply that, but I think the teleporting away was more due to her being Jacob’s girlfriend. She jumps back and blushes before the mosque is even mentioned. Then she just keeps running away.
I think it’s very likely Radiah’s reaction is that she assumes being missionary is not something which made her brother WEALTHY. So, if she ever met Jordon, her respect would go up/
I’m sorry, but I strongly disagree. I’m not areligious, but to me, the idea that a religious group literally pays people to proselytise is extremely distasteful to me- especially when that religious group is such a majority with so much power already. There’s a world of difference between “this person has a faith” and “this person actively tries to convert others to their faith FOR A LIVING”. The two are not comparable imo.
Jordan is a crappy missionary. There’s also missionary works which did massive humanitarian relief efforts–including ones which Westerners condemned because with no resources, they weren’t 1st World hospital levels.
Mind you, I do Jordan props that he isn’t a bigot and married locally. That’s the only props I give him.
Just as a reminder, Jordan isn’t the missionary brother – you’re thinking of Joh. Jordan is the Mystery Brother.
I think she would be ‘okay’ with a missionary, but the cool car makes it seem like he helps a for-profit church. Which might explain her judgemental answer.
Read literally, the missionary with a cool car gets a better response than before the car is mentioned. Which could fit with her general classist approach.
Based on her facial expressions (which I read as “insincerely kind”), I read that line as patronizing. I think she thinks Joyce is incredibly immature and that it is showing in how she speaks about her family (and her professional goals in the previous strip).
And it is a kind of immature thing to point out. A missionary who drives a nice car. Mature people would not care about the car and pointing it out was a little silly (and I suppose could also give negative implications about the type of missionary her brother is, as others have already hashed out).
It’s pretty bad that Raidah just talked right over Jacob when Dorothy specifically asked to hear from him for a change. I don’t hate her or anything, but that’s not a great way to treat your SO. Unless Jacob likes it that he doesn’t have to engage in conversations himself or something, which I don’t think is true.
Been looking through the comments just to see if anyone else picked up on that. This is actually my least favourite thing about Raidah in this strip. If your SO is asked a question, LET THEM ANSWER IT.
She’s definitely directing the conversation, but it’s probably subtle enough he’s not likely to be much bothered by it.
I’m loving Joyce here. She’s innocent and oblivious, and a little weird, and it’s adorable. A lot of guys find that appealing, maybe Jacob is one of them. She’s definitely the polar opposite of Raidah, who is conniving and manipulative, and probably doesn’t deserve someone as nice as Jacob. I’m sure she’ll get what’s coming to her eventually.
……..she might be ACTING innocent and oblivious, but she’s neither. She knows exactly what Raidah’s doing, and knows that Raidah knows exactly what she’s doing.
I didn’t miss it. But come on, Joyce is still clinging to the salt and pepper here. She’s hardly on the same level as Raidah.
Joyce is in the wrong here. It doesn’t matter what Raidah does, she can be in the wrong too, but the moment that Joyce went after Jacob in an attempt to break up a (then) seemingly healthy and happy relationship, she crossed the line.
From Joyce’s perspective there’s still nothing to give her an impression that the relationship isn’t healthy. Jacob has talked about how great they are together and that’s it. Anything more is what we the audience has seen, which shouldn’t affect Joyce’s behaviour because she doesn’t know it.
That’s not what OP meant, though. She is innocent in her beliefs of how much money is a lot of money, how the jobs of her brothers are socially perceived (especially “blogger”, writer alone has some people sneering), and she is oblivious to Raidah’s condescending tone and passive-agressive attempts to make her look bad.
I personally think Joyce knows and is taking it with a grain of salt, but Joyce isn’t exactly the most aware of people’s intentions, usually
I don’t think the staredown meant anything about “purposefully rude”. The staredown was an acknowledgement that Joyce was out to win Jacob and that Raidah had come to defend her prior claim. And that they both knew what the other was doing.
Innocent and oblivious? You mean how shes going after Jacob knowing full well hes got a girlfriend, who just happens to be sitting across from her
As for conniving and manipulative, like trying to break up Jacob and Raidah for Sarah or trying to break up Jacob and Raidah for herself
Shes been told in no uncertain terms, by Joe, this a bad idea and Dorothy whose only just been dragged into the middle of this, can see this a bad idea
Someones getting hurt and I hope its Joyce because as much as I like Joyce her behaviour has been pretty shitty and she does not deserve anything good to come out of this
“Going after” Jacob? Has she made a pass at him, propositioned him? She’s literally done nothing so far. Her ultimate intent, which we don’t actually know, is irrelevant.
she’s been flirting with him (which he’s been oblivious to) and her intentions were made pretty clear by http://www.dumbingofage.com/2018/comic/book-8/03-faz-is-great/sniping/
Especially since earlier in the day on which that strip is set, Joe had out-and-out told Joyce that Sarah was hoping for Joyce to get with Jacob, which Joyce interpreted to mean that Joe thought that she had a chance with Jacob.
I still maintain that friendly flirting while hoping things go in a specific direction is not the same thing as making a pass at someone, because Joyce is also legitimately his friend, and not only for nefarious purposes.
I don’t think Jacob’s oblivious any more. Not entirely. His reaction to her babbling after the gym injury definitely (imo) showed him picking up on her feelings and I feel like the way he was looking at her a few strips back, when she went up to the bar, implied (to me) that yeah, he’s somewhat aware of her feelings- although still oblivious to her intent.
I think it’s more that he’s being affected by her flirting and responding to it, while still being oblivious to what’s going on.
He called in Raidah while going to lunch with Joyce and we saw his thought bubble of pizza while they were having their little glare match.
Man, either Jacob is being dense as a brick fruitcake or he’s preternaturally unflappable. Raidah turned a “let’s talk about you” to “let’s talk about your brother, who’s better than you” without even hiding it.
Honestly? I think he’s probably kind of used to women doing this around him, even if he’s not cognizant of it. People stop just short of turning into a cartoon wolf and going “AWOOOGAH!” on meeting him on a routine basis.
Guys, especially non-assholier-than-thou guys, tend to avoid assuming that women being outwardly friendly to them have any sexual or romantic interest in them. Maybe it’s an over-correction because we know how fucking vile people who assume that shit about anyone that gives them a smile can be, but I wager that’s Jacob’s mindset here.
I mean it could just be that Jacob’s brother is someone really important to him who he looks up to and actually does enjoy talking about. Not everyone feels inferior to and jealous of their more successful siblings.
Would you ask them for a new name? With as much love and care as went I to the other one? Or would you choose it yourself, thus proving the independence?
Just speaking for myself as a trans person, the amount of trans people I know who would trust their parents with the new name is ….. pretty low. Mostly because it’s so rare to have that level of love and support, but even when you do, it often comes with a kind of well meaning but clumsy understanding.
As a parent, I would have a really hard time giving a teenager a name the way I do a child, but I could absolutely contribute to the process.
“If we had known your real gender when you were a baby we would probably have named you X.” (Most expecting parents have brainstormed a few alternative names)
I AM trans, so it’s not a hypothetical for me. I didn’t, I was more interested in having a name I liked this round than involving them (especially since that’s often done to placate).
Check out Jackson Bird on YouTube! He’s trans and he did ask his mom for help when he was choosing his name. It’s very interesting to hear him talk about it
I ended up picking a name for myself, but I asked my mom for a lot of input during the process. Her view was pretty much exactly what Bagge said above- if it were up to her she would’ve gone with something she and my dad were planning if I’d been born female, and she told me all of those names that she could remember.
For me, the biggest part of picking a new name was trying to come up with something that would feel as special and “me” as the name I’d been going by for my whole life up until that point.
Not trans, but as a parent, I would be fine with whichever route my kid chose. If they wanted my help deciding on a new name, I’d feel honored to be involved, but I also would want them to do what makes them most comfortable and choose a name that they identify with.
I’d presume, from my own experiences, most people in that situation would be a bit of A and a bit of B. I’ve known several trans people that have simply gone the route of closely related names (Patricia becoming Patrick for example). I’ve also know several that, already knowing other names that were considered, chose one of those in spite of being not on good terms with their parents because of transitioning with the hope they could appreciate the gesture should fences ever be mended.
Trans with shitty parents here- although I didn’t realise how shitty my parents were at the time, I didn’t include them at all in the decision. In fact I chose a name that my mother said she hated, and my reaction was “welp, tough.”
But even if the relationship was better… having a new name is, for a lot of trans folk, hugely symbolic and important. It’s part of taking control of who you are, your identity and the way you’re perceived. Taking a new name is immensely empowering. So I doubt many- if any- would 100% leave it up to their parents even with the best relationship. As others have said though, yeah, I can totally see it being a discussion.
I have never known anyone to let their parents choose their new name. BUT i’m changing my legal name to The Boy Name My Parents Would Have Picked so I mean. I’m sure some people would or have. It’s just…definitely not the standard.
Choosing your own name is less an issue of “proving independence” tho and more an issue of. Being a grown person with like, life experience and self-interest and shit and therefore being able to pick something comfortable, as opposed to being a baby that can’t make decisions and has to be referred to as something by the people who will be raising you for the next n years.
I’m not trans, but when I was a teen I went through a long period of time where I identified as genderfluid. I played around a lot with my name as a result. My parents have always been supportive but confused, and my mom’s only hangup is that she felt the names she gave me and my sibling who IS genderqueer were special and significant to her because of the thought and love she put into choosing them. I can’t speak for my sibling on how much this impacted choosing names, but we both go by names at least vaguely derived from our birth names. For me thats a least somewhat out of respect for her and the genuine attachment she had to my birthname. My sibling uses their middle name (my parents gave us both very gender neutral middle names for some reason), but I have a feeling that once they move out of the house they’ll find a name that they feel fits them more, unrelated to birth name. I think they’re only going by that name out of love for our mom? Which isn’t the sole reason they should be going by that name.
Yeah, from the perspective of a parent who would have zero issue with my kid being trans, I think it can be tricky for even the most tolerant parents to be fully comfortable with their kid changing their name.
For me I’d have no issue with them changing their gender, and would respect their wish to change their name, but when you have a kid you associate whatever name you chose with them, and that automatically makes it special. It’s the whole, “They’ll always be that newborn baby to me” emotional deal parents (or at least many/most parents) feel towards their kid. It’d be just as tricky for me whether my kid were trans or not.
I think choosing a similar name (like a kid named Charlie going with Charlotte, or Samantha becoming Sam, etc.) makes it a bit easier for the parents because then the new name still has attachment to all those childhood memories.
But I also understand why some trans people prefer going with a very different name, and I’d learn to deal if that’s the direction my kid decided to go. Their comfort with their life/identity is more important than my attachment to a name.
I think an ideal world for me as a parent would be if we didn’t automatically gender names so if my kid ended up being trans, they could still go by their birth name and have it be a non-issue, but sadly that is not the world we live in yet I guess.
Her backbone has the firmness of a waterbed. She just dumped a guy for a few extra hours of study time. She’s only still sitting there because she doesn’t want Joyce to have to get up to let her out.
Also, it’s not that she tries to avoid confrontation in general – she deliberately puts herself in harms way to try to pull JOYCE out from the confrontation. That’s a big difference (not that Joyce in any shape or form WANTS out of the confrontation, but that’s another thing altogether).
75% of Dorothy’s entire shtick is avoiding confrontation, something she seems to have picked up from her mother (at least) – it’s why she went to University hoping Danny would forget about her instead of just breaking up with him. One of the very few times she showed a spine was when she made Walky write a thank you note to his parents, because that was the *polite* thing to do.
It’s (part of) why she has no chance to be president, and it’s why she should have no chance in politics. The US already has its share of spineless, non-confrontational, politeness-concerned uselessness in politics – they’re called “every high-profile Democrat that isn’t Maxine Waters.”
But then the 25 remaining percent is taking responsibility and doing the right thing, such as when she finally broke up with Danny, or when she recognised how she’s stringing Wally along.
She only broke up with Danny because he basically cornered her, and she didn’t break up with Walky because she was stringing him along, she broke up with him because she thought she’d be better off turning relationship-time into study-time.
She can be both endearing and admirable, and certainly one of the more upstanding characters in the comic, but that still doesn’t exclude the fact that she’d make for a terrible politician for a high-profile position (as opposed to, say, an advisory or research position for someone in said position).
She did both. In the break up scene, she came to the realization she’d been treating him badly – pulling him in and pushing him away.
If you’re not actively trying to avoid confrontations that accomplish nothing and are likely to just end in a screaming match and damaged relationships, then you’re a shitty person, and would be an even worse leader.
For fuck’s sake, our current fucking president is a perfect example of why avoiding confrontation is a valuable skill for a leader. Every god damn day he’s starting some completely pointless fight where the best case result is that he ends up wasting time complaining about some celebrity instead of finding new ways to fuck up the economy and/or be cruel to women and minorities.
The idiotic fucking “AVOIDING CONFRONTATION MEANS YOU’RE WEAK” mentality is why that orange fuck is starting trade wars, alienating our allies, and putting babies in god damn prison camps
Dorothy isn’t fucking spineless, she just (1) has the ability to recognize when a fight or argument isn’t worth it, and (2) would prefer to be gentle or at least civil when confronting someone is actually necessary.
I mostly agree with this but I also think it depends on the stakes of what’s going on. Low stakes things can merit low stakes confrontation (which can be as simple as ‘dude, c’mon, don’t be like that’) whereas actual high stakes stuff definitely requires a ‘dude, seriously, DO NOT be like that’.
Oh how’d I know the most full throated apologist for Dorothy’s personality would be you, Fart Captor.
Look, person, a president needs to be capable of standing up for themselves and their interests. Negotiation and compromise is only possible when you have a position. Dorothy doesn’t have a position. She barely has a belief system. She’s the least self-actualized person in a strip that has people like Danny and Jacob.
I’ll fucking dare tell you what I want to, and that’s that a President who can’t fight will get devoured by the sharks that can. And that’s why Obama now watches Donald Trump take his whole legacy apart.
Also, wtf are you talking about? “Dorothy doesn’t have a position”? On what exactly? We know more about her political beliefs than any character in the strip except maybe Roz. Or is “barely having a belief system” a shot at her being an atheist? (and if so, fuck you)
Dorothy doesn’t fucking need apologists. Her biggest flaw right now is that she needs a work/life balance that will let her pursue her ambitions without burning herself out. Dorothy might not be terribly aggressive, but she’s shown she’s able to stand her ground when she needs to.
We have yet to see her face a serious situation where she just ran away or failed to act. She’s allowed to prioritize her long term goals over sex and romance. The fact that you see that as a lack of backbone says a lot about how you view women with ambition (and the idea that relationships are something women can opt out of for whatever the fuck reason they want, not some kind of contractual obligation which can only be terminated without penalty under a limited set of conditions)
I’ve never seen someone *intentionally* fall for the rope-a-dope-in fact, engineer their own rope-a-doping-with such vigor, such determination, such bloody-mindedness.
Are you referring to only one of Joyce and Raidah, or both? Because I feel like this could turn quickly into a mutually assured destruction scenario.
Raidah-she’s going on the attack, in an incredibly conspicuous and obvious sort of way. Joyce is not only completely unfazed by any of her peacocking, she’s managing to reply in a way that increasingly boosts her profile and provokes Raidah into doubling down in an increasingly self destructive cycle.
Yeah. I get that feeling as well. Like, she’s trying to punch Joyce who’s just ignoring the jabs because she doesn’t realize they’re in a boxing ring.
Up until last strip I would have thought Joyce was just innocent, but I don’t think so any longer. I think she knows exactly what Raidah is doing, and her own lack of reaction is a measured, deliberate counter move.
Joyce has matured THAT much. She is now that sure of herself, that confident and that prepared to play Raidah’s bullshit alpha bongo game.
Joyce has matured into a very scary young lady quickly – I think both Sarah and Dorothy will become very nervous about this development very soon.
Nah, this is a game a lot of girls in heavily conservative religious places learn WELL. Passive aggressive sparring matches are a THING from what I’ve heard. So Raidah taking passive aggressive shots trying to get her to snap back? She can just as passive aggressively, smugly NOT react and play innocent.
When you’re not allowed to openly express hurt, anger, disgust, sadness or any other negative emotion, those emotions don’t go away. You just find a socially acceptable way to get your message across. Passive aggression is big. My mother is terrible for it – rather than telling you she thinks you’re wrong, she’ll just repeat the same question ad nauseum until your answer changes, and if you get annoyed with her for it, she’ll pretend she was just making sure, for example.
In those situations, healthy means of conflict resolution (standing up for yourself, calling out someone treating you badly, learning to use the word no, etc) are penalized heavily. I was always the “difficult” one because my autism made me too direct and unable to pick up on passive aggression at the time.
Raidah is less transparent about it than my mother. But suffice to say passive-aggressive needling is something I fully expect Joyce is well-versed in.
Afterthought: Look always for the weaponization of compliments. I fully expect Joyce’s parents are going to start in on that when she begins to fall out more with them – “You were always so responsible” – responsible here means compliant – “what happened?” or “You’ve always been the good one.” or whatever. The purpose of weaponized compliments is to serve the purpose of the carrot – it’s like love-bombing only the string is more visibly attached. The message sent is clear: You can get praise and acceptance if you return to the way you were.
I wouldn’t even really call her more mature or confident. She’s always been confident and proud of herself – she’s just got a new set of beliefs to be confident in. And well….I’d hardly call Joyce mature, really. She’s very childish still. But the passive aggressive arena isn’t really the place for that so.
Now, if she’s really misread Jacob’s ambitions then this will completely backfire, but if she hasn’t then she’s nicely set up Joyce as a sweet naive kid who isn’t going anywhere, like the rest of her family. Nothing wrong with her, but not a match for an ambitious lawyer-to-be like Jacob.
And honestly, it might work. Jacob doesn’t judge Joyce’s goals for herself – but he DOES want the big, prestigious career. The ‘glamourous’ life, as Raidah oh so condescendingly put it. He wants the career to be on par with Harrison, who he idolizes so much, and make his family proud. Joyce’s desired quiet family life with the lowing paying low prestige job isn’t a bad thing, but it’s not what Jacob wants. Someone who’s supportive of him and in an equally prestigious job? Yeah, that sounds more like Jacob’s speed. It’s why Raidah is the perfect checklist girlfriend for him.
Exactly. And remember that Jacob has no idea that Raidah’s doing this intentionally and since she’s his girlfriend, he’s likely interpreting what she’s saying pretty generously.
Can YOU imagine living up to that, Raidah? Yesterday I thought, “Yeah, that’s kinda mean,” but today she actually made me cringe.
Also, I’m betting that Jordan is either a porn star or is involved with gangs/drugs. Considering the level of sexual repression in the Brown family, it’s likely the former.
My bets are porn, gay porn, enthusiast of another religion (anywhere from ‘obnoxiously zealous former Christian White Dude atheist’ to Mormon are options here), and for an outside bet, webcomic artist. (Pornlord optional.)
Given that we know the Browns have gone through a number of churches over the years trying to find the right one “wrong brand of Christian” seems a pretty likely option. Which means a range of possibilities from “Too liberal/borderline not even Christian in the view of his parents” to “Too conservative even for the Browns.”
Yeah, the kind of church where women wearing pants is scandalous, and men having hair longer that a military recruit is suspect.
Given the level of conservative Joyce’s parents are, there’s a rather wide range of options for what Jordan could be. High school science teacher at a secular school? Athiest blogger? Planned Parenthood doctor? Avenue Q puppeteer?
I was thinking that too. Maybe he is a health teacher who covers sex ed, a legal advocate for LGBTQ+ people, a counselor who helps teenage runaways, including pregnant teenage women…basically *anything* of which Joyce’s parents wouldn’t approve. He doesn’t necessarily have to be a porn star or a druggie.
My bet is on porn being related entirely because I bet it’s related to something DW does given what he’s done with Joyce and Jocelyne.
I would actually love to see Jordan the Secular Puppeteer. (Hell, Disney Muppets are probably too vulgar for the Browns. Sesame Street could be too secular for them.)
Now I’m picturing Jordan as special effects specialist who does amazing non-digital effects for horror and science fiction movies.
Nah, Hank still considers him a good kid. If Hank turned him out, I don’t think he’d say that. Mama Brown also says it happened by them not ‘squeezing hard enough’ so its something they consider a disciplinary failure on their end.
While I think neither Joyce nor Raidah come off well in this situation AT ALL, I’ve got a fair amount of sympathy for Joyce in this strip because I have had many people belittle me exactly the way Raidah is belitting Joyce.
(I’m assuming that Raidah is being sarcastic, not honestly interested here – the visual cues, text, and bold-faced words seem to suggest snarkniess.)
Meanwhile, Joyce thinks she’s bragging about her family (and maybe showing off a little), but Raidah is being completely disdainful and trying to make it clear to everyone how “pathetic” Joyce and her life is.
Note: I may be over-personalizing because this has happened to me so often. Some sample exchanges from my life:
Snarky person: WOW, BU. I’ve heard they have some decent departments there. I actually picked them as my safety school.
Snarky person: Well, while that’s *interesting,* in the past twenty years literary criticism has really advanced and moved past simplistic dated interpretations.
Ew, people. (Though I could see me saying something like the dress one sincerely, tone is everything and there’s a world of difference between that and ‘I couldn’t pull that off but you look great in it!’ or similar sentiments.)
Yeah – tone doesn’t always come through in text. That’s why I said it’s possible Raidah is being sincere. However, I really doubt it, especially given Willis’ visuals.
Trust me, the person who said this to me was NOT saying “I couldn’t pull that off but you can.” I have said some version of that statement to friends and family members and honestly meant it. Apply snark filter +10 to each of the Snarky People above. 😛
I think that kind of meanness is the worst, because it’s so hard to counter (at least for me). If someone flat-out tells me, “I think you’re too stupid to be in this class and I don’t like you,” that is hurtful, but at least I can flat-out tell them to fuck off. If they’re being snarky and smarmy, it’s still hurtful, but I am going to look crazy if I get angry. (“What’s wrong with you? I was just pointing out something to *help* you understand the reading…”)
As a side-note, now that I’m kind-of grown up and working in my chosen field, I can say that there is less of this kind of snarkiness. But it’s still there and is more insidious and harder to counter. Poot.
Snide: Oh you ran out of money to finish your degree at that private university and you didn’t want to take a loan? That’s ok, plenty of people get degrees from ‘community colleges for work’.
I teach at a community college and I will put my students and the quality of education they receive up against any private university, any day.
In fact, I think that in many cases you can get a *better* education at a community college or public 4-year school. A lot of times the professors choose those schools because they are really committed to education and helping everyone receive a quality education, whether they are wealthy or not (that is the reason why I teach where I do). Professors at “fancy” schools may want the “prestige” that goes along with saying they teach there and don’t really care much about the students or education in general. (I went to graduate school with some of those people.)
Also, the student experience may be better at a 2-year school because, overall, most students *want* to be there. They may be paying their own way, or looking to advance in their careers, or (like you) may not want to go into the massive debt that comes along with most private university degrees in the U.S. They are overall not privileged, entitled kids whose parents are paying their way and who sleep or party through class because it’s “only daddy’s money, anyway.” *snark* A classroom full of engaged, committed students is, IMHO, a much better learning atmosphere than a classroom full of students who don’t care or, worse, feel they have the right to tell the teacher how to run the class or what grades to give them because “My family pays X amount of dollars for me to be here.”
(That last is not a hypothetical. I once had a friend who adjuncted at a very expensive private college and students *literally* said those things to her.)
Hell, my mom is a doctor of clinical psychology and a licensed forensic psychologist with more career experiences and accomplishments than I can list here, and she started out at a community college! Your classmates are just being snobs and you can laugh at them when they are declaring bankruptcy because of student loan debt and/or finding out that in the real world, an expensive degree from a “prestigious” school is not necessarily a guarantee of anything.
Thankfully everyone in my family has had a much better reaction. There’s was more of a “They were going to charge you THAT MUCH for classes? Yeah, you definitely made the right choice.” Put snide, snobby people who work at the same place but in a “higher prestige” role are real assholes sometimes. And I’ll definitely agree on Community Colleges being a better experience. Drunk roommates who are English majors who can fall back on their parents successful medium sized business are not conducive to a learning environment.
I’m really glad you have your family’s support, even if your former classmates are being spoiled douchecanoes. 🙂
The cost of a college education in this country is *insane,* especially because it’s getting harder and harder to get even a semi-professional job without a college degree. And non-loan financial aid (like scholarships, grants, and work-study programs) is fast disappearing.
It is. In fact, there are only 8 or 9 countries (depending on source) in the world with a GDP larger than that.
Umm, does anyone else feel slightly…weirded out by the way Raidah’s talking about Harrison? It just feels a little off that she seems so focused on her SO’s brother.
I think she’s trying to get a rise out of Joyce. She’s assuming that, being the kind of Christian she is, Joyce will find fighting for transgender rights abhorrent.
Is Joyce even aware yet that transgender people exist (other than whatever her church might have told her)? She knows Carla has her own room but she doesn’t know why, and she thinks her sister Jocelyne is “Joshua”.
I mean, honestly? Doubtful. We expect her to come around quickly once she finds out a la Becky, but Carla isn’t anywhere near close enough friends yet to tell the clearly-early-stages-recovering-fundie what trans people are, and Jocelyn’s not ready to break ties from the rest of the family yet. She could have found out things online when she was looking up LGBT-friendly scripture interpretations, but if she missed the Ruth and Naomi one, I doubt she was looking hard enough to get a solid crash course on LGBT issues outside that.
Oh, I’m sure she knows about the term transgender. That bathroom nonsense a while ago didn’t pop up out of nowhere and I’d not be surprised if her church was ALL UP IN IT.
Do we… even know what Becky’s mentality towards trans* people is? I wouldn’t go “lesbian therefore informed about and cool with trans folk”, personally. I mean, she didn’t even know that bisexuality was a “thing”, so I’m honestly not leaning towards her knowing more than Joyce. And I hope she would be chill once informed but you sadly can’t assume that.
TERFs are mostly lesbians, so Becky being a lesbian means less than nothing about how accepting she’ll be of trans people.
Personally, I am thinking Becky will follow the Becky pattern: “Pfft, that doesn’t exist – wait it does?! Wow, people are weird. I don’t get it but whatever floats yer boat.” and thereafter radically accepting. Because that’s Becky.
Joyce OTOH I think is going to have another moral panic because that’s Joyce. But she loves her siblings enough I think Jocelyn might wind up being the straw that breaks the back of her faith.
Yeah, Joyce will flip out and be confused and say hurtful things, but she’ll come around – like she has with every other one of these kinds of issues, because people are more important to Joyce.
Except in one circumstance: If it’s Jocelyn and in the midst of conflict with her parents, in which case it’ll be full on righteous fury from the start.
Yeah agreed. In conflict, Joyce prioritizes the wellbeing of those she cares about and feels are being attacked.
Then again, between Jocelyn and her parents… I wouldn’t put it past Joyce to freeze if she’s surprised by Jocelyn’s gender. If she knows ahead of time, I see her going full righteous fury. If she’s surprised, I see her freezing in shock – we’ve seen before that Joyce very much has fight-or-freeze in response to adrenaline. She doesn’t seem to have much of a flight response – and typically when she’s frozen, it’s because the situation is completely outside of anything she’s ever entertained as a possibility before. She froze when Ross pointed a gun at her for example.
Seeing the favorite get into a blow up fight with the parents over gender identity would probably fall in the category of “completely outside anything she’s ever entertained as a possibility before.” And I can see it really messing with her mind if she did freeze.
I half-think the reason she’s interested in Jacob to begin with, or at least willing to seriously pursue him, is that she wants a contact there. Networking is everything, after all. And if Jacob is attached to her, he needs to be at least as glamorous as she is.
It’s one of the methods that she controls Jacob – “If you don’t achieve the same absurd levels of success as your brother then you are intrinsically a failure; let me help you!”
Jacob already wanted to live up to his brother’s reputation. We can’t pin that one on Raidah. Regardless, it’s definitely something she brings up a lot – in this case, to get him to see he and Joyce want very different things professionally, and before when she was turning Jacob’s offer to fool around down.
We can’t hold it against Raidah that he does. She however seems to have grabbed onto it to use as a lever to manipulate him. That we can hold against her.
We can’t hold it against Raidah that Jacob feels inferior to his brother. We can and do hold it against her that she is stroking that insecurity to her own ends.
I’m not even sure it’s “feels inferior”. You don’t have to be insecure to look up to an older sibling and want to emulate them. Especially when Harrison has to be good deal older – probably close to 10 years at least, if he’s a full-fledged lawyer with a significant role on a case like that.
Oh absolutely. She’s working that desire to emulate his awesome big brother and make his family proud like its her JOB and that is absolutely something to be criticized.
I’m waiting for Jordan to be absurdly inoffensive but not toeing extremely close to the church/party line and that’s why every member of Joyce’s family is being weird about it.
Like, he’s a pharmacy tech or something but his not being a missionary had Hank and Carol sweating bullets.
Probably the most likely option, all told. (Except maybe ‘religion is the opiate of the masses’ atheist. He doesn’t appear to be particularly interested in reaching out to the family, but we have a very narrow perspective here. And as far as we know, Jocelyn hasn’t reached out to him, which could mean a lot of things, but again the narrow perspective means that’s not given as true.)
When I first re-came out (I had come out as a teen and they thought it was a phase), I was told in no uncertain terms to stay away from my sister’s kids. So I visited only once a year for several years. They’ve begun unbending because they’ve realized my sexual orientation will outlast their bigotry and for all their other faults, they do view having me in their life as more important than their bigotry. So, there’s that.
Yeah, I’m just wondering if that cut off has prevented him from contacting Jocelyn as well. Again, we have such a limited perspective we don’t know either way. Doesn’t help that we don’t know how much older Jordan is than Jocelyn, either, or WHEN the estrangement began, which could both contribute to whether or not they’ve tracked each other down or tried.
Joyce’s parents have literally cut off Jordan from contact with the rest of their family. (To the extent that they can — presumably they no longer have that power over Jocelyn.)
Whatever Jordan has said or done or been has to be something that would make Hank and Carol cut off one of their own children. When you consider that Carol has said she would die for Joyce, cutting off Jordan must have resulted from something drastic (from Carol’s point of view).
My money says Raidah brought up Jacob’s brother’s work on the transgender rights case in hopes of setting off a nasty reaction from Joyce to make her look bad in Jacob’s eyes. Jacob must have told Raidah that Joyce grew up in a regressive church, but he must have neglected to tell her that Joyce’s best friend is a lesbian.
It’s been, at most, six or seven weeks since Joyce believed, unquestioningly, everything that her church taught her. With the sliding timescale and this being conservative-leaning Indiana, Joyce’s church was quite likely involved in the whole anti-trans stuff that got kicked up a notch a few years back…and with Joyce having no idea about Carla, Jocelyne not being out to her, and Joyce not being in Alex’s class, Joyce may very well have no idea about trans people beyond what her church has taught her (“they’re all waiting to assault you in your bathrooms!” etc). She hasn’t yet, to my knowledge, had an epiphany about them the way she did when Becky showed up – I’m betting that’s most likely to take place only if and when Jocelyne comes out to her.
Being okay with gay people (or even being a gay people)is super different from accepting trans people, let alone cherishing them enough to really prove Raidah wrong
Sad to say but there are people who identify as gay who are staunchly anti-trans- basically for the same reason you get some insecure straight guys who are angry about trans women. “I’m into the same sex and this person was once not considered that and icky and cooties and it makes me ANGRY!”
I mean, I don’t know how common that is. I suspect a lot of it is more low-key “well I don’t want to date them”. But yeah, it’s out there.
There’s also TERFs, who are worse because they’re that kind of bigotry only organized and acting with planned malevolence.
*Partnered with groups that advocate the death penalty for LGBTQIA people, bonding over their mutual hatred of trans people
Could go on but yeah. I won’t mention She Who Shall Not Be Named here but there is a certain TERF who will show up with the initials CB who is particularly awful if you google them. The reason I am not mentioning her by name here is she literally googles her own name a lot and has, does, and will come after any site host who has comments critical of her – she’s a big fan of SLAPP suits.
I can’t tell if you (Jason and ischemgeek) are trying to build on what I said or correct me. If it’s the latter these are what I meant, I just didn’t expand on it at the time
Sorry had a damn stressful day sooo… longstoryshort had to face a phobia and yeah. Did the thing, didn’t puke or run screaming out of the room or hit anyone, did cry and pass out, still calling it a win.
Yeah, and there’s also a huge difference between being supportive of gay people and supportive of a gay person. Which, not to say that Joyce isn’t the former, but simply her having a lesbian as her best friend does not automatically mean she’s accepting or even tolerant of the LGBT community at large. Though we as the audience know Joyce’s feelings towards the gay community, that doesn’t mean people in-comic know it. After all, someone who doesn’t know Joyce that well could see Becky as being an ‘exception’ in her eyes, rather than proof of Joyce’s opinions changing.
Have I ever mentioned that I’m surprised that Willis’s kids don’t both have names starting with the same letter?
I’m also annoyed that it doesn’t have Babylon 5; now we’ll have to dig up old files that theoretically exist on some device somewhere in this house… (but hey, at least I’m not fighting with the corrupted ds9 dvds that we paid good money for only 7 years ago 😛 )
Given who Joyce’s parents are, that probably means that Jordan has left their faith and gone on to do something pretty startlingly different.
As someone who ended up an areligious Christian/Buddhist mix with plenty of friends raised fundie who went pagan and Buddhist, I could see that being at least as scandalous as coming out gay to them.
Jordan’s part of some ultra-secret military or intelligence agency special ops unit. The Browns don’t like it because they don’t trust secular governments. They only know about it because they were inadvertent witnesses to some operation Jordan was involved in, and can’t tell Joyce because it’s classified.
I don’t think there are dangerous aliens in this universe. I was thinking along the lines of some part of the CIA’s Directorate of Operations, or a military outfit like Delta Force. Of course this being fiction it would probably be a made up one.
You know, we have been told one thing about Jordan: he and his parents don’t always see eye to eye, but he’s still a good kid.
So it would seem Jordan has left the ways of humanity behind and now lives on a farm as a goat. I’m not sure all that entails, but you can see how such religious parents might be reluctant to discuss that kink with their daughter.
Replace “goat” with “horse”, and you have the book ending to Gulliver’s Travels. That always really weirded me out, reading the unabridged edition when I was younger.
I would just like to point out that, while “missionary” is low-paying, it is historically pretty high class, as poor people couldn’t typically afford to go traipsing off to be missionaries. Missionaries also have to speak a foreign language, which often took several years of university training.
EG, Sidney Gulick, missionary to Japan, 1860-1945, held degrees from Dartmouth, Oberlin, and Yale. He taught at Doshisha University in Kyoto and lectured at the Kyoto Imperial University.
A childhood friend of mine hails from an old missionary family; she attended the London School of Economics and now works for the UN.
While we’re at it, since very few people are defending Raidah, I’d like to note that it is entirely possible that she is not being evil. I am not the best judge of facial expressions, but she looks like she is genuinely smiling at the beginning of the comic. Maybe Jacob’s brother is just an interesting topic of conversation and she actually admires him. She doesn’t know much about Joyce’s family before asking, so she’s not purposefully setting things up to make Joyce look bad.
Since Raidah isn’t a main cast character and it’s been a while since we’ve had much of a scene with her, I can’t remember too much of what she’s like, and we haven’t seen much from within her point of view. Which means… we don’t really have a whole lot of information about her. She might have a good side.
For example, if we only saw Sarah’s behavior from the outside–the side her friends saw–we’d see someone who got her roommate expelled because she was taking her mother’s death badly. Until we know more of Raidah’s side of things, or see more of her, I’m comfortable with entertaining the possibility that she has a good side.
Her last appearance before this lunch was chatting with her cronies about Joyce sniffing around her man. She raced down her as soon as she heard about Jacob and Joyce having lunch. She had that nice little staredown with Joyce when she showed up.
If the situation were reversed and Raidah were purposefully flirting with Joyce’s boyfriend, and Joyce showed up, concerned, we’d think Joyce was pretty much in the right.
Absolutely. I read your other post as saying she wasn’t being hostile here – genuinely smiling, not purposefully making Joyce look bad, etc.
That she’s concerned is very normal. I do think she’s being pretty ugly about how she’s expressing that concern – both here and when she was talking to her gang about it.
very few people are defending raidah because it’s not a particularly defensible position. that stuff you can’t remember (and/or haven’t noticed), it’s in the comments, and it’s pretty damning.
Stuff Raidah did in the past, however, is not stuff that is happening right now, and people are judging the current situation.
So far she’s asked about Jacob’s brother, said something nice about him, and asked about Joyce’s family. “So, Joyce, do you have any brothers or sisters?” is not exactly A-level evil.
Shockingly, when people judge a situation, they often consider what the people involved have said and done in the past and what that reveals about motivation for their current actions.
Are you really asking that we judge each and every day’s strip with no reference to any previous strips? I mean, you’re even ignoring the pointed comments about Joyce’s financial prospects from yesterday’s strip at this very same lunch.
Suddenly, I’m wondering if Raidah is really interested in Harrison and is trying to turn Jacob into a carbon copy so she can have one too.
Yeah, I’ve been reading that line in a few days. I think she’s TRYING to make it sound friendly and competitive for Jason, but really saying ‘can you even imagine living up to something even acceptable to associate with jacob?’ to Joyce, and aldo like she’s saying Jacob is going to have to try topping that and then look how cool her boyfriend ans later convenient husband or associate will be.
You know, it had been me policy to hold judgement on Raidah until this point. We hadn’t seen her much when she wasn’t around Sarah, and treaty your enemies poorly is to be expected. But this is just the worst. I was willing to let Raidah show me some further layer of complexity, but instead she gives me this. Valley girl shit that anyone would have seen through in the seventh grade, let alone in college.
I wasn’t fond of Raidah from the little bit we’ve seen, but my distaste for her is growing rapidly. I’m getting the feeling that she is fundamentally just not a nice person. Or has a very narrow definition of ‘nice’ that only applies to her privileged few.
Nah, the fallout between Raidah and Sarah was very understandable. Not being able to watch it play out in front of us I find it very easy to believe either sides version.
That whole situation was a giant shade of grey especially considering how shit Sarah is at not coming across as wholly self interested to people who don’t know her really well.
“Definitely the best kind of missionary” is top level response to “he’s a missionary with a cool car.” I’m not fond of Raidah, but kudos for that one, at least.
Other people have commented on Raidah bringing up Harrison, but yeah. That’s a big thing, isn’t it? I find it quite disturbing how eager Jacob is to be like his brother and, worse, how quick Raidah is to press on that. She really doesn’t seem to be in the relationship for the relationship- and same for Jacob, he’s with her because of a literal checklist according to him and she backs that up, saying she’s what he needs for the future.
But more to the point, there seems to be something going on with regards to Harrison. It doesn’t seem to be resentment, but the mere mention of him seems to drive Jacob, which hugely concerns me. He seems to me to be the most likeable character to date, and I want to see him with minimum baggage and maximum happiness.
Unfortunately, this is Dumbing of Age. A baggage-free and emotionally-healthy main cast character is extremely unlikely. Heck, as a rule, even the secondary-level characters have their serious issues!
Riley, Sierra, Other Rachel, Other Rachel’s gf whose name I can’t bothered to look up, the tattooed arm guy (I want to say Amir?) and HIS bf, and precious cinnamon roll Agatha seem to be of the very few that avoided the baggage claim.
This is, of course, a necessity of narration. “This person was extremely well-adjusted and moved through their life without shenanigans” does not make for a compelling story.
Dina’s got a pretty good head on her shoulders and is largely free of drama that isn’t other people’s that she involves herself in of her own choice.
Noting that it was Raidah who brought up the transgender laws thing… I wonder if she’s trying to get Joyce to do a conservative Christian freakout in front of Jacob so Jacob won’t find her quite so cute anymore?
Raidah is Muslim and I’m certain she’s had her share of Barbie blonde evangelicals freaking out at her before. If I had to hazard a guess, she knows Jacob looks up to his brother, therefore she can guess he supports his brother’s ethics and is progressive. She knows Joyce was brought up in a religious conservative household. She’s seen Joyce have freakouts before (the dress being too low-cut).
I don’t think her bringing up the trans stuff was a mistake. If I’m right, let’s expect to see more of it as she tries to find the right angle to set Joyce off.
(Also, props to Willis for not only seeing but portraying well the way cis feminists sometimes weaponize trans narratives to their own ends. Well done – I’ve seen more than a few cis feminists bring up trans issues at strategic times to try to provoke a freak-out that would justify out-grouping someone they don’t like).
Raidah’s a fantastic character – IMO she’s an excellent foil for Dorothy. They’re both ambitious, they’re both driven, both going to law school. The main difference is Raidah knows what is going to get her ahead in life, and knows for damn sure that’s not academics – it’s human connections and networking. Dorothy is still sheltered enough to think that grades matter at all for anything past getting your first post-uni job (Protip: they don’t. Networking is way more important) and that she won’t have to compromise herself to get where she wants to go.
Raidah’s also a great foil for Sarah, although Sarah’s differences has to do more with her difficulty in making human connections. Dorothy is good at making connections, she just de-prioritizes it in favor of academics. Sarah on the other hand is just bad at social. Dorothy can learn to reassess her priorities from Raidah, but Sarah needs to watch how Raidah gets most of their friend group wrapped around her finger – even the people who don’t like Raidah wind up doing what she wants them to do. That’s a really good skill in a lawyer, especially any type of lawyer who wants to end up doing trials (thought I’d suspect Raidah wants to go business law as opposed to one of the disciplines that gets more trial time because that has higher status and more money).
I want to see more Dorothy-Raidah interactions because I think Dorothy could learn a lot from Raidah. I’d like to see more Sarah-Raidah interactions because it’d be nice to see Sarah recognize Raidah has a strength where she has a weakness and work on it accordingly.
To be clear, I don’t approve of what Raidah is doing here, but Raidah has her shit together far more than most of the audience (and cast for that matter) gives her credit for. She’s not a great person, to be sure, but she is formidable. As they currently are, Raidah would have much better odds of eventually making first female president than Dorothy, if she were a white Christian instead of a brown Muslim. The really scary thing is, I wouldn’t put it past Raidah to have figured that out and changed her ambitions accordingly.
For Jacob’s part… I feel bad for him. It’s rough if you have an older sibling who is so obviously a super-achiever. I’m guessing Jacob has always gone through being what, for any other kid, would be considered a star student – member of the football team, good grades, genuinely helpful, etc. But because of his older brother, he sees himself as lacking – since no matter what he does, his brother did it first and better.
And immediately after she brings up transgender issues, she dismisses Joyce’s transgender sister for being a blogger. Not that any of them know she’s transgender, but it’s a clear signal to the readers that Raidah’s probably a Roz.
I see more Carol in Raidah than Roz. Roz isn’t cunning and calculating the way Raidah is. Roz knows how to play the manipulation game, but she seems incapable of taking the long view, and she’s not ruthless enough.
Which probably explains why and how Joyce saw through her provocation and refused to take the bait so well. She’s had a lot of practice with her mother.
This seems a weird accusation. Raidah is dismissive of the blogger, not of the transwoman, because “blogger” does not match the achievements she or Jacob have idealized for themselves.
Yeah I think you’re right – Raidah is dismissive of blogger. She has no way of knowing Jocelyn is trans.
That said, I think she let the subject get changed from trans stuff because Joyce didn’t take the bait. I think Raidah is now trying to figure out how to provoke a reaction.
In North America, most professional schools (engineering excepted for some reason) require an undergrad degree before you can apply. Law typically requires undergrad in science, engineering, criminology, or political science.
Thanks. Are those Law prereqs an expectation that you should have some knowledge of the stuff whose regulations you’ll be working with?
In Canada yeah. So like if you’re wanting to be a patent lawyer, it’s a good idea to have science or engineering background. If you want to go into business law, a business degree is probably a good idea. Etc.
To make it extra confusing some places offer an undergrad in certain areas of law that is not enough to pass the bar or become a lawyer but is enough to give you a leg up to law school.
Engineer here. Unless one is going to become licensed as a Professional Engineer (PE), a Bachelor degree in Engineering is usually sufficient to do work in the corporate or R&D world. PE can be thought of as analogous to passing the bar for lawyers or the licensing exams for MDs or RNs.
Pretty much any major (humanities included) works for law, they mostly just want to know you can think. My mother got into Georgetown with a French degree.
It’s kind of ironic that Raidah is defending trans people just to look superior, but she unknowingly mocked the sibling of Joyce that is a trans woman.
Also, my predictions of what Jordan does are: porn star, stripper, liberal activist, Democrat, the New Wolf of Wall Street, a scientologist, a bomber of abortion clinics, a member of a Fight Club, an alt right racist, a social justice warrior, a stunt double, a hitman, the wingman of the celebrities, the lawyer of Hollywood’s elite, etc.
I have SERIOUS doubts that New Wolf of Wall Street, bomber of abortion clinics, or alt right racist would cause him to be ostracised by Carol. 50/50 on hitman, depending on what contracts he took.
Carol’s standards of what makes a good person are quite strict and far away from normal standards of today.
And I love the amount of pride Joyce has in her siblings even though Raidah is trying to be classist as fuck at her. Like, yeah, Jocelyne is a BLOGGER and that’s awesome and so on.
I’m still stuck on $50k *USD* not being considered a lot of money. That’s like, $67k AUD. If I had a job that paid that, I could afford an inner-city apartment by myself, a pet, good food, private health insurance, and saving up to actually buy a house. Maybe I’m aiming low but that’s a friggin dream to me.
Raidahs strategy did, at first, appear odd to me in that she seemed to be playing to Joyces strengths by playing up now good, decent and nice Joyce is but now its becoming clearer that Raidah is letting Jacob subtly know that what he wants seems to be incompatible with what Joyce clearly wants
Jacob clearly wants to be a success, as does Joyce, but his version of success includes climbing the corporate/law ladder and making a difference whereas Joyces idea of success is more geared towards marriage and family (of course Jacob also wants that but he probably assumes that will happen rather than work towards it)
To cbwroses: Agreed, Jacob is too perfect at the moment as the only flaw he seems to have is, and its quite a stretch to describe it as such, being a bit oblivious
Might be even subtler – Jacob wants someone who’s going to be working with him, sharing his goals. Whether that’s actually working together in the same business or just doing the same kind of “making a difference”, while Joyce is stuck in the “husband goes out and does that stuff while I stay home with the kids as support.”
Now, I’m pretty sure Joyce is going to move away from that, but Jacob doesn’t realize we’re in a long term character arc. 🙂
I’m not keen on the view that materialism is somehow more, or less, virtuous than the other. Its a good thing Joyce (maybe) wants to teach kids, teaching is a noble profession but going out and doing what Harrison has done is also noble.
But yeah its a big difference in expectations, Jacob realises that to achieve what he wants to achieve that it’d be in his best interest to have a like minded partner because they’ll be more likely receptive to the extremely long and arduous hours it’ll take Jacob to get there
Joyce, at the moment, is sounding like she wants something else entirely, more likely a doting husband that won’t be spending a lot of time away from home and won’t be putting his career ahead of his family
Joyce specifically is in education so she can home school her kids because, I dunno, women working outside home (unless its for church) is the Devil. Becky was shoved that way too until she came out and realized she could do what she wanted.
I’m just really liking that this storyline isn’t cut and dried “shes good so she deserves the boy and shes bad so she deserves to lose the boy” kind of thing
Yeah, Raidah seems to make Jacob very happy – he’s not stopped smiling at her since she came (except once when he was confused by Joyce calling 50K a lot of money).
Whereas Joyce’s familial success is in opposition to Jacob’s. If she finds out what “transgender” is, she’ll have a learning curve.
Radiah seems to be trying to make Joyce look bad, but it’s really making Radiah look snobbish. I think Radiah is going to end up shooting herself in the foot with this tactic.
I’m not thrilled with Joyce, though I do think they’d make a cute couple. But I dislike Raidah more and more as she continues to exist on panel.
I feel like Raidah is someone who’s very concerned with appearing acceptable and doesn’t really care about much that’s beyond that. She’ll tell off her friend for calling Dina the R-word, but she’ll still call her mentally challenged to her face and talk down to her. She’ll bring up trans people as a tool to provoke a fundamentalist and seem better than her, she’ll use subtle classism as a way of getting one over on a romantic rival. From the way she mentioned Harrison, which we’ve seen is an insecurity of Jacob’s, I feel like he’s not safe from this attitude either.
Joyce is being shitty here, but her behavior is pretty limited to just Raidah and Jacob. I think why I like Raidah less than Joyce (besides Joyce being the main character) is because she’s consistently used outsiders against people she’s fighting with. You can see it here with her bringing up Harrison and putting Joyce’s family and class on blast, and you could see it earlier where she tried to use Dina’s (perceived) disability to turn people against Sarah. Raidah’s high-stakes ruthless in pretty low-stakes interactions.
I wouldn’t call Harrison an insecurity of Jacob’s. He seems pretty happy talking about him and really seems to admire him. He wants to be like him and make his family proud but that’s not the same thing as being insecure and worried about him.

Working-class family man Christopher Robin encounters his childhood friend Winnie-the-Pooh, who helps him to rediscover the joys of life. ...
Since there are already plenty of biographies for Amy all over the web ("Amy Sedaris was born on March 29, 1961,to Lou and Sharon Sedaris in upstate New York..."--that kind), I thought it would be more fun to compile a list of really bizarro and useless trivia and stories that will make you adore [or be weirded out by] Amy even more. Oh, and yes, she's the younger sister of bestselling author David Sedaris.
"What you have to understand about this lovely woman is, in addition to being a fine actress and a wonderful comedienne, she's peculiar.... You have to keep that in mind because she's like -- and joyfully, gladfully -- different from everybody else walking around on the planet. That's what makes her special. That's why we embrace her. But, you know. She's not hooked up right."
She had a fatty suit made just to wear home to Raleigh for a brief visit to screw with her weight-conscious father. It tore him up to think that his daughter had "let herself go" but Amy did it for the laughs.
She really wanted some Vicodin one Christmas Eve. Upon walking out of her apartment on a search for it, she ran into a woman on crutches--who took her up to her apartment and gave her Vicodin. Amy calls it the "Miracle on Christopher Street."
She taught Martha Stewart how to make a grilled cheese sandwich in prison by using an iron... in 2001. She also gave Martha a squirrel-shaped wooden bong which she carved herself, and told her it was packed.
She had a long-time imaginary boyfriend named Ricky... Who worked as a grip in Argentina, brought her back saffron, lost all of his tools in a camper fire and suffered a stroke. She and Ricky had a baby, Hercules, the around same time that David Letterman's son was born. Amy said they had been "trying for hours."
She briefly had a know-it-all imaginary dog named Douglas, but he went away when she ran out of random facts for him to know. She also had an imaginary monkey named Pockets.
Everything in Amy's apartment comes alive at night. Even her dustpan, which is known to be a real pain the ass.
In Fall 2003, she started an amateur craft club called The Crafty Beavers. She's the club president and they meet on a weekly basis. Felt is their medium of choice, and it's largely an excuse to smoke pot.
She wanted to write a children's book about a worm going on a journey to find out what kind of worm he is. In the end, he finds out he's a tequila worm and it's about reaching for the lowest star. The [lame] folks at Hyperion didn't buy it.
When Amy was young, she had a club called the Funny Face Club (she was the only member), and she would go door-to-door after Halloween and offer to take away her neighbors' pumpkins for 25 cents. She'd take the quarter, then just go throw the pumpkins in the street.
She once ate a whole pot brownie "because I was hungry," then had to have her doorman talk her down from a really bad high for an hour and a half.
When she was little, she once got caught stealing a fistful of twenties from a grocery store cash register. When confronted, she said that she wasn't stealing. She was just pretending to steal. She was pretending to be a thief, and that's what thieves do--they steal.
Once when she couldn't sleep, Amy went online and ordered Ambien from a lab in Florida. It came the next day, and when she took it without any regard to the directions, it completely messed her up. When she woke up the next day, her computer was "mysteriously" broken.
She once made a Visine-laced cocktail because she heard it would cause instant diarrhea, and she wanted to see for herself if that was true. It was.
She makes seasonal hats for her taxidermied squirrel, Winks, such as a pilgrim's buckle hat for Thanksgiving, and Indian headdress for an Indian summer.
Amy and her brother David once took out Paul Dinello's car. She ran it into a parked car (hopefully by accident, I'd assume) and when Paul returned home, she and David were laughing about it.
When Paper magazine named her one of New York's most beautiful women, she showed up to the photo show looking unkempt, with unwashed hair, and had a make-up artist make her look battered and beaten.
She wants to make a sitcom out of 'Night Mother, where the daughter tries to kill herself a different way in every episode.
Things that make Amy laugh: People falling down, monkeys, seeing mushrooms or toadstools, men in fur, skin disorders, people crying while driving.
She would love to have a hospitality show, where each week she'd have to overcome an obstacle--like having really long legs and not being able to get off the couch--but still having to put dinner on the table.
She collects fake food (plaster meat and vegetables), but won't buy it online because she consider that "cheating."
When she was little, Amy would dress up, wear a wig and go to the grocery store with her father in character every week.
When she was about 12, she'd dress up, call her father at work and proposition him, pretending to be a woman from the art gallery that her family frequented. The charades went on for a while, and her dad always fell for it.
She wanted to name the family vacation home "The Nut Hut," and persisted on calling it that, even after they didn't buy the home.
When she adopted her first rabbit, Tattletail, Amy told her that she needed to get a job to earn her share... and she meant it. She created a catering company, selling cupcakes and cheeseballs, called Tattletail Industries. The money went into a jar to pay for the rabbit's care. After Tattletail passed away, Amy adopted another rabbit, a mini-rex which she named Dusty, and changed the name of her catering business to Dusty Food Cupcakes.
At an Obie awards reception, when Ethan Hawke told Amy that she had the prettiest dress at the party, she told him, "It looks better on the floor. You could talk me out of it." He was apparently taken quite by surprise.
She had a necklace made out of wig hair samples. Hideous samples of hair that hang down about 5 inches. She says she wants to go to a Korean restaurant wearing the necklace, then complain that there's hair in her food.
For her birthday in 2004, Amy asked Todd Oldham to make her 5 BLT sandwiches out of expensive felt. Or if he couldn't do that, ten halves.

For those with a large Twitter following, you can make money from your Tweets alone with Sponsored Tweets. You could be paid for sharing a business’s information, recommending restaurants or hotels, or tweeting pictures of you using or wearing products. As with all sponsored posts on social media, businesses will only be prepared to pay you to Tweet if you have a large following that you can influence. So work hard on building up a loyal fan base.
Signing up with Google AdSense will enable you to make money from advertising on your blog. Google AdSense will place relevant ads around your site, and if your site visitors click on these ads, you will earn a fee. Although each click only amounts to small change, if your blog has high levels of traffic, this will quickly amount to a reasonable sum.
If you have a passion project, Kickstarter may be exactly what you need to get it off the ground. Celebs like Zach Braff and Melissa Joan Hart have used this site in attempts to fund their movie projects. Some crack dealers in Canada inspired a “crackstarter” campaign from Gawker for pictures of the Toronto mayor smoking crack with them. All you need is a dream, a goal, a budget, and a great pitch to convince people to come to the site and donate to your Kickstarter campaign. Panhandling isn’t dead – it’s gone digital…
One of the most in-demand services that you can offer to fit the active-income bill online, is software development. Software development, or coding as it’s generally referred to nowadays, is in high demand and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future as the reach of technology continues to unravel its tentacles further and further into our lives.
A site called User Testing will actually pay you a fee to evaluate websites. It typically pays you $10 for each video that you review – which typically takes about 20 minutes. If the work is there, and you are particularly good at it, you could earn up to $30 per hour. That’s a pretty solid pay rate for a work-at-home job. You wouldn’t have to work a whole lot of hours to generate a decent part-time monthly income.
Great post to start the week. I have been an affiliate with my web host for a few years and earn commissions sharing the services. The same man owns a fitness program and I am a founding member there also. Both programs are less than $10 a month so you need to build a large team and help that team duplicate to earn commissions that will let you work full time from home.
Where Indeed excels at finding job postings across the web and acting as a search crawler for employment, maybe a full-fledged career is too big of a commitment at this point in your life. Elance is a site to find freelance work of all types. I’ve used it for quick writing, editing, copywriting, resume building, and other odd jobs and temp gigs. The experience has been great.
The audiobook industry is booming, yet only 5% of books ever get made into audio format. If you’ve got a background in acting, or if people have said you’ve got a voice made for the radio, you can make extra money recording audio versions of independent and popular books. Sites like ACX connect authors with audiobook performers. So, whether you’re an author looking for more ways to sell your book, or an actor/voice actor looking to make some extra income, you can sell your services online.
Cafe Press: This website allows you to create digital designs that can then be sold on the platform. You'll earn a commission for everything that sells and you'll never have to deal with printing, warehousing, customer service and so on. The site has over 2 million independent designers that have created products being sold online here. If you have some graphic design skills, then this is a great potential source for your web-based income.
Now most affiliate programs have strict terms and conditions on how the lead is to be generated. There are also certain methods that are outright banned, such as installing adware or spyware that redirect all search queries for a product to an affiliate's page. Some affiliate marketing programs go as far as to lay out how a product or service is to be discussed in the content before an affiliate link can be validated.
Instead of building from the ground up, many networks are leveraging technology that already exists, then building on top of it to customize their systems. We see this all the time with HasOffers. For example, Kiip, a mobile advertising network with powerhouse clients like McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Wrigley, Pepsi, and BMW, decided to build on top of HasOffers instead of starting from scratch. “After sitting down with the HasOffers team, it quickly became clear that we could rely on something that was already built and allow our engineers to focus on developing our secret sauce,” said Corrigan Neralich, Senior Director of Advertising Operations.
Affiliate marketing has now invaded Hollywood? We know it invaded US politics in Washington as some politicians (current and retired) are silent affiliate marketers or in MLM. Maybe we can look forward to hearing in the next few years about more celebrities going from actors and actresses to home-based affiliate marketers. Wouldn’t that be something?
Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing is a great learning tool, even if you are a brand new blogger. By taking this course, you will start off blogging the correct way. You can learn from my affiliate marketing mistakes and learn the best ways to start making an income by being an affiliate. Through taking this course you are sure to grow a profitable blog quicker than the average blogger, as you'll learn exactly what you need to know about affiliate marketing. So, even if you only have one blog post, you are ready to get started with this course!
This is Simon, thank you for your post, it is very helpful for me. However, we are a lighting company, and we are plan to try the Affiliate Website to increase our sale. But it seem that there are many different Affiliate website to be chose and some of them also need pay some fee to begin, so as we just begin to do this, which website is your recommend ?
ShareASale — ShareASale provides access to more than 3,300 separate merchant affiliate programs in many vertical markets, including food, apparel, and home and garden. The network has smaller brands than most of its competitors, but many affiliate partners offer high payouts: The stationary company Tinyprints offers 10% commission on sales, or $5 per lead; while PerkStreet Financial Commissions offers as much as $50 a sale. The Affluent Blogger’s Aiden Clinton speaks highly of ShareASale’s intuitive web interface, asserting that it is particularly convenient for companies that run multiple websites. ShareASale also offers referral bonuses for signing up new affiliate marketers.
Too much too soon. Stick to one website to begin with. Don’t get distracted by shiny new niches. This will only dilute your efforts. It’s absolutely not a waste of time to spend hours on end researching the very best niche for you to enter into. The commission, cookies, product and even the advertiser’s website all have to be excellent. The last thing you want to do is invest money in creating your own site only to send visitors to an advertiser’s site that barely converts a single sale. Would you buy from the advertiser’s site? Question everything before you spend a single penny on building your new site.

Basic Sauerkraut is so delicious (see my how to here). I have it with eggs, add it so my coleslaw (kraut slaw here) and try to have it with any meat dish as a side. The sour flavour works well to stimulate gastric acids too so it a great primer for any fat, protein rich foods.
Since cabbage has so many health giving properties (read here), combining it with beetroot and ginger makes so much sense. The rich, sweetness and earthiness of the beetroot goes so well with the heat of the ginger and the sourness of the kraut. It hits all of the senses on the palate and really satisfy the taste buds.
Of course the rich myriad of antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and blood boosting qualities of the beetroot with the anti-inflammatory, warming and nourishing properties of ginger are made even more available to the body with the fermentation process. The presence of a well balanced symbiosis of bacteria allows the body access to these nutrients, to absorb and use them to help promote wellbeing and healing.
Start in the same way as you would with the basic sauerkraut. When the cabbage and salt have been massaged together, combine the beetroot and ginger (I have used raw and powdered ginger and both work well) before packing it all into your jar.
A rich nutritious flavouring of sauerkraut. Great to assist in the body's wellbeing and healing process. Really good to help digestion of fat or protein rich foods in a meal.
Make sauerkraut by mixing the cabbage with the salt. Massage the cabbage until it starts to wilt and release water.
When the mixture is all in the jar and there is liquid covering the top, press down the outside cabbage leaves to keep any stray bits of cabbage from floating to the surface of the liquid.
I was doing our normal meat free friday (I know its not monday but hey we are different!). I was planning falafel, hummus, baba ganoush and guacamole. Since we are grain free for now while I sort out some issues with me and the kids I decided to do another salad instead of wraps.
Beetroot is very digestive repairing, full of blood boosting nutrients- you can tell by the colour! I want its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects at the moment, it goes so well with carrot- they balance each other out i think, earthy sweetness and crisp sweetness of both. To balance the whole salad I then thought about matching the tang of goats cheese with the texture and spice of the turmeric pumpkin seeds to the honey, mustard kombucha dressing I had planned.
The result was amazing- worked so well as a salad on its own but also brought the flavours of the meal together and added some much needed vibrant colour to our plates too.
Since the summer is pretty much here for us in the tropics we are naturally drawn to lighter and raw foods- salad being top of our list as a side dish- this is now a firm contender for favourite and will be on the table again and again in the future!
A great combination of flavours and textures to make this vibrant salad great on its own or as a side.
You can also add a different cheese I just love the tang of the goats cheese with the sweetness of the vegetables and sour notes of the kombucha.

Kimchi is a traditional Korean ferment. There are hundreds of variations using cabbage, radish, scallion or cucumber as the main ingredient. The paste can contain a variety of ingredients. There may be more than 187 different varieties, all from different regions of Korea. Traditional ingredients will may use garlic, ginger, red pepper, some also add sugar, vinegar, fish sauce or paste to add to their recipe. Families will pass on their different seasonal varieties and they are traditionally buried in the ground to ferment.
Traditionally made by brining the vegetables and then mixing in a paste before packing it into a fermentation vessel to become full of probiotic bacteria and flavour.
Fermented cabbage has a long history of providing benefits for many different health conditions (see my sauerkraut here and a flavoured version here). The fermentation process produces the living probiotic microorganisms that are beneficial to the digestive and immune system, plus making nutrients in the foods being fermented come to life and are more accessible.
Salt is one of the most amazing natural products. Hugely beneficial to the body when consumed in the right way. I am often asked which salt to use- these are my salts of choice:
Sea salt – originates from drying the sea water in the sun, salt lakes or other methods. This is what I prefer and generally prefer those from Wales, France or Scotland. Sea salt nutrients can vary and may contain up to 80 or more minerals than table salt (which is refined down to one or two) it will hugely depend on where the sea salt was obtained. In addition to sodium and chlorine, you are likely to find potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sulfur. Trace minerals in sea salt can include iron, iodine, manganese, zinc, bromine, boron, copper.
Pink Himalayan salt – this salt is traditionally harvested in the Pakistan side of the Himalayan mountain range and the pink colour may be due to the salt containing iron oxide. Harvested from caves of ocean salt settled into geological pockets. It is an unrefined, unprocessed raw mineral, mainly mined by hand. The salt can be up to 250 million years old, which is pretty cool! Its nutrient content is similar to sea salt (since they both originated from the sea).
I use these two salts in fermenting, in cooking, in the bath, as a scrub, as salt lamps and also on the carpets to help deep clean them.
This is a basic Kimchi recipe. There are around 187 different variations of Kimchi, this one uses Chinese cabbage, daikon radish and carrot. I have made this one sugar free and suitable for vegans and vegetarians as it is also seafood free.
Try and retain one of the out side leaves for later. Add the thinly sliced cabbage to a non reactive bowl (plastic or ceramic)..
Weigh and add the salt to the vegetable in water. Mix into the cabbage with your hands to massage and work in the salt. Leave for 1-8 hours.
Add to your fido jar pushing the vegetables down with a wooden spoon, potato masher or fingers. You will notice the brine being created and rising up to the top of the cabbage.
When all the vegetables are in the jar then you place the retained cabbage leaf on the top- this will ensure all the stray bits remain under the brine. You may weigh down the cabbage with either ceramic baking beads, marbles, rocks or a shot glass. This step is not compulsory but does help the first few days of fermenting as it makes it easy to continue to push the kraut down to keep the cabbage in the brine.
Leave for 1-2 weeks on the counter and taste, depending on the temperature and humidity levels of your fermenting spot- leave for up to 28 days. Ferment to taste so continue to taste and then refrigerate when you like it!
Kimchi is added to most foods, soups, noodles, stews, pancakes and so on. It is really nice mixed in to sauces like BBQ, mayo and ketchup. Kimchi is also delicious with cheese and also eggs…
Some people fear mosquitoes. More than just not liking them. Actually fear them. It is called insectophobia. Also, entomophobia. Defined as an unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect.
Never knew some feared simple mosquito bites merely because of the itching. Yellow fever I could understand.
I became interested in the topic the past few days. Some TV programs showed pictures of Trump during the campaign and since elected swapping mosquitoes who were flying around him. He generally referred to them as no good. Said, “Kill them all!”
Spent yesterday afternoon fine tuning last night’s podcast. Tuesday Talk with Key West Lou. I had the program organized. My intent was to begin with some non-Trump items. Then move on to Trump re immigrant children and tariffs.
The U.S. Supreme Court screwed me up. They decided Trump v. Hawaii yesterday. Had to work the decision into the show.
I do not agree with the decision. The Supreme Court has become as politicized as Congress and the Nation. Our government is not working at any level.
I have read portions of the decision and listened to various TV persons analyze it. Associate Justice Sotomayer had it right in her dissent. Chief Justice Roberts majority decision read like Comey explaining his decision re Hillary Clinton and her computer usage.
Another case was decided yesterday. One of importance re immigrant children. The case was decided in a California federal court by Judge Dana M. Sabraw.
Judge Sabraw ruled that authorities cannot split families who illegally cross the border. Those already separated must be reunited within 30 days. Two weeks for children under 5. All children must be allowed to speak with parents within 10 days.
The Judge hit certain things right on. He wrote property is accounted for with more efficiency and accuracy than immigrant children. Also, adults may not be deported from the U.S. without their children.
I had time to sneak out for a bite to eat before the show. Hurried to Roostica. Arrived in time for Happy Hour. Did not know they even had a Happy Hour.
A good deal! Eight limoncello wings for $8. The full meal of 10, $12. Two less and save $4. A good deal!
Chatted with the man who sat next to me. From England, he has worked at Byrd’s 15 years. Byrd’s is where Cheryl and Roger used to park their RV on Stock Island.
He knew Cheryl and Roger well. Agreed they were the best of people. Said Roger had stopped by in the morning to say hello.
The U.S. Supreme Court decided last week that internet sales could be taxed. I believe the issue not yet resolved. It will be litigated ad infinitum till it reaches the Supreme Court again.
Trump administration officials and supporters are being harangued. People feel they are being abused. They have begun pushing back. Last week saw Secretary Kristjen Nielsen and Sandra Huckabee Sanders confronted. Both in restaurants.
Yesterday at Georgetown University, Georgetown students approached Majority Leader McConnell and his wife Transportation Secretary Chao as they were leaving dinner at the University. The students played the recording of the now famous immigrant children voices, cries of woe, etc. They also shared their thoughts. Directed at McConnell.
His wife came to his defense: “Why don’t you leave my husband alone?” Followed by, “Leave my husband alone.”
This is but the beginning. Confrontations will continue. Again, people are upset. Even some conservatives. Government is not being run as it should. I worry about the demonstrations nationwide which are to take place this saturday. Emotions are running high with the children situation. The fuse is lit. I hope nothing of a serious consequence occurs.
Suicides on the rise. This we have heard for several weeks. A recent article indicated that farmers are the occupation group with the highest suicide rate. Five times more than the broader population.
Blame is attributed to economics. Farmers are living on the same income as they earned 15 years ago.
Causes will include retaliatory tariffs from China, the EU set to further undermine U.S. crop prices, and the Federal Reserve expected to soon raise interest rates making loans upon which farmers depend increasingly expensive.

Montessori classrooms are bright, warm, and inviting. They are filled with plants, art, music, books, and interest centers filled with intriguing learning materials, fascinating mathematical models, maps, charts, fossils, historical artifacts, computers, scientific apparatus, perhaps a small natural science museum, and oftentimes animals.
You will not find rows of desks at Free Horizon Montessori. Our learning environments are set up to facilitate student discussion and stimulate collaborative learning. One glance and it is clear that our children feel comfortable. We feel it is important for students to feel safe to take risks. Our classroom environments are the 1st step in providing that secure atmosphere.
Students are typically found working throughout the classroom, working alone or with one or two others. They tend to become so involved in their work that we cannot help but be impressed by the peaceful atmosphere. It might take a moment to spot the teachers within the classrooms. They are found working with one or two children at a time, advising, presenting new lessons, or quietly observing the class at work.
In her research, Dr. Montessori noted specific characteristics associated with the child’s interests and abilities at each plane of development. Montessori’s focus on the whole child led her develop to a very different sort of school from the traditional adult-centered classroom. To emphasize this difference, she named her first school the “Casa dei Bambini or “The Children’s House.” There is something profound in her choice of words, for the Montessori classroom is not the domain of the adults in charge, but rather a carefully prepared environment designed to facilitate the development of the children’s curiosity, independence, and sense of personal empowerment and responsibility.
True freedom cannot exist without discipline. There is a foundational structure in place that ensures that each child’s level of choice and independence is in direct proportion to their demonstrated ability to act with respect and responsibility toward themselves, the environment, and others. Independent work plans empower students to make choices as well as accept the responsibility and due diligence of study.
Classrooms at Free Horizon are organized into several curriculum areas, which include language arts (reading, literature, grammar, creative writing, spelling, and handwriting), mathematics and geometry, geography, history, science, sensory awareness exercises and puzzles, everyday living skills, and art, music, and movement. Each area is made up of one or more shelves with a wide variety of materials on open display and ready for use as the children select them.
Our curriculum is organized into a spiral of integrated studies, rather than a traditional model that is compartmentalized into separate subjects. In the early years, lessons are introduced simply and concretely, and then reintroduced several times during succeeding years at increasing degrees of abstraction and complexity. The course of study uses an integrated thematic approach that ties the separate disciplines of the curriculum together into studies of the physical universe, the world of nature, and the human experience.
Montessori classes are organized to encompass a two- to three-year age span, which allows younger students to experience the daily stimulation of older role models, who in turn blossom in the responsibility of leadership. Students not only learn “with” each other, but also “from” each other. Oftentimes the best tutor is a fellow student who is just a bit older.
Some parents worry that having younger children in the same class as older ones will leave one group or the other short-changed. They fear that the younger children will absorb the teacher’s time and attention, or that the importance of covering the advanced curriculum for older students prevents teachers from giving the younger ones the emotional support and stimulation they need. Both concerns are misguided.
Working in one class for two to three years allows students to develop a strong sense of community with their classmates and teachers. The age range also allows especially gifted children the stimulation of intellectual peers, without requiring that they skip a grade and feel emotionally out of place. Each class is an essentially stable community, with only the oldest third moving on to the next level each year. At each level within a Montessori school, the curriculum and methods are logical and consistent extensions of what has come before.
Montessori teachers play a very different role from those played by traditionally trained educators. While the stern disciplinarians of the past may be an endangered species, many teachers are focused on maintaining order and on covering a pre-defined curriculum. Most see their role as dispensing facts and sills to complacent students.
The Montessori teacher’s role is that of a facilitator and guide. The Montessori teacher has four primary goals: to awaken our children’s spirit and imagination, to encourage their normal desire for independence and high sense of self-esteem, to help them develop the kindness and self-discipline that will allow them to become full members of society, and to help them learn how to observe, question, risk mistakes, and explore ideas independently. The Montessori teacher is a coach, a mentor.
While there are times for whole-class discussions and presentations, most lessons are presented individually and in small groups consisting of children at similar levels of demonstrated mastery. Teachers closely monitor students’ progress, keeping the level of challenge high. Because they come to know their students so well, Montessori teachers can use students’ own interests to enrich the curriculum and provide alternate avenues for accomplishment and success.
In a world of rapid change and new discoveries, we can only guess at the skills our children will need to succeed in our 21st century. Now, more than ever, the essential lesson is learning how to learn.
The most important years in our children’s education are not high school and college, but rather their first twelve years of life. This is when their character and values, self-image, foundational skills and knowledge, and appreciation for diversity, culture, and the arts are formed.
Free Horizon Montessori offers children a world-class education, along with opportunities to develop emotional intelligence that nurtures self-confidence, personal creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. We offer them the most challenging academic program that they can handle in a course of study with a depth and breadth not typically found in a traditional neighborhood school. Children truly love learning and have no concept of a limited potential. We aim to keep it that way.
Much of the above information is excerpted from “Basic Elements of the Montessori Approach” by Tim Seldin of The Montessori Foundation.
Can young children’s developmental difficulties be addressed early on, sensitively and in their everyday environments, with the support of their parents and educators?
The Neuro-Developmental-Functional Approach answers this question affirmatively, and has been developed by the Centre for Advancement of Functioning Capacities.
In the folder are some evaluations of the Centre’s Programme for young children, all of which are very favourable.
Rami Katz, director of the Centre and who will present the approach this afternoon, has been Chair of the Developmental Psychology section of the Israel Psychological Association and member of the Educational Planning Committee for disadvantaged children established by the Education Ministry.
Josie Mendelson’s qualifications are in early childhood education, special education and group coordination. At present she is co-director of Hand-in-Hand, the Centre for Jewish Arab Education in Israel.
In her earlier capacity as Director of Early Childhood Education for the City of Jerusalem, she introduced BvLF to the Neuro -Developmental-Functional Approach.

In this new cinematic trailer for Star Wars: The Old Republic, we're supposed to feel sorry for Alderaan, as it's enslaved by the Sith Empire. I don't know. They're only occupying it. It's not like they blew it up.
I'm still not sure if this game can stand against the might of World of Warcraft, even with the Star Wars license, but I'm glad more publishers are learning the value of a good trailer for their MMO, even if it does mean squat in terms of how you'll actually play the game.

Allow me to preface my own megillah: this series is one that focuses on the best effort to tell a story. If a film adaptation is awful, I'm going to tell you. If the book is awful, I'm going to tell you. Perhaps both--reach into recent history and I'm sure you can recall both terrible novels and their ungodly film versions. Think: vampire. If the source material and the film are wildly different, I'm definitely going to tell you. But the story itself is my concern. Sound good? Let’s do this.Beyond here be spoilers.
I’m going to be straight with you, readers: I collect phrases. A Southern friend of mine once asked why I was always hollerin’ the steady out of my own feet, and in a slight of self-service I completely ignored whatever that meant to get that ridiculous thing, quick, into a moleskine before it was lost in the ether of ADD and flight. Be your own tea and be stimulated, and that. I tell you this because, when it comes to Winter’s Bone, if hill people talk and twang annoy you and you’d just like to read some, y’know, George Eliot and be at one with the dryness, by all means. Be that. Do you. My heart is still in the right sink when I tell you, go watch Debra Granik’s excellent adaptation of Daniel Woodrell’s novel, and marvel. Bear witness. Twang is easier on the ears than eyes and it will be good for you. However, I will also insist that a line like “you one time smacked fire out the ass of a Boshell boy” is a neat little linguistic thrill regardless of colloquial bias and Woodrell wrote one hell of a novel. It was divined from the well. Jussayin’. I will fairly offer now that if a Kentucky relative of mine said something like “I seen the law over here this after” I would cringe and cross myself, but that same line from Woodrell is charming. Truth is never as melodic as fiction.
Since you’re wanting to know which of these tells the better story, I’m going to assume you know the basic players, but, since this is our first pass, a quick summary: Ree Dolly’s father (Jessup) has skipped bail on charges that he ran a crystal meth lab, and the Dolly family will lose their home in the Ozarks if he doesn’t show for court. Ree lives with, and supports, her two young siblings and their catatonic mother. The search to find Jessup, dead or alive, starts. Teardrop is her meth addicted uncle.
Okay: this is really the best case scenario for book to film adaptations, and therefore an easy start to this series. So much of the film is word for perfect word from the book. Two of my favorite scenes from this story I was pleased--but, y'know, horrified--to find were the same in both. The first is when Teardrop and Ree are pulled over by the Deputy, and Teardrop drawls that Crews meets the Cohens line, "Is this gonna be our time?" There is a slight advantage on the film's behalf on account of John Hawkes's fine actressin', but even on this technicality it's just plain, goodass writing.
And the second, well. Look. Listen, a girl chainsawing a twain 'tween the lakerotted hands and corpse of her murdered father is gory going no matter what medium makes your aware. I say both bring it on and please, no, I get it. It's already gross enough. And the unbelievable chastising, "you'll need both hands or sure as shit they'll say he cut one off to keep from going to prison! They know that trick." It's momentarily worse to wonder how many Dolly's were Titus'ed and less a hand before the law grew wise. Needless to say: draw. I've seen enough book-to-film adaptations to know that a certain gratefulness should be had, quietly, when a pivotal and terrible moment in the book is not changed to suffer ratings systems or, god help us all, "artistic vision." Debra Granik, you are wonderful and a damn fine steward.
As someone who reads and writes reviews, let me stop just to say: I smell what you're cooking. I know this might appear rather handsy grabass and glass-eyed of me, all this outright respectfulness and wonderful, wonderful, but honestly: sometimes, it's just wonderful. But, for the blackhearted of us, I will pick a few bones about the absence of some rather important details and events from the film, though I'm going to disclaimer before we work--time is a constraint in film. It takes a deft director to negotiate the line between what is necessary, what can be supplemental upon a read, and what is of offense to the story if cut.
There is strangely no snow in the film, though it's oppressively Gassian in the book. Brunette book Ree is now blonde Ree of the pretty, impossibly ombre'd hair. Film Ree doesn't wear her ubiquitous headphones of cope while working. Book Ree spends much of the book in old, hand me down dresses; film Ree, in jeans. There's mercifully less 'ado about phlegm in the film. Woodrell certainly makes snot social and the hocking of spit and crud from deep in the sinuses is frequent. I know this isn't just over-characterization on his part, y’know, just a chance to describe the generality of the looger; these people exist and walk about freely. These people are the worst. Stop sitting behind me in movie theaters, mucous filters! Everytime. It's ridiculous.
You realize that these are trivial things; good. We are on the same page. When our focus is the story these details are superfluous. And so, bones: those differences that I do believe to be of note--those small devils in the details, say--are what I think separate the two. The film is Ozark hillbilly noir; the book is a character study. If you plan to read the book--and get thee to a bookery, nudnik--save the next paragraph until you have! Decide now. I’ll wait.
Alright: I am going to confess publicly that at one point I put this book down, closed, to just reassess what the hell I’d read. Ree is, at unspecified age but younger than her present sixteen years, fed hallucinogenic mushrooms and raped in the middle of the woods by a friend of her father’s. The way she describes it is horrific, nightmarish and psychotropic, just completely drugged out of her mind, tasting gold and feeling China and brightness, pretty words and, wait. Wait, this grown man just what? Lord Jesus. You stop expecting more out of these people at this point in the story, but Ree herself starts to make a whole lot more sense. (Just to note: there is a brief scene in the beginning of the film where this freak rapist, Little Arthur, has screen time. He’s the first guy she goes asking after for Jessup--the guy in the trailer. The same scene is in the book.)
Ree is also intimate with, and sick with love for, her best friend Gail. She seems mostly disgusted with men and, really, who could begrudge the girl. She doesn’t define a sexuality and I’m fairly certain that wouldn’t ever happen, either, but I feel like there’s enough there to work some safe sum. Time is, again, a constraint in film, and this burgeoning sexual exploration would have been distracting there. This is on one side of the line between crime drama and character study.
While the book is about Ree, it’s also a lot about the women in this area and what happens to them and their families when the men work meth, get arrested, and go to jail. Avoid the law and disappear. When they’re murdered. Every woman in the book is a compromised character, and so then are the children.
Here then we have a big divergence. In the film, Ree has a younger brother and sister. I understand this had to do with verite type choices and it works, in the film. In the book, though, Ree has two little brothers, and there is some Faulkner type meshuga afoot with their parentage. The boys serve as an interesting commentary on the fate of the men here: since the Dolly’s are so many in number and so ceaselessly criminal in behavior, many of them share “family names” so as to mislead the law. Ree’s father is a Jessup, and so is Teardrop; there are Haslam’s, Arthur’s, and Milton’s. Ree expresses regret that she and her mother didn’t put up as much of a fuss for Sonny--a Jessup--as they did for the youngest, Harold (who was to be a Milton), that the both of them might avoid a preordained life of boiling meanness and crime.
The last thing to discuss is the ending. The ending differs by slight but is tonally consistent. When I saw the film the first time, prior to the read, I found it bleak. Again, consistent--but after reading the novel, I passed quick judge that the film was unable to capture the book's optimism, its hopeful ambiguousness, juxtaposed with the unbearable dread of Teardrop's inevitable future. This is not the case: the film is just much, much more quiet and austere. Stoic, like its people. Two things of interest in their omission: in the book, the bondsman who brings the cash remainder to Ree--you earned it with blood, kid--offers her a job working for him; and the final line that has Ree vowing to spend the first of the money on "wheels." The film's ending, with its chickens to raise and their father's banjo to honor, is certainly a more modest promise for the future than one with real prospects for escape. It must be said: Teardrop holding a dead man's banjo is a bonechill in the foreshadow. In the book he and Ree embrace tightly before he leaves, both silently acknowledging the deathwish burning his blood. Just as her father did before he squirreled off into the dark Ozarks, Teardrop warns Ree not to ever look for him once he's gone. These are a people who want to appear to their kin to go gentle into the Thomas'd night while raging straight for it. Sentimentality is to be rationed and served slim. The hug makes sense in the book, even if it is still a surprising thing; it just wouldn't make sense for Granik's Teardrop and Ree at all. And better yet, I think the look the two exchange before he hands the banjo back and sets to leave says everyting, and just as well. While I prefer the book's ending, I concede that it would seem simply saccharine, all this straightforward next-chapter life stuff, if it were tacked on the end, like to shine a bleak film's posterior. A jaunty "that was easy" and the slap of a button. The differences do have meaning, and I prefer the book; still, each ending is perfectly suited to its respective piece.
So how was your day? Seriously, that’s what it boils down to. This is rue hickishness and trouble of high order. It’s going to burn no matter what way it goes down, and this story is worth the cough after. Do you want to tuck into a beautifully written study of character or would you rather watch a finely crafted Ozarkian noir? If southern slang gives you the creeps, you want the noir. But really, friend, you want both; let now be your time.
Oh man, more people should have seen this movie. But I can understand why it didn’t exactly storm the box office. The story follows the trials and tribulations of Ree Dolly, a seventeen year old girl who has to care for her borderline-catatonic mother and her two young siblings (a twelve year old brother, Sonny, and a six year old sister, Ashlee), after their career-criminal father, Jessup, skips bail. Ree isn’t too upset that Jessup’s gone — or she wouldn’t be, if he hadn’t put their house up as part of the bail money, which means that if she can’t find him in a few days, she and her young wards will be out on the street. And so Ree embarks on a journey through the meth-addled, poverty stricken landscape of the Missouri Ozarks. When she eventually finds her father (dead, and rotting in a bog), she has to cut off his hands with a chainsaw so that she can prove his death to the bail bondsman.
But descriptions of Winter’s Bone tend to make it seem more “worthy” (taste the sneer in my scare-quotes), than it is. There’s no learning, no hugging, here, and to say that the movie is “about” the toll methamphetamine is taking on poor communities in middle America — which it totally is — conjures up a wholly inappropriate image of a “message” picture along the lines of Tracy Jordan’s Hard to Watch. The horrors of meth abuse here are kept in the background, and it’s by far the stronger for it, both as a film and as a treatment of meth abuse.
Critics who didn’t get lost in the social-issue aspect of the movie have talked about it as a neo-noir, a description which strikes much closer to the heart. There are inscrutable criminal syndicates at work, icebergs of which we see the barest tips. There’s a detective, searching for an answer she would rather not find, but persevering out of a sense of duty. Every character — every frame of the film — swims through a haze of futility and moral rot. The potential for violence floats in the air like cigarette smoke (although no one here is smoking, or at least not tobacco), and cathartically explodes into actual violence in a few carefully chosen scenes. But then on the other hand, there are some ways in which Winter’s Bone is as removed from noir as it’s possible to get.
Ree is a standard issue noir detective in that she goes up against insurmountable forces armed only with savviness, courage, stubbornness, and a willingness to get the tar beaten out of her. This much comes with the territory. But her motivation is completely different. I read somewhere – don’t know where, and I wish I did – that the quintessential noir hero is a man for whom a twisted version of the protestant work ethic has supplanted all other codes. He doesn’t do his job because it’s the right thing: often he knows it isn’t. He doesn’t do it for the money: often the money is inadequate, or he has reason to believe that it won’t materialize. He does it because he said that he would, and a man keeps his promises. This is not about honor in the classic sense. He doesn’t think of himself as a good man, and he certainly doesn’t hold out for some kind of future reward, heavenly or otherwise. There is no motivation beyond keeping the promise, doing the job, finishing what was started. The noir hero clings to the code because the alternative is flailing around in an abyss of moral relativism. Man’s willingness to follow the code, even knowing that the code is a shell, is what makes him heroic.
Ree’s actions are those of a noir hero. But her motivations are nothing like this. Everything that she does is in care of her family. She isn’t looking for closure, or justice, or any of that nonsense. She wants food on the table and a roof over their heads. In fiction, at least, these are traditional “girl values.” In life, plenty of men take care of their kids, but it’s not something that features in a lot of hard boiled detective stories. So this brings up the other thing that people talk to with regard to Winter’s Bone: feminism. (As if it wasn’t box office poison already.)
Ree Dolly is marked by the absence of men in her life, and I don’t mean the Cathy Guisewite “Aack! I need a man!” kind of absence. There’s no love interest that defines her character — and while she does seem to love her father, she’s not overly concerned by his absence. Tracking him down is a strictly financial proposition. It would be patently absurd to label her “the absentee meth-cooker’s daughter.” But the other women she runs across in her travels could pretty easily be summed up as “the asshole heavy metal fan’s wife,” “the psychopath’s girlfriend,” “the drug dealer’s daughter,” and “the woman who stands in some non-specified but obviously significant relationship to the crime kingpin.” Gail, the asshole heavy metal fan’s wife, is an interesting case. Ree comes to Gail to borrow a car, so that she won’t have to walk all the way down to where the real assholes live. At first, Gail says she can’t help: the truck is her husband’s, and he won’t lend it out. “Why not?” asks Ree, indignantly. “He doesn’t tell me why not, he just tells me no,” Gail replies. “It’s different when you’re married.”
A few scenes later, Gail shows up on Ree’s doorstep, truck keys apologetically in hand. “You truly are the person I always thought you were,” says Ree.
I’m just giving my best recollection of the dialogue here (and throughout), because I returned the film to Netflix before I realized that I wanted to write about it, and it’s still too recent and little-seen a film for every significant scene to have been uploaded to youtube. But it’s pretty close. What’s interesting about this scene, other than the subtly wonderful and wonderfully subtle depiction of a friendship, and the delicious cadence of Ree’s dialogue (which I’m sure I’ve not quite captured), is the structure it sets up, in which a man gets in Ree’s way and a woman helps her get around him. This is the basis for literally every encounter Ree has in the first three quarters of the movie. It’s so schematic that after a while it begins to feel like a fairy tale about the female solidarity. Even Ree’s two younger siblings play into this, although in a slightly different way. Both kids do violent things in the film. The boy tries to protect Ree from a low-level drug runner. This turns out to be a thoroughly meaningless gesture: it’s senseless shouting for shouting’s sake, and if anything only escalates the situation. The sister’s violence involves gunning down a squirrel that the family stews up for dinner. More precisely she helps Ree shoot the squirrel – she spots it, then Ree aims and asks if Ashlee would like to pull the trigger. So the kind of violence that’s done here is productive, and it’s built into a structure of helping, teaching, etc, qualities which again are traditionally marked as feminine. Much more than the cavalcade of male obstacles, it’s this kind of thing that makes the movie exciting as a feminist text. And if nothing else, Winter’s Bone would have to be seen as strongly feminist simply by virtue of having such an interesting, complex, active (both in the sense of “gets shit done” and in the sense of “drives the narrative action”), female main character surrounded by such vividly sketched female supporting characters. There’s more to movies than ideology, of course, and more to ideology than gender alone. Nevertheless, it’s refreshing to see a movie where the treatment of gender roles completely escapes the standard model.
The turd in the buttermilk is Ree’s uncle Teardrop. Which is kind of funny, because you get the feeling that that’s Teardrop’s designated role within the world of the film, too. In his first appearance, he just seems like another asshole. When Ree asks for his help, he tells her to pound leather. When his girlfriend asks again on Ree’s behalf he tells her, chillingly, “I’ve already said no once with my mouth.” When Ree asks a third time, he lunges across the room and grabs her by the neck and face, staring her down with violence in his eyes until she agrees not to ask him again. Later on he casually does a bump of meth and offers some to Ree like it was a stick of gum (with another chilling line: “You developed the taste for it yet?”). But towards the end of the film he gets humanized. When Ree’s been taken captive by the meth-father in chief, Thump, and gets brutally stomped by some of Thump’s female associates, it’s Teardrop who shows up like a knight in armor to rescue her. (This, by the way, would be the point three-quarters of the way through the movie where the male-gate/female-key structure stops happening.) He confides in her, explaining his earlier behavior: the reason he doesn’t want to help Ree find out about Jessup is that if he ever learned what happened to his brother, he’d have to do something about it. And he’s smart enough to realize that this would eventually lead to his own death (“going toes up myself” as he indelibly puts it).
There’s an interesting parallel in this to Ree’s own situation. She dreams of running away to join the military — not because she’s particularly into that, and I think perhaps not even for the money (although that’s the reason she gives when asked), but because it’s a way out, the only way out available to her. And then it turns out it’s not even available, because she couldn’t take her family with her during basic training and combat operations. If she was free to join the military, though… what kind of escape would that be? She could “go toes up” that way too: people get shot in the army, I hear tell. And Ree seems to realize this, on some level. “I would be lost without the weight of you two on my back,” she tells the kids near the end of the film. “I ain’t going anywhere.” And she seems to know exactly what that means, on all possible levels. The line and the delivery are more heartwarming and soul-blighting than I thought was simultaneously possible.
Teardrop ends the movie on a very different note. Right at the end, when everything seems to have ended happily (or as happily as a film that features chainsaw-dismemberment can end), he figures out who killed Jessup. We never learn how, we never learn who. “I know,” he tells Ree. That’s all. She obliquely tries to convince him not to do it, offering him her fathers old banjo. Teardrop sits down next to the kids and plays a couple of haunting, uncertain bars, then hands it back, saying “I never had the gift for it, like your old man did.” And then he drives off, presumably to his death, while Ashlee tunelessly strums the banjo on its open strings. This is exactly the kind of thing that noir heroes do. And the film, and the viewer, and Ree(!), all seem magnetically drawn to Teardrop’s particular “man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do” breed of violence, even though it’s established early on that he’s a wife beater, a meth addict, and a sociopath that even the other sociopaths are afraid of. This kind of ambivalent attraction/repulsion is all over the older noir traditions… but it attaches to the female characters, not the male ones. Teardrop Dolly is an homme fatal.
Does this fascination make the film regressive and patriarchal? Not as such. I think it makes it… well, “accurate” might be the right word. I’m NOT saying that emotionally closed-off, violent men really do have some kind of special wonder-asshole power rings that let them solve problems beyond the capabilities of womenfolk, and that they should therefore get some kind of get-off-the-hook-for-being-an-asshole-free card. All I am saying that patriarchy really is seductive. The patriarchal role model presented by Teardrop is an attractive one, in narrative terms, even for filmmakers who are trying to struggle against it.
And if they sometimes lose that struggle… well, like I said, there’s more to a film than its political content. In this case, I think the threads of reinscribed patriarchy surrounding Teardrop’s character end up making the film stronger as art. Winter’s Bone is so aggressively focused on nastiness that it would actually hurt the piece, artistically, if its political content wasn’t slightly nasty too. Imagine an ending where Ree does convince Teardrop to give up his noirish cycle-of-violence ways, where he just sits down on the porch and plays the banjo for them, and maybe sticks around for a plate of squirrel stew and helps with the dishes after. From a feminist perspective, this would be the happy-happy ending. It’s the ending we should want: if the Rees of the world can’t reach the Teardrops of the world, can’t eventually change them in some way, then it’s a faint and sorry hope that feminism offers us. But artistically this ending would never fly. When I imagine it, it sticks in my craw. Too much sickly-sweet, too much learning, too much hugging. Or imagine an ending where Teardrop’s vendetta is not presented as tragic, but as merely stupid and pointless: just another damn male obstacle getting in the way of Ree’s domestic happiness. That wouldn’t work either. It’d be too pat, too comfortable. Smug, even. The ending of Winter’s Bone is troubling, if you’re the type to analyze movies from this perspective. I think I started writing this post mostly because I was troubled by it. But it also feels like the only possible way they could have ended the piece. And that’s really the reason why more people should see the film. Not for the meth, not for the noir, not for the feminism. But because everything about it feels like the only possible choice they could have made.

Leaders say bankrupt Fayette County hospital needed, but don't know how they can help - Indiana Economic Digest - Indiana
Community leaders agree a hospital is an important community asset. While they would like to help make sure the hospital remains but agree there is not much they can do.
Fayette Regional Health System filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Oct. 10. The day before, the medical group that previously supplied emergency room physicians sued the hospital for non-payment. The hospital has closed the ambulance service, home care service and the obstetrics department closed Friday.
The community needs the hospital and the community needs to know it will remain open, the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce board of directors stated in a written statement. Chapter 11 can be frightening if not understood, but in the business world, under approval of the bankruptcy court, it is used to restructure finances, balance its income and expenses, regain profitability and continue operations.
“The board of directors of the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce is pleased to hear that FRHS is being transparent in this time of restructuring,” the statement continued. “As one of the only stand-alone rural hospitals in our region that receives limited federal dollars, FRHS is using this tool to reorganize so that patient care disruption is minimal and they can continue providing services.
“This (reorganization) will probably be a slow process, however we are confident in the continuation of quality service FRHS provides to our community.”
“The hospital is very important to the community, and as the city, we’re going to do everything we can to help them stay up and running, because a good city has a good hospital,” said Mayor Harold Gordon. “It is vital to economic development to the city because people don’t have to travel as far, so it is good.”
He is uncertain what the city can do at this time, but will do what it can whether that is nothing more than providing support letters.
Gary Naylor of the Fayette County Board of Commissioners is not sure the county can provide any material help.
“I’ve been very concerned about it and have tried to seek advice from friends and others to know what directions we need to move in, just in case,” he said. “I haven’t really gotten any answers.”
For the county commissioners, the question is whether they become involved in some fashion or just stay out of the way and let the process move forward, he said. Even if the county wanted to do something, he is not sure what can be done.
There has been talk over the years of a larger hospital taking over the local facility in some fashion, but the concern now is that anyone once interested may back off and see what happens, he said.
“I think a few years ago, something was mentioned about us becoming co-owners in the hospital and I think there was no desire on our part to want to take that responsibility on,” he said. “We’re struggling to keep the ship afloat of what we have now.”
A hospital is an assumed staple of a community, especially the emergency room and critical care, said Anna Dungan, Fayette County Foundation executive director and the former director of the hospital’s foundation.
“I was fortunate our twins were born there and I have such good memories of that,” she said. “There has always seemed to be a disconnect between those administering the hospital and those working with patients. I don’t know of a time where there was harmony.”
The hospital has entered several areas of service but for a county with 20,000 people, it may have tried too much, she suggested. It is wonderful to offer the services but FRHS should not be considered a regional hospital, she said.
“You can’t compete with Reid (Richmond),” Dungan said. “They’re a powerhouse. They have a legacy of strong leadership and deep pockets.”
She questioned the wisdom in building a medical center in Brookville about 10 years ago when those residents typically have gone to Oxford, Ohio, or Batesville for a hospital, she said. They will not just come because you build it.
“I’ve had a lot of people from other community foundations say ‘Is there anything you guys can do or is the state going to try to help?’” Dungan said. “They understand how vital hospitals are.”
“I don’t think the hospital board members should be making salary like they do,” Dungan said. “It’s a not-for-profit board.”
It is good that they are trying to reorganize but, during the process, there are many people counting on paychecks from the hospital, she said.
As the community tries to move forward with attracting new business, it seems to take one step forward and then something comes along and it takes two or three steps backward, Naylor said. The idea of the hospital in bankruptcy likely puts a damper on economic development efforts.

Are you looking for an experienced and highly recommended car accident and injury attorney in Murray or Southwestern Kentucky? The Roberts Law Office has more than 25 years of experience as a personal injury lawyer representing people who have been injured in a car crash. If you have been involved in a car accident we strongly recommend you see a doctor for a thorough check-up within 24 to 48 hours of the accident, even if you think you are uninjured. Many injuries can actually take several weeks before your body experiences the pain and impact of what has happened. Insurance companies can refuse to pay an injury claim if you do not see a doctor after the accident. It’s better to be safe than sorry.
The next step is to contact the Roberts Law Office to learn more about how an injury claim is handled and why it is so important to have an experienced lawyer. The insurance company which is liable for compensating you for your injuries is focused on one thing: keeping the most profit possible for themselves by attempting to get you to settle your case for far less than you deserve. You only have one chance to settle your case or put it before a jury. You can’t go back several months or years down the road when new expenses arise. The Roberts Law Office works to ensure you recover full compensation under the law for the injuries you’ve been forced to suffer, and all of your resulting expenses now and in the future.
Our Kentucky courts look to a number of factors in determining whether a driver was negligent. Some examples include, but are not limited to:
The most common location of car accidents resulting in injury in Kentucky happen in an intersection. The resulting side impact or “t-bone” crashes do not provide occupants of a vehicle with the same amount of protection as they actually would have in a head-on or rear end impact.
Side impacts unleash severe forces on the neck and spine as the body violently shifts during the impact of a car accident. The resulting damage to the discs which are designed to protect your vertebrae may not actually create any symptoms for several weeks. We have had many clients over the years who basically thought they weren’t injured after the initial accident, but were bedridden within a few weeks due to damage to the discs in their back or other soft tissue injuries.
Car accidents on the roads of Southwestern Kentucky may result in serious injuries. Many injuries may result in the permanent loss of a range of motion in the legs, arms or fingers. Traumatic Brain Injury or TBI can actually change the personality of the victim while impacting their ability to process information in the ways they used to. This can make it difficult to handle interruptions, complex tasks or even a trip to the grocery store.
When you are involved in a car accident and injury you may be entitled to reimbursement of your lost wages and medical bills. If the accident was someone else’s fault, you may also be entitled to additional financial damages, including pain and suffering and an impaired capacity to earn. If the accident was someone else’s fault, you should be entitled to have your vehicle repaired or replaced. Even if the at-fault party does not have insurance, you may be able to pursue a claim against your own insurance company for your damages.
Insurance companies have trained adjustors and experienced lawyers helping them to defend claims. Insurance companies generally begin preparing the defense of their claims within hours after the wreck occurs. Therefore, it is vitally important for you to act quickly after being involved in a collision. Your actions can impact your rights and the recovery that you are able to obtain. Therefore, you need an attorney who is familiar with these claims and is also familiar with how insurance companies work to help you navigate through the process successfully.
Jeff Roberts has handled car accident and injury claims in Kentucky since 1992. Jeff has the experience to handle your claim properly and to advise you through every step of the process to make sure you get the best outcome possible.

Day care center plays a pivotal role as providers of child welfare services, with emphasis on the national responsibility for child care and low fertility. It is a public institution which provides a child care environment suitable for children and makes children esteem their own rights and the rights of others and them have responsible for their actions and which does children's proper child-care and education. Child care teachers as practical service providers of child care are obliged to report child abuse and at the same time care for the child. Teachers should respond sensitively and promptly to child abuse of those who can not protect themselves. The continuing increase in child abuse has been reinforced by the enforcement of the Child Abuse and Punishment Act, and the rate of found victims and child abuse cases has been increasing due to the mandatory installation of CCTV at day-care centers. The measures to prevent child abuse in child care centers are as follows. First, the child care teacher should look for ways to improve as an expert. Second, it is urgent to take measures against child-care teachers' treatment and welfare. Third, a child rights consultant system should be implemented. Fourth, consultation about child abuse and child abuse prevention should be needed through the establishment of child abuse preventive support center. Fifth, systematic education is required for those who report child abuse. Sixth, it is obligatory to educate parents about child abuse. Seventh, it is necessary to find ways to raise self - esteem of child care teachers.

What's your definition of "better"? What are you wanting out of it? What do you plan on doing? C'mon, friggin details dude.
Like Laser said it depends on what you are looking for. For me its the rev of a rotary motor. Or a Honda for ease and reliability god knows rotary isnt always the most reliable. If your intrested in building your car then do research on it before you buy. That's the best advice I have for you. That's how it was for me with my Rx7. If you want power, read up on it. If I want reliablity, read up on it. There's plenty of Nissan forums I believe there is a local Nissan forum if your in Iowa. At least its been advertised on this forum recently. It all depends kn you man. Everyone has there opinion.
I know the sad thing is I was trying to fix most of it . I don't get mad about that shit. It was always my worst subject. I do try though because its a forum, and who knows how many people read it. If I didn't try I would make myself look like a five year old. English teachers always loved me.
TT is just as slow since it weighs close to 2 tons. They're also a giant PITA to work on for anything beyond basic maintenance.
Well light and fun would be an Ef hatch its like a Go Kart unless its an si or si tranny then it has some pull. Haha
If you think of purchasing the Spec V, you should get it check out before purchasing it because of the butterfly screws problem and the precat failure and the MAF sensor . Also check if the motor isn't burning oil or if white smoke is coming out. There are many advantages and disadvantages between the spec v and z32 such as age, fwd/rwd, 2/4door.
QR25DE were notorious for spinning their bearings around the 2002 time, I'd watch out for that too. Just like what they've said above.
They both can be fast if you do the right things to them. The only thing you're most likely not gonna change is the fact that it's a FWD vs RWD, 2 Door vs 4 door. Assuming you're getting the Turbo z32 insurance will make a huge difference too. If you're keeping the car through out the year, the z32 will either be a fun or a dangerous car for you; depending how good of a winter driver you are. You gotta add lots of different factors when you're buying your first car.
As much as I wanted to say that in the first place, I just couldn't. He would have to know a decent amount of knowledge in order to buy one due to the fact that there are too many stupid owners who cut corners modding them. Though a prime example of what to look for is the DSM in the FS section on here. No cut corners and, if I remember the guy, takes very good care of his cars.
to me a gsx, has to offer all he was wanting and there very affordable for what you get if you know what your lookin for when making the purchase
yea, the one FS is tits. but most people dont know what to look for, especially if it has a bunch of DIY mods done to it. thats why bone stock or properly modded ones run a premium. though he has a great price on it. im guessing the OP is looking for a first car considering he thinks a spec-v or Z32 would give bitches an orgasm
ya that talon was done right from what i see, could make some real good power with just a little tweaking, but 90% of people who get a turbo dsm have it blown up in 3 months..
probably not. although fast can be subjective if you think about it. a good example is driving a go-kart at 20 MPH vs an SUV at the same speed. your sense of speed will differ between them greatly. if i had to choose between the 2 though, id go with the V-spec, simply because they are easier to work on and have a better power:weight ratio in the end. the Z32 is great for style, but its in the same league as a N/T 3000GT, heavy tank and a bitch to work on. if he has a good income and can afford it, he could get style and speed with an LS swapped S5 vert. as i like to say, drop tops make the tops drop.
Anyone noticed he hasn't been active on this thread since those two comments..? Matt Franks the owner of that talon is a good guy knows what he's doing for sure. I agree with the prespective of speed as to what laser said. I'd pick the go kart over the suv though. Personally I stay away fron DSM I have thought about getting one or looking at one but I don't hear good things. There pretty much "Knock knock jokes" 2gs are sweet if done right though. 99eclipse your avatar phone is a nice looking one.
I have been a crazy person in the kitchen lately. Our days have gotten longer, but also busier...there's soccer after school, softball starting soon, and a baby that's eating! I have to be more organized and prepared since there's a lot less free time to get dinner ready. I feel like I am making a dent in our kitchen floors with all the hours I stand in the same spots prepping, cooking, cleaning. But, it's all good. We rarely eat out and nobody seems to miss it.
So, on Friday, I hit up Whole Foods for their one-day sale on mangoes. It was something like 10 mangoes for $5 but I ended up getting 2 cases which was 36 mangoes for about $15. Gulp.
Now, I LOVE mangoes. I first had them when Mark and I were on our honeymoon in St John about 11 years ago. Our favorite restaurant was Morgan's Mango in Cruz Bay where I had an amazing mango margarita. Yep, I've pretty much been a mango lover since then. So, in the spirit of wonderful memories and warm island breezes, I thought I'd share here what I did with the 36 I picked up...also known as how I spent my weekend. : )
Ok, so, first I set aside a few or 7 for salsa and snacking this week. More on that below. The rest of the mangoes got peeled, chopped and diced. I thought I'd share here how I chop mangoes. The ones I got are the yellow type from Mexico and from my experience, are softer/juicier than the typical red mangoes. They are shaped like a kidney bean and kind of have a core like a pineapple.
Some people like to cut the sides off the core, score the fruit, and cut it off of the core. I prefer to peel the mango like an apple first and then cut slices of the fruit off. I begin with my knife on an angle and rotate the fruit around cutting slices off. After getting most of the fruit off, I hold the core up and shave off those last bits. Like so.
So, from those 25 or so mangoes that I chopped I ended up with about 18 cups of fruit. And very sore feet. : )
I froze them in batches in these nifty silicone ice cube trays that I bought for freezing baby food. Which, by the way, also deserves its own blog post...but as this is feeling very long winded, I'm thinking maybe food blogging is not for me. Anywho. Where was I? Oh yes, the frozen cubes of mango - those will be for smoothies, and recreating magical margaritas. They will be loved.
I also made 10 cups of mango banana sauce for my girl. Yes, ten cups...or about 25ish servings. Needless to say, she better LOVE it. I'm thinking it will also be a yummy addition to yogurt for the kids or smoothies or popsicles. Lots of options for all those mangoes.
We did a lot of salsa eating this weekend. It seemed fitting as it was the first Spring-like weekend here in NC. I like this recipe. If I want something more sauce-y, I follow the recipe, omit the cucumber, and add some apricot or pineapple jam. Either option is delicious on grilled shrimp, fish or chicken - and a summertime favorite here.
Welp, that's about it for the mangoes. Now I can resume my normal life again. Off to sweep up the little baby I hear babbling in her bed and brave another week. Happy Monday!

Notes: This was week 1 of my second 4-week period on 5/3/1. I'm finding myself adding more accessory work if I still feel fresh enough after my planned workout, which is probably a good thing. I don't feel burnt out at all, and my strength gains have been steady, so I'm really warming to the periodization part of the program. I'm still not sure how keen I am on the split routine, but I'm trying to compensate for that somewhat with my extra-curricular accessory work. Most of my body is getting a workout in each session, just with a variation in emphasis.
I'm still only in the gym about 4 hours a week, which is a lot less than a serious athlete, but plenty more than your average guy. I'd like to go more -- just to build my work capacity if nothing else -- so I may look toward doing some conditioning work (farmer's walks, tabata intervals, etc.) in the evenings either before or after dinner. I realized recently that going to the gym is frequently the most exciting part of my day, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Seems weird. I also realized that it's been just over a year since I seriously started trying to get healthy again, so I might put up some progress pics for comparison.
1 . I realized recently that going to the gym is frequently the most exciting part of my day, and I'm not sure how I feel about that. *nodding. I've met a lot of people at the gym - since I live out in the boonies, and didn't know ANYONE up here. I talk politics ... have gotten to know some of my kid's teachers (small town). But, overall, my workout is often the highlight of my day.

There are several other rates including day passes and lower rates for kids, but a full conference badge will get you into the 'con suite, which includes a full open bar and limited food options, so it's a much better deal than a lot of music festivals!

The end of the calendar year always seems to be a time for re-examining the preceding twelve months. Every other show on TV seems to be chronicling the "Top Ten" whatever that happened in 2008. (I've long believed that this is done, in large part, because the weeks before and after Christmas are quite slow news-wise.) I thought, why not include my own top ten lists? So here they are. . . .
Top ten things that I would like to do (or see happen) in 2009 (not listed in order of importance or likelihood)
3. Visit Rowan at least three times (especially now that he is getting to an age where he'll know whether or not I'm there!)
1. When my mom said half my friends would be "divorced and back out on the market" by the time I was ready to get married. . . . she was right (again).
2. If a 2-year-old sees something he wants, once he puts his hands on it and claims it as his own, it belongs to him, at least in his own mind. Take it back at your own risk!
4. If you choose to do things that are unconventional--like eloping, keeping your own name after marriage, or not wearing a white dress for your wedding--there are people who will judge you and think you are strange.
10. Neither a healthy diet nor regular exercise alone will make me lose weight. I have to do both simultaneously! (OK, I knew this already, but I was in denial. And it's been reconfirmed.)
No, I'm not mailing this. I wrote it to get my thoughts and feelings out of my head and onto the page.
It has been over a month since you and I have spoken. At this point, you may be wondering why I have not been in touch. Given the many years that we have known each other and been friends, I’ve decided that I should make my feelings clear rather than simply avoiding contact with you, as I have done thus far.
To be succinct, I have been hurt by your failure to acknowledge my marriage in any way, shape or form. I didn’t expect much in the way of recognition, despite the fact that I attended both your weddings. A simple text message, email, or phone call would have sufficed and would be no more or less than I have received from many people in my life with whom I am not even in regular contact. However, it seems that even simple acknowledgement of the fact that I am married—or even that I took a vacation to someplace I’d long wanted to visit—was too much to expect.
Your lack of any response whatsoever to what is an extremely happy and significant event in my life has given me cause to re-examine my friendship with you. After much thought, I have come to the conclusion that our friendship has been mostly one-sided for a long time. I have made excuses for your behavior in the past, but in light of this most recent display of thoughtlessness, I cannot continue to do so.
Clearly you have not been too busy to text, email or send me a letter, given the fact that, since my return from Maui, you have found the time to send me two text messages about things going on in your life, a forwarded email about friends, and a Christmas letter. Apparently, though I know you had the time, you have not seen fit to congratulate me or even to mention my marriage. . . . or even my trip to Maui.
In my opinion, anyone who would fail to acknowledge an important event like a wedding for someone who she claims is a close friend, barring some type of dire emergency in her own life, is not someone with whom I want to associate myself. I do not know the reasons for your behavior, and at this point I no longer care.
I wish you well and hope that you find some happiness in your life. I cannot say that I will miss our friendship, primarily because it's been years since you have showed much interest in my life or offered me much support. I will say, though, that I am sorry to be ending a friendship of over twenty years’ duration with someone who I once considered as close as family, and I will miss hearing about your sons’ progress as they grow up.
I really wish there was a way to post our professional photos on this blog; they turned out really great. Alas, the cost of the digital images themselves was too much to justify paying extra for them.
MM and I at the beginning of the ceremony with our minister giving a traditional Hawaiian blessing (preceded by three blows on the conch shell)
One of many kisses (this one after the exchange of leis). There were seven kisses during the ceremony alone: one after each of us said our vows; one after exchange of leis; one after exchange of rings; and one at the end.
Me blowing the minister's conch shell after the ceremony. It only took me two tries to get the right sound, though I wasn't nearly as loud as he was.
My MIL's version of a cute shot of the bouquet and our rings set up by the photographer/wedding coordinator
One of our posed shots after the ceremony. I love the long, multi-colored lei and the way the ocean looks in the background.
Another posed shot. Our videographer actually requested this one and then made MM do four (!) takes before he was satisfied. MM joked that the videographer "thinks he's Martin Scorcese." We were very happy with the way the video turned out, though, so it was worth it.
We hosted Christmas Eve at our house, and then spent Christmas Day at my in-laws'. For Christmas Eve dinner, we had lasagna: an "M" family tradition since at least the early 1990s. I briefly considered making my own lasagna, but ended up getting it from Romano's Macaroni Grill instead.
Christmas Eve was the first time I've ever used my Noritake china which I received as a gift in 1990!
Sebastian posing in front of our faux fir on Christmas Eve. The number of presents doubled after MM's parents arrived.
Hard to say from this photo whether Sebastian loves his Grandma J (my MIL, pictured) or just wants her leftover lasagna
This is her nine-year-old daughter. She was a bit more camera shy than her brother. A very sweet girl!
I realized today that I still haven't posted my MIL's wedding photos as promised. Oops. Our professional photos are in the mail as of today, but I won't be able to post them on here because I was too cheap to pay for the rights to the digital images (it was a significant cost). I really should put up a few of us on our wedding day.
Not much to share. I'm really glad that I'm only working three days this week. Our office is closed on Thursday and Friday, so even though today is Monday, in a way it's like Wednesday already. ;-)
I woke up with a headache today and came to work late because of it. It sucks how many headaches I get, but since I am otherwise generally healthy, I guess it's just my cross to bear.
I learned today via Facebook that yet another of my law school classmates recently had a baby. I should seriously make a list of everyone from my law school class who's had a child int he past 18 months. I know it would be a lot of people. . . . at least 10-12, I'm thinking. And that's just of people that I hear/know about. . . maybe a third of our 160-member class.
An old, old friend contacted me today via Facebook, too. She is someone with whom I went to band camp when I was 13 years old. It was really weird--and really cool-to hear from her.
I had a fun visit with my college friend K and her family yesterday. Maybe I will post a few shots of her kids later along with my wedding photos. (K actually reads this blog. Hi!)
In my life, I can't say that I've always gotten my way. It's a rare person who gets her way all the time. And I'm not sure living that way would be healthy.
I *can* say, though, that most everything I've wanted to achieve, I've achieved once I made up my mind that I'd try to do it. Sure, I've had dreams that I've allowed to fall by the wayside--for example, I long ago thought that I wanted to be a doctor--but by and large, when I've set out to do something, I've done it.
The things that have always been most difficult for me are those things that are elusive, that you can't do much to "get." Things like friendship, love and happiness. Even there, though, I believed that I could take affirmative steps in a direction that might lead me to those things, and I did. I changed careers so that I'd feel more satisfied at work and hopefully therefore happier with my life. I've moved. I've gone out of my way to meet people and to date.
Though you can't make someone be a friend, I am fortunate to have many people in my life today who deservedly bear the title. In that area of my life, I am blessed beyond what I probably deserve. Despite the elusiveness of both love and happiness, I eventually found both. I love MM and have a wonderful relationship (and now marriage) with him. I am happy with my life.
Now, though, I am in pursuit of something that is turning out to be equally elusive. . . . and just like I did when searching for love and happiness, I am having a devil of a time accepting that this is not something that I can "get." I guess I am too much of a controller or a concrete thinker or something. I find it next to impossible to "let things happen" or to "just relax" or "let go and let God." Pick your phrase: no matter how you word it, I am not a passive person who can accept the will of the universe.
I almost didn't even blog today because I'm in a funk (again). The weather here has been very un-Phoenix-like again today: dreary, cold (low 50s), overcast, and raining.
I am attributing my feelings of apathy in part to the weather. The fact that my eating has not been the best, I haven't been to the gym in a week, and all my current work assignments are BORING could all be contributing factors as well.
Anyhoo. . . . while browsing around on Facebook today, I learned that someone whom I used to babysit is pregnant and due in April. I am genuinely happy for her--that's not the point--but man, did it make me feel old!
And I felt even older when I realized that this woman has been married for a year, has a master's degree, is a working family therapist, and is 25 years old. In other words, she is AN ADULT in every sense of the word. Wow. It's weird to think that someone who I knew when she still used a pacifier is now a genuine grown-up.
Add her to the list of people I know who are pregnant or have had a baby in the past 3 years. The list must be over 30 by now, with some names appearing twice. ;-)
I am annoyed with a friend (who I will call D) and wanted to get the opinions of objective outsiders about my situation. She is one of my friends who is not very active on the internet, so I know she doesn't read this blog; she wouldn't even know how to find it! So I feel safe in posting this, knowing that she won't see it.
D has yet to acknowledge our marriage! She has not emailed, texted, called, sent a card. . . nothing. Even though she's known for months that it was going to happen and when. Since I got home, she has sent me two text messages: one a week ago Saturday (12/6) to tell me her middle son placed 2nd in a race he ran, and one last Wednesday to tell me that her period arrived 3 days early (we are usually on the same cycle schedule and both of us are currently off the pill). But nothing about our wedding or the fact that I got married.
By way of background, D and I have been friends for over 20 years. I attended her first wedding in 1995, and I flew two states away and took a day off work (on a Friday) to attend her second wedding this past February. She has three children--now aged 12, 10, and 8--and I spent a week at her house helping her with each of them within the first few months of their lives. I also spent a week taking care of them after she had surgery several years ago.
D has a history of being self-centered--many of our conversations over the years have involved my listening to her problems with her husband (now ex-husband), children, or crazy mother--and it's not uncommon for us to talk for an hour and have none of it be about me. So I'm used to her ignoring what is going in my life. But I feel that failing to acknowledge my marriage is incredibly rude and perhaps more than I can excuse or forgive.
Thoughts? Opinions? Thus far I haven't responded to either of her messages. I'm at a bit of a loss about what to do. Part of me wants to call her out about her rudeness, but another part wants to just continue to ignore the situation (and her).
Here in Phoenix, we don't see much of what most people would consider cold weather. Today is an odd one: it's overcast and the current temperature is 54 degrees. If it were colder--and I lived in another part of the country--I'd almost say it looks like it's going to snow. But I know that won't happen in Phoenix. The forecast does call for rain, though.
My weekend was a busy and productive one. I've been having some difficulty getting into "the Christmas spirit" this year. MM and I bought our tree and wreaths on Saturday; I addressed all my (50+) Christmas cards and wrote something in about half of them; decided on our Christmas Eve menu; and Sebastian got his photo taken with Santa at Petsmart on Saturday. So things are starting to feel a bit more "seasonal."
Oh, and for those who were speculating whether I might be pregnant in response to my "Bleh" post of last week. . . . yeah, my period arrived early Sunday morning. So I guess I did just have a prolonged case of The Mondays.
Mom and I watched "It's a Wonderful Life" on Saturday night while MM was out with his friend. I love that movie! I really should buy it on DVD so that I could watch it more often. My sister often jokes that I'm "dead inside" because I hardly ever cry at things that others find moving. . . but that movie makes me tear up every time I watch it.
My dad is home from the hospital as of yesterday and doing better. My stepmom developed a cold after her surgery, so she's not feeling so hot. I'm sure it's not a fun time to be at their house! MM and I will be flying to visit them on New Year's Day: his first visit to New Mexico!
I know I've used today's title for other blog posts, but nothing could more succinctly sum up my feelings about today. I need a weekend!
I continue to put off starting the South Beach diet. Yesterday was a tough day eating-wise: breakfast was what was provided at my legal education seminar (fruit, danish, & coffee); lunch was out; and dinner was at my firm's holiday client reception at a local resort. I always find it harder to eat healthfully when I'm not preparing my own food. I did eat quite a few roasted veggies and some fruit at the holiday reception, so I was proud of myself for that.
Lunch yesterday was fun. I met a friend from high school who I hadn't seen for over 20 years! We fell out of touch after graduation and just became reacquainted this past summer when plans were being made for our class's 20-year reunion--which neither of us attended--and we realized that we were both living/working in the Phoenix metro area.
It was interesting to catch up and find out what she's been up to for the past 20 years. Equally interesting: I had the sense that I'd want to be friends with her even if I met her today, something I wasn't expecting. So I'm sure we will be getting together again soon when time permits. Although we live in the same metro area, it'd be over an hour's drive from my house to hers, and we are both busy with work and personal stuff.
As usual, I have lots of stuff I need to get done this weekend, including finishing my Christmas shopping. (I only need to buy MM's gifts and three gift cards.) MM has plans to hang out with a friend on Saturday afternoon/evening, and I've made no plans; that's a rare occurrence! Of course, my mom is still staying with us, so I will hang out with her.
The good thing about Mom is that she won't mind if our time together is composed of my cleaning out my closet and sorting through some boxes. LOL Mom is also going to come with me to my office on Sunday to help me hang some photos and reorganize my desk and files. (As thanks, I'm going to take her out to brunch.)
My dad is in the hospital with pneumonia. The timing could hardly be worse because his wife had some outpatient surgery on Wednesday. (Actually, things could be slightly worse: my stepmom's surgery could've been more complicated, and then they'd both be in the hospital right now.) I talked with him this morning, and he said that he is feeling better. His doctor tells him that he can go home on Sunday if he continues to improve.
I cracked up when I read the comments on my last post. Too funny that people immediately thought I might be pregnant! Honestly, I am not in a position to even find out the answer to that question for at least another few days. And if I *were* pregnant. . . I'm not so sure I would write about it on this blog. Too many people IRL read it, and I wouldn't necessarily want everyone to know so early on. KWIM? I am of the school of thought that I would keep that news to myself--except for immediate family and a couple of close friends--until the 2nd trimester.
I'm in a bit of a funk today. Not exactly sure what's wrong with me. I don't want to work--all my current tasks are boring--and my energy level is low. My eyes feel heavy and itchy, as though I didn't get enough sleep, even though I had my usual eight hours. I feel alternately mildly nauseated and hungry.
Anyhoo. This, too, shall pass. I suspect I am just suffering from a little post-vacation/post-wedding letdown. It's not an uncommon thing.
I have a laundry list of things I need to get done at home, but last night I did none of them. The only things I accomplished were writing a few thank you notes (surprisingly, some friends/family have sent us money and gift cards after our elopement) and uploading my snorkeling photos to the computer. Otherwise, I did nada. Well, I did go to the gym, as planned.
It's funny how the scale has been hanging around the same number for a while now. I'm wondering if this weight is one of those "set points" that my body likes? I do know that I've been at this approximate weight a few times during my adulthood.
Ever since we got back from Maui, I have felt slightly off. First, I was exhausted from jet lag, sleep deprivation, and travel. Then I was fighting a nasty cold (which seems to be mostly resolved now, thank goodness). Today I am well-rested and seem to be over my cold, but I still feel. . . not quite right.
I had a relatively healthy breakfast: 2 soy sausage patties and a sugar-free Frapuccino. (Hey, it beats the peppermint mocha & pastry that I usually have!) I've been drinking water and have almost finished my first liter of the day. But I've been feeling vaguely nauseated and had some heartburn for a while, too. I took a couple of Tums, so we'll see if that helps at all.
Yesterday evening I got upset over something that is not really that big deal and can likely be corrected. (No, I wasn't mad at MM.) Even at the time, I realized that my emotional reaction was out of proportion to the issue. . . yet even realizing this, I continued to feel upset. I used to never be hormonal, but maybe I am developing PMS later in life or something. . . . who knows.
When I went to the grocery store last weekend, I bought all the foods I needed to start the South Beach diet yesterday. But I also decided to bake a chocolate cake, thinking that my mom and MM would eat it. And I brought home leftovers from Sunday night's dinner at Romano's Macaroni Grill. My eating yesterday was definitely NOT SB-compliant or even healthy: the only vegetables I had were a few mushrooms in the cream sauce on my pasta, a small can of V8 with lunch, and a little bit of salsa on the burrito that was my dinner. And I ate two large pieces of chocolate cake.
So far today, I am off to a better start. Because I had dairy (in the form of the milk in my sugar-free Frappucino), I don't think I can really consider today a truly Phase One SB-compliant day. . . but if I stick with my planned lunch and dinner, I should be on track to at least a reasonably healthy day of eating. I brought a Lean Cuisine entree and some extra frozen veggies for lunch (along with V8 and a piece of lowfat cheese for an afternoon snack), and am planning on a Chik-Fil-A chargrilled chicken salad for dinner. I may have to throw the half-a-chocolate-cake that's left in the trash.
MM and I are going to the gym tonight, too. At the moment, I really don't feel like it. . . but I know I'll be glad I went. I actually worked out at the Hyatt's fitness center with MM three times while we were in Maui, but it's been over a week since I got any exercise: I haven't done anything since our return. Maybe working out will help me feel more back to normal, too.
After a big ONE day back at work on Thursday (and my attorney holiday dinner that night), I woke up with a raging sore throat, aches, fatigue, and a headache on Friday morning. (And I didn't even drink at the party!) I guess that cold I'd been fighting off for over a week finally got the better of me. So I called in sick, slept for another three hours, and then spent the rest of the day rehydrating and taking it easy. As a result of feeling sub-par, I haven't accomplished nearly as much as I'd hoped to in the days that I've been home. . . but I have unpacked, done laundry, grocery-shopped, and done some housework.
Although our visit was a short one, it was great to see my sister V and her family in Vegas the weekend before Thanksgiving. My nephew Rowan is as cute as ever and is talking up a storm now! He amazes me with the number of words he knows and the sentences he can utter, to say nothing of his ability to parrot the words he hears (I almost had him saying "President Obama" in two days. Obama was easy; "president" was a bit tougher.) I took loads and loads of photos of him, but will include just a few here:
We took Rowan on the gondola ride at the Venetian. (It was one activity that none of us adults had done before, despite having been to Vegas numerous times since the hotel was built.) The second photo of the little guy shows the expression on his face as he watched the gondolier singing "Volare" in Italian. (And I swear I heard Rowan say "Volare" himself the next day!)
MM came very near to missing the Maui Invitational Tournament altogether: he flew home a day before me from Vegas so that he and his parents could fly out on Sunday morning. . . but picked up a raging case of (what was later diagnosed as) staph food poisoning at the Vegas airport. After awakening at 2:00 a.m. on Sunday with horrible vomiting, diarrhea, etc., he was in no shape to take a 6+-hour flight to Hawaii. Instead, he spent a few hours at an urgent care clinic receiving 3 liters of IV fluids and a shot in the butt for nausea. Poor lamb! When I arrived home a little before 10:00 p.m. on Sunday, he was huddling in a blanket on the couch, beet-red and shivering, with a fever of 101.6!
Luckily, between the care he got at the clinic and the TLC and Tylenol he got from his fiancee, MM was recovered enough on Monday morning to board my flight with me, though he was still far from 100%. He probably wasn't fully himself again until after we'd been in Maui for about 24 hours.
What can I say about Maui? Everything you read and hear about the island is true: it's an absolutely beautiful place. The resort where we stayed--the Hyatt Regency--was gorgeous, truly someone's vision of an island paradise. The grounds, the artwork, the beach promenade, the shops: everything was perfect. My photos don't even do it justice, so I won't post them here (the hotel's website has photos that put mine to shame). The resort even had swans, flamingos, and tropical penguins living on-site, as well as three talking parrots and a koi pond in the lobby.
We were lucky enough to get upgraded to an ocean-view room for our entire stay, rather than just for the three days after our wedding, as we'd anticipated. I could hear the waves crashing on the shore, even with our balcony door closed. . . what a wonderful sound to hear first thing each morning and last thing each night! The view from our balcony looked like this (the island visible in the distance is Lanai):
I spent several early mornings and evenings sitting on our balcony reading and enjoying the sights, sounds, and smells of the ocean. (On a side note, I also read four complete novels during our trip! What bliss! I rarely got so much time to read in my usual daily life.)
We didn't do many of the typical tourist things that are recommended for first-time visitors to Maui--like driving the road to Hana or visiting Haleakala crater--in favor of enjoying the beauty of west Maui, on and near the resort. MM is not a big fan of road trips at any time, so he didn't want to spend lots of time in the car, and I acquiesced. (Marriage is about compromise, right?) We did go snorkeling at Molokini, as well as off Ka'anapali Beach near the hotel; went parasailing; took a sunset cruise up the coast of western Maui; and shopped in Lahaina.
Our wedding was wonderful and exceeded our expectations. Everything went off without a hitch. The ceremony was a simple one, performed by a Hawaiian minister on the beach at D.T. Fleming Beach Park (just up the coast from Kapalua), complete with exchange of leis, a traditional Hawaiian blessing, a conch shell, and a ukulele. We couldn't have been happier with the way things turned out!
I obviously have no photos of my own of our wedding ceremony (pretty hard to shoot pictures when you're the bride!), but will ask my mother-in-law to email me some soon to post on here. I do have this photo of my bouquet to share:
Didn't it turn out well? (Bear in mind that I shot this photo the morning after the wedding, so a little wilt is visible.) My only requests were that it be primarily white (with only a small amount of pink, if necessary) and that it be composed entirely of flowers native to Hawaii.
After our wedding ceremony, we celebrated with a delicious dinner at Merriman's Kapalua, which is located right on Kapalua Bay. Eating at Merriman's was a very sweet gift to me from MM: he normally eschews any type of "foodie" eating establishments and is by no means an epicure, unless one considers Red Lobster and Outback Steakhouse "fine dining." LOL
Really, that pretty much sums up our trips. The only things I forgot to mention: MM attended (and enjoyed) some--though not all--of the tournament's games on Tuesday and Wednesday (duh!); and I did some shopping and unscheduled exploring of Maui's northwest shore with my mother-in-law on Tuesday. (The "unscheduled exploring" came as a result of my driving past the turnoff for Fleming Beach when I went to scout the location. When we saw the breathtaking scenery, we didn't want to turn back! And I haven't seen so many shades of green since Ireland!)
I had a tranquil and relaxing week and would go back to Maui in a heartbeat. . . even though flying over 6 hours there and back--not including delays--is no picnic.
I only have time for a quick check-in, and I haven't even uploaded my photos from my camera yet. . . . but I wanted to say that I'm alive and married and back from Maui. We had a wonderful trip, our wedding was perfect--just what we wanted--and I really enjoyed seeing my sis and nephew the weekend before, too.
I'm back at work today and still trying to work my way through my inbox. I hope to write a comprehensive entry--complete with photos--by the end of the weekend.
P.S. I stepped on the scale with much trepidation this morning, thinking that it'd be way up after a week of eating with abandon. How awesome is it that I weigh about the same as before I left? Not that weighing 211+ is awesome, but it could be much worse. . .
Yesterday was the last day of my 30-day exercise challenge, and I fell a little short of my goal. I will say, though, that my decision not to exercise yesterday was not made out of laziness. I really wanted to work out, but made a conscious choice not to due to the issue I'm having with my right hip/buttock. It stinks.
Although I'd really hoped to achieve 100% compliance, 26 days out of 30 is about 87% or an average of about six days a week. I'm pretty proud of that.
Not sure why the scale is up again. I had KFC for dinner, which I imagine is quite high in sodium, so perhaps that's why.
When I looked back on my entry for this same time last year, I realized that I'm about 10-12 lbs heavier now than I was then. Bummer!
Not much else to share. I aim to start my 30-day challenge for eating nine servings and fruits and vegetables a day next Tuesday.
Between Sept and Jan 1 I lost 20 pounds. Between Jan 15 and today I've gained 5 back. Weight loss sucks. At least you're giving it a fair go.
I'm really, really, really proud of you and your challenge. I want to do one as well (as I've said a million times) and I need to get motivated. I have more time now than I ever will - so I have to take advantage of it.
I hope you guys have a great VD!!! It sounds like you both get into it - I'm jealous! My hubby and I are just too lazy to plan ahead like that.

Madison 1031 regularly handles all types of §1031 Exchanges regardless of the complexity of the transaction.
Under §1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, investors can avail themselves of various different approaches for doing a §1031 Exchange.
This, the most common type of §1031 Exchange, happens when an investor sells one real estate property — known as the Relinquished Property — and purchases another real estate property (or properties) — referred to as the Replacement Property(ies) — within 180 days following the sale/closing of the Relinquished Property. For purposes of real estate, any type of real estate is considered like-kind to any other type of real estate and thus qualifies for the Exchange. To get the safe harbor tax benefits of a Forward Exchange, the proceeds of the sale of the Relinquished Property must be held by a Qualified Intermediary from the time of the sale/closing of the Relinquished Property until the subsequent purchase/closing of the Replacement Property.
In a Reverse / Simultaneous Exchange, the Replacement Property is purchased by the investor before the sale/closing of the Relinquished Property. In that situation, the Replacement Property must be held by an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder (EAT) until the sale of the Relinquished Property, which must take place within 180 days following the purchase/closing of the Replacement Property. Although this is a more complex transaction, Madison 1031 handles Reverse Exchanges regularly.
A Construction or Improvement Exchange allows an investor to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Relinquished Property to improve or build on a newly-purchased Replacement Property. This approach works well if the Replacement Property is less valuable than the property being relinquished. When a Construction Exchange is structured properly, the improvement costs can be used to equalize the Exchange. During the §1031 Exchange, the Qualified Intermediary (QI) holds title to the property while the construction improvements are being done. All improvements must be completed within 180 days of the sale of the Relinquished Property.
Offering the broadest menu of services, Madison 1031 regularly handles all types of §1031 Exchanges regardless of the complexity of the transaction. While Forward / Delayed Exchanges are the most common, straight-forward and easiest to do, not everyone has the know-how to do Reverse / Simultaneous Exchanges because of the complicated nature of the transaction.
Why does “half life” intrigue me so much? I remember hearing that one form of uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years. I’m not a scientist, not remotely close. But I’m intrigued that certain earth materials have energy that can give the stars a run for their money in longevity.
Of course, nuclear “half life” puts me in mind of other things, like Chernobyl, or Hiroshima or Nagasaki — or any threat of nuclear action we consider. Extreme radioactivity stays with us. It can contaminate land for many years after an event, rendering places uninhabitable or highly dangerous.
But “radioactivity” and “half life” are terms I contemplate a lot these days in a social sense, too, not just in the literal, scientific manner. For instance, what is the half-life of stupid or mean things said online? And how can we reduce the massive radioactivity in our culture?
No doubt, our culture is radioactive now. I don’t need one of those full-body, white hazmat suits to get on Twitter, but it sort of feels like it, as if some of the invective gets in my eyes and starts to make me burn too, whenever I look. Within moments of reading any hostile political thread, I often feel sad, enraged, gross — or all three start to pull back from the actual topic at hand and just think, “What are we? What are we becoming? What is wrong with mankind? Is this who I want to be? Is this who I want us to be?” I then remember, we are all mites on a spinning, mossy space ball in a vast universe of darkness for a short period of time. We are here for these few brief moments as neighbors. We can hate or we can care for our neighbors, then we are gone. Right now, we’re hating more than caring. And the buzz on that space ball is radioactive. It’s giving off too much carcinogenic energy. Don’t you feel it? Do you feel the cancerous buzz? Maybe not, but I sure do. It’s white hot.
I’ve said many times, and will continue to say in a futile manner, that if there was a way to unplug the Internet, I’d do it. I’ve lived in pre-and-post Internet times. I think the net effect is negative, not positive. We gain many, beautiful things by being connected. That’s true. I could make a lengthy list. But something fundamental in mankind seems to be collapsing in the process, some collapse into the ego of self. What is supposed to “connect us to the world” seems more used as a form of celebration of selfishness. Millions and millions of people are constantly posting highly emotional things, often with the purpose of hurting or demeaning others.
And since there’s such a sea of hate, it feels easy to get lost in that, as if what you post has no consequence. There’s a total disconnect between what you might say to someone in person and what you’re willing to say to them from the safety of a keyboard or smartphone screen. People hurl stuff left and right as if there’s never going to be any personal consequence. That’s because, there usually isn’t.
But sometimes the opposite is true. Occasionally, there is a huge consequence — an outsized, insanely disproportional consequence. If you’re thrust into the national spotlight, then you can now count on your every past digital move to be analyzed for any potentially viral flaw. It’s an ugly fact of the digital age. Get a moment of fame and someone will want to play “gotcha.” I don’t know why. I think the motivation behind much of the “gotcha” social media culture is wrong at heart. I’m generally not interested in the social media musings of teenage athletes, who later become big-time ballplayers. If a politician is endorsing something truly radical at any age, then I think their old, radical views may be relevant public information later. But outside of our policy makers, I don’t feel like old Tweets or social media posts need to be a source of much discussion.
The Atlanta Braves’ Sean Newcomb was recently one strike away from pitching a no-hitter. But his brilliant performance on the mound was overshadowed by old, offensive Tweets he made as a teen. I honestly don’t know what he Tweeted. I haven’t looked it up and don’t really care. But the fact that his old Tweets caused a firestorm signified something about our culture today and made me realize that even teens need to understand the potency (the radioactivity) of the Internet. It has a half life far greater than most of us understand.
Yes, you may grow. You may become more mature. You may completely shift your thinking in life, with everyone in your immediate sphere recognizing your value and your contributions. But if you have unleashed hatred, if you have represented yourself in a terrible way online as a teen or adult, then you have made yourself vulnerable if you ever wind up in the national spotlight. Because someone will find their own malignant glory in tearing you down. And yes, taking glory in tearing down someone for their teen posts is a form of malignancy. It’s not a good thing. It’s a bad thing. But it’s a modern reality. In this way, American society is “the media.” What goes viral is often not determined by “the media” but by “social media,” which is all of us.
In this way, the half life of stupid online seems to be endless, because the radioactivity of the Internet is so strong. If you are hurling hatred one way or another, you may feel extremely safe in your cocoon of the keyboard. But that cocoon can bust. And when it does, it can bring a disproportionate (mean-spirited) kind of shaming onto you.
I think there’s a good rule to follow: don’t say anything online that you wouldn’t say to a person’s face. This is not just for their sake but possibly for the welfare of your future self, who may later regret the intense emotion you feel in the moment and be unable to shake the shame. Just ask Roseanne.
And yes, there’s the elephant in the room on this matter — Trump on Twitter. I think it sets a tone, and not a good one. But I know even saying that raises the blood pressure of many and invites exactly the vitriol I’m talking about. How do you even say “Trump” now without starting a fight? I’ll just say I wish there was an honest-to-goodness “be better” campaign in this country, one that actually had our president’s attention, one that had all of our attention, one that took down the level of radioactivity in the unhealthy diet of our screen-obsessed eyes and temper-fueled fingers. We can be better — and should try.
And if you don’t think you have any personal risk if you wage nasty attacks online, well, you may be right. You may not face any real consequence if you set out to hurt others online. But then again, it’s a gamble, isn’t it? Because that stuff never dies, kind of like uranium. And it can come back in viral form later, like polonium in your inbox. We see it happen. So we can’t play dumb to that fact. And kids need to learn this early. I hope it sinks in with my own. But yeah, they’re going to get an earful on this. I want them to understand what’s radioactive and what’s poison. I want them to think about what’s helpful and what’s hurtful. Everybody makes a choice, even if they don’t see they’re doing it. We make a choice with everything we say and type. And yes, it matters, both now and in our future.
Tax rates for 2018 are now finalized for county commissioners, school board and industrial authority. There were no rate hikes, but increases in individual property values could lead to bigger tax bills later this year for some property owners.
County commissioners approved the county millage rates Aug. 27 after a public hearing in the county government complex. The group is charged with giving formal approval to tax rates for the county government, as well as the school board and industrial authority, which both set their own rates.
While all three tax-levying entities kept their tax rates the same in 2018, each will see increased tax revenue from property value increases.
County commissioners held the final of three mandated public hearings Monday regarding their tax revenue increase. Local pastor Glenn Guest said he felt the board could find ways to cut spending to offset the tax burden on those who are financially strapped.
Guest said he sees money spent on cell phones, a person hired for $60,000 and health insurance benefits for employees that others don’t get.
Commission chairman John Scarborough told him that his point was “well taken,” adding that “no one wants to see a tax increase.” He said there’s often more to the story of each budget item than just a figure. For instance, he said cell phones included $30,000 in the budget, but he said $10,000 of that is for air cards for deputies to use in patrol car computers to transmit and receive information. He said the $60,000 hire was for a new executive director, Frank Ginn, adding that the salary is $20,000 less than it was under the previous director. He said he felt the hiring of Ginn would be a good investment, because Ginn, a state senator, can work to bring business to the county and offset property taxes.
Frank Strickland, who has spoken at recent BOC meetings about assessment practices that he finds objectionable, addressed the commissioners Monday, saying he felt the hiring of Ginn was a good move and could help bring more business to the county.
County commissioners followed a public hearing on taxes by approving the local tax rates during their subsequent regular meeting. Commissioner John Pethel provided the lone “No” vote to approving the millage rates. He has repeatedly said the board should do more to cut expenses and that it wasted its substantial reserve fund in recent years. Commissioner Lee Allen said Pethel has failed to point out specific cuts that are needed. Pethel replied that Allen voted in favor of a $7,000 raise for an employee, a move he found objectionable.
Scarborough said the county had about $6 million in reserves in 2008. He noted that the financial crisis of that year deflated property values and left the county with less value for the same tax rate. Meanwhile, the board repeatedly rolled back its tax rates, effectively having tax cuts for several years in a row and covering revenue shortfalls with reserve funds, which eventually dwindled to nothing. He said the tax revenue increases of the past two years were needed to set an accurate budget, where expenses are covered with actual revenues. He asked that anyone with specific proposals for cutting expenses come forward with suggestions.

This study aimed at studying awareness of the principal, teachers and parents for necessity of policies about child abuse, countermeasures of child abuse and prevention. The study was conducted on 391 people including 70 principals and 161 teachers of childcare centers and 160 parents in U city and Kyungsangnam-do area. The results are as following; First, besides the necessity of education based on actual child abuse cases, parents felt necessity of education for the concept and content of child abuse, and children’s human rights. Second, in terms of prevention, the teacher group regarded reducing heavy tasks as the most important factor while the principal group regarded a program to enhance teachers’ self-esteem and the parents group regarded toughening up penalties and constant education to prevent child abuse as a key factor. The results showed difference of awareness of child abuse among the principals, teachers and parents. This difference indicates there may be a problem due to the difference of awareness of specific policies for child abuse prevention between the organization and the parents.

Tons of cabinets and so much counter space for cooking. Convenient to shopping, golfing, interstates, and downtown Birmingham. This one deserves a look. Motivated seller, bring us an offer.
Planning the location of the sink, the stove top, and, even the wall outlets is a must, as well. Employ the concept of the Work Triangle to ensure you can move freely between each workstation of the kitchen. Once finalized, the installer identifies the position of the Cutouts based on your decision.
He or she may recommend adjusting these locations sometimes, as cutouts make the stone very fragile. There should be at least 50 mm clearance between the nearest edge of the slab and the lip of the cutout. In some cases, the installer may even require to place it with seams.
The Frontage, the central part of the countertop, is the working area of the kitchen. It is here where we perform mostly the various tasks, such as kneading and chopping. Moreover, it is the surface which absorbs the constant use and abuse of daily meal preparations.
When you choose a professional to install your new counter-tops, you won&apos;t have any of the headaches that come along with dong it yourself.

A countertop can either be a continuous space or a connection of two or more slabs joined at angled corners. Often, kitchens with an \"L-shaped\" or a \"U-shaped\" layout require seams to accommodate the size of the countertop. Alternatively, you may also consider using gangsaw slabs (slabs which have a depth of more than a meter) to minimize the number of seams.

This study was conducted to find out how child care center directors felt about respecting the rights of young children and what efforts they have made towards respecting the rights of young children. For this, an in-depth interview combined with a group interview and an individual interview of ten child care center directors from July to October, 2015 was carried out. The results were as follows: First, child care center directors thought that respecting the rights of young children should begin by recognizing that young children are human beings with rights, and that proper play, rest, expressing oneself, time with parents at home and shared experiences are the rights that young children should have. Second, child care center directors were making efforts to improve the awareness of teachers and parents about respecting the rights of young children, and made efforts that ensure the rights of young children are respected by reducing teachers`` task and meeting the individual demands of young children as well as respecting teachers.
The purpose of this study was to understand parents of child-care center by hearing about their difficulties and demands corning their relationships with teachers and to use the results of the study as basic information to improve the relationship between teachers and parents. In total 13 parents of child-care center living in A City participated in the research for 12 weeks from August to October 2012. In-depth personal interviews, group interviews, email and telephone interviews were carried and the researcher`s diary was analyzed. The results of this study showed that first, parents felt difficulty such as ``pouring water on a duck`s back`` because teachers did not understand what they said; ``suffering in silence`` because parents had to suppress their desire to complain; ‘half in doubt’ because of collapsing confidence and accumulating distrust; and ‘biting the bullet`` because they had no choice but to send their children to those nurseries. Second, parents` demands of the teachers were: teachers` self-management of appearance, teachers` accurate understanding of and sensitivity to children, teachers` understanding and care for parents. and building professional counseling capacity of teachers.
The purpose of this study was to examine child care teacher`s perception and practice about the 3rd index of child care center accreditation system and the difference between perception and practice. This study was conducted with 232 child care teachers in Gangwon-do. The major results are as follows. First, there was high level of perception about the 3rd index of child care center accreditation system and teachers thought that safety was most important and they understanded well it. Also teachers thought that child care environment was too difficult to practice. Second, in all sub-categories and overall average of the 3rd index of child care center accreditation system, it was found that there were significant differences between importance and understanding, importance and practice, and understanding and practice.

The American Civil War was a war fought within the United States of America between the North (Union) and the South (Confederacy) starting from 1861 and ending in 1865. This war was one of the most destructive events in American history, costing more than 600,000 lives. It was thought to be one that helped shape the character of the American individual today. From the Southern point of view, this war was a War of Rebellion, or a War for Southern Independence. From the Northern point of view this war was seen as a revolution. This unfortunate war started as a result of many years of differences between the Union and the Confederacy. It erupted after many years of conflict building up between the two regions. Between the North and the South there lay deep economic, social and political differences, but it is important to understand that Slavery was the root of cause of these differences.
There were many factors that contributed to the onset of the Civil War. Socially, the North and the South were built on different standards. The South, or the Slave States, was a slave-based community that followed a class-based system. This system consisted of aristocracy, middle class and then slavery. Many depended on slaves and were accustomed to this way of life, which was hard to change. Plantation owners had slaves working for them, and those who could not afford to own slaves would work on their own farm. The North, or Free States, had more immigrants settling in its areas, where labour was needed, but not the labour of slaves. Therefore it had a more industrialized society where most people worked in factories, and did not follow a class system. The Northerners opposed to Slavery as an institution in the South, as the Confederate States were the only region in the world that still legalized the ownership of slaves. This angered the Southerners and threatened their way of life. The election of Abraham Lincoln, as president was viewed by the South as a threat to slavery.
By time, economic differences also developed between the two regions. The Southern states were agrarian states, and depended on agriculture rather than industrialization. After the Cotton Gin was invented, it increased the need for slaves and made cotton the chief crop of the South. The South was able to produce 7/8 of the worldâ€™s supply of cotton. This increased the South's dependence on the plantation system and its vital component, slavery. But by then, the North was prospering industrially. It feared that the Southâ€™s slave-based economy might affect their economy. The North depended on factories and other industrialized businesses. For this reason many of the new immigrants settled north, while very few settled south. This allowed the North to grow industrially, while making the South more hostile towards them. The Confederacy resisted any kind of industrialization and manufactured as little as possible. Southern economy opposed high taxes, as manufacturing was limited. But the Northern states welcomed high taxes to protect its products from cheap foreign competition. As a result, the South preferred not to accept most improvements that were made by the federal government, such as roads and canals, in order to keep taxes low.
Another major problem that occurred was the competition between the North and South for more land. Both regions wanted to expand socially and economically westwards. The South wanted more agrarian states, while the North wanted to be able to expand industrial-wise. Confederate states felt that more agrarian states would help protect their economy and society in the future. The Union also felt that expansion would help their future as an industrialized country. As competition grew between the two sides, unrest grew with it, eventually resulting in the Civil War.
Politically, the States were not any more united in their point of views. They each feared each otherâ€™s political goals. Expanding westwards did would not only help each side socially, and economically, but also politically. More Slave states meant there would be more Southerners will be involved in congress. But if there were more Free States, there would be more northern representation in congress. This caused continuous unrest between the two regions. Also, both the North and the South had different views on how the government should operate. The south wanted less government control, and more state freedom, while the North welcomed the central power of a government. The South viewed the election of Abraham Lincoln, as president, as a threat to slavery. After Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860, the South threatened to secede from the United States that questioned â€œState Rights.â€� Were States allowed to secede from the nation or not? To make matters worse, the South was determined to start its own nation, by electing its own president, Thomas Jefferson. It started calling for International recognition as a nation from France and Britain. The South was persistent in becoming a separate country, but the North was not about to give up the South.
Eventually, the Civil War erupted. After four long years, the Union would win the War and the country would once again become united. There were many reasons why the North was able to overcome the South. Since Southern economy was agrarian, and they had very few factories, the value of manufactured goods was higher than crops by the start of the War. This made the North wealthier, helping it to produce ammunition and other warfare utilities. The South was poorer, do to the lack of money since cotton was no longer providing the income and had only a few sources for manufacturing goods. As a result they were always unequipped and could not keep up. The North had the ability to invent modern weapons while the South had to fight with older weapons. The North always had more people compared to the South who had fewer people. At war, the casualty rates were always equal, but the South suffered more because while the North could afford these loses, the South could not.
The Civil War lasted longer than it was expected to. But, unfortunately, the War was inevitable due to the great gap between the North and South socially, economically and politically. In fact, due to these circumstances, if the South had won the War, the country would have probably been divided into two separate countries. As any war would have ended, the War ended with great losses to both sides. More Americans were killed in the Civil War than in all other American wars combined from the colonial period through the later phase of the Vietnam War. Apart from the number of deaths and casualties, the great loss of property and money, the country now needed to work together in order to rebuild what was lost. Emotionally, it would take long years for many people to overcome the consequences of the war. The war was followed by twelve years of Reconstruction, during which the North and South debated the future of black Americans and fought bitter political battles. Yet, there was a good outcome of this war. Slavery came to an end as a legal institution. But the war did not bring equal rights for blacks, they still had their own war to win until those rights would be achieved.
I am speaking of the life of a man who knows that the world is not given by his fathers, but borrowed from his children; who has undertaken to cherish it and do it no damage, not because he is duty-bound, but because he loves the world and loves his children… - Wendell Berry, 1971

The purpose of this study was to examine the awareness and needs of childcare center principals and teachers for the development of supervision programs in an attempt to provide some information on the development of childcare center supervision programs and the qualitative improvement of childcare centers. The subjects in this study were 200 principals and 230 teachers who were selected by random sampling from the childcare centers located in the city of Busan and the South Gyeongsang Province. The findings of the study were as follows: first, as a result of investigating their awareness of supervision and its current state, the majority of principals and teachers replied that they were aware of childcare center supervision to some extent(62.0%). Regarding supervision-related training and supplementary education experiences, the largest group of principals and teachers never took training courses nor received supplementary education on that subject(30.6%). Concerning the reason why supervision wasn`t conducted, the largest group of principals cited poor understanding of supervision as the reason(31.1%), whereas the biggest group of teachers pointed out the lack of a childcare center supervision system(48.2%). Second, as a result of checking any possible differences between the principals and teachers in the need for the development of supervision programs, there were significant intergroup gaps in opinions on the necessity of childcare center supervision programs, methods of supervision, planning/operator, supervisors and efforts by the national and local governments and childcare centers for the development of supervision programs. However no significant intergroup differences were found in their views of the content and cycle of supervision. The importance and necessity of the development of childcare center supervision programs was discussed based on the awareness of the principals and teachers and their needs.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship among organizational climate, perception of professionalism, and happiness of infant teachers. The subjects were 269 infant teachers who were working at day care centers in Gangwon. Data were obtained from questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression analysis were conducted to examine research questions. The findings of this study can be summarized as follows. First, significant positive correlations were found among organizational climate, perception of professionalism, and happiness of infant teachers. Second, organizational climate and infant teachers’perception of professionalism were predicting variables for their happiness. In particular, organizational climate of day care center was more influential than infant teachers’perception of professionalism.

This study is about the life history of a nursery school teacher, Ms. Kim, who has worked at private, national/public, and workplace day care centers for 10 years. It was described in time-frames focusing on the change and continuity of experiences as a nursery teacher. Life history text was primarily constructed based on her diaries, her notebooks and memos, her schedulers, the letters she received, the transcription of teacher interviews, the transcription of dialogues with the co-authors, and memory. And then the texts were repetitively reconstructed in order to draw meaningful themes, extract key life-events, and represent interwoven relationship among the themes. As a result, Ms. Kim`s life history was depicted, in accordance with each of the five day care centers she worked in, as ``a woman who complies with director`s orders, ``a factory-hand in learning factories``, ``an instructor who tries to teach well``, ``a temporary contract employee of parent/commissioned-company/company employer``, and ``a burdensome being who is married and on high pay-step``. Under each theme, Ms. Kim`s career life experiences were categorized in two phases; the characteristics of the operating mechanism and the ways that her caring/teaching functions. Lastly, it was discussed about the implications of the life history of a nursery teacher as a typical job symbolizing a female was discussed, enduring strong physical and emotional labor holding low positions in a small-group organization, and grew as an early education teacher with praxis-based identity, but had to be short-lived due to the early education system in Korea.
This study investigated the relationship between emotion regulation and smartphone and internet addiction of day care center teachers, focusing on emotional regulation strategies. The participants were 351 teachers who work at day care centers in Gyeongsangnam-do and Pusan, Korea. The results of indicated that active regulation strategy was negatively correlated to smartphone addiction and internet addiction, avoidance and dispersion regulation strategy was positively correlated to both addiction, and support seeking regulation strategy was not correlated to both addiction. The results of regression were that active regulation strategy was negatively related to smartphone addiction and internet addiction, avoidance and dispersion regulation strategy was positively related to both addiction, and support seeking regulation strategy was positively related to internet addiction only. The findings would be helpful to understand the relation between emotional regulation strategies and smartphone addiction and internet addiction of day care center teachers in Korea.

During a tandem run, a single leading ant recruits a single follower to an important resource such as a new nest. Here, for the first time, we used a motorized gantry to track tandem running ants accurately in a large arena and we compared their performance in the presence of different types of landmark. We interrupted tandem runs by taking away the leader and moved a large distant landmark behind the new nest just at the time of this separation. Our aim was to determine what information followers may have obtained from the incomplete tandem run they had followed and how they behave after the tandem run had been interrupted. Our results show that former followers search by using composite random strategies with elements of sub-diffusive and diffusive movements. Furthermore, when we provided more landmarks former followers searched for longer. However, when all landmarks were removed completely from the arena, the ants' search duration lasted up to four times longer. Hence, their search strategy changes in the presence or absence of landmarks. Even after extensive search of this kind, former followers headed back to their old nest but did not return along the path of the tandem run they had followed. The combination of the position to which the large distant landmark behind the new nest was moved and the presence or absence of additional landmarks influenced the orientation of the former followers' paths back to the old nest. We also found that these ants exhibit behavioural lateralization in which they may use their right eye more than their left eye to recognize landmarks for navigation. Our results suggest that former follower ants learn landmarks during tandem running and use this information to make strategic decisions.

Motherhood is a fatal commitment for female octopuses, who fast as they tend their developing brood of eggs, then die just as the eggs hatch. Over 40 years ago, this selfless sacrifice was shown to be driven by the optic gland, buried deep in the female octopus brain. Now, Yan Wang and Clifton Ragsdale describe how a cocktail of signalling molecules coordinating various physiological processes is responsible for the new mother’s demise.
James Foster highlights a preprint from Vincent Lorent and co-workers revealing that antlion larvae hiding in their sand pits detect sand vibrations just a fraction of a nanometer in size. These vibrations inform the antlion of an approaching ant, and they respond by throwing sand to prevent prey from escaping their sand pits.
I was wondering what love actually means to people, I know that sounds strange but am currently in a relationship which stemmed from a wonderful friendship.
He is very traditional so wants children with me and marriage and to move in, in the future. Though I said I do not want children and marriage he said it's fine even though I know that's what he wants.
Here is what I am very worried about. I know love isn't a fairy tale, my head is fully screwed on when it comes to that. I really like him, I do. I care about him, I think about him every day, smile and/or laugh whenever someone says his name and have blushed on several occasions when someone mentions his name. Once my heart beat faster when a work colleague mentioned his name (turned out, she said a different name). He is even breaking down my barriers I have about physical contact. But....
The quirks which I did not know about him before are annoying me, they are not enduring. I see us taking trips together but not him moving in together, he wants me to do things that I won't do but if I ask him to do something he will do it, which is why he called me selfish before and though it hurt when he said it, I would have to agree. He thinks we should spend every day together as well, if we are not together then we should at least contact each other by phone, email. I was so happy when I met him because he was quiet like me and we both opened up with each other.... two quiet people. But he wants to spend majority of his time with me, which I should find sweet but I don't
I know love is different for different people, I guess I am scared, I have never felt like this before. He has gone further then other males so I know I really care about him (I mean physical contact) but from everything I have read or seen I should be in this state of euphoria and find him irresistible. I don't know...... I think I am being too hard on my self.
love is a bitch ... it can come in many forms ... to anyone ... everything you said sounds alot like me and one of my ex's, difference I see is she has a kid from another relationship, your "friend" sounds alot like me and you her, we ended up moving in together and destroyed us ... but we are still friends and her new boyfriend is a great guy ... from my own experience, you need to tell your "friend" and make him realize, he will be hoping that you will end up seeing his view and unless a compromise on both sides is made then issues will arise ... never say never and know one knows what the future holds ... i go sleep now
That is good that you are still friends with your ex, I strongly believe that can happen and not all relationships end badly even though you were in a bad situation with moving in together.
I know he will agree with me when I say what I want but ultimately he will further down the line try to change my mind. before I met him, I hated the idea of physical contact, I would let friends and family hug me but I would not actively touch anyone but he's changing that, though it's just with him but it could go on to expand. Also he gave me the self confidence to try to go to university, an idea I previously dismissed before hand.
Those both are good, they are but both times he changed my mind, so I know further down the line he will want to try change my mind again. Though I don't know why I am thinking about this now. I am struggling to work out if I am in love first of all he apparently does me so I do not know
no the breakup with my ex was bad ... as always when she and I broke up I started drinkin heavier than usual and tried other things, it was actually an intervention from my MP that stopped me, he saw a post on twitter was worried, and phoned me up (we are on opposite sides of politics and debate a lot but he had my number for something else), spoke to me for 2 hours and then requested to meet me at a neutral location, he came and we talked and it helped and I cut my drinking back to normal. Ironically my MP was on a alcohol ban at the time and not allowed in pubs etc for punching another MP in one of the westminster bars.

I bought this painting for both artistic and sentimental reasons. I recently acquired this painting and now it is beautifully framed and hung in my dining room.

The light in this painting is beautiful. It’s on a wall in my family room so that I can see it every single day. It’s captivating.

Jeff is able to capture the subtle changes in light on the clouds and …
I fell in love with this painting from the moment I saw it. It depicts my favourite time of year. I love the way the dappled blue green background lends a sense of the depth of the forest. This is where I find peace. Jeff has a unique way of showing light in his paintings. You always have a sense …
My first piece of Jeff Dillon art. The captivating brilliance of the Canadian fall lives on year round in vibrant red, if only in my heart. This kindly, gracious birch limb cradles it. I was mesmerized by this, my first painting by Jeff Dillon. Anne, Kitchener, Ontario Jeff Dillon Fine Art

An Apple A Day: 365 Recipes with Creative Crafts, Fun Facts, and 12 Recipes from Celebrity Chefs Inside!
Once upon a time there lived a man. He was certain there was Heaven. He was also sure there was only one way to get there. So he registered himself with the God of Heaven through his approved intermediaries and was assured of a place as long as he declared his allegiance to the God all his life.
The man had a wife and a few children. His wife would work all day for other people and gather food with the money earned. She Would then come home and cook a sumptuous meal. Our pious man would lay around the couch and watched movies, and played around with his video games, all in his immaculately maintained exterior, meaning his designer clothes, designer shoes, and designer hair. Although quite cute, the burden of children never attracted his attention as he was not sure that would affect his heavenly outcome one way or the other.
At dinner, he would ceremoniously arrive and serve himself ample portions, just in case if he was to get hungry at night. He would place himself at the table with immense satisfaction expressed with a toss of head and a sigh of relief. He would then declare his piety to the God by closing his eyes most reverently and thank God for such a wonderful provision. He would consume his food and at the end emit the most satisfying sounds, however rude they may be, and would leave the table leaving the emptied dishes for his wife or whoever else to clean. For a man of such reverence "cleaning dishes" did not come across as an act of piety nor thanking his wife. She was a mere mortal and she had no influence in Heaven.
Greatly impressed with the man's performance, God welcomed the man to the Heaven. The man looked around and he could see his wife no where. He said with an air of satisfaction, "I have told the foolish woman to sign up, and see now. I am here and she is not". The Heaven was fully populated. He eventually found his place. He was not sure, thought, why the Heaven looked so dingy.
That night when it was dinner time, he had no food. He was waiting to thank God. Yet there was no food.
Once upon a time there was a man. A rare bread, certainly for modern times. It was a time when pace was slow. It was a time when each event in the heavens was significant, recognized and moved on. For instance there was a keen sense of when Sun was up and when it was down. It was a time when you could tell how angular the 7 sages constellation was apart from the Northstar, called "Dhruva".
This man was not cunning. He has no means of scheme in his mind. He has no intentions of get rich quick schmes. He is what you call a very honest man. He had a reasonable amount of land and considered himself rich among peers. Ofcourse there is every reason for the peers to think otherwise. Nevertheless it is fair to say that such a thought never crossed our subject of this episode.
He felt himself so rich he made a promise to his son that however long he wants to educate himself or remain in school he would support him unconditionally. His son went through ten years of schooling, perhaps stumbling through the way. His son then went to a town nearby for the next two years to be taught in English. Instead apparently the only thing the school taught him is how to light up long tobacco filled foreign cigarets. The man, in the coming years, would recite a connected episode again and again to his grandson.
One day the man went to visit his son. The son is not available and the man walked into his room only to find bags of smoked stubs. He would recite this story now in a glee. Nevertheless he went on to support his son untile his son decides to get married and save the man of any futher expense.
On a summer night, in an open ancestral home that is degenerating faster than the man himself, he narrates this to his grandson with apparent joy and makes him the same promise which goes "If we were to sell all the land, we would do so, if you were to continue your studies, how ever far you wish to". The grandson noticed not a wish in his grandparents voice but a sense of pride that he would be able to support a dream as long as he could.
It was gladly concluded that the grandson studied so far that he had wisely spent every rupee of his grandfater until the man said, "I never thought you could study that long, perhaps you could look for a job now".
Susan Hockfield is the sixteenth president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She has been a strong advocate of the vital role that science, technology, and the research university play in the world, and she brings to the MIT presidency an exceptional record of achievement in serving faculty and student interests. Dr. Hockfield assumed office on December 6, 2004, following election by the MIT Corporation on August 26, 2004.
The MIT Program in Women's Studies will celebrate its 20th anniversary with a daylong symposium, "Challenges for Women's Studies: Power, Politics and Gender," with leading feminist scholars Barbara Ehrenreich, Chandra Mohanty and Patricia J. Williams.
There was a saying in Telugu that talks about turns, and the sneakily implied benefits. It goes something like, "It won't be long, will it, as my sister is being hitched". The birthday of a 2 year old is especially interesting to a 6 year old as she very well knows she is the tacit owner of all the toys that are to be received and she tries her best to promote the event.
We were playing the other day with one of those games that she purportedly borrowed from her brother with an absolute glee on her face. It is a board game called "candy land" where small figurines move over a snakey path as pick cards. Obiously the one ahead will eventually win the game.
I pick my cards and I was ahead of her by a few squares and I was quite satisfied with my progress thus far and quite placid in the hope of teaching this 6 year old how one should take such things as victory and defeat , pleasure and pain in stride and so on and so forth.
The she picks one of those privileged cards with a mermaid sitting on a load of gold, and she jumps way past me on the board. Well I have never seen my teaching debunked in a flash and I see these hand waving, air pumping 6 year old jumping on the bed while saying
A considerable number of hand written notes guard her, as she calls the ENTRANCE, but essentially her door. Most of those notes deal with who should stay out of her room. The objects may range from generic, parents for instance, to specific, Ashley for example. Obviously I, nor anyone else whether listed or not, do not pay any attention to what is on the door, until I have started realizing there is a certain amount literary value to these, obiously painstakingly crafted decissions.
The other day we were celebrating Narayan's 2nd birthday. We had a houseful of kids and adults. She thought she was discouraging the younger ones and older ones by posting a note. Very phonetically chose inscription reads
I was surprised as this writing spanned multiple lines and after having only read the first part "No buddy allowed..", I said to myself, what on earth would she write that for. It would have been 100% natural to see things like
When she is really mad. But she would never write to keep her buddies out. This must be serious I was thinking. So I stalled and read the rest. That was funny I thought, however unintentional. A normal observer would have stopped there.
For a 6 year old, 'u' is taught in school to sound more like "ah" in "fur". So to spell "body" in "No body" she choose "bu" for the first part. Then what about "ddy"? Well she pressed the "d" twice to show you how serious she was about the "No body" part.
I prefer warm water for brushing teeth or washing hands and Kavitha prefers cold. When in hurry, particularly the mornings, I turn on the water for her to brush her teeth. By habit I always turn it on and keep it in the warm setting. Kavitha tells me subsequently "Daddy, accidentally you have turned on the water on the warm side". I am quite humbled by the exonerating virtuosity of "accidentally". I am not sure where she picked it up from but she uses it quite often under similar circusmstances.
I usually wake up around 6:30 and be ready by 7. Then I start my journey upstairs. Everystep step adds an extra ounce of stress as I go through my strategies to wake up this 6 year old. She is one tough cookie to wake up. In the complicated script that ensues there is a step when I have to separate the 6 year old from her blanket. The other day she said with out a feather of a surprise, "Daddy the blanket will be coldiee..". Her eyes were still closed and her feet a bundle under her chest.
Child-speak is quite interesting. Either it is the element of surprise for an adult to decipher a parallel sound or just an evolutionary slavery that was inculcated into the brains of a parent. Narayan, 19 months, has a little bit of vocabulary now.
Not to offend the pains caused to his mother he started off with Mom. For the superstitious he woke up on Dad's day and clearly said Dad. Well a good excuse for the rest of the family not to get me anything else.
In fact before he remembered Mom or Dad, his favorite object and word is ball. He has variations on this word. While he seeks it he calls a round object a "ball". When he gets hold of it it becomes "baa-laa" with a clear glee.
The other day I was sweeping the kitchen. Then I saw this diaper clad otherwise buck naked little figure running through the kitchen start saying "deedee" with his mouch curled up into a surprise-o. I acknowledge thinking he is calling me Daddy, "deedee" being close. "I am sure there are other activities that Daddy does, and wants to be recognized other than sweeping floors" is really what is going through my mind.
Now he takes his little finger and points to the to the trash and insistently calls it this time "deetee" with a discernable frown and a left to right head shake. Well it is child-speak for "Clue-less-grown-up I mean to say Dirty".
It is quite familiar now to hear "deetee" around kitchen sinks and also in public sometimes, referring to various inanimate and animate objects at which time I translate it to "Daddy" and sport a courteous smile.
Dialing through the radio today I heard a passing remark that "Great nations deserve great art". The composition was compelling but I prefered to rearrange the order of the sentence and make a bold prediction that perhaps "Great art begets Great Nations".
Art is the candle. Art is the potential that the drifting masses hang on to in the storm of time and in the time of change. At times of despair it is the hope.
Art is religion for some. Art is song for some. Art is engineering for some. In all cases it is an act of love and the seed of action.
Where it is not held in chains humanity should prosper and where it is a medieval darkness should descend.
Mighty kings may have shaped the dominions in their rein, but it is Shelly that should be known in the next nation.
Rulers of various hues may have empires over the Hindukhush but it might be the Gita that is in the heart of the citizen, the scientist, perhaps the next ruler
Narayan is a year and 3 months. He is walking around quite good now. His favorite hobbies include toppling oversized things among other destructive things. This past sunday like many husbands of the modern times, otherwise quite respected, I was washing dishes while watching Narayan. He is at his game destroying things in the living room. Kavitha, my 5 year old, is kind of keeping an eye on him as I couldn't spot him exactly what he was upto from where I was washing the dishes. Kavitha got hold of a puppet doll. It wasn't long before she tied knots around it. Now she is all concentration trying to unknot the doll. I hear the frustrating sounds of a 1year 3 months old. More than usual the presense of Kavitha around a 1 year 3 month old can cause this. So I yelled "Kavitha what is the problem?" as I lift my head from the sink. I can see this time though that she couldn't be the reason as I see her in the middle of the room focussing on the puppet. As I was conjecturing this I hear the answer floating by. Katiha didn't even turn her head. She simply stated using a pronoun: "He is trying to lift the sofa" and continue to unravel the puppet.
However you slice it life in these times is a rush. Along with it goes the stress. This quotient is at its peak around 8AM in our house as I start gathering my work bag and Kavitha's school bag on our way to the 100,000 mile Camry in the driveway while trying to wave the customary bye to her Mom and Narayan who happens to eye us everyday as to where on earth we disappear into.
I check my seat belts and back up while Kavitha settles in with her school bag while ferociously thinking how to annoy her Dad. This annonyance may vary from playing a game to pretending to be a creature with matching vocal chords. On this rainy, wintry day she must have decided to take it easy on me and announced that she would like to play the "My letter is letter.." game. The drive usually takes about 10 minutes covering the 2 mile distance as we pass the traffic lights and an ever present ominous looking Jacksonville Police Officer that directs the traffic into the school from the main road.
The game goes like this. I will start by choosing a letter. Let me say the letter is "t". So I will have to promptly announce to the other player as "My letter is letter T", followed by a clue. As I pass through the tall growth on the side of the road I prepare my clue: "It is tall and green". Kavitha would normally guess this with an answer of "tree". Today she chose to play first and chose "T". Subsequently she declares the clue:
In my mind I start reflecting "My tree is tall and green" while her tree is a thing of life and a part of Nature. So I take in stride the humble, and she moves on to her second letter which she chooses to be "R". And her clue arrives with the same precission:
With consternation and gloom I pull into the parking lot of the school thinking of ruses to avoid getting a "Rabbit" for her 7th birthday. It used to be her 6th birthday. But recently she weighed the predicament of taking care of a Rabit and decided that the Rabit will be more manageable when she is 7. I am still hoping it will be 8 next year.
I dropped her off with her basket of Valentine gifts to her teacher and co-students and headed back to work. A friend of mine comments in this wake:
The other day it was an evening time. It had just gotten dark outside. you were doing something in the kitchen. I had Narayan in my hand. I was walking out of the kitchen, and I had turned the lights off.
You were hesitant in getting your tongue around "Electricity" to finaly decide on "Electric City" as your chosen sound.
It was inventive, sweet, and tacky. I wish grownups take such chances in every day lives to try out when they are not sure. Venture out and invent something. Go beyond their means to wring the possible out of the impossible.
It is from the unexpected that an intelligent human being derives pleasure. This is the kick in exploration. This is the true pleasure of science.
The Pandava prince Arjuna is known for his wisdom of weaponary. In sanskrit in which Mahabharatha was written the word "weapon" rhymes with the word "science". A weapon does not exist with out a serious study of science. Weapons have personal names. Each weapon seem to have been a perosnification of years of study and knowledge. The tales of Mahabharatha are ripe with such abstractions. Perhaps that is a subject on its own.
Back to the original story. So the art of weapons being a science, Arjuna as a child was being taught by Drona.charya, the renowned teacher of the Kaurava Court. On a certain occasion the grand old man of the dynasty Bhishma drops by to check on his grand children. A demonstration of their skills ensued. The test of the time is to take aim at the eye of a bird sitting on a tall Oak.
The five of the Pandava princes and the 100 of the Kaurava Princes are lined up for the task with Arjuna being lined at the last intentionally although he was the middle of the 5 of the Pandava princes. As each of the students take aim, each one has a different interpretation of what they saw while aiming at the bird. One saw the blue sky, and one saw the branches and the leaves and one saw the bird itself etc.
When it is Arjunas turn, I am certain to his apparent dismay, saw nothing, that ofcourse except the eye in its complete magnificence. A transcendental vision perhaps. While he watches his aim the rest of the physical world seem to disolve into nothingness.
This unbridled focus is the essence of study. Intelligence is nothing but a manifestation of all absorbing interest in your subject. Everything else is bound to follow.
There is another important element to this story. It is not often that the attention gets drawn to the fact that Arjuna FORGOT the world. So focus and forgetfullness go hand in hand. Unless you are capable of forgetting you won't be able to focus. Not knowing this principle of forgetfullness seem to be the bane of many learners. To ignore the small and many for the big and one is important.
I am not an expert on sanskrit. But "Ekagratha" literally might mean "Focus or mind on ONE" (Eka - means one in sanskrit)
It is very interesting how children like cause and affect songs. Perhaps this is the most famous of such.

ANYTHING about Ancient History interests me! Many of my kids feel the same way...We are getting ready to do a World's Fair (each will have a booth about their chosen part of the world/time period), and 4 of them picked an ancient civilization.
I think this is a very unique way to get kids (and adults!) to really understand historical figures. They can really see what they might have felt, seen, or experienced. Definately will be looking into getting this! Thanks!
I don't see a lot of information about the book, and being new to your products doesn't give me much background. However, I love history through stories, and the idea that this is honest history is appealing. My husband is a history buff, and I think he would enjoy using this resource with our kids.
Gilgamesh and Imhotep are interesting to me because our family doesn't know quite as much about these historical figures as we do about some of the other ancient history figures. Thank you for giving us an opportunity to possibly win this book!
We love History and especially ancient and middle ages. I shared your page with my boys who loved the artwork and I love that I can purchase this in an ebook format so I never have to wait to start a lesson!
Oh, I love the illustrations. I will be covering this section of history two years from now and this will be a great resource.
I really enjoyed the illustration. I think it really brings history to a form my 9-year-old daughter could relate to.
history in story form....sure to be a hit. with pictures that one can look at while doing so...all the more fun. :)
The illustrations are wonderful. I think on the site, though, there is too much white space between the Bramley Books picture and the Peek Inside... information. It would be helpful to see the book information before the ordering information. It's very helpful that you've allowed a sampling of one of the biographies.
Thank you for offering a free sample biography online. It is helpful to read one of the full stories to get a feel for the quality and style of writing before purchasing the book. The illustrations are incredible!
My kids and I are having a great time studying Ancient History. I love that your books are not full of tawdle and bring the people alive!
The illustrations look beautiful, and it would be fun for my dd to read some stories to "flesh out" what we've been studying. Thanks for this opportunity. Kathy (kathy bowden at mchsi dot com)
This looks very interesting and would add a new dimension to our ancient history studies. We will be covering ancient history again in our 2010 - 2011 school year and will definitely be considering adding this resource to our studies. Thank you!
Terri, this book looks wonderful! I love anything that helps my children and myself place ourselves in the lives of the people we are studying. Thank you for this opportunity.
We love anything that involves history, and this book looks like a resource we would enjoy. Thanks for entering us in the drawing.
This looks really nice,and the pictures are wonderful. Are the other books available as an e-book as well? A look at the contents or index would be helpful.
Stories that bring history to life are what I am always looking for. In the Eve sample, I liked the way you use dialogue to convey a lot of the message, and the message was great too! My daughter loves to put together dramas. I don't know about other stories in the book, but this story would lend itself well to that use.
This looks like a great source for history! The pictures look like they came from ancient times as well. I think this would be a great addition to anyone's library.
I can think of no better illustrator for this series of books than Darla Dixon. Incredible detail and talent!
The thing I love most about this series is the blending of Biblical biographies with others. They naturally go together. They should not be separated. This is what sets Terri Johnson's materials apart from most others.
I've always found that the best way to get a "handle" on history is through biographies. I love the idea of this series!
I love the map and the illustrations in the Eve sample I downloaded. The scripture references are also appreciated. Keep up the great work!
WE have enjoyed reading the biography of Good King Wenceslaus (What really Happened during the Middle Ages). I like how the characters chosen are unique and bring to light little known stories of real people. These biographies are perfect for narration and I think they are excellent supplements to any History Program. I can't wait to see the newest book.
I love these pictures. It helps to remind me that these were real human beings just like you and me. Thank you for sharing.
Well, knowing that we will be studying ancient history next year in at least one group that we participate in, and knowing that I have a child who is a voracious reader who loves biographies, this new book seems a win-win for our year next year! Here's hoping... :) I am one who loves to check out a book "in the flesh", but from what I can see, this book will be a wonderful addition to our studies.
Wonderful resource; full of interesting facts and the imagery in the Eve download is awesome! I can only imagine that the rest of the book would be just as great! Thanks for sharing and showing!
I just read the Eve bio, very well done. I love the drawings, they are beautiful.I like the mixture of people chosen for the book, it's nice to have a Christian resource for non-biblical people. I really like the story telling aspect,I've personally learned more about history with that type of delivery then with a dry facts only delivery. I'm looking forward to saving up and catching another sale at some point!!
This book looks great! I think my boys will enjoy it. We love learning about biblical characters, and I love the pictures. Thanks for the great resources!
I absolutely enjoy What Really Happened In Colonial Times, which I purchased back in (October?). The stories are very interesting and the illustrations are beautifully drawn.
I wish I could afford to buy this series of books! I've downloaded the sample chapters and they're fantastic (my girls are in 2nd and 5th grades). I enjoy the stories as much as they do! The illustrations in this book are just superb! It really puts character to the names. Thank you for the superb work you are doing in providing these resources!
We have already read several of the stories in this book and just love them. They truly bring people to life. Thank you so much.
I've been hoping for another chance to win one of these books! Reading about how they weave historical facts into a story to give a "picture" of how life may have been seems a wonderful way to interest kids in history.
Thank you for this opportunity, Terri! I would really like to read about Imhotep. We touched on him briefly in our studies this year and learned that he is one of the very few (if not only) Egyptians to have believed in the concept of One God. We love history in this house! Heather
I'm teaching a high school Ancient History course now that I hadn't planned on so I am scouring the Internet for resources! I love using stories to make history come alive. It looks like this could be a great resource. Would love to be able to see the table of contents and a sample! (hint, hint)
My daughter and I love history! She loves to read books and so do I. We will be studying ancient history soon, so these would be great for us.
Just finished reading the free download of Eve's biography. It is beautifully written and illustrated!! The footnotes for more information are wonderful. This would book be an excellent addition to any homeschool library!!I'll be ordering mine asap. Thanks for the opportunity to preview. Can't wait to share your book with my children.
History is my childdren's favorite subject! How awesome to have history come alive. Thanks for the opportunity to win a book they are sure to enjoy.
I am always looking for good History resources for my children to learn from. This book looks like an excellent resource and the illustrations are just beautiful. We will be starting our Ancient Civilizations studies and this would be a great addition to have. Thank you for the opportunity.
I love the illustrations. They are very detailed. My kids enjoy good illustrations. I have purchased your maps before and they have been so helpful through the years. I also noticed the pricing of your books seem very reasonable. Thank you for making them both an e-book and a soft cover. We love books.
We have What Really Happened in the Middle Ages and would love to add Ancient Times. My children are very young yet but I have to say you have already taught me a lot and it all rubs off on them at this point. Mommy's fun becomes their fun. Thank you so much for this offering this contest.
I am interested in history by story. I myself am not interested in ancient history, but my son loves to read about it. I think this would be a great way for him to do so.
Those illustrations are fabulous. I feel like they could just start speaking to me at any moment. We've been homeschooling for 7 years and History can be so much fun. I always enjoy new things and finding a way to work them into our daily assignments. Keep up the excellent work. Sherry
Great detail in the illustrations! I also get a sense that the illustrator researched character and is giving us an accurate rendition of what that person would have been like. These will surely make the stories come to life. Great job!
I love learning along with my children. I am learning about people I never knew of before. You have some great products!
We, meaning myself and all 5 of our children were totally engrossed..The illistrations are amazing,and this books was beautifully written..Our children were begging me to purchase this book so we could finish reading the entire book "together".. Their ages are 5,10,12,13,and 14..This says alot about this book with the age range and the fact they were totally engrossed and would like to read this book together..What a blessed job you have done, congratulations and God Bless all of you... ...t.muston@comcast.net
I love getting a look inside the book. Bringing history alive with story rather than facts and figures is always more fun and easier to remember. Great illustrations!
The idea of ordinary people doing extraordinary things intrigues me, especially in ancient times. Thanks.
I have What Really Happened During the Middle Ages and we have enjoyed it. The Ancient times book looks just as good! I love the artwork and the stories are engaging and fun to read.
I really like the black & white Images. I think it would be fun to use watercolor pencils to color them and put in a notebook.
We are currently studying ancient history and would love more Christian resources. I read the Eve free sample and enjoyed imagining what her feelings and personality may have been like. Thanks...I am happy for the chance to win a copy. Kathy T ticesaved@mwt.net
The illustrations are beautiful. We are studying ancient History this year, much of it is even new to this Mommy-teacher.
I have read many of your downloads and have enjoyed the personal side of the stories. The black and white art allows my artsy daughter to color them in. We have used your maps since the beginning of our homeschool journey and have found none to equal their clean lines and ease of use. Thank you for your dedication to history's stage!
These books are so interesting, and with good illustrations, too. I tried writing a story about creation recently, and the more I tried to lengthen it, the more boring it got! What I read in the Eve sample was so much more exciting. These books look really great for teaching history.
Wow - EVERYTHING about the book looks fantastic (grin)! I think what I like the most (at least upon first glance) is that the age range is perfect for 2 of my children. They love to read, so what better way to learn about some of the famous people from history?
Thanks for offering a free biography to try! I had my 9 yr old read it today and he asked for more because he loved it! Thanks, I will be getting the book now!
Please enter me for the drawing. This book looks wonderful! The illustrations are beautiful, and I love books that make history into a story. I'd love to have this.
I love the idea of history through biographies, stories of real people. It would be great to have these organized by time period! Thanks for the drawing!
We are currently doing ancient time history and for us this owuld fit in perfectly. My son (6) and daughter (3)love for me to read to them. I feel that liturature is a great way to learn and enhance your studies. It can really bring a character to life.
I downloaded the smaple on Eve. WOW, it is written just wonderfully. My son was memzmorized by it. It just, like I said, really helped to bring her to life and make her seem more real!
What an interesting accompaniment to any study of ancient times. It helps "flesh out" historical characters. Lovely drawings!
We are studying ancient history right now - and loving it. Using real life stories is the way to go. I think I going to have to order it while it is on sale.
I downloaded the sample and read the Eve story last week. I was awed by the story - I loved it so much. Sandra@actsoflight.com
The sample chapter offered a beautiful portrait of Eve through a tapestry of honest history and thoughtful prose. Darla's illustrations are intricately drawn and offer a glimpse of the personalities of these great icons of history. Thank you, Terry, for offering a product of such quality at a price that makes it available to even the most frugal of homeschool moms (e-book sale priced at less than $7)!
Okay..the illustrations are so fascinating. I love having biographies at my fingertips also. It looks like such a wonderful book!!!
Thanks for the contest! I'd love to have the book, as I personally know very little about people of ancient times. Since I know little I don't refer to these times/people (except for the Bible) and my children are also less familiar with them.
As a mom of an artistic child, I can't help but be wowed by those illustrations. A natural inspiration for the pencil artist!
Just beautiful! My children have a wide age range, but the story format of history would draw them all in, I believe. Their grandmother does pencil drawings of them, so the illustrations in the book will resonate with them that these were REAL people.
I love simplicity of the stories. They draw in the reader but yet are based in facts. Sounds like a wonderful resource.
I've been interested in this book for a while but haven't been able to afford it. My kids are just starting to really appreciate history (thanks to Dad) and we use the blank timelines to fill in every interesting thing and person we learn about. I think What Really Happened is a terrific book.
While there is a fair amount of conjecture in the Eve story, I do enjoy the illustrations, and the Bible citations and clarifications in the footnotes to get the REAL story, without too much preachiness. The story itself is interesting in that it allows us to look at these characters for the real people they were...with thoughts, feelings and activities they may have engaged in day to day. If read as a story with a historical basis, and not as history itself, it is a starting point for teaching and thinking.
I have the Middle Ages book & it's fantastic so I can't imagine I wouldn't love everything about the Ancient Times book as well. The drawings are amazing.
The drawings are beautiful, but I think the kids would especially like the stories that they could identify with.
I was intrigued by these historical portrayals of these prominent figures! It is always neat to see how they are "brought to life" by illustration and in story-form to catch the interest of our little ones and ourselves. :) Great work! I especially enjoyed that they were true to history and morally done--exactly as I would "picture" these people to be, but could never bring to life in story form myself. Again, great job! Can't wait to see the rest...I know my large family will enjoy them.
These drawings are awesome. They make history come alive and seem more real. The artist has a wonderful gift.
I was captivated by how the 'sample' bio drew me in with suspense. Definitely a winner. Also, the sketches are creative works of art! Wonderful.
Thank you for creating a fasinating book about ancient times. My children love to listen when I read history to them, even the books with more facts than stories! This would be a wonderful book for our library.
Thank you for these great treasures. What a great way to dig deeper into history. The drawings are amazing!!
I would love to win this. We have your What Really Happened During the Middle Ages book and are using it in our current study of the Middle Ages but I never got the Ancient one. We love your products. I have the cd of the complete Blackline maps and we use them all the time. I also hope to buy your Time Travelers Series when we get to the time periods you have covered. I wish you had the Middle Ages done that you have plans to do in the future :-)
I hope I win this or the Wonders of Old book since I did the survey also. I have wanted the Wonders of Old since it came out but cannot afford it. It is on my want list so if I don't win it maybe I will be able to afford it soon.
I really liked the illustrations and think they would be a great way to interest my "artist" daughter in ancient history. It looks like another great product.
I really think the illustrations would draw my "artist' daughter into ancient history. This is definately going on my wish list.
(I left the wrong e-mail address on a previous comment and may or may not have gotten it erased. I struggle with technology.)
When does the sale end, in case I'm a winner? By the way, I love the book cover. It looks authentically old. I like that about history books. It makes me think they really understand the subject. If I buy a history book and it's cover looks like it was made by a computer graphics guy, I wonder if the info is accurate and tend to peruse the book alot longer before I buy.
I like the story format for teaching about the people you've selected and the selection of people chosen. Two of my daughters prefer to learn history from stories and would enjoy reading this book.
I loved the Eve biography sample. The story was told in a riveting way and really caused me to think of her as a Mom and not just a character in a story. I think if the rest of the book is as well written as Eve, then it will be great.
I look forward to sharing my love of studying history with my young children and know your books will help to share that love even earlier than text books alone. I agree about the space down to the sample. I didn't even know it was there until seeing it mentioned in other comments and I've looked at your sales page before. The illustrations are both beautiful and yet approachable by students working on portraiture. While my children are too young for that I can see that making the text of more interest to budding artists as well. -L Brons bluehydrangea at gmail dot com
I love teaching deeper history lessons. This book fits right in to that. I do not like "surface" teaching about history. It is one of our favorite subjects and I want to know the "meaty" details. This books says it offers that so I would like to read it.

It’s been ten years since the events that changed Johnny Merrimon’s life and rocked his hometown to the core. Since then, Johnny has fought to maintain his privacy, but books have been written of his exploits; the fascination remains. Living alone on six thousand acres of once-sacred land, Johnny’s only connection to normal life is his old friend, Jack. They’re not boys anymore, but the bonds remain. What they shared. What they lost.
But Jack sees danger in the wild places Johnny calls home; he senses darkness and hunger, an intractable intent. Johnny will discuss none of it, but there are the things he knows, the things he can do. A lesser friend might accept such abilities as a gift, but Jack has felt what moves in the swamp: the cold of it, the unspeakable fear.
John Hart is one of the kings of US 'rural noir', a master storyteller who's never really written typical thriller novels. From when he first broke through 12 years ago with the Edgar-shortlisted debut THE KING OF LIES, Hart has offered readers an intoxicating mix of lyrical prose, richly drawn North Carolina landscapes, captivating crime storylines, and chasm-deep characters. Hart, one of only two living authors to have won two Edgar Awards for Best Crime Novel (the other being James Lee Burke), is the kind of writer compared to literary maestros as much as fellow crime bestsellers.
But even given that resume, Hart throws crime readers a couple of major-league curveballs with THE HUSH, his new tale. After a series of remarkable standalones, for the first time ever Hart has brought a protagonist back. THE HUSH sees the return of Johnny Merrimon and Jack Cross, childhood best pals and adolescent heroes from THE LAST CHILD, a Southern Gothic mystery masterpiece that swept the Edgar, CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger, and Barry awards, among other accolades. In that tale, Johnny and Jack teamed up as Johnny searched for his twin sister, who'd vanished a year before.
A decade later, Johnny and Jack are young men. Johnny has retreated to a self-sustaining lifestyle in a remote cabin on the swampy, sprawling property of Hush Arbor that was in his family more than a century ago, and passed to him after the events in THE LAST CHILD. Johnny's land-rich, but cash poor, and many vultures are circling, eyeing up the rugged landscapes he calls home. Johnny is living life the way he wants, on his own terms, and Rowan County locals view him as as wild and untamed as the land he inhabits. Books have been written about his exploits; he even has groupies.
Jack, who was the wilder of the pair as kids, has turned himself around from teen tearaway to young lawyer starting his career at a well-regarded local firm. He's Johnny's only link to normal life, but even he finds himself questioning his old friend's insularity, and his strange attachment to Hush Arbor, a place full of dark and mysterious history, that seems to affect visitors in bizarre ways.
As Johnny's ownership of the land comes under threat from multiple angles, Jack wants to help his old friend, but also worries about the dangers that lurk among the swamps and trails of the Hush.
And it's those dangers that provide a further curve ball. Hart has always had a strong sense of the rural environment in his thrillers, the places and the people who populate them, but in THE HUSH that sense of place casts a long shadow. Not just a 'character-like shadow', it is pretty much a character in itself, with a swirling, malevolent personality. There's an elemental feel to THE HUSH, an ancientness, or mysticism. It's a thriller with more than a touch of magic realism.
So a few curve balls, and several places where the author could strike out. But in Hart's hands, he connects. Beautifully written, with that vivid, elemental sense of place and populated by an eclectic cast of richly drawn rural characters: blue-collar workers, rich landowners, entitled businessmen who fly in for hunting, a range of local lawyers, outdoors enthusiasts, and strikingly poor people that feel a great connection to land where their ancestors spilt blood or were enslaved (or both).

Best Kept Secret is kind enough to release our tape: Pillows Out of Sweaters "in their words, “it's like eating vanilla ice cream in your dark living room in the middle of the night...wearing your robe and your bedroom slippers...suddenly, you realize you're missing something or someone...and then you start humming a song”. To put it my way, Sid and Lei write the most candid and heartfelt bedroom pop that I have heard in a while." You can buy it from Indiepages ^_^ Read more on Last.fm
Best Kept Secret is kind enough to release our tape: Pillows Out of Sweaters "in their words, “it's like eating vanilla ice cream in your dark living room in the middle of the night...wearing your robe and your bedroom slippers...suddenly, you realize you're missing something or someone...and then you start humming a song”. To put it my way, Sid and Lei write the most candid and heartfelt bedroom pop that I have heard in a while." You can buy it from Indiepages ^_^ April 15, 2005 Alte Recensioni Poi di troppa cuteness si può anche morire, ma per il momento a Sid e Lei la cosa non sembra importare. From the italian zine, indiepop.it: March 7, 2005 A tape review Although the feeling of many of the songs is overtly cutesy bedroom pop, the Shmat could not help but feel happy listening to this tape by Under Shooting Stars. He had already heard one of their songs "Clouds Upon Clouds" from the excellent Humblebee compilation "Hey Where Did The Summer Go!" On their Pillows Out Of Sweaters cassette tape from Best Kept Secret, Sid and Lei alternate singing duties on these 7 intimate, hummable tunes.
But lest you think these are lifeless bedroom ditties, they endeavor to make the songs sweetly upbeat with bouncy drum machine beats and dreamy, slightly-out-of-tune electric guitars. "Sweater Weather" has a beat like an old Nintendo game machine along with whispered vocals by Lei. "Heart Shaped Poems" could be a Galaxie 500 song if you replaced Damon with a Boss Dr. Rhythm Section and Dean with David Bazan. One of the Shmat's favorite tunes on the album was "Smile Again" which takes a standard blues chord progression and mutates it into fun indie pop a la mode.
The keyboards in the droning "Every Waking Moment" definitely reminds him of the duo Shoestrings. While the Shmat is talking about bands that Under Shooting Stars reminds him of, he might also mention that the overall tone and construction of certain songs feels similar to one of the Shmat bands, Light Sleeper. The Lucksmiths cover, "Untidy Towns" has some cool driving bass lines near the end along with that snappy snare beat. A lot of the lyrics seem to have something to do with sweaters...
maybe it's chilly where they live? Or perhaps like sweaters, these songs are meant to comfort and reassure in a world that is growing slowly colder in tone day by day. In any case, if you need to brighten your morning, the Shmat thinks these songs are definitely worth taking a listen ... that is, if you have a cassette player handy! - review by SHMAT (2.27.05) Read more on Last.fm.

For ultimate camouflage, tray or aligner systems render a modern straightening method. Designed with sophisticated software and 3D digital models of your teeth, a series of clear plastic trays produce the straightening results. Medical-grade plastic without wires, metal, springs, or rubber bands gently moves your teeth into place. Gradual pressure on specific teeth with each aligner means less discomfort and shortened treatment times, in many cases. Your provider dispenses several sets of aligners at a time, allowing you to change to a new one at home every three weeks.
Removable trays can be set aside for short periods allowing normal eating and cleaning. Enjoying an apple without the intrusion of brackets and wires works well for many patients. And the smooth plastic surface offers a comfort level to the tongue and cheeks unequaled by other forms of straightening.
A system that can be taken out and set aside may be forgotten. Committing to consistent wear, at least 22 hours each day, helps ensure the success of your treatment. While clear aligners work extremely well for adults, a responsible teen can be a candidate too. And adults of every age have discovered the perks of straight teeth through aligners.
While aligner treatment works for 90% of straightening cases, some tooth movements may not be possible. Or you may simply prefer the security of fixed braces. More choices than ever exist for many procedures in dentistry allowing customized care for your situation. 8 to 8 Dental can help you discover the path to a straighter smile.
You may discuss adding whitening to your plan, removing years of yellow stain accumulation. In some cases, the beauty of porcelain lifts a straight smile to another level or may even offer an alternative to orthodontics. And you may be pleasantly surprised to find a flexible payment option or undiscovered insurance benefits that make treatment closer than you think. To learn more, give us a call soon!

The existence of katagami helps to reconstruct something of the culture that developed around the textile industry and the social and the cultural nuances imbedded in their materials, construction, aesthetic and use.
The John Huston Collection of Japanese paper stencils is believed to be the largest private collection of katagami in the United States. The collection was amassed from European collections acquired when the first Japanese artifacts arrived in the west and were collected in London, Vienna and Paris. These excellent small collections were gathered by John Huston (not the director) in the 1950s and 60s. Stencils from the Huston Collection have been the subject of major exhibitions in American museums including the Asia Society New York, Museum of the Art Institute of Chicago and the de Young Museum. It is with great delight that we are able to present these masterworks of Japanese design and craftsmanship.

Since 2010, this community-focused conference has brought some of the biggest names in the sci-fi, fantasy and gaming world to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Hal-Con attracts celebrities like Jim Beaver (2017), Gates McFadden (2016), John de Lancie (2015) Mark Sheppard (2014), Billy Dee Williams (2013), René Auberjonois (2012), Erin Gray (2011) and Walter Koenig (2010). Halifax is the hub of the Maritimes and we think it’s the perfect backdrop for Atlantic Canada’s biggest sci-fi, fantasy and gaming convention.
Mission: Our purpose is to host an awesome convention every year and host events year-round to bring together people to build and enhance our community.
Vision: Hal-Con is committed to celebrating geek, nerd and pop culture. Through a variety of events, we continue to strive toward establishing ourselves as a mainstay of Nova Scotia by integrating into the landscape of Halifax’s landmark events, and positively impacting both the culture and the economy.
Values: Hal-Con values equality, opportunity, and freedom of self-expression safe from ridicule or judgment. We provide opportunities to learn, to create friendships, and to celebrate in a positive, welcoming environment. We have zero tolerance for harassment, sexism, or bullying of any kind, both in our online communities and at our events.
Nova Scotia has a history of conventions; many existed from the late 70’s through to the 90’s, but then unfortunately fell out of existence. In late 2008, the idea to revive having a science fiction and gaming convention came about. A group of keen individuals began work on putting together a new Hal-Con, borrowing the name from a previous Halcon convention which existed years before. Over two years of planning, fundraising, and slogging turned out a brilliant first new event. The Lord Nelson Hotel was flooded with nearly 1500 fans from all over the Maritimes turned up in costume to celebrate the return of science fiction and fantasy. Coverage of the event went nationwide across Canada with a feature on InnerSPACE on the Space Channel.
In 2011, Hal-Con moved to the World Trade & Convention Centre, expanding our space and more than doubled attendance to nearly 3800 that year. We saw increased attention from the media, fantastic feedback from fans and vowed to keep growing.
In 2012 we demonstrated even more remarkable growth. We eclipsed 4500 fans in 2012, continuing to draw more fans from across Canada and the USA. Everything grew – our number of scheduled events, our floor space, the caliber of the guests, and our total charitable contributions crossed the $25,000 mark through our charity auction.
In 2013, we had an unprecedented surge in demands for tickets with our guest list including Billy Dee Williams, Jewel Staite, John Rhys-Davies, and Peter Davison. Our existing ticket model allowing single day passes to be redeemed on any day of the event proved problematic as Saturday saw too much demand for attendance. Fans were frustrated with the difficulty for entry/exit of the event, full hallways, and lack of access to their preferred programming. Hal-Con acknowledged the problem, offering immediate no-questions-asked refunds on site, as well as refunds available upon request up to a month after the event. During the peak hours of Saturday, some official guests walked the line-ups outside offering free autographs and chatted with fans. Attendance was estimated at 5400. While there were problems that needed correction – this proved Hal-Con was a popular event and had potential to continue growth based on audience demand.
Determined to “right the ship,” the team regrouped in 2014 and corrected the issues plaguing the previous year. By allowing tickets only to be valid for one specified day, the total attendance could be easily capped and monitored to allow better event flow. Vigilantly monitoring any issues as they arose, we were able to accommodate requests and ran a smooth, successful event, working toward establishing our long-term future in the city. Growing once again to approximately 6400 (including volunteers, etc), we committed to a cautious but optimistic outlook for our future.
As of 2015, we have seen a huge increase in demand for tickets. To ensure due consideration was given as we grow to include the attached Scotiabank Centre to our existing space at the WTCC in Halifax, tickets went on sale later than usual in May 2015. By the end of that month Warp Speed (VIP), Weekend Passes, all children’s passes, all discount passes, and Saturday admission tickets were sold out. We are excited for this year, looking forward to our expanded space as we anxiously await a larger venue space in our future.
For 2016, we continued to improve towards meeting demand of tickets and guests, as well as fan-run panels and space for everyone. We kept an eye on the new place as it continued construction, held the countdown for ticket sales, and we were able to be back at the WTCC and Scotiabank Centre. Tickets went on sale in June, and within a fortnight Weekend Passes were sold out, and within 14 seconds Warp Speed (VIP) was sold out.
Hal-Con’s main fundraising event is our annual Charity Auction, held during the sci-fi and gaming convention weekend. Proceeds from the auction are donated to our charities – The IWK and The Kids Help Phone. We are also committed to supporting the community and other charities throughout the year. Our Community Events Team and our costumed volunteers can be seen at events around the HRM all year round!
Hal-Con is registered with the Province of Nova Scotia (Registry of Joint Stocks) as a society, granting NPO status. (#3235985).

It's useless for me to try to talk about the Virginia Tech massacre. I have a lot of sympathy for the reporters - the good ones anyway - trying to find some words in the English language to adequately talk about something so horrible and sad. For the most part they've done a pretty good job - I've read some pretty amazingly touching stuff about this tragedy.
I'll leave it to others more elequent than I to talk about the tragedy itself. And I have no intention of addressing the gun control vs. student firepower debate here - at least not right now. The little piece that I can try to wrap my head around is the question asked early on by many of the parents and many in the media (and many of the surviving students) about what security measures the campus administration should have taken between the initial shooting at 7:15 and the later shootings at the engineering building. I don't know what people mean when they talk about "locking down" campus. I haven't been to Blacksburg but it sounds similar to UNC (even larger) and while you can certainly cancel classes and lock the dorms, what are you going to do about the majority of the students that live in off-campus apartments and Greek houses? They're going to get on the bus or get on their bikes or slip on the flip-flops and get to campus. A major university is not a high school.
Modern campuses are certainly in a much better position to actually get communications out to the students quickly then when I was in school 25 years ago. Every college kid has a cellphone, every one has email - I'm sure you could set up a reverse-911 thing to call or text all the students (and faculty) to warn them of... what? That there was a double homicide in one of the dorms? That's the kind of thing that happens. That's the kind of thing that you sort of know how to deal with. Probably a crime of passion, of jealousy. As callous as it may sound, do you somehow shut down what amounts to a decent-sized town (40,000 people if you include faculty and staff) after what that appeared to be? What if the initial shooting had happened in an off-campus apartment?
I know it's too early to be speculating but that's partly my point. I can understand distraught parents and students in the panic of the moment feeling like something should have been done. I just don't see what, given what we know at this point and I'm not ready to start beating on the administration and security staff who are undoubtedly already beating up on themselves enough for all of us.
While it's way, way too soon to celebrate, it does appear that the Navy's position on building the Outlying Landing Field (OLF) at their preferred location is finally losing steam. The News and Observer views Senator Burr's strongly-worded letter to the Secretary of the Navy as one of the last bullets in the head of this stupid idea. Note that the major political player in the state that has not staked out position is the ever-elusive Liddy Dole - I'd suggest you email her but as far as I know, she still does not have a senatorial email address. I can't rememer a less effective legislator from NC that Ms. Dole and it astounds me that she's actually running for reelection.
But this not about Bob's little woman - it's about the good news that the worst possible site for the OLF may be soon to die the ignominious death it deservers.
I'm here to announce a press conference for 11:30am Tuesday April 17 where Lex will announce that he is going to schedule a press conference to announce whether he will be forming an exploratory committee to investigate the viability of a possible run for the White House in 2008. Or not.
Just kidding of course but Lex does seem to be the only Republican I know of that hasn't at least publicly flirted with the idea of running for President (naturally, he's the only one that I would consider voting for). I know it's early still (although it doesn't feel like it) but it seems there's a lot of winnowing out to do on the Republican side. In addition to the 847 declared candidates there are at least another few dozen that are being coy and waiting to see whether anyone emerges early on that might stand a snowball's chance in hell of getting elected. I certainly can't see any of the three apparent front-runners actually winning a general election - frankly, I'm having trouble seeing any of them going into a Republican convention with any kind of clear lead.
Like it or not a Mormon is not going to get nominated as the Repuglican candidate. McCain is so ridiculously damaged (almost entirely self-inflicted) I'm surprised he's not in traction. Guiliani comes with incredible baggage and as far as I can tell his only positive is that he happened to be mayor of New York on 9/11 and managed to stop what he was doing and pay attention, rather than read "My Pet Goat" to a bunch of schoolkids. Not exactly the stuff that Presidents should be made of.
As long as Fox News makes no real pretense at being a real news bureau, I see no reason for Democratic candidates to treat them like they are. Kudos to John Edwards in particular for being consistent in his dealing with them as they deserve.
...coming to Casa Plutonium soon! Sorry to not be posting more but that was primarily due to getting ready for the Arts at the Meadows streetfair last weekend, which went very well! More soon...
On March 1st 2013 a new e5 project was launched which will be funded for two years by the “Umweltbundesamt”, the central German environmental protection agency. The European Business Council for Sustainable Energy (e5) and the Global Ecovillage Network of Europe (GEN Europe) will be working together on two thematic strands cooperatively which aim at mainstreaming the ecovillage approach and connecting actors in the field across existing institutions and society groups.
The first thematic strand, held by GEN-Europe, will present ecovillage solutions and the ecovillage approach to sustainability as possible answers to our pressing, complex and interconnected societal challenges to an urban audience and facilitate further connection between ecovillages in the German speaking community (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). Over the course of the project several workshops and events will be organised and accompanied by public relations and a new website in German. Also, GEN will be represented at several conferences and gatherings.
The second thematic strand, held by e5, will focus on the field of the commons economy and bring together actors from ecovillages, the urban commons movement and business in Germany. Looking for potential technological, social or economic innovations and possibilities to mainsteam these in the established economy is the main goal of this strand. “Sustainable lifestyles through commons economy” is the project title under which four round tables with representatives from different fields will come together to work on the question how impulses from ecovillages can support the transition of society. The findings of these meetings will be involved in a concluding study on the economic potentials of the commons economy in ecovillages.
Q3 2017 passed by quickly with a couple of major events at work and family… Wait. Did I say that at the Q2 review? Déjà vu.
First, I left Conversion Logic, which I was part of the founding team since 2014, and joined Microsoft. While my team is in Redmond, WA, I work from home mostly. I will write about it with more details sometime later.
Second, my family moved from Torrance to Rancho Palos Verdes (RPV). My wife grew up and has lived in Torrance for 20 years. I moved to Torrance in 2007 when I started dating with her. We love Torrance, but thought that RPV would be better for our children.
Moving was challenging. It took 3 moving trucks and 2 full days. Even after two months, we still have lots of boxes to unpack and many things to fix. We hope that this is our last move.
Third, Joseph started kindergarten. The transition from preschool to kindergarten was a big deal for both Joseph and us. He needs to get to school by 8:30 am and be done between 3 and 4 pm. After coming home, he needs to finish his homework before any play time.
That means that we need to adjust our schedules to accommodate his (plus schedules of his three brothers). For us, it helps that I work from home with a flexible schedule, but I have no idea how other working parents manage to do so.
Fourth, our nanny found a full time job. Big congrats to her and we’re so happy for her. The downside is that we have even less time on our own.
Running 200 miles (53%) – I ran only 5 miles in Q3, and 105 miles in 2017 so far. Those 5 miles were done during my business trip. I couldn’t carve out even 30 minutes to hit the gym.
Algorithms to Live By – How to apply CS algorithms in real life. Very insightful and entertaining for those with CS background.
Judges for You – by Tim Keller. Brutal reality of humanity without God. “Everyone did what was right in their own eyes”.
The Language of God – by Francis Collins, Director of NIH and former head of the Human Genome Project. Scientist’s perspective on God and faith. “Mere Christianity” in 21st century.
Winning 1 competition (x) – In Q3, I formed a team with 4 first time Kagglers at Microsoft and worked on Carvana Image Masking Challenge for a week as a hack project. We finished 130th out of 735 teams.
Q3 2017 was very challenging. For about a month around the move, I was in the survival mode, barely doing my duties at work and home.
Although, Q4 started with most of the same challenges outstanding, I’m positive that I can achieve more in Q4 – because I’ve become more effective than ever by going through the toughest quarter.
I just stumbled across this suggestion for a helpful Bible Memorization program. For a couple of months now I have been delaying my journey back into memorization techniques that I once used. I listened to a sermon by NT Wright on this subject and his suggestion to memorize the Epistle to the Ephesians challenged me. I also read a book that changed my perspective on the will of God where the author emphasized the way of wisdom in decision-making. In the back of Decision Making and the Will of God, the author suggested digesting passages of Scripture to help guide us in thinking more like Christ and making wiser choices that way.

The head of the SPLC's 'Intelligence Report' has warned that President Trump's s alleged plan to change the name of the federal government's 'Countering Violent Extremism' (CVE) program to 'Countering Violent Islamic Extremism' is "dangerously misguided" for two reasons.
First, it singles out adherants of Islam, the majority of whom are peaceful, she says. Secondly, it ignores the threat of "homegrown extremists inspired by white supremacist or antigovernment ideologies."
The SPLC refers to a Reuters article dated February 2 which quotes several anonymous DHS sources who claim that the program will change both its' name and its' focus soon.
"A source who has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the program said Trump transition team members first met with a CVE task force in December and floated the idea of changing the name and focus.
In a meeting last Thursday attended by senior staff for DHS Secretary John Kelly, government employees were asked to defend why they chose certain community organizations as recipients of CVE program grants, said the source, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.
Although CVE funding has been appropriated by Congress and the grant recipients were notified in the final days of the Obama administration, the money still may not go out the door, the source said, adding that Kelly is reviewing the matter.
The Reuters article then reveals this very interesting info, which certainly deserves more scrutiny as to who is getting all these millions of our tax dollars and what these alleged "anti-extremist groups" do with it:
"The Obama administration sought to foster relationships with community groups to engage them in the counterterrorism effort. In 2016, Congress appropriated $10 million in grants for CVE efforts and DHS awarded the first round of grants on Jan. 13, a week before Trump was inaugurated.
Among those approved were local governments, city police departments, universities and non-profit organizations. In addition to organizations dedicated to combating Islamic State's recruitment in the United States, grants also went to Life After Hate, which rehabilitates former neo-Nazis and other domestic extremists."
The SPLC statement concludes by referring to President Trump's advisor and former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon as "a champion of the white nationalist movement."
"Second, the threat from terrorists who falsely claim to represent Islam is not the only one we face.
"In recent years, we've seen a series of deadly terrorist attacks from homegrown extremists inspired by white supremacist or antigovernment ideologies, such as the massacre at the Charleston church in 2015. But now it appears that President Trump wants the government to stop its efforts to prevent terrorism by far-right extremists.
"This is dangerous and unacceptable. Sunday's attack on a mosque in Quebec City should remind us, once again, that our government must not let down its guard against the threat posed by non-Islamic extremists indoctrinated into the ideology of hate.
"We can only surmise, given that Trump has repeatedly taken cues and talking points from anti-Muslim extremists and that his chief strategist is a champion of the white nationalist movement, that this is a politically motivated decision. The bottom line is that rather than making us safer, it increases the risk."

On the first day of HWA's New Mexico writing conference, literary agent Jeff Kleinman asked ten aspiring writers to trim their books.
First, he asked them to eliminate every adjective from a handpicked passage. "I'll give you a dollar for every adjective you can expunge," he said.
The reason? Too often, those things get in the way of the reader and the character. "Writers stick in too much information," especially early on, he said. "It's your job to get out the way."
Kleinman, with Folio Literary Management in New York, is one of more than 30 agents, writers and historians who spoke at the Historical Writers of America's second annual conference at the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort in Santa Ana Pueblo.
The conference ran Friday through Sunday with more classes and keynote speakers, including Santa Fe author and screenwriter Melinda Snodgrass, bestselling Texas romance author Parris Afton Bonds, and New England historical writer Jodi Daynard.
Kleinman, by the way, didn't make good on his promise to pay writers a buck for their adjectives. But he did buy them ice cream sandwiches. And he moved his classes from a dark hotel ballroom to a sunny patio, where his students could gaze at the Sandia Mountains.

This time a selection of my old Orcs. I am almost ashamed to say but back in the day I was less worried about painting every single miniature I bought before they got to see the table so most of these brutes would have seen some combat!
Having said that, some of these chaps did get a lick of paint and considering how old they are (I am much more careful with my painting now) they still hold up to a reasonable tabletop standard...just. Perhaps a little bit of work on them and some new bases?
Above: These are some of the really early Citadel Citadel FTO Fantasy Tribe Orcs, later known as C15 Armoured Orcs and C16 Orcs. Really like the one in the middle with the serrated sword and shield.
Can't remember the manufacturer of the above but he is a great looking mini. Really mean looking and not a bad paint job either!
In the pic above you can just about see Harboth and some of his Black Mountain Boys. These were one of the first of the Regiments of Reknown sets and I managed to get them all apart from the champion figure who I believe was released later as a slotta-base figure.
I particularly like the standard bearer and his 'pole with some skulls on it' - none of this flashy flags stuff for Harboth and the lads!
In the shot above you can see the different ranges and manufacturers - front left are some Black Orcs and Hobgoblins from the Chronicle range by Nick Lund. Behind them are some Citadel Half-Orcs. Next are some early Grenadier Orcs from the Battle Lords set 'Army of the Black River'. At the back is the Citadel Man Mangler. In the centre are a selection C15, C16 and other Citadel Orcs, some on slotta-bases (my last purchases) and at the rear are a handful of old Citadel Goblins. To the right of the picture are a horde of Grenadier 'Fantasy Warrior' Orcs and behind them are the Goblin Raiding Party boxed set, which I have actually started to paint recently!
Above is the Orc Man Mangler from the early 90's, unfortunately missing a couple of crew. I am sure they can cope.
Figures are predominantly Citadel from across the years but the are also some from the Grenadier and Chronicle ranges, possibly some from Asgard with a couple more from who knows where.

They are ideal for experimentation with magnetic fields.� When you place these filings on any magnet, you can visualize 3D magnetic fields.� This demonstration is very common in the classroom and this is your chance to further study the magnetic properties at home.
For uses involving changing magnetic flux in electromagnets, electric motors, generators and transformers. Dimension (D x L), 5 mm X 200 mm.
Floating wheels is among the most exciting magnet levitation attempts. The idea is making a wheel and axle that will float above a set of magnets and can rotate with no friction. This is a challenging experiment and interesting novelty that provides an attractive and exciting display. This is very close to a 100% magnetic levitation constructed with static magnets.
This set comes with 6 magnets, 5 pre-cut pieces of wood and some screws. You will need a screwdriver and wood glue to complete this project. A thread or invisible string is pulling the axle from one side.
For students ages 8 and above. Adult supervision and support is required. Keep away from younger children.
These bar magnets measure about 1/4" x 1/2" x 3" (72 x 12 x 6 mm).�The magnets are made of Aluminum (Al), Nickel (Ni), and Cobalt (Co) which makes for a super strong and high quality magnet.�
Discover the gravity defying effects of magnetism through experiments in equilibrium, gravity, and magnetic fields. Then build a Magnetic Levitation Train with this kit.
If you need additional magnetic strips or want to make your own kits, please use the product code MAGTAPE.

There is evidence that we are trying to do too much which is too bad because even when accomplishing numerous things, we get the feeling that we didn’t have that productive a day.
This means a lot of other things will be sidelined, but according to time experts, doing less with more focus delivers the better result.

House Warming Games where a key reason why my house warming party was so successful. Like you, I was very proud of my new home, not only did we design it ourselves, but we also built it! It really is our home sweet home.
Most people move house on average every 7 or so years, so house warming parties don't come up on a regular basis. So why not make the most of this special time in your life, and celebrate with a house warming party to remember.
Like all other parties, my message is clear, keep it simple and easy. Plan ahead, and if necessary get your friend and family on board to help out.
You only need a few house warming games to get everyone mixing and mingling and having fun. Have a look at the home party games that I have listed below. Choose the ones that fit your own personality, the personality and the number of your guests.
If you want to choose a theme for your house warming party I have listed some ideas below. Plan your house warming games around your theme. Many of the games that I have suggested work well with these themes.
This is a great ice breaker game to use as one of your house warming games, especially when the guests don't know each other. It gets everyone talking.
Object of the game: Apart from getting to know each other, the aim is to collect as many clothes pegs from the other guests as possible.
Andrew and I do this every time we have a new visitor to our home sweet home, did I mention how proud we are of our home?
Andrew gives the $2 tour, I give the $5 tour! no we don't charge them, but I do tend to take a bit longer and go into much more detail than he does.
The tour consists of guiding your guests around your home sweet home, explaining what you use the rooms for, how you chose the colors, the decorations etc. I always start at the front door, and flow logically from one room to the next, trying not to back track. When you have several guests you will probably need to break them into small tour groups and run several tours throughout the party until every guest has seen your beautiful new home.
You can call it find the dog, find the pig, find the what ever. This is one of those house warming games that I created before I actually had a real cat. I like cats, so I have 3 shadow cats. What are shadow cats I hear you ask? They are cardboard cut outs of a cat, and they sit on the various door architrave in my home. I also have a porcelain cat in my family room.
After the tours have finished, I ask the guests to see if they remember how many cats they saw. I had 4, 3 shadow cats and 1 porcelain cat. One of the shadow cats is in the guest toilet, so it's not easy to see unless you look up while comfortably sitting down!!
It was funny to see my friends walking back around the house trying to find the cats. Now of course I have 5 cats, but Coco, my Australian Mist, is usually hiding very well when there is a party at my house!
So whatever you're into, spoons, horses, cats, dogs, strategically place pictures, ornaments or the real thing around your home and see how many of your guests can find them all.
Another great house warming games idea that can be used as an ice breaker at the start of the party.
You will need: A name of a famous person written clearly on a party hat, create as many famous name hats as there are guests. E.g. The Queen, Marilyn Munro, Santa Clause.
Questions can only be answered with Yes or No. For e.g. Am I a living person?, Am I a cartoon character?
Once all the guests have arrived, or at a set time, the guests sit in a circle and take it in turns to say who they think they are.
You can also call this "Know your city", "Know your town", or even "Know your street", if it's a party with lots of neighbors coming.
We did this game when we moved into a new apartment in Sydney several years ago. The apartment was in a converted wool stores building in Ultimo near Darling Harbour in Sydney. We had some friends visiting from Brisbane, but most were Sydney locals. We were discovering our new suburb ourselves and that's what gave us the idea to do this game.
Depending on the number of guests, you can do it as an individual competition, or split them into teams. For some questions that are tricky, you could do multiple choice answers to help them.
Research some interesting facts about your suburb/town/city. Check out the local library, even the local people will be able to help if they've been around for a while.
This is a fun way to give your housewarming party guests a small gift as a memento. Buy a enough gifts for the number of guests and a few extra in case extra turn up!.
Head to the shops and purchase small homeward items, such as, a small egg beater, a pate knife, a stubby cooler, (Australian for bear cooler), key ring, egg timer, bottle opener, tea sieve, small spatula, bar of soap, face cloth, small picture frame, dusting cloth….etc etc get creative!
Place the wrapped gifts into a washing basket which has been filled with packing filler such as scrunched up wrapping paper.
I like this idea for house warming games because you end up with a lovely memento of your house warming party.
You will need: A nicely decorated book like a journal that can be written in. You could put a picture of you in front of your new home on the front cover. pens.
Object of the game:To create a "cook book" of new home recipes and comments from friends and family about your new home.
As each guest arrives, ask them to write some words of wisdom regarding how to they know you and what they think of your new home.
Once the book is completed at the end of the house warming party, you can read out some of the words.
This is a fun way to bring your guests together. People love to talk while doing an activity. Turn it into a fun house warming games by making it a competition for the best tasting pizza that everyone can vote on later.
You will need: Pre buy the bases and prepare toppings into small bowls (Ham, Cheese, Tomato, Red and green peppers etc). make sure you cater for guests that may be vegetarian or gluten free etc. Aprons for guests. Oven gloves to prevent hands getting burnt.
Why not share this page with family and friends. I will be adding more ideas as I grow my site. Your patience is appreciated.
What about RSS Feed? These are my new services, provided to help you keep up to date with the best House Warming Games around.

I used your switch the garter game idea for my sisters engagement party as well as the Donut and the carrot game. I have never laughed so much, it was hilerios. My sister didnt know what I had planned she loved it. Thanks.
What a lovely web site you have. I love the fact that you have lots of free games ideas. Im going to use your idea of having a candle ceremony and use your baby bingo game for my friends baby shower next month.
Thanks for the party ideas Katherine.We played your game "Find The Cat" at our housewarming party, only we have a pet rabbit called Bob. We took photos of him and hid them around the house. It really did liven up the party having everyone looking for Bobs pictures. It got everyone talking.
Thank you for your feedback, I really appreciate it. If you want to make a comment please feel free to contact me here

I know three languages, the third being a tribal tongue less than one percent of the world speaks. I like to run even though I’m not that good at it. I read a lot. And I once published a book I wrote, setting all the type by hand on an old-fashioned printing press. I’m an avid traveler and amateur photographer. I’m also a master spider-killer and possess the ability to stalk my prey without the squeamish screams of my former urban life.
I’m originally from Las Vegas, a city with more people than the entire country where I currently live. I now reside in a two-room concrete house with a tin roof and a ceiling made of rice bags. I eat with my hand out of a shared food bowl. I walk down a dirt road to fetch my water and carry it home in a bucket on my head. And yes, I even poop in a hole in the ground.
The Gambia, known as "The Smiling Coast of Africa," is the smallest country on the continent's mainland. Just 210 miles long and no more than 30 miles at its widest point, The Gambia carves out a space in Senegal on either side of the picturesque Gambia River.
Although many regional languages are spoken, the official language is English. A majority of the 1.8 million people are Muslim. About a third of the population lives below the international poverty line on less than US $1.25 per day.
I am so baffle by your ignorance of what is really going on. Let me learned ya, it all has to do with wiping Christianity from the world. Who suffer the most when we invaded Iraq the Christians did. Who will suffer most if we destroy Assad, the Christians will. Who will suffer if we attack Russia which is a Christian nation the Christians will. again Iran the fastest christian growing nation the Christian will. This war is against Christianity and nothing else, wake up people open your eyes. Amir is so blind, God called Syria the city of His joy why? I believe because there are a lot of Christians there. No Assad did not used chemicals on his people, he is not as stupid as you make him to be, forget your fake news reporters who report fake news, and gullible people like you believe their lies. Your prime minister is corrupt to the core, a mason in my opinion who want's nothing better than to establish a false Messiah, mark my words. I suggest president Donald Trump stay out of the middle east for good, because all who meddle there will God destroy. Israel is going to get his well deserved punishment that sodomite city of the world, who was suppose to give out the gospel, yet he is a disgrace to God. Trust me it all leads to destroy Christianity. Watch General Clark on destroying 7 nations in 5 years Iran is one of them.

Ravalli County Sheriff's officers at the Man Up Crusade booth at the fair. (Steve Fullerton, Townsquare Media)
Ravalli County Sheriff Steve Holton (third from the Left in photo) is helping spread awareness of domestic violence in the Bitterroot Valley. He and a whole host of other county and city officials and law enforcement have teamed up with SAFE (Supporters of Abuse Free Environments) to organize the Man Up Crusade Rodeo Friday night, August 31, at the Ravalli County Fair main arena. Sheriff Holton said some patrol cars will come into the arena about 7 p.m. with a group of supporters to make a brief presentation to the grandstand crowd. Then, the Rockin' RC NRA Rodeo will start, including a couple of Purple Bulls, where the prize money for an 8-second ride is in the thousands. If the rider wins, he gets half the pot. If the bull wins, all the money goes to SAFE. The Man Up group also has a booth under the grandstands at the main entrance, where you can check out a group of great raffle items.
Holton said that 50 percent of all law enforcement calls are related to domestic violence. "Man Up Crusade" stands for "Making Awareness Now Using Purple. The Hamilton event will be followed by more Man Up rodeos in Idaho. There is more information at the Man Up Crusade website and the SAFE website.
It`s monday, always a busy day and am here with another post for ya all. I was inspired my sis coat and I just love the flow it has to it. I really like cream color and during winter it just fits so well. I like to blend the look together by avoiding black shoes and instead go for brown just to add some intensity and avoid horrible contrast.
This is just an outfit to church and I really love the simplicity. Avoid being distracted by too much accesories and stuffs. Just love staying simple.
Girl where have you been, I feel like I haven't seen a new post from you in forever! Hope all is well and school isn't taking over too much hahah. Loving this outfit, the coat is fab, totally something I'd see Victoria Becks rocking.x

My name is Maggie. Welcome to my little corner filled with my randomness, bits of my photography and display of my fashion sense.You can also count on me to share everything I know about makeup with you. Make yourself comfortable and read :)
FRÍ, adj. = fráls, free, released, vacant, used in a less noble sense than frjáls, q.v.; frí is foreign, but freq. in mod. writers :-- used as adv. freely, truly, in mod. poets, Pass. 7. 12, 18. 9, 19. 8, 38. 5.
FRJÁ, ð, [Ulf. renders GREEK and GREEK by frijon, and GREEK by frjaþva; akin to friðr, friðill; in Icel. this word has almost entirely disappeared, except in the part. frændi, which is found also in Engl. friend, Germ. freund: frjá has thus met with the same fate as its antagonist fjá (to hate); both have been lost as verbs, while the participles of each, fjándi and frændi, fiend and friend, remain :-- vrijen, to woo, still remains in Dutch; and the mod. High Germ. freien and Dan. frie are borrowed from Low Germ.] :-- to pet, an GREEK in Mkv. 5, -- annars barn er sem úlf at frjá, to pet another man's bairn is like petting a wolf, i.e. he will never return your love. The passage Ls. 19 is obscure and probably corrupt.

Plant scientists with very different career paths shared their experience with the young audience. This was a huge success with a record turnout. WELL DONE!!

Potential Difference was a collaboration between Karen Halliday (Director, scientist), Meriem El Karoui (scientist), MELTING SNOW: Hamer Dodds (artist) and Graham Russell (graphic designer); Heshani Sothiraj Eddleston (photographer).

New models of private jets come out every year, but it’s only ever so often that a jet is released that is truly innovative. The Learjet 45 is one of the rare jets to seamlessly integrate new technology with a tested and successful older design. Its speed and economy are to be expected – being a Learjet – but its remaining features combine to create a high-quality private jet. The Learjet 45’s cabin holds eight seats (usually in a double club layout) with plenty of room to swivel, recline, and track. The cabin’s length and width are 19.8 inches and 5.1 inches, respectively. Don’t be misled by these measurements; the interior of the Learjet 45 was designed to offer the most usable passenger space possible so that the passengers do not feel claustrophobic. Other fine points of the cabin’s design make it functional and comfortable, from work tables that fold down from the walls to an extra pressure relief port on the door for added passenger safety. The noise level in the cabin never exceeds 72 dB, and a two-zone temperature control system ensures that both the cabin and the cockpit are kept comfortable. An external compartment provides 50 cubic feet of baggage space with an additional 15 cubic feet of storage in the interior. The Learjet 45 can fly 1,800 nautical miles nonstop and can cruise at 465 knots

The "Touhou Special" that I'm making for Raymu now has one character done. You may look forward to 4000 frames of Reisen humping you. And 1000 frames of something extra.
The entire project follows a similar format with all the girls in it. It won't be perfect, but considering this is the first long-term motion I'm making... I think it will exceed expectations.
I'm sure everyone remembers me talking about this huge project from way back. Well, a few problems. A couple of which I wasn't aware of back then.
First: I lost all the work, not intentionally. When my Computer had to be formatted recently, I wasn't able to back up the work I had done.
Second: It was going to be really, really long. I was aiming for fifteen minutes! Which brings me to the third point...
Third: The size was going to be massive, even with the new file type I discovered. The almost two minute long Reimu POV video I did, for example. Took several hours to upload! A fifteen minute video probably would have taken days, and that's not taking into account that the internet may or may not be cooperative for all that time. If it goes down in the middle of uploading... Pretty much screwed for that process.
Onto brighter news! I am still working on the Alice POV series, but work has kinda slowed down. I've been awake when my Brother is here [and when we're RPing], which leaves little time to work on such projects because I'm not alone and/or I love RPing. MMD is strictly a side-hobby, though an enjoyable one.
That said, I did some experimenting and I think I can do the third part just fine. Though I need to pace it properly so it doesn't look like you two are running rather than walking and cuddling.
To be honest though, you really weren't missing too much. It was just several minutes of repeat frames. Once the Alice POV series is done... Well, I might try a cut down, much more polished up version, but we'll see, for now, I want to get the Alice series done.
And this one, I have the work I plan to do written down, so even if I have to start from scratch, I'll know what I have to do and what I've already done. One way or another, it will get done. I'm just not sure when. xD
Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin, a Reform Judaism leader who founded and guided Stephen Wise Temple from modest beginnings to one of the world’s largest Reform congregations, died Friday evening (Jan. 26) at his home in Palm Springs, CA, surrounded by his family. He died of natural causes at 97.
Born and raised in Brooklyn (New York), the son of a respected scholar and ardent Zionist, he moved to Los Angeles in 1954 to establish the California branch of Hebrew Union College and served as the 11-state regional director of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
In 1964, he and a nucleus of 35 families founded Stephen Wise Temple on a striking 18-acre mountain site situated between the city’s two largest Jewish population centers, the Westside and San Fernando Valley.
To prepare the site, contractors literally had to move a mountain by lowering its height, Zeldin told the Journal in a 2004 interview. “We had no place for the dirt, so I invited the University of Judaism (now American Jewish University), which was then on Sunset Blvd, to buy the property next door. And we pushed a million cubic yards of dirt into the hole to make it a leveled piece of property.”
As his lasting legacy, Zeldin left a thriving congregation and school system, now numbering some 4,800 members and students. The congregation is guided by five rabbis and two cantors.
The impact of his personality and organizing skill ranged well beyond the Jewish community and the Los Angeles area. Close friends, including former California governor Gray Davis, described Zeldin as combining the abilities of a committed educator, hard-driving business executive and nonpareil persuader, who believed that a synagogue had to serve its members from pre-birth to post-death.
After meeting Zeldin in 1981, Davis, though a Catholic, was so taken by the rabbi’s personality that he attended High Holiday services at Stephen Wise Temple for 34 straight years.
Stephen Wise Senior Rabbi Yoshi Zweiback observed, “I was amazed and inspired by Rabbi Zeldin’s impact on the lives of so many members of our community. His commitment to and love for his congregation and his deep passion for finding creative ways to inspire in them a love of Judaism, Jewish community and Israel filled me with awe. What he did for our congregation, for the Los Angeles community, and, more broadly, for the Jewish people, was truly extraordinary.”
One of Zeldin’s closest collaborators for half a century was Metuka Benjamin, now president of the Milken Community Schools, who joined the rabbi in establishing an extensive day school system in a Reform setting, consisting of a pre-school, elementary school and community high school.
In an extended interview, Benjamin described Zeldin as possessing “an iron fist in a silk glove. He was, in effect, the head of a corporation as well as a prodigious fundraiser – nobody ever said no to him.”
He was also a hands-on boss, from always picking up stray pieces of trash on campus to driving a bus to the temple’s camp.
From the beginning, Zeldin emphasized that schools were on the frontlines of Jewish continuity and at Stephen Wise, he said, “We built the school before we built the temple.”
Zeldin was a committed Zionist, a friend of Israeli prime ministers and other leaders, who enjoyed impressing Israeli visitors by the Jewish knowledge and fluent Hebrew of his students.
Among the many financial patrons recruited by Zeldin, none played a larger role than Lowell Milken, co-founder and chairman of the Milken Family Foundation.
In an interview, Milken described the rabbi as “The most transforming individual I have met in my lifetime…He had the ability to make others share in his vision and thus transform vision into reality.
“He was great at lightening your wallet but in such a way that in the end you considered it an honor.”
As a lay leader at Stephen Wise Temple, business executive David Smith was closely involved in bringing its educational goal to fruition.
“Rabbi Zeldin always had a clear picture where he wanted to go,” Smith said. “Some people complained that he didn’t listen to what they were saying. However, he did listen, though he was never sidetracked from where he was going.”
One piece of advice Zeldin passed on to Smith was “Never call for a vote unless you know the outcome…The board (of directors) has only one decision to make, whether to keep me or to fire me.”
Zeldin transferred his acumen to his champion-level chess game (“I try to think three moves ahead,” he used to say) and his vigor and enthusiasm to the golf course.
Friends on a first-name basis with Zeldin always addressed his as “Shy,” derived from Yeshayahu, the Hebrew name for Isaiah, and frequently shortened to the nickname Shy. From that it followed that insiders referred to the temple’s hilltop location as “Mount Shynai,” as a tribute to its founding rabbi.
Zeldin retired as senior rabbi at Stephen Wise Temple in 1990, but remained actively involved with the congregation throughout his life.
Services will be held Monday (Jan. 29) at 11 a.m. at Stephen Wise Temple, with Rabbi Eli Herscher, who served as Zeldin’s immediate successor as Wise Temple’s senior rabbi, will deliver a eulogy. Interment will be at Eden Memorial Park.
Zeldin is survived by his children Joel Zeldin (Karen) and Michael Zeldin (Terry); brother Bernard Zeldin; five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
In lieu of flowers, mourners may wish to make donations to Stephen Wise Temple and Schools to establish the Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin Rabbinic Chair. Or to Hebrew Union College, to establish a scholarship fund in his name.
Are you missing the homemade pita bread of your childhood? The chicken kebabs spiced with fresh tahini or the deep fried falafel soaked in amba sauce? Bibi’s Kitchen, a new kosher food truck in Encino, promises to bring back these childhood memories with its traditional Mediterranean food.
Shauli Eliyahu opened the truck about five weeks ago and named it after his girlfriend, Jasmine Bibi, who told the Journal that Eliyahu started it it because “he loves to make people happy with his food.”
The menu boasts colorful flavors in its sabich, malabi, and freshly made challah.Out of all the menu options, Bibi recommends the signature kebab without hesitation. (“A Balanced Diet is a Kebab in each hand,” reads one of the truck’s Instagram posts.)
The restaurant’s sole Yelp reviewer rated it five stars and reemphasized its homey feel by commenting “fantastic service! Feels like you just walked into your uncles kitchen.”
Bibi’s Kitchen is at the intersection of Zelzah Avenue and Ventura Boulevard in Encino (look for the yellow and black food truck) and is open from 10 a.m.- 7 p.m. every day, except Saturday.
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com | Yesterday was the anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that left 149 men and women  most of them federal workers  and 19 children dead. As is his habit, former President Bill Clinton used the occasion to bash his critics.
In a New York Times opinion piece, "What We Learned in Oklahoma City," Clinton placed the blame on Americans who have advocated smaller government. The terrorists  bomber Timothy McVeigh and his accomplices  who targeted the Murrah Federal Building, he wrote, "took to the ultimate extreme an idea advocated in the months and years before the bombing by an increasingly vocal minority: the belief that the greatest threat to American freedom is our government, and that public servants do not protect our freedoms, but abuse them."
When a former president seizes such a tragedy for partisan purposes, it is no wonder a new Pew Research poll found that a modest 22 percent of voters say they trust Washington to do the right thing most of the time.
Clinton wrote that while criticism is "part of the lifeblood of democracy ... we should remember that there is a big difference between criticizing a policy or a politician and demonizing the government that guarantees our freedom and public servants who enforce our laws."
What I want to know is: Other than the twisted McVeigh and company, who is not clear on this difference? Does Clinton think his all his critics are stupid, or is he playing stupid?
But wait, there's more. Clinton continued, "We must all assume responsibility for our words and actions before they enter a vast echo chamber and reach those both serious and delirious, connected and unhinged."
Think about that for a minute: If anyone were to cast blame for the Fort Hood shootings that left 13 dead, or any other attacks within American military bases, on the antiwar movement, then that assertion would be followed by howls of outrage, and deservedly so. It would be absurd to suggest that opposition to the war be misconstrued as promoting violence against U.S. troops.
Yet somehow arguing against President Obama's health care plan can be construed as practically an incitement to violence.
And it doesn't matter if you blamed cult leader David Koresh  not federal agents  for the violence that claimed more than 80 lives in Waco in 1993. Or that you urged the death penalty as the only fitting punishment for McVeigh. Somehow if you oppose the expansion of the federal government, you are responsible for the violence that you abhor.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations echoed Clinton in a press news release commemorating the Oklahoma City deaths that berated "experts," who initially blamed Muslim extremists for the bombing, then cited the need to "recognize that the same anti-government extremism that led to the attack is growing and is unfortunately moving toward the mainstream."
So what did Clinton learn from Oklahoma City? He learned that he could drive the wedge that divides the electorate even deeper  and in so doing, endear himself to the element of his party smitten with itself. But outside the Clinton echo chamber, it sounds like whimpering.
ONLY TWO THINGS can account for the president's extraordinary rise in popularity since his State of the Union address -- stupidity or cynicism.
Given Clinton's character -- as disclosed by a stream of revelations over the past six years from former bodyguards, a former business partner and an ex-FBI agent assigned to the White House during his administration, among others -- it takes a staggering degree of credulity (to make Pollyanna seem like a New York City homicide detective) to believe our president is the victim of a "vast right-wing conspiracy."
About this conservative cabal, it is a conspiracy so formidable and far-reaching (not to mention prescient) that it enticed a border-state governor to secure fraudulent bank loans for his real-estate investments, persuaded foreign agents to raise funds for the president's re-election campaign, slipped Spanish fly into Clinton's Big Macs and recruited a White House intern to play Lolita. The daughters of Beverly Hills oncologists are among the favorite tools of right-wing conspirators.
To accept the president's innocence, one must also believe that the natural responses to allegations of wrongdoing are panicked denial followed by deceit and stonewalling.
In Clinton's case, these desperate measures include attempts to delay Paula Jones' lawsuit until after he leaves office, the two-year hiatus of Hillary's Whitewater files and denying the existence of tapes of White House coffees with contributors until after the election.
Of course, the people who voted for Clinton will presumably believe anything. But that's less than a majority of the electorate. What of the others who contributed to his 73-percent approval rating in a Friday CBS News poll? Stupidity isn't a moral failing, cynicism is.
Is it possible that the American people no longer care if the nation's highest elected official is a serial adulterer, a sexual predator and a chronic liar?
For years, the media have instructed us that it is wrong to make moral judgments on the private lives of political figures, that we must seperate personal conduct from public performance, that since we are all flawed (an axiomatic concept), what we do behind closed doors has no bearing on our public lives.
This is a facet of the doctrine that sexual behavior has nothing to do with morality, a concept the left embraced in the 1960s and which it has applied (with devastating consequences) to everything from pre-marital sex and out-of-wedlock births to homosexuality.
For liberals, consensual sex is an unqualified good that can never result in pain, degradation, exploitation, betrayal or psychic harm. What a married elected official does with a woman young enough to be his daughter is none of our business, we are told.
Apparently, a significant segment of the American people have embraced this doctrine. The attitude is justified with the oft-repeated phrase that "they all do it" (they being previous occupants of the White House).
Really? Did Andrew Jackson, who fought duels to defend his wife's honor, "do it"? Did Abraham Lincoln, who for years struggled to maintain a marriage with an emotionally unstable woman, "do it"? Did Theodore Roosevelt, who agonized over remarriage as a betrayal of his dead wife, "do it"? Did Harry Truman -- who practically threw a young officer out of a car for offering to arrange female companionship for the then-vice president (during an overseas trip) -- "do it"?
It is true that we do not elect a president to be a paragon of virtue. We do not expect presidents to lead moral crusades, walk five miles through the snow to return pennies or pick the dying off the streets of Calcutta.
What we should expect is a modicum of decency -- that a president will have enough respect for his office not to comport himself like a drunken frat boy during spring break.
Americans have every right to demand that a president honor traditional morality (including marital vows) and defer to the sensibilities of the majority of the population, so that parents won't have to explain to their adolescent children why the leader of the free world behaves like a barnyard animal during mating season.
People get the leaders they deserve, leaders who live up or down to our expectations. In 1980 -- when the World War II generation, and the virtues they exemplified, still held sway -- we deserved Ronald Reagan. By 1992, when the '60s generation came into its own -- we deserved William Jefferson Clinton.
This leads to appalling speculation: If the nation's current moral drift continues, what will we deserve by the year 2000?

IntelliJ IDEA 9 (Maia) purports to support OSGi bundles... so I dug in the weekend to find out just what this means.
This blog posts provides a quick start guide for two things: 1) getting the IDEA 9 EAP to publish your library as an OSGi bundle, and 2) getting a second bundle published and running to test your library.
The IDEA 9 OSGi support is a port/conversion of the Osmorc plugin which was available in version 8. In general, the functionality seems stable but sparsely documented. I could find neither a discussion group nor documentation for Osmorc. A lot of the configuration was a process of trial and error. But it does all seem to work, and after investing a few hours it has started to seem straight-forward in hindsight. You'll have to judge for yourself how it compares to Eclipse (that's next on my list!). Osmorc tries to do a lot of auto-magic generation for you, and when I stepped outside the norm (like including Groovy as a test-only dependency) I was confronted with hard to fix failures. However, this may not be a fair criticism. For any serious project, you will want to write a bnd script, not simply use an IDE, and IDEA lets you use a bnd script to drive the OSGi configuration. So at points where the config wizard started to get difficult, I really should have stepped back and created a bnd script.
While Eclipse seems to be focused on creating a Plugin (ie Bundle) from scratch using a wizard, IDEA is more focused on including OSGi support on one of your existing libraries using an OSGi facet. There is no "Create OSGi Project" wizard. You simply need to add an OSGi facet to one of your projects. I find this approach more reasonable. But let's not get too far before describing the basics of publishing a bundle:
Download and install an OSGi SDK (not just the framework jar). I had trouble with Eclipse Equinox, but KnopplerFish worked just fine
The next step is to tell IDEA about your OSGi SDK. In Settings (Ctrl+Alt+S), go to OSGi->IDE Settings->Framework Definitions and add your framework:
Now tell IDEA to use the framework you just registered. In Settings (Ctrl+Alt+S), go to OSGi->Project Settings and select your framework in the dropdown:
Now let's publish your Java library as an OSGi bundle. In this example, I'm using my filter4osgi library that provides a nice API for LDAP style filters (shameless plug: I'll pay you for bug reports). This step will create the OSGi .jar file and required manifests.
A note about the OSGi facet... currently, you're not able to add more than one OSGi facet to a module. For me, this forced me to create a multi-module project in order to produce several OSGi bundles from the same codebase. This seems like a considerable limitation to me but maybe my projects are structured strangely.
The Manifest Generation tab allows you to specify the exported packages for the bundle. I needed to manually add the package I wanted to export, Osmorc did not seem to discover this for me. Again, using bnd is probably the best option here.
There are plenty of other options, but they aren't as important right now. And note, I didn't add an Activator, because my bundle is just a library.
To verify that you published your library correctly, rebuild the application. The jar file should be written to disk. The manifest file with the OSGi headers is pretty simple:
It worked! (Although I have no idea why there is a failure removing "fwdir", whatever that means). Alternately, you can load the jar file into any other container and interact with it that way. One feature that is missing is the ability to interact with the container from IDEA. You cannot issue the stop or uninstall commands. In fact, the only way I found to stop the container is with the big red Stop button. It would be better if you could issue text commands to the container. This doesn't seem like it would be difficult to add.
There are a few test utilities for OSGi, such as Pax Exam and the Knopflerfish Junit Support, but all I wanted to do was write a bundle that imported filter4osgi and made sure the classes were available. So I simply added a new module to my project called "filter4osgiIntegrationTest". To this I added the Knopflerfish framework.jar since I needed to create an Activator. Take note, the prior example of exposing a library as a bundle required zero design or runtime dependencies on any OSGi implementation.
Without adding the OSGi facet, I created a new Java class that implemented BundleActivator. IDEA flagged me with a missing facet error and asked if I'd like to create a facet, which I did. Nice!
The Manifest Generation tab was mostly filled in, but again I needed to hand edit the MANIFEST.MF data so that it imported the package from the original filter4osgi bundle and added the root '.' to the bundle classpath (otherwise there were ClassNotFound exceptions).
And now it's time to create the Run/Debug Configuration, which was probably the hardest step in all this. In the Run Config, I needed to specify that both the filter4osgi and filter4osgiIntegrationTest need to be started up, and that the filter4osgi must be started first. You do this in the Bundles tab, and ordering is done by indicating a Start Level:
Now, when I run the config, I should see that both bundles were started. And if I don't get a ClassNotFound error then I know that the filter4osgi exports lined up correctly with the filter4osgiIntegrationTest imports. Which they do:
All in all, the support was quite usable. I think starting with a bnd file would have made things easier for me, as well as if IDEA had let me interact directly with the container.Definitely looking forward to the official release!

[SNY Knicks] True to their word, Knicks reportedly haven’t reached out to Timberwolves about Jimmy Butler trade
The Knicks said they wouldn’t take shortcuts with their rebuild, despite the Timberwolves’ Jimmy Butler asking for a trade and listing them among his preferred destinations. And it seems they’re being true to their word.
Chris Bosh isn’t sure if he will play again, but he said he will give himself until the All-Star break to make that decision. But Bosh is sure of one thing. His former assistant coach David Fizdale is the real deal and should eventually recruit at least one superstar. Bosh, who has suffered from multiple…
The Knicks will likely have more problems than just at point guard this season, but coach David Fizdale was tinkering at that position Monday night. In the Knicks’ sobering 110-98 preseason loss to the Wizards, Frank Ntilikina made his first start this preseason and first start of his career at point guard to mixed results….
Knicks coach David Fizdale is falling for guard Ron Baker in the same way ex-Knick president Phil Jackson and former coach Jeff Hornacek once did. If there was doubt Baker had his 15-man roster spot sewn up, it may have been erased the moment he hit the deck for a loose ball in Brooklyn Wednesday….

Frank finally looked a little better on offense last night, but imo he’s still not a true PG. He can pass just fine, but he’s not aggressive enough consistently to create things by penetrating and breaking down the defense. Hopefully, he’ll still become a very valuable 2-way player as his confidence and skills improve, but finding the proper role and combination is going to be tricky given he’s not the typical SG either.
Frank in the Jason Kidd role from the 54-win team might be great in time. We just need a primary ballhandler next to him, whether that’s Burke, Trier, or someone not on the team yet.
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 10:27 am
It should be Burke this year and then someone else eventually with Burke moving to backup PG. I see Trier as eventually taking the 6th man job away from Hardaway (which is what THJ should be) unless he becomes more well rounded and becomes the starting SG.
Frank’s still only 20 years old – we should give him time. I continue to think he should start over Burke.
Re: the Yankees last night – just awful managing by Boone. 3-0, bases loaded, no outs. Game is not over. You desperately need a strikeout there. You have literally 5 closer-types between Chapman, Green, Betances, Britton, and Robertson, 4 of whom are elite strikeout pitchers who are used to coming into hairy situations, and one who is absolutely elite at getting ground balls (Britton, 74% ground ball rate this year) — a double play would’ve been nice there, no?!
Instead, you put in Lance Lynn, a crappy starter who is NOT used to coming in with men on base and is rocking a 1.526 WHIP and 4.4 walks per 9 this season. Surprise surprise, what happens. Then you’re down 7-0 and at THAT point you decide to burn Chad Green, who prob won’t be able to pitch tonight. WTF.
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 10:43 am
I’m all for giving Frank time. I haven’t changed my view on him having the potential to become a very good two-way player. However, he still doesn’t look like a PG to me. I think the fact that he’s growing and getting stronger is not going to help him develop the quickness and handle that he’s lacking now. He’s probably going to become something other than the traditional PG.
So many possessions with Frank as the PG involve him dribbling over midcourt, picking up his dribble around the 3 point line and passing to a teammate to his right or left. That puts absolutely no pressure on the defense or the guy defending Frank. Fiz needs to set up more plays with high screens at the start of the possession, but at a minimum Frank needs to put more pressure on his defender by keeping his dribble and going “downhill” instead of just a sideways pass. And maybe drawing a few fouls, which he rarely does.
As much as I want Frank to play a lot of PG this year I think out of the gate he might not be ready. I want him to start though so how about at SF but let him initiate the offense a decent amount. Then move Knox to PF which I think is an easier more forgiving position for him.
For years this blog posted grades for the players and coaches after every game and they were amazing. Insightful and hilarious. Then after the 54 win season they went away forever. And I’ve been sad ever since. The subtitle on this blog says “humor” and the grades brought a lot of the humor to this blog but were also really insightful.
And I think if there is a season to bring back the grades its this one. I mean we are chock full of “students” on this team. Knox, Mitchel, Frank, and I guess Trier are all potential young pieces who will be growing and learning and will maybe be a part of the future core of this team. Plus we have a new coach and we will have KP returning at some point. All I’m saying is that we have a team that deserves to be graded after the game. PLEASE BRING BACK THE GRADES!!!!!!!!!!!
Cavan and Silverman are gone, and although Mike and Brian are very capable writers (B.C. himself is a many-times published author), I don’t think we’re ever going to get the halcyon days of KB humor again. It was a special time.
@ 9 – I miss it so much. I’m a comedy writer myself and would take on the task but I don’t really have the time to do it. I rarely watch the games when they’re actually on and usually watch the replay later that night or the next day.
remember when Melo scored 60 or whatever it was, and Cavan wrote an article about the ecstasy of it, except for in his column, everyone was on ecstasy?
This is a really annoying trait. When Hornacek was the coach, he did that every possession, but Jack also did the same when he played, so my guess is that it was the way Hornacek wanted them to run the offense. But it’s still happening the same way in many possessions and it’s just so unproductive specially when the Knicks don’t really have wings who can create off the dribble very well.
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 11:28 am
I didn’t watch much, but it seems like he puts his hand in the air as if to signal a play and then makes the lateral pass.
Yeah, that’s why I always thought it was Hornacek’s system. It seemed like he was following the designed plays. The question is whether he had / has freedom to call the plays himself and I actively choosing those, or just following the coach gameplan.
I think Frank Ntilikina will settle into a role as an off guard who can play either the 1 or 2 depending on who is next to him. With Burke in the game, he’s a 2 and with Trier in the game he’s a 1. We just need to see Ntilikina really develop that 3 point shot this season and figure out how to get fouled on lay up attempts.
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 12:46 pm
Wilson Chandler never figured that out. Instead of trying to draw contact, he always tried to avoid it to get the shot off cleaner. The result was a tougher shot and no foul call.
I, for one, was less a fan of RS’s schtick than most, not on a jon abbey level (the stupidest warranted banning ever, he just wouldn’t let up!) but, hey, I never quite got Seinfeld either…but really liked Curb your Enthusiasm, go figure! I guess it’s a textural thing, like my brother-in-law who only likes certain shapes of pasta, or my kid who hates tomatoes but loves tomato sauce, ketchup and pico de gallo.
And while I almost never post at P&T, Seth Rosenthal’s stuff was the best. Joe Flynn is pretty good too, but Seth was in a class by himself.
RS was the best. I actually met him IRL in a somewhat cosmic coincidence, we were both watching the Knicks at a bar. I can understand finding his writing a little over the top, (I loved it), but I don’t think anyone could deny that he and Jim made this place really fun for a while.

Same thing happened to me, actually. We were both chain smoking between quarters of a Knicks game… I couldn’t even tell you when… for some reason I feel like it was 2008 but it could have been later. Anyway, he told me about this blog. He was selling me on it for ten minutes and I was “you had me at Knickerblogger.” Great name.

This has the makings of another Noah situation where we talk about merit but then have the veteran that would easily get minutes on a better team buried on the bench.
But yeah he’d be raking in those minutes if it weren’t for the media’s bias against Phil Jackson, or something.
Lee isn’t Noah-level cooked, but he’s been mediocre since, well, he began his career in the NBA. It’s no guarantee he can outproduce THJ/Dotson/Trier/whoever.
I also don’t think reading vague statements about merit literally makes sense because that would be a dumb way to distribute minutes on a team like the current version of the Knicks. So if they’re bullshitting about it, I’m happy.
Tuesday, ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Sarver “is leaning” toward hiring former player James Jones to take McDonough’s job. Jones was playing in the league as recently as two seasons ago
The Suns are one ponytailed, occasionally-nude aging center away from true contention. Somebody get James Jones on the phone for this one-time can’t-miss offer!

Noah was playing through injuries that required surgery in his last 2 seasons in Chicago, missed camp coming into NY his first season and then got hurt/PEDs, and was sent to Siberia last season. In the very brief period he was healthy AND FIT in NY he was our best C (albeit diminished from his peak).
I have no idea what he has left and how long it will last, but I’d be willing to bet that if can remain reasonably healthy he’ll still be able to rebound, make plays, and direct the defense from the C position better than a LOT backup Cs out there now for as long as it lasts. There’s a reason he wants to play even though he could theoretically hang out of the beach all day, smoke weed, and get paid. He wants to play and knows he’s still better than some of the dregs out there now. He’s not a desperate guy looking for a new contract.
Nah, but Tim Hardaway for Tyson Chandler straight up works under the cap and is within the intersection of dumb and not impossible.
Wait when was Noah good as a Knick? His defense was no longer elite and he was horrendous on offense
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 3:58 pm
If we don’t distribute minutes based on merit, why would anyone in their right mind want to play in NY?
What I have argued is that late in the season when you’ve already made your case to the league and “everyone” that’s not in playoff contention is also in tank mode, that’s when you can go away from merit and go into pure developmental mode. At that point everyone knows what’s going on and it won’t impact your ability to get a new contract. But if you do before then and go too far, that’s when you create friction in the locker room, turn what should be a difficult situation into an impossible one. piss off players and agents, and ensure that everyone thinks your team is really still a mental asylum.
This is supposed to be the recent history of a player who apparently deserves minutes on the basis of merit. Fascinating logic.
In all seriousness, sure it’s possible that Noah can put up some decent minutes on a better team than the Knicks. That doesn’t change the fact that it’s detrimental to a developing team to give minutes to a guy that has no future whatsoever here. Phil Jackson made a laughably idiotic mistake but that doesn’t mean we’re bound to let it dictate our decisions moving forward.
Is it really your opinion that we should play a 32 year old decaying corpse over, say, Mitchell Robinson because he might be slightly more productive than Robinson in Robinson’s rookie year? That would be a psychopathic way to manage a team.
The whole Noah thing irks me. I was against signing him but I do like Noah as a player a lot. He grew up in New York during the Riley Knicks era I loved and I think he plays with a little bit of that same edge and intensity and defensive savvy. He’s a little bit crazy in a good way too.
Total disaster for the Knicks of course but i would root for him to have a reasonable end to his career, peds and all.
See, here’s the thing. Smart teams don’t really run into this problem because they don’t employ morons like Phil Jackson who have no conception of the win curve.
Having said that, I have literally never heard any player or agent say they wanted to stay away from a team because that team wasn’t giving enough minutes to its mediocre veterans at the expense of its younger players. If anything, prospective players are increasingly looking for healthy development systems within teams.
Also, as DRed points out, in what world does Joakim Noah deserve minutes based on merit? He’s been injured, suspended, malcontented, and bad.
I wish that everyone here has someone in their life who loves them as unconditionally as Strat loves Courtney Lee’s shitty contract.

1. I think rebuilding a team should be about getting better, but it should be done with some logic in terms of cap space, age of players, development, and the careers of the players/agents you are dealing with. I do not like tanking except in some rare circumstances and even then for only 1 year.
3. I think the organization was asking for trouble when it added Kanter to a center corp that already included Hernangomez, Noah, and O’Quinn (not that I know what other options they had, but the ugly outcome for 2 of them was practically pre ordained).
4. I think you play players based on merit PERIOD and develop young players in the gym and in garbage time. When/if they earn significant minutes you play them. At the end of the season once you are eliminated the unwritten rules change. The veterans understand the story and no one’s career is impacted.
5. If you find yourself in the position where you are taking a completely different approach and need to jettison some veterans to get playing time for younger inferior players you want to develop, it should be done in a way that balances the interests of those players and the team. If there isn’t at least some balance to it and you treat people like they are an entry on a spreadsheet, that’s how others will treat you back. I’m not so sure that’s a very good idea long term. People notice how you treat others.
Stratomatic "Porzingis, Ntilikina, Knox & Robinson are going to lead us to the promised land October 9, 2018 at 4:24 pm
How are they going to handle this situation when he’s still more productive than some of the young players and they don’t seem to be able to move the contract the way they expected earlier when the cap was expected to grow faster and now the market is different?
There’s every reason to move him given we are now in perpetual tanking mode instead of tank for a year and start rebuilding via draft, trade, FA mode the way Phil planned (but admittedly erred with regard to Noah) .
Courtney Lee’s BPM last year was zero (which was an improvement on the previous year) and he’s injured without a timetable. I don’t think we need to worry about how we’re going to find minutes for the guy.

I think when your team sucks, you have no draft picks, some cap space, and are trying to build a team with picks, trades, and FAs, it’s OK to sign a couple of mediocre players as placeholders for that cap space and keep rolling it over until you get to the point where you can draft a couple of good players, make a good move or two, and start attracting better free agents.
The alternative is renting the cap space for picks. I’m OK with that too. However, there is no inherently greater value in picks than other assets. It all depends on what’s available. The Nets have done a lot of cap space renting but they still suck, still have some bad contracts, and have no guarantee they are going to draft anyone that can play with the picks they got.
I like picks too. But I think the idea is to compare the value of picks to the market for available players and try to take the more attractive route at that point in time. It doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you do it competently.
I have completely given up arguing with strato about this merit thing, as I think it’s completely pointless.
But I’ll just leave this here: the Lakers buried Luol Deng, a very respected veteran, outside of the bench even while he was allegedly 100% healthy. They signed LeBron James as a free agent the next summer.
I agree with Strat, this is a delicate situation. However mediocre he may be, Lee is a professional and he’s arguably the second best player on the team behind Enes Kanter. Even though he’s not in the team’s long term plans, it would be hard to justify benching him.
If Frank, Timmy, and Lee are all two guards this year, it’s going to be tricky to go with Frank over Lee if one is clearly outperforming the other. It won’t detract free agents from coming here, but it’s something that would need to be managed.
It would also be stupid to bench him because dumping his contract is one of the most important things we need to accomplish this summer.
The alternative is renting the cap space for picks. I’m OK with that too. However, there is no inherently greater value in picks than other assets.
Really? Picks, literally any picks, aren’t more valuable than one bad season from Derrick Williams/Arron Afflalo/Kevin Seraphin/Derrick Rose? C’mon dude. I’m sorry if my tone with you crosses the line sometimes but it truly feels like you actively refuse to take into account any ideas that might present Phil Jackson’s tenure as Knicks’ POBO in a bad light.
There is no world in which the singular seasons we got from those players are more valuable than a pick. Any pick. 60th pick. Whatever. Cap space is an asset that can be used to put your team in a better position for the future. If you max out your cap space while failing to do that AND failing to be a good team in the present, you’ve wasted the asset of cap space.
As to your post in #35, what you’re essentially saying is that it is never justified to give a young player minutes over a veteran who might presently be a little more productive until late in the season. This is logic that would lead to some patently absurd situations if applied historically (e.g. Kirk Hinrich getting more minutes than #1 overall pick and rookie Derrick Rose on the 2008-2009 Bulls). I also can’t get past your conviction that Joakim Noah would absolutely be more productive than Kanter or Robinson or whoever. Maybe he would be, maybe he wouldn’t be but we don’t know because he’s been injured or trying to fight coaches his entire time here.
@35 I have to respectfully disagree with points 3 and 4. As for point #3: Kanter was/is good value for a clear-in-decline Melo; maybe not the value we desire most, but definitely value. It led to a glut at C, sure. But I’d rather the team figure out that issue than figure out how to continue to get younger/better with an aging Melo on the roster.
For point #4: basketball has the smallest roster (and lineup) of the major sports. It is a sport where one/the right talented player can potentially have a huge effect on the fortunes of a franchise. Merit should have its place, but not at the expense of playing the best talent.
But I think the idea is to compare the value of picks to the market for available players and try to take the more attractive route at that point in time. It doesn’t matter which way you go as long as you do it competently.
It doesn’t matter if picks are over valued around the league if your team sucks and is desperate for talent on cost controlled contracts. Your market analysis tends to gloss over structural factors such as the win curve, the small number of teams, the huge influence of the CBA, the limited player pool, ect. When teams are as bad as the Knicks have been it doesn’t matter what the market is for picks. They can’t afford to trade them. It doesn’t matter that you have a moral objection to tanking, or want to always play the best players. Continuing to pursue suboptimal strategies because ‘it can work, if x y z’ isn’t a rational or enlightened choice. The Knicks are too poor to gamble. They have to make safe choices.
Ron Baker is on pace to smash all time scoring efficiency records and y’all are talking about draft picks?
“I wish that everyone here has someone in their life who loves them as unconditionally as Strat loves Courtney Lee’s shitty contract.”
“That cap space is an asset that we needed to use, or we’d lose it for nothing. And those contracts become assets we can use in future deals.”
[Knicks desperate to shed cap space, consider stretching $36M of Noah’s contract, can’t find anyone to take Courtney Lee’s remaining $25M]
“Those contracts are valuable placeholders, even if no one wants them. Imagine how hard it would be to get a marquee free agent without them!”
This convo reminds me of a recent article about whether an NFL team who has a quality QB on a rookie contract should trade that QB when they’re on their final year of that contract for the chance to draft another 1st round QB. The argument is that QBs on rookie deals allow the team to spend heavily elsewhere to boost the overall team talent level. Not too different from the argument that the Knicks should pursue draft picks to acquire young upper-tier talent on cost controlled deals.
Wouldn’t it be a game-changer if the NFL decided to have a soft-cap for QB contracts? Meaning that they can go over the cap to sign (or re-up) a franchise QB without having to dump high salaries of other positions.
Prioritizing acquiring cost-controlled talent in order to develop them because your team has jack shit seems slightly different from rotating rookies to save cap space on an already developed team.
You know, I was thinking about this site and the opportunity it represents to air out many long-standing grievances and hopes that we, as Knicks fans, hold regarding our team and its direction. But then it dawned on me that all of this is meaningless in the face of the fact that preeminent global climate change experts believe that we only have 12 years to basically maintain our planet’s moderate temperature levels and two of those years, at minimum, will be with Donald Trump at the helm of the world’s largest per capita greenhouse gas emitting nation. How would anyone us be able to even rationalize our own existence on this planet if the best we can say to future generations is that we spent our hours discussing the merits of Courtney Lee’s contract in the face of imminent catastrophe that will most probably result in the extinction of our species?

I finally watched the recent Washington pre-season game where Ntilikina started. I thought he did better than I expected as a starting point guard. He did take shots and mostly did not pass them up in situations where he should have taken them. There were some possessions as described above where he came down the floor, Washington gave him space and he didn’t do anything with the space, so the overall possession went nowhere. But there were fewer such occasions than in his games last year. When he got in foul trouble and Burke came in, there were clearly troubles defending Washington’s guards. We did lose to Washington and his plus minus probably wasn’t great, but I attribute that to not having either Kanter or Robinson to create enough of a threat inside.
Overall, in the three games I’ve watched of preseason, I think he is better than last year. I’ve always thought and posted here before, that he won’t really be effective as a point guard until an0ther year. That is,, I don’t expect him to suddenly attract notice around the league as a good guard until the 2019-2020 season. He seems on track for that. And the Washington game suggests to me that he may start for the Knicks against certain teams where the defensive matchups call for it. So I wouldn’t anoint Burke our starting point guard this year just yet.
I agree, the NBA should organize schedules to minimize plane flights. Wait, don’t they already do that?
You should start a campaign to get MSG to compost and recycle more. I’d sign a petition, write a letter.
You know that about 80% of this site’s posters thinks that climate change is both real and incredibly important, and the other 20% are people who’d tell you that the Earth is flat if they heard it on Fox News. You know exactly what you’re doing, and you’re doing it because you’ve worn out your welcome with most of the board’s regulars. Just stop.
Untrue. I came to talk. I’ve been thinking lately. About you and me and everybody. About what’s going to happen to all of us, in the end. We’re going to kill ourselves, aren’t we? Perhaps we’ll kill the Earth. Perhaps it will kill us. Perhaps sooner. Perhaps later. I just wanted you to know that I’d made a genuine attempt to talk things over and avert that outcome. Just once. Are you listening to me? It’s life and death I’m discussing here. Maybe our death… maybe our children. I don’t fully understand why ours should be such a suicidal species, but I don’t want our extinction on my… hands…
I mean, if we’re going to discuss only the pressing matters of our daily lives there would be no point for sites like this ever.
Occupying oneself with the urgent things in the world is necessary, but having ways to escape the harsh realities is also necessary. I’m discussing stratomatic’s theories on merit-based team building while my country almost elected straight away the most fascist, homophobic presidential representative ever, a worse Trump, and will probably elect him anyway in a couple of weeks.

We often discuss non-basketball topics here. I see nothing wrong with Ntilikilla commenting on global warming. I am a board regular and I welcome his post.
What shocks me about this recent report is that so many people say they are shocked by it. What did they expect? The world has made only half-hearted efforts to address global warming and somehow people expect it will be better than predicted? They seem to think: well, either it will match the scientists predictions, or it might not be as bad as they say. Scientific projections don’t work like that. If you estimate a number, like degrees of global warming, there is just as much chance that you are off on the low side as that you are off on the high side. And so far, every year, the actual warming has proven worse than predicted. And that’s not because the scientists were wrong. It’s because of things like China’s standard of living improving faster than expected. As far as I am concerned, those people who want to bring back coal want to destroy the world. And they may get their wish.

I sympathize. People should be furious about the climate changing, but I hope very much the Yankees make a comeback and give you reason to sleep well.
Occupying oneself with the urgent things in the world is necessary, but having ways to escape the harsh realities is also necessary.
We have 12 years. History is littered with examples where current generations have looked in the past and wondered why more wasn’t done. Why people passively accepted their imminent catastrophe without a fight. And I can’t shake feeling that all of this – from the Knicks to the Kardashians – exist to make us escape the harsh reality we know is coming but can’t be bothered to change.
I really don’t want to troll. But after reading the UN climate report that was just released I came to grips with the reality of my situation and the situation of everything I love in this world – and I can’t understand why people aren’t freaking out on the streets about it.
It’s funny how the issue of inconvenient statistical models vs. optimism we see here regarding Knicks players replicates itself with the issue of human made climate change. The UN climate change panel is team negativism and everyone else who hopes it won’t be that bad is team optimism.
Knick fan not in NJ who thinks our rookies will lead us to a lousy lottery pick in 2019 October 9, 2018 at 10:59 pm
Hoping for the best seems almost universal. But, like some posters on this board in reference to the Knicks, I would call the UN report team reality, not team negativism.
We’re all freaking out, dude. I also might be in a torture chamber next year in a so-called democratic country.
It’s just that freaking out about this stuff and trying to force down people’s throat how they should act towards it often generates the exact opposite reaction that you want. You do your part and work towards what you think it’s the best possibility and you go with it.
I’ve been an activist for the past 8 or so years of my life. If you let the freak out part consume every other aspect of your life you already lost the fight.
I tend to stay away from the news, thanks for the heads up on this report…I’ll make sure to check it out…
why would god create a creature such as us, I’m not sure…hard to imagine it was for the betterment of our ecosystem…
I thought Sanchez actually redeemed himself to an extent in the playoffs. A few big hits and his ABs seemed stronger.
The person that writes the climate report for Trump should be the same dude that wrote the “stop trading your draft picks” memo to Dolan. That guy is a savant at conveying basic information to the Powerfully Inept.
And I can’t shake feeling that all of this – from the Knicks to the Kardashians – exist to make us escape the harsh reality we know is coming but can’t be bothered to change.
It’s like when your nephew comes back for thanksgiving after his first semester at college and he can’t understand how anyone can eat bc he just learned about the prison industrial complex.
Knick fan not in NJ who thinks our rookies will lead us to a lousy lottery pick in 2019 October 10, 2018 at 10:23 am
Hubert, people do feel they can ignore global warming. even when their nephews are worried, But unlike the prison industrial complex, it’s not something that will stay out of sight and be irrelevant to most people. The world is going to be much more dangerous, more expensive and more difficult for everyone. As a people, we are acting like the frog in a pot of cold water put on the stove. By the time the frog notices the water is too hot, he is no longer capable of jumping out and saving himself.
I’ll spell it out for you: we’re all going to die, and everything around us exists to take our minds off that inevitability.
Now please let us enjoy some Knicks talk so I can stop thinking about the mortality of me and my species.
My apologies, I wanted to edit this to “young person” but the edit time ran out. I didn’t mean to connote the insult that comes with calling someone a child.

I went in to the game data and manually added extra animation frames haha - if you download the game file and look inside you should be able to see it :)
love this - especially the "tutorial kid" dialogue! someday I'll get those turnips to grow... I just know it
nice work! very atmospheric, and good use of empty space for pacing of both the words and the environment :)
nice work! I like the way it sort of makes you feel like restarting the game is still part of the game :)
I've encountered a few issues though; let me know if you have any thoughts on how to solve them! (I'm on Mac btw)
1. Just want to note that the symlink error is still a problem for me. I couldn't launch the generated .app file at all at first. I went back to version 0.21.6 of nwjs and that seemed to fix that.
2. My icon files aren't being associated with the app. It just has a generic icon. I've created the icons in the 3 formats and named them all appIcon.* but it seems as though they aren't being picked up?
3. When I load the generated .app, it starts as a blank white window. I have to right click and "reload app" before it will display the web page. An odd detail is that I can hover around the blank white page and see the tooltips for the html elements.. they just aren't visible.
this was great! love the "retry" structure and also how you focused each room down to just a few visual elements that were really striking
this is really good! I like the way the different color palettes seem to help express the feelings of the protagonist as you navigate different spaces
wish I could properly express how much I loved this piece.. it has such a strong sense of melancholy and history

Many schools use service-learning on their campus to enhance their classroom content. According to Learn and Serve Clearinghouse, Service-learning is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service with instruction and reflection to enrich the learning experience, teach civic responsibility and strengthen communities. There are several projects that can be implemented on the high school campus that can promote service-learning. At Raymond S. Kellis High School in Glendale, Arizona, students have undertaken projects in service-learning to help feed the less fortunate in their communities, and to install solar panels in the school's student-run store.

Here is the second mattress protector I have purchased from this business. I'm more than happy with it. The worth is honest and as described in the description, it does not Have got a crinkly come to feel or audio like some mattress addresses do (visualize a reasonable vinyl shower curtain).

Both a magnitude and a direction must be specified for a vector quantity, in contrast to a scalar quantity which can be quantified with just a number. Any number of vector quantities of the same type (i.e., same units) can be combined by basic vector operations.
Caution! This is a large HTML document. You need to wait for it to load completely in order for all the links above to operate. Index
Adding two vectors A and B graphically can be visualized like two successive walks, with the vector sum being the vector distance from the beginning to the end point. Representing the vectors by arrows drawn to scale, the beginning of vector B is placed at the end of vector A. The vector sum R can be drawn as the vector from the beginning to the end point.
The process can be done mathematically by finding the components of A and B, combining to form the components of R, and then converting to polar form.
Finding the components of vectors for vector addition involves forming a right triangle from each vector and using the standard triangle trigonometry.
After finding the components for the vectors A and B, and combining them to find the components of the resultant vector R, the result can be put in polar form by
Some caution should be exercised in evaluating the angle with a calculator because of ambiguities in the arctangent on calculators.
After finding the components for the vectors A and B, these components may be just simply added to find the components of the resultant vector R.
The components fully specify the resultant of the vector addition, but it is often desirable to put the resultant in polar form.
Vectors are resolved into components by use of the triangle trig relationships. You may change the length or angle of the polar form of the vector, and the components will be calculated below.
The input to the boxes for units is arbitrary; they serve to emphasize that the process of vector addition is independent of the units of the vector.
If the components of a vector are known, then its magnitude and direction can be calculated with the use of the Pythagorean relationship and triangle trig. This is called the polar form of the vector.
Vector addition involves finding vector components, adding them and finding the polar form of the resultant.

Beats Music brought us in to prepare their customer-facing site for the launch of their new music service. We worked out of their office and stayed close to their design team in order to build an image-heavy, fully responsive site by their launch deadline.
Beats was preparing for a launch and wanted some last minute front-end help to meet their deadline. Working closely with their design team, we helped build out their customer-facing material and helped to create description of the service, pricing, team, and corporate information.
The app was written with node.js and is totally responsive front end design. This project involved retina assets and other bells and whistles, going above the usual call to make a highly refined site in time for big time sensitive launch.
The target for the app release was iPhone, Android, and Windows phones, so we made sure the site delivered well on each of those experiences and included device detection.
Our developers sat with the Beats team in their office. We had a good collaborative experience with their designers, leading to quick turnaround, short iteration, and implementing some cutting edge technology on their site. In short, a small team on a short timeline was able to produce very high quality front-end experience.
To optimize resource use of the site, we did some work around making sure everything performed well on the client's load balancers.
We also implemented some cool troubleshooting tools like Android debuggers to make sure the site worked well across various devices.
Part of preparing for this launch meant getting their website ready for over a million users following a Super Bowl ad.
Getting a very image heavy website optimized for mobile devices presented some fun layout and performance challenges that we solved using some CSS3 and PJAX techniques.
We worked with other teams closely and based entirely in the Beats office. This helped us execute really quickly while speaking the same language as the design team.

For a man fettered with handcuffs, leg-irons, and chains to free himself in less time than it has taken, to fasten him has long been so mystifying a performance that many people have acquired the impression that it bordered on the supernatural. The secret is, however, like many of the best tricks ever invented, in reality a surprisingly simple one. In the first place, it must be remembered that handcuffs such as are used by modern policemen are constructed with spring-locks, which are fastened or released by means of a key, or some article which answers the same purpose, which pulls back the spring. Without the aid of such a key it is impossible for any human being to free him- self from the regulation handcuffs employed by the police. And herein lies the whole secret-the performer has a key, or rather several keys. All his ingenuity is exercised in concealing these bout his person, or inside the cabinet to which he retires to release himself after being, to all appearance, helplessly secured.
Some of these keys are concealed in the framework of the cabinet, which is generally constructed of piping, having additional pieces which appear to be essential portions of the framework, but which in reality are only intended to hold the keys. Other keys the performer keeps disposed about his person in sundry small pockets especially made for the purpose, and so arranged that he is able to place his hand upon some one or other of them in whatever position he may be. The best places for concealment are-first, a pocket between the knees, to permit the key to be reached when the performer is fastened in a crouched position; secondly, a pocket about six inches up inside the leg of the trousers; thirdly, a key carried in the hip-pocket of the trousers, for use when pinioned with the arms behind the back; and, finally, a small pocket inside the top of the waistcoat, or wherever it may be found convenient.
Let us now turn to the photographs, which have been especially taken for this article, and which render the whole proceeding very clear. In Fig. 1 the performer is fastened with six pairs of hand cuffs. In such a position it seems impossible that he can free himself; but by putting his hands over his head and down his coat-collar he has caught the end of a silk handkerchief thrust into the breast of his waistcoat, to which a key is attached.
Fig. 2 shows the handkerchief and key drawn to the front; while Fig. 3 shows the key inserted in the lock.
Fig. 4 shows the method employed when the position is such that it is impossible, owing to the awkwardness of the attitude, to pull the lock back. A piece of violin string is made into a loop and kept inside the cabinet. When it is impossible to draw the key, and with it the lock-spring, with the fingers, the loop is put over the key, the heel of the boot placed in the other, end of the loop, and the lock is then easily drawn back. After one, pair has been opened the others follow as a matter of course. Figs. 5 and 6 show another position, the key this time being obtained from the waistcoat.
Fig. 7 shows one of the most difficult positions in which it is possible to be placed. The silk handkerchief shown is just peeping from the waistcoat, and is brought out by aid of the tongue, it being possible to draw out a good silk by licking it.
In Fig. 8 the performer has rolled over and obtained a good hold of the handkerchief, which, by a quick jerk of the head, he throws over his back, and eventually gets hold of it with his hands, as shown in Fig. 9.
If the key falls to the floor he rolls over and picks it up, the rattle of the handcuffs hiding the sound of the falling key. His next movement is to free his hands from his feet, which he does in the manner already described. The key for this position can also be obtained from the leg of the trousers.
Fig. 10 shows the implements of torture and the condition of the performer's wrists after an exhibition. The special keys are split with a saw about half an inch down, to allow for variation in the sizes of various locks (Fig. 11). It should be understood that an expert, when about to give a performance, inquires what position it is intended to place him in. He then causes, as an introduction. a few pairs of his own handcuffs to be placed on his wrists, and while freeing himself from these in his cabinet he arranges his keys to suit the position in which he will next be placed. Other implements besides the keys are also used: a piece of bent wire is often quite sufficient. Most experts are also conjurers, and "palm" the key, especially in the case of nude test, when they are stripped and locked up in a cell; or they make use of a concealing key, which is made telescopic, the handle being constructed to close down the side of the key, and the whole being fixed under the toes by a piece of shoemaker's wax and detached when inside the cell.
Although, when the secret is explained, it seems very easy to accomplish it must be understood that it is necessary for a successful performer to possess very hard, strong wrists and abundance of finger strength and to be a man of some resource. It is to fasten him. He obtained some very small gold almost impossible for any person to fasten an expert securely unless he himself understands the secret of the method of, escape, and even then may not be successful. On one occasion a performer underwent a severe test by a person who understood the secret, and therefore did not any keys whatever, but by very ingenious method overcame the efforts of the gentleman in question to fasten him. He obtained some very small gold-filled wire and made it into the form of a wire ring, which was partly covered by a broad gold one to which the wire ring was attached. Thus prepared he underwent the test, unwrapping the wire ring when in the cabinet. Needless to state, in a very short time he was free.
Handcuffs are sometimes brought to fetter the performer with the locks plugged or otherwise tampered with. But it is the performer's own fault if he is trapped. It is a very easy matter to tamper with the locks-a few lead pellets dropped down the barrel will effectually prevent the lock from being drawn. This method has often been attempted, but not successfully.
Now that the methods have been explained and illustrated, it will be very easily perceived that there is nothing supernatural about the secret of handcuff manipulation.

Choosing a career is a lot more complicated than deciding what to have for dinner or where to go on vacation. Whether you’ve just begun thinking about veterinary medicine as a career or it’s been a lifelong dream, you probably have some questions about how to get there and what you may have to give up along the way.
We’ve posted some of the most common questions about becoming a veterinarian and their answers here, but please add your voice and send us your questions. Chances are, if you’re wondering about something, someone else is too.
Most veterinarians in the U.S. work in private practice. While veterinarians are licensed to care for a wide variety of animals (dogs, cats, horses, farm animals, exotics, etc.), most limit their practice to certain types of animals or medical specialties. Currently, the majority of veterinarians in the U.S. provide medical care for pets such as dogs and cats.
Veterinarians also work in teaching, research, private industry, and government, expanding scientific knowledge and finding solutions to human and animal health problems. Most organizations housing or using animals utilize veterinary services, including: zoos, aquatic animal parks, meat production and inspection, the space program, wildlife management, racetracks, circuses, animal shelters, the military, and more.
Working and talking with veterinarians, veterinary students, and veterinary technicians and staff is the best way to get a realistic picture of the profession. Veterinary medicine is a big commitment, both academically and personally. A prospective veterinarian should be a good student with strong science, math and communication skills.
A veterinarian must have compassion for both animals and people, enjoy working with people, and possess strong communication skills because every animal comes with a human. Veterinarians must be willing to advise clients on decisions that will have significant financial and emotional impact.
While veterinary medicine can be richly rewarding, a veterinarian's day is not filled solely with adorable animals. It is important to develop a realistic picture of the profession before choosing this career. Failure to understand the demands and challenges of the profession can lead to dissatisfaction. Veterinarians must handle failure, loss, grieving and angry clients, and sometimes animals that have been neglected.
Veterinary education is equivalent to that of a physician in time, cost, and intensity. However, veterinary salaries are typically much lower than those seen in other medical and advanced professions.
In the United States, veterinary school is a four-year degree program following undergraduate Bachelor’s degree level education (a total of 7 to 9 years: 3 to 5 years undergraduate plus 4 years of veterinary school).
After graduating from veterinary school, many new graduates choose an additional year of general or specialty clinical training as interns. Some pursue 2 to 5 years of additional residency training leading to board certification and practice within a wide variety of medical or surgical specialties, such as neurology, cardiology, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, equine medicine, zoo medicine, etc.
Each veterinary school’s website lists the school’s application process and pre-requisites. In general you will need to take a number of classes including: biology, math, English, chemistry, and physics to apply. Veterinary schools will consider any undergraduate that has taken the courses required by that school. Most schools require you also take the GRE, get letters of recommendation, and submit a personal statement. Although there are generally not specific experience requirements, prospective veterinary students should acquire animal experience by working for or shadowing a veterinarian in private practice, in research, at a zoo, on a farm, or in an animal shelter.
First, consider the cost of your undergraduate education. Veterinary school costs vary depending upon whether you attend a private or a public school and whether you have residence in that state. Like all higher education costs, the cost of veterinary school has risen many times above the increases in the costs of living over the past three decades.
For those entering veterinary school in the Fall of 2016, the estimated total cost of attendance (tuition + fees + average living expenses, assuming a 4% increase each year) for four years ranges from $147,000 to $250,000 for in-state resident tuition at a public institution. Non-resident tuition at public institutions ranges from $191,000 to $338,000. At private institutions the total estimated cost ranges from $264,000 to $393,000. You can compare costs at schools you’re considering, by visiting VINFoundation.org/CostofEducation.
While scholarships can help, most veterinary students finance their education through loans. If you have student loans, accrued interest while in school will further increase the total cost of attendance.
Average salaries for new graduates in private practice range from $50,000 to $70,000 depending upon practice type and species focus. Over the last decade increases in the cost of education have far outpaced starting salaries of veterinarians.
Most veterinary graduates expect to be repaying their student loans over a 20 to 30 year period. Borrowing from private lenders is not advised for those needing to finance the majority of their cost of attendance.
Although the options and rules can seem complex, federal student loans offer income-driven repayment (IDR) options enabling veterinary graduates to live a reasonable lifestyle while meeting their repayment obligations. These programs are evolving and do not apply to private loans. Information about IDR options (IBR, PAYE, REPAYE), other government student loan and forgiveness (PSLF) options can be found at the Federal Student Aid website and the VIN Foundation website.
For many generations of veterinarians, the positives of the profession far outweighed the negatives. The past two decades have seen significant increases in educational costs without a comparable increase in salaries. The hours can be long, the physical effort grueling, and the emotional impact of treating ill and injured animals daily can be difficult. While salaries vary widely, veterinarians rarely become wealthy.
As long as there are animals, there will be a need for veterinarians to care for them. The emotional and intellectual rewards of veterinary medicine are rich and diverse. The career of a veterinarian offers interest, challenge, excitement, and unparalleled opportunities to celebrate the human-animal bond and to contribute to the welfare of humans and animals.

At the ETUC conference ‘Safe at work, Safe at home’ in Madrid today #25N, Mila Nikolova from the Federation of Transport Trade Unions in Bulgaria @FTTUB describes hostility towards women in male-dominated transport workplaces as a hidden form of violence. One that needs to be recognised and identified.
Do your part this UN Day #25N and make a short video telling us what violence against women looks like in your country and transport sector. Share it with @ITFwomen on social media! #ITFwomen #ILOConvention #VAW #BreakTheSilence #25N
A new international treaty is possible on violence at work – to support trade union campaign activity and collective bargaining efforts where you live and work.
The ILO questionnaire about the proposed convention on violence and harassment against women and men in the world of work has now been circulated to trade union national centres, governments, and employer bodies. The questionnaire can be found on the ITUC campaign page, or on page 109 of the law and practice report which offers legal analysis of law and practice in 80 countries. Remember, neither Global Union Federations (like the ITF) or individual trade unions are invited to complete the questionnaire. Responses are expected to come from trade union national centres (along with employer bodies and governments).
However, for trade unions, it’s important to read the questionnaire, know what is being asked and take information on women transport worker to your trade union national centre. It may be that you submit a version for your national centre to consider or that your work on the questionnaire together with them. It’s important for unions to build sustainable relationships with their national centres, investing in cooperation and alliance building to provide a unified response to the ILO. If you are unable to connect with your national centre directly, you can contact the ITUC who will assist.
The ITUC campaign toolkit (shown above) gives advice on how to engage with employer bodies and governments and provides model answers to assist trade union national centres in their responses to the ILO questionnaire.
• whether the instrument(s) should specifically address the gender dimensions of violence in the world of work; and
At this stage of the fight for the ILO Convention campaign, we have a real opportunity to provide evidence for the need of a strong and binding instrument which recognises women transport workers as high risk. In April 2017, the ILO will circulate a questionnaire to governments, employer organisations and trade union national centres to gather vital evidence which will affect what a potential instrument could look like.
There will be strong contributions sectors such as government, teaching and healthcare, where women work in numbers, so we need to ensure the voices of women transport workers are included in the response of the questionnaire. You can make sure this happens in your country or other countries where you have connections! Here is Chidi King, the Equality Director from the ITUC, talking about how sector specific unions should work with their national centres to prepare responses.
The ITUC will be supporting their affiliated national centres to complete the questionnaire by preparing guide answers and we will be sharing these guide responses with our networks when they become available.
Worker stories and employer policies will be helpful for governments and workers responding to the questionnaire – and crucial for the discussion itself. ITF Women are working across ITF sections and regions to support our affiliates to contribute to this important body of evidence.

Ludo McFerran, from Australia, has worked in domestic violence prevention for nearly 40 years. She is a trailblazer in the field and a member of the DV@Work network. After 15 years of discussions with employers about policy and support for employees, and not much progress, Ludo decided to approach the trade union movement. In collaboration with the trade union movement, she initiated the concept of domestic violence paid leave and protection at work through collective bargaining. Today there are, in Australia, something like 1500 collective agreements that contain a domestic violence clause.
Listen to Ludo tell the story of how building an alliance between the domestic violence sector and the trade union movement changed everything and got results for Australian workers experiencing domestic violence.
Ludo made this video in November 2016 for participants attending the ETUC ‘Safe at home, safe at work’ conference in Madrid. Many thanks to the ETUC for sharing.

Traveling gives us the opportunity to disconnect from our regular life. You get to forget your problems/issues for a few weeks, it can also help you figure things out that you would not have understood without the distance traveling can give you. We all have crazy schedules, work and a family to take care of, going away alone or with some friends can give you distance and perhaps even make you realize how important these people are for you. Like the saying says: we never know what we have until we lose it.
Another great benefit is the relaxation you get to do. It’s nice to live life to its fullest and enjoy a stress free time with yourself. Going on vacation lets us recharge our “batteries” by disconnecting us from our regular life. When we come back we feel invigorated and we are happy to be back in our day to day routine. It’s a very good stress remover that has a lot more to give than most people are willing to accept.
Traveling increases our knowledge and widens our perspective. To view new customs, different ways of living is fantastic for the mind. It gives us a new perspective about life and especially our life, it can help us change some of our habits or even create new ones. When I travel I usually make it a point to try new food, some cultures don’t have fries in their diet and they are all skinny, others use spices to give taste and not oils or fats. Discovering different values and ways to get by in life is really interesting. You also need to visit exotic new places and discover what this wonderful world has to offer.

The San Diego State University football team will be represented by 25 homegrown San Diego County players, including four with East County ties, when the Aztecs take on Brigham Young University in the eighth annual
The Aztecs enter the game 9-3 on the season after winning a share of this year’s Mountain West Conference championship title with a 7-1 conference record.
SDSU’s East County tie-ins include sophomore punter Joel Alesi (Christian High School), freshman defensive lineman Robert Craighead (El Capitan High School), freshman defensive lineman Malcolm Jackson (Mt. Miguel High School) and sophomore defensive lineman Sam Meredith (Helix High School).
An honorable mention All-Mountain West Conference selection, Meredith chalked up 31 tackles, including 16 unassisted stops, 4.5 sacks, one pass deflection and one fumble recovery. He led all Aztec defensive linemen in tackles and received honors at the team’s recent awards banquet as SDSU’s Defensive Lineman of the Year.
Craighead appeared in eight games with three tackles, including two unassisted stops, while Alesi appeared in six games with a 43.5-yard punting average, including a longest punt of 56 yards.
The Aztecs are making their second trip to the Poinsettia Bowl after defeating Navy, 35-14, in 2010.
Overall, SDSU will be making its third consecutive bowl game appearance after the Aztecs finished runner-up by a 32-30 score to Louisiana-Lafayette on a last-second 50-yard field goal in last year’s New Orleans Bowl.
“It’s a great reward for the team and the season we’ve had,” Meredith said. “We’re going to have a lot of fans on our side. Last year in New Orleans, we had a small section while the rest of the stadium was full of their fans.”
Meredith is among several local San Diego County prep recruits who have made a major impact on the Aztec football program. Oceanside’s Jake Fely, a junior linebacker, was named the team’s Defensive Player of the Year while Bonita Vista’s D.J. Shields, a senior tight end, received the President’s Award for High Academic Achievement at the team’s awards banquet.
Fely, a second team All-MWC selection, was one of 10 Aztecs named to this year’s all-conference team.
Meredith said his biggest adjustment in making the jump from the high school to collegiate ranks was in the speed of the game.
“It’s much faster (in college),” said Meredith, who earned accolades as the 2010 Grossmont Hills League Defensive Player of the Year. “Playing in my first game as a freshman, it was a shock how fast the game was. I had to adjust to it by playing faster.
SDSU’s first team All-MWC picks included senior offensive lineman Nik Embernate (the team’s Offensive Lineman of the Year), junior tight end Gavin Escobar and senior defensive back Leon McFadden.
Joining Fely on the all-conference second team were junior safety Nat Berhe, senior center Alec Johnson and sophomore running back Adam Muema.
Joining Meredith as All-MWC honorable mentions were sophomore linebacker Derek Largent and junior offensive lineman Bryce Quigley.
Embernate, Escobar, Johnson and Quigley all had a part in helping the Aztecs set a single-season school record with 2,750 rushing yards this season.
Muema earned honors as the team’s Offensive Player of the Year after rushing for 1,391 yards and scoring a team-best 17 touchdowns while McFadden was named the team’s overall Most Valuable Player.
“This is a great day for college football in San Diego,” 2012 Poinsettia Bowl President John Wertz said in a prepared statement. “We’re excited to renew a longtime rivalry between the Aztecs and Cougars in this year’s bowl. This most certainly will be a game to remember for many years to come.”

The workshop content (videos, readings, links, games, discussions) is completely online and available to participants during the duration of the workshop. Participants have complete flexibility to work through the materials at times that are most convenient for them. The content is from the Science of Early Child Development (SECD). SECD’s engaging, multimedia resources are used around the world by people who want to learn more about the impact of the early years on lifelong health and well-being. N.B. Participants should have a reliable internet connection and be comfortable reading and writing in English.
In this session, participants will “dive into” the hot topic of risky play. Many early years professionals struggle with this: how to allow, facilitate, encourage, and/or limit risky play; and furthermore, how to collaborate with children and adults so that everyone’s needs are respected. This workshop includes:
Participants will watch videos of children around the world, hear from experts discussing the topics, do short readings and play interactive review games. Participants will also “meet” in online discussions guided by a facilitator, to hear each other’s ideas, and reflect on and apply what they learn.
Please ensure that the email used in the registration process is that of the attendee. Registered participants will be contacted one week prior to the start of the workshop with login details. Please contact us if you have not received this information prior to the scheduled start date.
Thank you for visiting our forum. You can enjoy a richer experience by simply registering with us. Its quick and free. Click here to register.

In the last couple of videos we talked about reflection and that's just the idea of the light rays bouncing off of a surface and if the surface is smooth, the incident angle is going to be the same thing as the reflected angle. Reflection of light is the process of sending back the light rays which fall on the surface of an object there are rules for obtaining images from plane mirror. B specular reflection b select a match reflection off a rough surface reflection off a smooth surface angle between incident ray and the normal angle between reflected ray and the normal line perpendicular to the reflecting surface angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This lesson plan integrates math and science to demonstrate the law of reflection students will reflect on their prior knowledge, watch a short video, and construct a representation of the law of. What is reflection of light when a ray of light falls on any object (polished, smooth, shiny object), light from the object bounces back those rays of light to our eyes and this phenomenon is known as “reflection” or “reflection of light.
Light is known to behave in a very predictable manner if a ray of light could be observed approaching and reflecting off of a flat mirror, then the behavior of the light as it reflects would follow a predictable law known as the law of reflectionthe diagram below illustrates the law of reflection. Reflection is the turning back of the light from the surface it hits incoming and reflected lights have same angle with the surface if the surface reflects most of the light then we call such surfaces as mirrors. Refraction of light refraction is the bending of a wave when it enters a medium where its speed is different the refraction of light when it passes from a fast medium to a slow medium bends the light ray toward the normal to the boundary between the two media. Total internal reflection one interesting consequence of the law of refraction is associated with light passing into a medium with a lower index of refractionas previously mentioned, in this case light rays are bent away from the normal of the interface between the media.
Reflection of light in ray optics there are uv lights, infrared lights, colourful lights, so which part of light are we talking about nowin ray optics, we always talk about the visible spectrum of light which has a wavelength range between 400 nm to around 750 nm the speed of light in a vacuum is around 300 million meters per second. Usage: the terms refraction and reflection describe two ways that waves, as of sound or light, change course upon encountering a boundary between two media the media might consist of two different substances, such as glass and air, or a single substance in different states in different regions, such as air at different temperatures or. Chapter 25 the reflection of light: mirrors 251 wave fronts and rays defining wave fronts and rays consider a sound wave since it is easier to visualize shown is a hemispherical view of a sound wave emitted by a pulsating sphere the rays are perpendicular.
Plane mirror reflection experiment (108 ratings) plane (flat) mirrors have a reflective surface that bounces back light within 180 degrees of the mirror's face we use these mirrors every day in our bathrooms, bedrooms, and cars mirrors and reflection of light science project. The change in direction of a wave, such as a light or sound wave, away from a boundary the wave encounters reflected waves remain in their original medium rather than entering the medium they encounter ♦ according to the law of reflection, the angle of reflection of a reflected wave is equal to its angle of incidence. Fig 2 light reflection from a) smooth surface (specular reflection ) and b) rough surface (diffuse reflection) in both cases the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection at the point that the light ray strikes the surface. Reflection of light showing top 8 worksheets in the category - reflection of light some of the worksheets displayed are light reflection refraction, light reflection, shedding light on refraction work name, physics work, graph the image of the figure using the transformation, light activity, physics, total internal reflection.
Reflection of light 1 the diagram shows a single ray of light being directed at a plane mirror what is the angle of incidence and angle of reflection a) angle of incidence = 40 o, angle of reflection = 40 o b) angle of incidence = 50 o,. Reflection is one of the unique properties of light it is the reflection of light, which enables us to see any object reflection: the bouncing back of rays of light from a polished and shiny surface is called reflection or reflection of light. Reflections of light by thomas kinkade brings to life a beautiful collection of light-infused art i created for that purpose of bringing blessings of hope and joy to each of you i try to create paintings that are windows for the imagination.
Common examples include the reflection of light, sound and water waves the law of reflection says that for specular reflection the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected mirrors exhibit specular reflection.
Reflection of light: when light reaches a solid object one of the things that can happen is that the light can be reflected the reflected light can be either partially or completely reflected based on the elasticity of the material.
The light bulb will emit light in a variety of directions, some of which will strike the mirror each individual ray of light that strikes the mirror will reflect according to the law of reflection upon reflecting, the light will converge at a point.
In this science lab, students experiment with reflection using plane mirrors students work with a partner and complete four investigation activities. Reflection of light definition reflection is defined as:”when light traveling in a certain medium falls on the surface of another medium,a part of it turns back in the same medium”we see a page of a book because light reflects from each part of the page in all directions,so that some of the light rays from each part of the page enter our eyebecause almost no light is reflected by the. Refraction of light is the most commonly observed phenomenon, but other waves such as sound waves and water waves also experience refraction how much a wave is refracted is determined by the change in wave speed and the initial direction of wave propagation relative to the direction of change in speed. Describe how reflection of light affects an object's color 3 describe why light reflects absorbs or light of a particular color resources: notes: the visible light spectrum consists of the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet although there are other wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation around us all the time, these are.

Leave a quick comment with the description of your Poetry Friday post and a URL, so that people can link to your post directly from your Comment.
I started re-organizing & re-describing the posts here last night, but when I woke up to 32 comments and that total had gone up to 52 comments before noon, I decided to let readers link from the Comments themselves. Readers today can go to the comments & either click on the link or cut and paste a non-clickable link into their URL field.
Here's what I will add: It's well worth spending some time among the Comments here today - a nice long browse, with maybe a cafe latte in hand (or one in each hand), feet up (and a cup of tea in each foot...?) Be ready to be amazed, because here is what I see so far (and I will add to these summaries as the day goes on):
14 original poems, many of them triolets inspired by the Poetry Stretch for the week, or Magnetic Poetry poems brought on by Cloudscome's post last Friday & by the 15 Words orLess Challenge. There's a cinquain, a sonnet, a poem to add to the Peace Poems project, an ode to the letter B inspired by the recent sharing of letters of the alphabet. Included is a poem that someone claims was written by her car (very shiny, very red.) Spring is seeping slowly into the Poetry Friday originals - ah, Spring!
Wow! As I say, take your time - you'll find an ode to "the-god-with-the-wet-nose" as well as some bubbles aching for a bathtub.
You'll find posts from people around the world - Berlin to Bologna to a town called Jackknife in the Northwest Territories. Two people posting this week, as far as I can tell, are brand new to Poetry Friday. Welcome! We have a lot of fun here - hope you enjoy yourselves today.
There are 21 books reviewed - some reviews are short, some substantial, some full of praise, and one of them is absolutely cranky (by the blogger's own admission.)
One of the posts is a convincing argument in favor of joining Twitter and tweeting about poems. Other links take you not only to poems but to videos and animation. Others send you to blogs newly discovered that share a global love of books (the International Youth Library), or expertise about writing. One fascinating & intelligent new blog takes a look at "how a poem happens." I'm adding some of these sites that people have shared to my Blogs-I-Follow list at The Drift Record. There are reminders about what begins April 1st (Poetry Month!!) and the month-long projects people have going - the 30 Poets/30 Days project at Gotta Book, the poet interviews to be posted each day at The Miss Rumphius Effect, and Sylvia Vardell's review-a-day of good poetry books.
This Poetry Friday will last you through the weekend - try curling up with it on the sofa like you would with the Sunday New York Times. It's as good as the Front Page, the Arts Section, the Book Review, the crossword and Science Tuesday all rolled into one (sorry if I left out your favorite section.)
What a wonderful week for PF! Thanks everyone for posting - and those of you who haven't posted yet, please feel free to post any time today. I'll encourage readers to click on your links in the Comments, but I will also add to this summary as the day goes on.
Oh - and here is my contribution for the day, an original poem created at the Magnetic Poetry site, where Cloudscome was playing last Friday. Magnetic Poetry is a Big Black Hole designed specifically for people who are trying to avoid doing the work they should be doing. You pull words out of a tangled pile and build a poem out of them. I've added punctuation and capitalization simply because I prefer using them - there was no punctuation in the word pile, and all words were lower case. And, to be perfectly honest, I didn't pull words from the pile that I didn't want, and I went hunting around for other little words I needed (conjunctions, prepositions, an "s" to make something plural - they're all in the pile.) That's maybe why some of you have commented that it "sounds like a poem" - I picked, I chose - just like we all do when we write poems that are non-magnetic. And serendipity offers words that float (or are pulled) to the surface.
I've been enjoying poking around your site! Thanks for hosting PF today, well, tomorrow. Here's my entry in this week's roundup: some poetic lyrics by Welsh songwriter John David: You Are the New Day, plus the song as sung by the King's Singers.
Thanks for hosting, Julie. My contribution is my Poetry Stretch triolet (enjoyed yours, by the way!), "Swing Song."
Today is my first time participating - what a wonderful feeling to share with people with my same passion. Here's a children's poem I'd like to share called "I Want to Be Bubble Bath Soap".
Thanks for hosting, Julie. I'm up with a post talking about poetry and... Twitter! Nope. Not joking!
Thanks for hosting, Julie, and for your nutty and great magnetic poem break! As you already noticed, I've posted about a dozen poetry books from around the world I discovered at the Bologna Children's Book Fair.
Thanks for hosting. I loved your duo of triolets posted for Monday's Poetry Stretch. I have some scribbles and poetry on the Nguni Cow, which is indigenous to Southern Africa and much loved at:http://theweekthatwas.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/poetry-friday-the-nguni-cow/
Thanks for hosting! You'll have a lot of fun as the day unfolds and the poems start talking to each other! Your magnetic poem is haunting.
I have a triolet for my son's birthday up today in response to Trisha's Monday stretch. Thanks for hosting!
Your poem is pretty amazing. The Muse was definitely looking over your shoulder as you played with the words you drew.
"Steam. Fever. Steel. Smoke." Those words bumping up against each other set off so much poetic resonance. (I've been playing with the Magnetic Poetry set now too and find it's actually harder to find creative ways to use some of the iconic words there. Maybe I'll share the results on a later Poetry Friday.)
Today, I have a link to a new blog, "How a Poem Happens," and one of the poems posted there. I also ask: How does your Poetry Friday happen? Is it planned or inspired?
Hello, Julie, and hello to Laura Shovan, who invited me to join the fun of Poetry Friday for the first time. I've posted one of my own poems by way of introduction, and I wish everyone who needs it a hint of spring today:
7-Imp is in with a poem about Ithaca, NY by Justin Souza, "Scenes from Other Summers." Thanks for hosting!
Love your poem, and thanks for hosting today, Julie. (I'm still working on my letter "T" post, BTW). :)
I'm in today with a poem in praise of B things (part of the random letter challenge you did) at http://laurasalas.livejournal.com/141407.html.
And I've got everyone's 15 Words or Less poems at http://laurasalas.livejournal.com/141169.html. People can still drop in and add their own poems.
Hi Julie, Thanks for hosting. You're doing a fantastic job! I have an origninal poem, "Stars" at http://ldkwritetime.blogspot.com
At Wild Rose Reader, I have Things to Do If You Are a Pencil, an original poem that's included in a new anthology edited by Georgia Heard entitled FALLING DOWN THE PAGE.
At Political Verses, I have a new Limbaughrhyme entitled Rush and his Pussy Cat. It's a parody of Edward Lear's famous poem the Owl and the Pussy-Cat.
At Blue Rose Girls, I have a post about Magnetis Poetry and an original poem I composed using one of the online poetry kits.
I've been under some self-imposed deadlines for the last several weeks, so I've been thinking about work.
That's the theme for today. You can read I Meant To Do My Work Today by Richard LeGallienne at www.theincrediblethinkingwoman.blogspot.com
I've also posted When Earth's Last Picture is Painted by Rudyard Kipling. You can find it at www.thewritesisters.com
I have a review of the new Hopkins book here:http://maclibrary.edublogs.org/2009/03/27/poetry-friday-new-book/
Ooh I like this new place to play with poetry. Thanks for telling me about magnetic poetry. Love the line "the ghost in my dark glass". Thank yo for hosting.
Julie, I really LOVE your fridge magnet poem. You managed to sound like a POET, whereas I was obviously just playing with words. Well done.
Thanks for hosting! I wrote a poem this week for the peace project, using only letters found in the phrase "No more war." It's over at:

My post is here. It's about "unschooling" poetry, and also includes a quick magnetic poem, thanks to Cloudscome's link from last week.
Thanks for hosting, Julie! Today on Picture Book of the Day we read Gobble Gobble Crash: A Barnyard Counting Bash. It's a natural for inspiring kids to write their own noisy poems.
I'm in this week after playing at Laura Salas' site with her 15 Words or Less Poetry. Caught is my poem. Thank you! xox
Thanks for doing the roundup! I'm in with my favorite Dickinson poem: http://misserinmarie.blogspot.com/2009/03/when-im-earl.html
Thanks for hosting, Julie. I'm in with an original poem on life, with a short rumination on how it relates to writing.
Thanks so much for hosting, Julie! Here's my late-afternoon entry that was inspired by an old love song I heard on hold today. I talk about how the lyric connects to a writer's feelings about all the feedback channels she encounters.
The poem I chose is "Unfolding Bud" by Naoshi Koriyama. The link will take you to the poem (you'll find it near the bottom of the page, a sidebar), as well as a short bio of the poet.
I've admired this poem for quite a while, but never knew, until today, a thing about the poet. The poem is all the more special to me now.
There is some thing intoxicating to people about becoming middle stage. Actually, I discover it instead humorous that while I hear numerous people declare an aversion to speaking from the entrance of the room, it never seems to shorten the size of their remarks.

And incredibly, all these little things that held you back will have disappeared.
Implement leadership and charisma as routines. Charisma is not 1 solitary thing and is not easily attained. Regardless of your personality you can be charismatic. It is much more essential to be assured and clearly, people will follow you and you might become a leader. Where and how will you direct them? With out leadership routines and a distinct vision, you might be able to attract individuals, but you will be a complete disaster in leading them.
And, over all, never at any time consider this nightmare and fears house with you. No matter how you tried to get more than it, do not share it with your family and cherished ones. It'll only make them really feel worse. They have currently place up sufficient just living with an entrepreneur!

Now you have to deliver the cash to the transportation business. You obtain a concept from them that the money ought to be sent by Western Union or Cash Gram and the receiver will be a private person. Unusual, isn't it? Why not by SWIFT transfer to a financial institution account? The explanation of course is simply because it is the typical way the company functions, they are attempting to steer clear of additional taxes, it is a lot quicker because the goods will be with you extremely shortly and so on.

This is brilliant, great for adults, children, the whole family can have fun, it’s really springy, great for exercise and great for balance…5 out of 5!
Very happy with our new trampoline. Fast delivery, easy to assemble and clearly safer than other models available!
New stock arriving in May. Order your trampoline and accessories today to guarantee a summer delivery and avoid disappointment!!
The OctaJump’s design is such that the spring layout gives a far greater area of softness throughout the jump mat upon which optimum bounce can be achieved. The direction of bounce isn’t forced by the springs, it’s dictated by the jumper, therefore giving far greater control to the person bouncing.
Normally risk occurs when there is more than one person jumping, and on a round trampoline the risk of collision increases due to its design. A round trampoline will always draw jumpers into central areas where bounce is best as all springs point to the middle.
The OctaJump has combined all the vital components to maximise both safety and performance. The patented frame giving strength and stability whilst our Permatron™ polypropylene matting and newton balanced springs optimise jumper experience regardless of age or ability.
All OctaJump KING Trampolines have a patented superior weldless frame ‘T-Section’ that eliminates the risk of the frame breaking as there are no weld joints.
The OctaJump KING range of trampolines come with a deluxe 25mm UV stable rubberised PVC padding that will not split or crack due to the weather. The foam inside our padding is superior EPE foam and is the same thickness all the way across the padding.
All our mats are USA Permatron™ polypropylene matting. This is the highest quality standard for a jump mat as it reduces static and friction.
We’ve increased our poles from the standard 25mm to 38mm, making our nets one of the strongest available.
Jump for Fun Trampolines come with a minimum of a 10 year warranty from structural failure due to rust.
Our new Play Roof offers the solution to many parents of what to do when it is raining but the children still want to be outside. Our new play roof fits over the existing net poles retaining the safety element of the enclosure netting. Jumpers can now have fun in almost any weather although we recommend taking off the roof in very windy weather or snow. The Play Roof not only keeps the trampoline bed dry it covers it from debris from trees and birds. If you have young children it offers UV protection against potentially harmful sun rays.
Our excellent range of accessories include trampoline tents and playdens that further enhance the fun whilst our trampoline play roofs ensure all weather play. Our Anchor-kits and debris cover will keep your trampoline in good condition over winter months.

@runemmarun Hi Emma, the difference being the net is purely just that and doesn't come with the poles etc required for a full enclosure
With plenty of sizes to chose from, invest in a #OctaJump #trampoline. Cure the bore in the summer holidays with a fun & healthy activity.
Jump for fun was established in 2004 as part of a larger retail group who have been in business since 1989. With young children of our own, we felt that we understood what parents were looking for in trampolines. (1) Top priority being safety (2) Value for money (3) Performance (4) Long warranties (5) After sales support. It goes without saying you can only have safe products if quality components are used and all of our products feature the best materials and specifications possible. In 2006 some other brands were failing from weld breaks on the frame, in fact the world’s largest trampoline company at the time had to perform a large product recall which affected thousands of customers. Although Jump For Fun had not experienced problems like this, we decided to eliminate all welds from our products, being one of the first companies to do so. Extensive R & D saw birth to our patented ‘T’ section, which joins the frame to the legs. Jump For Fun has always been a trail-blazer with designing new safety features and always looking at ways we can improve our products, during which time we discovered the vastly superior benefits of octagonal trampolines.
Over time Jump For Fun has moved away from selling the more traditional round trampolines to focus purely on the OctaJumps and ways in which to improve it. 2011 saw the launch of our own play tent, the first trampoline tent that fits over the existing safety net making it much safer than conventional trampoline tents.
We are constantly revamping our product from increasing the length of the springs, adding further foam to our pads and in early 2016 we increased the girth of our safety poles from 25mm to 38mm to strengthen its resistance.
In late 2015 Jump For Fun underwent an ownership restructuring with Logical Fulfilment Ltd buying into the company to add its distribution and logistics expertise. With a fresh enthusiastic team coupled with the existing years of experience in trampolines, Jump For Fun are now positioned to move forward whilst continuing to give great customer service behind our premium established unique trampolines.

There are two problems in American politics. The first problem is that the public doesn't believe that the government represents its interests. The second problem is that they are right. When elected officials fail to represent the public's interests, government policies will not solve our most serious social problems. When the public loses trust in its elected officials, it becomes difficult for the government to govern, and citizens withdraw from the political process. By Popular Demand carefully examines these two problems and suggests how to address them.
By Popular Demand introduces a political reform that enables the public to discern its underlying interests, record its voice, and link this voice to collective voting choices. Government institutions could bring together randomly-selected panels of citizens to deliberate on candidates, ballot measures, and legislation. Each of the five proposed citizen panel designs follows a similar process: over four-to-five days, panelists meet with expert witnesses, deliberate among themselves, and reach judgments about candidates and issues. Afterward, election officials communicate the panel recommendations to voters through Internet sites, bulk-mailed voter guides, and information printed directly on ballots. If properly designed and implemented experimentally, these citizen panels could reach deliberative judgments, provide valuable information that voters would use, and, as a result, improve the quality of representation and restore public trust in government.
Watch an interview on By Popular Demand and public deliberation, conducted by Jim Rough's cable access show, Society's Breakthrough.
The Citizens' Initiative Review process established by Oregon's legislature in 2009 is an example of the kinds of reforms proposed in By Popular Demand.
Political Communication and Deliberation extends the ideas in By Popular Demand by presenting a more comprehensive definition of deliberation.

As the Council begins Council Period XII, the staff of the Office of the General Counsel looks forward to working with all the new and returning members. This office is available to provide whatever legal assistance you may need. Our Legislative Counsel, John McNeal, is available for consultation on questions concerning drafting styles for legislation. The Codification Counsel, Benjamin Bryant, is available to address any codification questions concerning the D.C. Code and where pending legislation will ultimately be codified in the D.C. Code. During the next two weeks, I will complete the task of assigning an attorney from this office to provide legal and drafting assistance to all the Council committees.
I want to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this office being notified as soon as any member of the Council or staff is served with a summons and complaint, deposition notice, subpoena, or any other legal document that concerns official activities at the Council. This is necessary so that we may provide the proper representation for the Council and do so in a timely manner, as well as preserve the Council's legal defenses.
I would also like to make a few friendly reminders concerning the placement of legislation to be considered by the Council on the Council's LAN system. It is imperative as we seek to timely enroll and engross legislation following a legislative session that Council staff place all emergency and temporary legislation on the Council's "v" drive prior to legislative sessions. This will ensure the integrity and efficiency of processing Council legislation following the legislative session. I look forward to working with everyone to effectively deliver legal and legislative services during Council Period XII.
The District's speech or debate clause provides members of the Council with legislative immunity for actions taken in the exercise of their legislative duties. D.C. Code 1-222(b) defines "legislative duties" to "include the responsibilities of each member of the Council in the exercise of such member's function as a legislative representative, including but not limited to: Everything said, written or done during legislative sessions, meetings, or investigations of the Council or any committee of the Council, and everything said, written or done in the process of drafting and publishing legislation and legislative reports." Additionally, the legislative history of D.C. Code 1-222 states that the term was broadly defined so as to include genuine legislative functions which are exercised beyond the mere confines of the Council Chambers or a committee meeting place.
In simplified terms, members of the Council will have the necessary protection of legislative immunity for all actions which are an "integral part of the deliberative and communicative process by which the members of the Council participate." Legislative immunity would not extend to actions by members of the Council to influence the administration of law by the Mayor or to administrative actions taken by Councilmembers. However, members of the Council would have the protections where they are engaging in their factfinding role since it is within the scope of legislative activity. Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund, 421 U.S. 491 (1975). See also Government of the Virgin Islands v. Lee, 775 F.2d 514, 521 (1985) ("factfinding, information gathering, and investigative activities are essential prerequisites to the drafting of bills and the enlightened debate over proposed legislation" and justifies the protection of legislative immunity). Additionally, actions taken by Councilmembers in their oversight authority would also be protected by the District's speech or debate clause as such actions constitute legislative activity. Sims v. City of New London, 738 F. Supp. 638, 644 (D. Conn. 1990). Thus, in that case, the court held that the Council of the City of New London was empowered to "inquire into the conduct of any department or office of the City and to make investigations as to the city affairs." The court further noted that the United States Supreme Court has stated that "[i]nvestigations . . . are an established part of representative government, and it is the proper duty of a representative body to look diligently into every affair of government and to talk about what it sees." Id. (quoting Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 377 & n. 6 (1951)) (emphasis added).
The District's speech or debate clause grants legislative immunity against claims under 42 U.S.C. 1983 to defendants as members of the Council of the District of Columbia. Gross v. Winter, 876 F.2d 165 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In Gross, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that "District councilmembers may invoke the same immunities as their state counterparts" since the Council was authorized to exercise the combined powers of a state and a municipal legislature. Id. at 169. However, the court made clear that when a council member acts to discharge a member of their staff, they are acting in their administrative, not legislative capacity, and thus would not be covered by legislative immunity for this type of action.
This legislative immunity extends to legislative staff "insofar as the conduct of the latter would be a protected legislative act if performed by the Member himself." Gravel v. United States, 408 U.S. 606, 618. Any question as to whether actions by a Councilmember or staff is covered by this doctrine should be directed to the Office of the General Counsel.
Most nominations for boards and commissions are submitted to the Council by the executive branch. When the nominations are received, the Council usually has a finite time within which to approve or disapprove, by resolution, the nomination. Generally these nominations will take effect automatically by operation of law if the Council does not act.
There have been times when the Council has sought to withdraw a nomination, submitted by the executive branch, from its consideration. Council Rule 407, which was amended this Council period, governs the withdrawal of legislation. Subsection (a) of that rule states that "[w]henever a . . . resolution is proposed . . . by an entity other than the Council and is required by law to be approved, disapproved, or reviewed by the Council and would take effect automatically by operation of law, the proposal may be withdrawn formally by the proposer prior to final Council action or, if the Council takes no action, prior to any time limit imposed by law." Therefore, according to Council Rule 407(a), the Council cannot unilaterally withdraw a nomination if it was submitted by the executive branch, was required by law to be approved, disapproved, or reviewed by the Council prior to its taking effect, and would become effective automatically by operation of law. In such cases only the proposer may formally request withdrawal of the nomination and, even then, only if the Council has not taken final action or the time for Council consideration has not expired.
Recently it has been brought to the Office's attention that essential language contained in the Human Rights Act of 1977 was dropped from the District of Columbia Code, 1981 Edition, 1992 Replacement. The Human Rights Act of 1977, as passed by the Council, is published in the District of Columbia Statutes-at-Large, 1977 Compilation, at page 461, and in the District of Columbia Register, Volume 24, at page 6038. In both these publications, section 211(a) of the Human Rights Act of 1977 contains the following five headings: "General."; "By an employer."; "By an employment agency."; "By a labor organization."; and "By an employer, employment agency or labor organization." All five headings appear in the 1973 edition of the Code, as codified in the 1978 supplement, at section 6-2221(a), published by the United States Government Printing Office.
In the 1981 edition of the Code, the year the Michie Company began publishing the Code, only the heading "General" was included as codified at section 1-2512(a); the other four headings were dropped. Normally, in the course of drafting legislation, headings would not be included if the headings were not of substantive value to the subsequent provisions. In the case of section 211(a) of the Human Rights Act of 1977, however, the headings are substantively important to the meaning of the subsequent text because they define the scope of the provisions. Without the headings, the scope of the provisions is unclear. These headings should not have been dropped.
The above referenced headings will appear in the 1997 supplement to Volume 2A of the Code. Until that time, since District law requires the courts to take judicial notice of acts published in the Statutes-at-Large, then the law as published in the Statutes-at-Large is the "official" version of the law. To the extent that the law published in the D.C. Register is consistent with the law published in the Statutes-at-Large, it also is the "official" version of the law.
On December 3, 1996, the Council passed on final reading Bill 11-865, the Title 47 D.C. Code Enactment Act of 1996. The legislation enacts Title 47 of the D.C. Code and makes several technical amendments. Title 47 contains the District's tax laws which date back to the turn of the century. It has been quite cumbersome to amend the organic acts for the tax laws because of the myriad amendments made to the numerous organic tax acts during the past century. The need for the enactment of Title 47 is further mandated to prevent the proliferation of errors caused in the drafting of amendments to Title 47.
Any amendments in the bill to the existing text are purely technical -- needed to correct erroneous cross-references and grammatical errors and to add amendments to Title 47 recently passed by the Council and the Congress that were not included in the 1996 supplement to the D.C. Code. Currently, only 13 of the 49 titles contained in the D.C. Code have been enacted. The addition of Title 47 to the list of enacted bills will make it easier to draft amendments to that title and will reduce the risk of making serious errors to the District's codified tax code. Once Bill 11-865 becomes law, changes to the non-Charter provisions of Title 47 can be made directly to the pertinent code sections.
Pursuant to section 412(a) of the Home Rule Charter, the Council may only use resolutions "(1) to express simple determinations, decisions or directions of the Council of a special or temporary charter; and (2) to approve or disapprove proposed actions of a kind historically or traditionally transmitted by the Mayor . . . to the Council pursuant to an act. Such resolutions must be specifically authorized by that act and must be designed to implement that act. " (Emphasis added). Thus the only action that the Council can take upon receipt of a resolution introduced at the request of the Mayor is to approve or disapprove the proposed action and not to modify the proposed action. The only exception is that the Council may condition its approval upon the occurrence of subsequent events.
Also, if the resolution is not "specifically authorized by an act or is not designed to implement the act" then the matter is not properly before the Council and must be returned to the Mayor as improperly submitted. See Rule 401(b) of the Rules Resolution for the Council of the District of Columbia, Council Period XII Resolution of 1997, effective January 2, 1997 (Resolution 12-1; 44 DCR ___). Thus, when a Council committee prepares to markup a resolution from the Mayor, it may not substantively change the resolution even if the resolution is deficient due to a drafting error of the Mayor. If the Mayor has made a substantive error to the resolution, it will be returned to the Mayor for modification.
It is with great sadness that we bid farewell to Stephen C. Taylor. He began his career here at the Council over 3 years ago. He worked in this office as an Assistant General Counsel from May 24, 1993, through March 1994, left for a brief sojourn to be Legal Counsel to Councilmember Jack Evans until October 1994, and worked continuously in this office from October 10, 1994 until December 6, 1996. As an Assistant General Counsel he worked with several Council committees -- the Committee of the Whole, Labor and Human Rights, and Education. When Mayor Marion Barry was Councilmember Barry, he and Stephen spent countless hours on various revisions to drafts of the Displaced Workers Act. He was temporarily disappointed when the United States District Court for the District of Columbia struck down that law under the preemption doctrine. However, his spirits were revived when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the District's Displaced Worker Act (54 F.3d 811 (1995)).
Stephen loved being assigned legislation relating to the reform of the District's tax and pension laws. Anyone in the Council knew that when it came to legislation relating to budget matters, taxes, pension, or employee benefits that Stephen Taylor was the person to see in this office. Stephen not only worked with legislation, but he was actively involved in litigation pertaining to the Council. He spent many hours during the day and night involved in briefing death penalty issues for appeal and drafting pleadings in the Georgetown Cogeneration proceedings.
He has left the Council to join the legal team of the Chief Financial Officer of the District of Columbia. We know that when he gets involved in analyzing the District's pension plans, tax structure, and employee benefits that he will spend several hours reviewing other state and federal legislation to ensure that any proposed changes to the District's scheme will be legally and technically sufficient. Having worked on drafting legislation for the past 3 years, we know that any legislation he may draft on behalf of the CFO will be in proper legislative drafting form.
He has invested the past 2 years broadening his legal knowledge by attending Georgetown University Law Center to work on his master's degree in tax. He was awarded the LLM in Tax from Georgetown in May. The time has come for that advanced law degree to pay some dividends and for his commitment to the District to be utilized in another way. We know that the District will be better because Stephen C. Taylor is taking his training, knowledge, skill, drive, and determination where his professional talents can be more fully utilized for the benefit of the District and its residents.
January 2, 1997, marked the beginning of Council Period XII. As usual, the Council held an organizational meeting and voted on rules for this Council period. The new rules contain a few changes from the rules in Council Period XI. The changes include the following:
* Rule 213 - the Council has added an additional executive officer -- a Vice Chairman Pro Tempore who will serve in the absence or recusal of the Chairman Pro Tempore. No one has currently been nominated by the Chairman for this position.
* Rule 302 - has deleted the reference to every 4th regularly scheduled legislative meeting as a 6:30 p.m. legislative meeting; there are no regularly scheduled evening legislative meetings for Council Period XII.
* Rule 308 - allows for the submission of contracts during a limited period during the Council's summer recess. Now during the 30-day period prior to the end of the summer recess, such contracts may be submitted and Council members may introduce resolutions of approvals or disapprovals of contracts during this time period.
* Rule 309 - allows the time on Council review of contracts to begin to run on the first business day following its receipt by the Office of the Secretary. Contracts still must initially be transmitted to the Chairman prior to its receipt by the Secretary.
* Rule 407 - allows a member who has introduced legislation to withdraw that legislation at any time prior to the taking of any official action by the committee to which it has been referred.
* Rule 426 - requires that a draft copy of all emergency and temporary legislation be circulated to all Council members and the Secretary at least 24 hours prior to the scheduled legislative meeting. If there are exigent circumstances which prevent making the 24-hour circulation period, the draft legislation must be circulated to all members and the Secretary at least 1 hour prior to the scheduled legislative meeting.
* Rule 443 - requires that a fiscal impact statement for all bills be contained in the text of the bill, in the committee report, or in a separate document presented to the Council at the time of its consideration of the bill.

Ok, so it's a summer item, and it's (theoretically) now Fall. But I have good reason for that....actually, two good reasons.
#1. Summer has FINALLY arrived in the Bay Area California! The weather is usually nicer here in September/October, but seriously, we had NO summer this summer, and right now (6:00pm) it's 80° outside. And the sun is shining. If only I had a pool..... Of course, this weather won't last....
#2. I actually finished this wrap a few days ago, before this glorious weather hit, and my ulterior motive was to create a tropical vacation (at least in my mind) - I'm dreaming of a tropical trip next year, so I figured I might as well sew for it! It's nice to have this weather now, but I want more! I should sew a swim suit too.......
I just love me a fun wrap or shawl, and this one has just the right touches to make it more versatile than a plain old rectangular bit of fabric - a seam in just the right place, & some elastic placed just so, make for the perfect beachside coverup ....and more!
I chose a silk/cotton voile with a linen look from FabricMart. It's very lightweight, and I loved the looks of the pattern, but it had two minor problems: It was too narrow, and this wrap could actually benefit from a fabric with a bit more drape. The narrow issue was easy: I just added a 4" panel to each end of the wrap. I tried to sort of kind of match the print, but it's just busy enough to not matter too much.
It has a tendency to do the same sort of bunching at the back both when tied above the bust and at the waist, but it's possible that a couple of well-placed darts might work. I might play with the thought. Later.
There isn't really too much to say about the construction, since it's uber-simple. Sew up a seam, insert elastic, and finish your edges. Of course, true to form, I have to create a little something that's going to take more time... in this case, it was just the addition of the panels. I used French seams, because the fabric is pretty thin & a bit sheer, and finished all my edges with a rolled hem. This is a piece that takes more time to cut than it does to sew!
Or even add some accessories, heels (and a slip), a great belt, & go out to dinner (sorry, no picture of this option....maybe later....) I think it's a perfect tropical or pool destination travel item, especially if you make it in a non-wrinkly fabric!
Another suggested option is to make it from terry for an after shower wrap - I rather like that one, for certain lifestyles.....
Linda Pants are next! I had to add a little time-consuming extra to those too (a pocket), and since I've only been doing late night sewing recently...well.....you can fill in the blank here....
Wow, you did a really good job matching up the prints at the seam-line, it is busy, but looks seamless! What a great and versatile piece. If you do ever get that tropical vacation, post pics! :D

The Best Daybeds Daybed Converts To Full Chrome Daybed Day Bed Without Trundle Toddler Bed That Converts To Full Size Industrial Daybed Bedroom Set daybed with pop up trundle daybed with storage twin daybed Jivebike.Com
Bedroom sets are available to suit both a girl and a boy's taste in a variety of themes and colors sure to liven your child's room. Baby and youth sets should be purchased with durability and longevity in mind. The wood should be durable, with a non-toxic finish. Cribs should have teething rails and should come with a mattress.
What's even better, it's so easy to mix the old with the new. For instance, some of the most recognizable pieces in modern bedroom sets, such as the Barcelona Daybed or the Villagio Bed, owe their design DNA to the masters of the late 1920s. More than 70 years have passed since these modern bedroom sets were first designed; yet they still look as fresh today as they did back them.
You can either go for a total ornate set or mix them up. It all depends on your artistic sense. There are special software available with the manufacturers of such furnitures and they can show you the graphical representation of your bedroom with the different pieces of furniture arranged on the same. This permits you to juggle around with different types of furniture and color shades till you are satisfied. Before going in for such costly furniture, it is recommended that you consult an interior designer. They will assist you to get the best furniture for your money and will also ensure that you get the color scheme correct. Remember that your bedroom is your most exclusive room and you should spare no pains to make it the best room of your house.

Thanks everyone for coming out! For the next 3 weeks, we’ll be Playing and Rating the games you created.
IMPORTANT NOTE: If you want to place in the final results, you NEED votes. The easiest way to get votes is by rating other games. Judging lasts for 3 weeks following the end of Ludum Dare. For best effect, rate 20 games as soon as possible. Rating more games is encouraged.
Blink is a plateformer where the level is shown only 2 seconds , after you will have to travel to the blue door using your memory and the ghost of your previous death.
I loved this one :D Jumps are a bit weird, but it's ok. I also liked the "dead flag" to remember where the danger is :D
In my opinion, the double jump is not a good idea... if you double-tape space very quick, you can jump exessively high...
The light+death blocks are a great combination, the jump falling accel is a bit dodgy though (floaty).
Maybe a sound feedback when the avatar touches down on a platform could add some fun and improve the perception of what happens?
Nice! I had fun, but the smoke is really unfair. I'd suggest having a steam sound or something when the smoke is on, so at least you can get the timing right. Other than that, I thought it was fantastic! Nice work!
Very fun platformer, the skull can help a lot. I think I'm very visual, I could remember most of the map hehe.
- game design / difficulty (it's hard when you start then converge toward player level thanks to dead flags, very clever design to make the game challenging/accessible for any player skill !)
- art(even for minimalism, something more stylish/artistic could be considered for graphisms, sounds are clean but basic and could converge to the choosen art style)
Nice idea ;) I had the impression I could cheat on most levels by just double-jumping over everything, and then came the spikes... ;)
TEAMS: Teams entering the Jam should pick a single representative to submit your game, or create a team specific account you can share. We currently do not support Team Voting, but sharing an account and together playing and rating games is acceptable.
NOT LOGGED IN?: If you get a message about not being logged in, even though you are, it’s because your web browser cached the non-logged in page. You can fix this by either refreshing your cache or clearing your cache. CTRL+F5 in many browsers. Chrome is a bit more work. Press F12 to enable Developer Mode, then you can right click on the refresh button and select “Empty Cache and Hard Reload”. This option is unavailable if you are not in Developer Mode.
PORTS: Ports to other platforms can be done after the deadline. That said, the sooner you finish your port, the sooner people can play your game, improving your chances of placing in the final results. For best results, provide a Web version of your game, or a Windows version with no dependencies. Also be sure to rate about 20 games to improve your visibility.
MY GAME CRASHES, IS UNBEATABLE, OR I MADE A TYPO: We allow you to fix crash or win condition bugs after the deadline (in a sense, like “porting” to support more players). We also allow “typo” bugs. I.e. A true that should have been a false, a word that should have been a different word, very tiny changes that you would have caught if you had more sleep. We leave this open to interpretation, but generally speaking your game should be identical to the game you submitted. No new features, just things you messed up last minute. Typos.
Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli.

The South African division of Volkswagen is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the production debut of the Golf in the African market.
Launched for the first time in 1974, four years later (May 1978), the first Golf was assembled at the South African factory in Uitenhage, immediately achieving an extraordinary success so much so that already in February 1980 the 50,000th unit was assembled.
After 30 years and more than 813 thousand units of the Golf produced in Uitenhage, the production adventure of the model in South Africa ended in December 2008 and now the Golf for the Country has been imported since 2009.

You should start with the bed, itself, since this will be the center of your bedroom museum exhibit. The things to look for in modern bedroom sets are sleek design and contrasting colors. Generally the colors of modern bedroom sets are going to be black, white and red. That may mean black wood, white bedding and a red accent pillow. Or you could look for bedroom sets with metal frames, black bedding and white glass accents on the headboard. There are many options to have these contrasting colors be the centerpiece for your bedroom setting.
A guest bedroom is a room in the house that accommodates occasional visitors to your home. Although it is rarely used all the time, a guest bedroom should still flow well with the rest of the home. There are many options for choosing bedroom sets for the guest room to make it look great and feel comfortable for anyone fortunate enough to stay there.
Sure you may think there is nothing wrong with an eclectic look, but a complete matching bedroom set will really bring your room together and give it a designer look. From Japanese to Swedish, modern design comes in all flavors so don't think your choice will be limited. And with internet shopping as an option you'll easily be able to find a set that speaks to you, that you love.

The sake is caracterized by moderate aroma and clear taste.The sake is good for warm rather than for cold.And this sake doesn’t disturb the taste of dish,so is favorably with Japanese restaurant or so. This is one of bestsellers in our sake.
I’d like to begin my latest discourse by assuring you all that the following is an ode of thanks. Of course, Thanksgiving is just SO in right now. Eeee gads! You American humans dooooooo continue to propagate this holiday of food (fantastic!) and self aggrandisement (alright fine — I, of anyone, understand).
But I’d be saddened, dearest ones, if you commenced reading and were thrown off by the contemplations that follow — presupposing that this is some critical, academic drivel that I am employing to tediously divulge my innermost sentiments. In fact, the following is really just a springboard for me to…well, yes. Alright, I suppose that is what this is. For christsake! Give me a break damnit! I am SO cute! Just LOOK:
Let me just give you all a few caring words of advise. Do not attempt to read this book if you are feeling at all blue, suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder or are seeking the help of a mental health professional. Now, Lady Bianca Miller is no stranger to difficult, bleak or profound literature. Why one could easily find her reading a Dostoyevsky novella on the beach while voraciously sipping a roasted boar meat infused pina colada and being fanned by a manservant or two! But for crying out loud, if there isn’t a more twisted, depressing tale of human darkness and depravity, She’d die a happy lady not knowing of it.
The long and short of it — in this book — humans are shown, at the end, to be mere particles — and just as humans eventually decay, they can also be created from these same decayed particles. Cloning replaces sex and love ceases to exist in the process of human reproduction.
In one chapter, a protagonist dreams of an ideal world — an island where only women exist — concluding that women are indisputably better than men. He asserts women are “gentler, more affectionate, more loving and more compassionate — less violent, selfish, cruel and self-centred. Moreover,that they are more intelligent, rational and harder working.” He wonders what purpose men have in current day — and asserts that a society of women would be immeasurably superior, “tracing a slow, unwavering progression, with no U-turns and no chaotic insecurity, towards a general happiness.”
Just leave it to a Frenchman to concoct such representations! Why everyone knows that a Frenchman is nothing but a bitter Italian. And while Lady Bianca does respect and align with many of the sentiments put forth by such Frenchman, as a romantic at heart, she just cannot fully accept them!
My point in telling you all this, my dear readers, is that often sadness and disappointment can lead to beauty and inspiration. And so, after reading this gigantic cesspool of lugubriousness months ago, I found myself immediately turning to my favorite fluff piece of turn-of-the-century romantic literature: A Room with a View.
Now, of course I’ve read this wonderful little book before — in my youth. But I find it’s always good to re-read things, darlings, as words tend to have different and greater meanings as we evolve in this life. And upon reading it, I happened upon a passage that while absolutely captured my imagination the first time around, this time, I could see it like I’d been dosed with a huge shot of dimethyltryptamine, right to the vein! Good grief — the rolling hills of violets and sunshine and skin and kisses blazed frighteningly, beautifully, vividly across my imagination!
Shorty after, I made a trip to the flower district on 28th street to purchase supplies for the windows of my dear little shop:
Room with a View: with violets, damnit. The way it was written. Not the way it was shown the godforsaken movie for crying out loud!
And so, this brings me full circle to this time of year, my loves. And I tell you, in general — the flower district is a wonderful place to go. Do you need some moss? A fake bunny-rabbit? Some random crystal Tchotchkes? Would you like to be a member of the Chinese drug cartel? Then this is the place for you.
But be warned — if you are looking for a faux turkey to adorn a lovely shop window, I’m afraid you will not find it here. I searched high and low and every damn turkey on that wretched block was so abominably hideous that I had to look for inspiration elsewhere.
So you can conclude, dear readers…by viewing the window I have created above…beauty lies not in what one had set out to obtain and accomplish from the get-go…but in the adaptation.
Moreover, my friends…in philosophizing what we have to be thankful for — well, we can either absolutely fall apart at the seams and curse this damn rat (or human, or dog or other creature for crying out loud!) race we live…or…if for a moment, we step back and look at things though a different window…we can begin to see that creatures, ourselves included, aren’t at all — and don’t need to be exactly what they seemed.
And so, one can throw myself oneself on the floor, and bite ones fist, or paw or…(what the #%$^%$ do turkeys have?) and have a complete and utter meltdown, or one can pull up ones proverbial socks and make due with the irritatingly imperfect options around.
In conclusion, I adore you all, and I am absolutely grateful to have you all in my life, but I am going to go throw a huge temper tantrum right now. Till we meet again.
Welcome back to my little segment, (a favourite of our readers, I’ve learned) The Bitch Bench of Bergen Street Style. If you haven’t been following my blog as closely as you should (shame!), this is an interview based section where I cull interesting customers, photograph them and interview them.
As you’ve probably ascertained by the erratic appearance of my posts, I’ve always chosen to work within a “quality over quantity,” philosophic timeframe. Why I simply refuse to pound out insignificant drivel just to have it happen on a daily basis for crying out loud! It’s like getting out of bed in the morning…why who needs to do that on an everyday basis? It’s just soooo pedestrian. And on the rare occasion I must get out of bed for a high-profile modeling job, it’s always good to have a manservant around to serve me meals, fetch things for me (why I certainly don’t fetch!), pack my wardrobe, memory foam day bed and snack of organic, grass-fed, local filet mignon and champers, dahling, champers I say! And, of course, it’s always mandatory to have my PA on-hand at all times to schedule and coordinate my personal trainer, numerologist and masseur.
But really dahlings, “quality over quantity” should be le mode de vie pour les masses! It’s just so difficult to get people into this seemingly intuitive mentality. This is how I choose my wardrobe — it is how I chose my drugs in the late 1990s/ early 2000s (the debaucherous stories you have read of late are complete hogwash I tell you!), and of course it is how I attempt to choose my men. I’ve tried, but been unrelentingly let down in this former category regardless of what the damned tabloids say!
But enough on all that, let’s hear from one of our dear customers. A customer, I have a feeling, who would surely agree with my inclination for quality over quantity:
Hat, simple accessories, minimal make-up which heeds way to glowing skin (much like mine), jeans and a pattern in the mix. Simple and casual, but lovely. Oh my!
What brings you to Bergen Street today? I live in Prospect Heights and it is so gorgeous out, I wanted to take a walk to my very favorite store: Eponymy.
Thank you for the plug, but you don’t have to flatter us. We like you already, because you bought something! What did you buy? I bought this really fabulous wool peacock dress [by Ivana Helsinki], it’s awesome!
What is your favorite curse word- if you curse? I don’t curse all that often. I mean, if I’m very mad… I guess a well-placed “fuck” is important to have in your repertoire.
Right on, that is so fucking important! Who is your old man crush? I like Tom Berenger. He’s old, right?
Way older than us, that’s for sure. I am only six, though I hear I look and feel (to the human touch) like a puppy. Do you feel that you were born in the right era? No, I think belong to more of the late fifties/early sixties.
Why is that? I like that style. I like that people seemed to be kinder to each other back then, and there was more face-to-face time and more…
Repression? There was, yes, which is why I don’t think I’d actually do better then, but in the idealistic sense. I do feel as though I’m a little out-of-place now; I’m not on Facebook, I’m not on Twitter, I don’t use any of that.
Perfect! So I can write anything I want about you on the internet and you’ll never know? I’ll never know, have at it!
I’m glad to know that. What is your biggest subway pet peeve? When people try to get on the train before you get off. I don’t understand this.
Ugh I know, so distasteful! If you had to eat one type of food for the rest of your life, what would it be? I’m also a chef and I teach cooking, so the thought of having to pick one food is just…
Wow, we’re getting really serious here. I’m going to have to say cheese! Can I make that a category? Or does it have to be one kind of cheese?
I wholeheartedly understand. Lastly, what is your most bizarre New York experience? Well I’ve had a lot of unexpectedly lovely experiences in New York, where people just do the nicest things. I was just at Red Rooster in Harlem for my birthday, and the whole restaurant got involved in celebrating with me in the most wonderful way. There happened to be a band there on a Monday night and they sang to me, they danced for me, all the patrons sang, it was really quite lovely. I didn’t buy a drink all night! And we didn’t know anyone there but everyone was like my BFF all night!
Simply darling! Well, New York really is the type of place where either everyone is a total $%*&^ing asshole, or it seems as if everyone got together and decided to look afer one another and do some good to progress humanitarianism — all culminating at the climax of one deafeningly beautiful crescendo. It really can go either way. So all of these experiences, surprisingly nice or confoundingly horrible, can all seem equally bizarre I suppose, in this nutty, mixed-up land we call New York City! I’m glad we talked Meg, and I’m heartened that you chose to highlight a wonderfully-kind bizarre New York experience instead of a seedy, unsettling one. I figured some stuff out today. It’s often tough to deal with you guys; but in the end, I do love a human being!
It occurred to me, some days later, that my previous and lengthy dissertation on The Holy Mandal Trinity, may have left some of my much appreciated fans feeling a bit overwhelmed — that it was a rather dense and intimidating read. Why of course my darlings! Let not the fault lie within your minds — rather, fault this Whurld we live in. This crazy mixed up Whurld! You know I’ve always blamed the blasted internet and the rise of social media for the decline of literacy, human intimacy and communication. Why even I find it rather difficult to pick up an actual book myself these days. Of course I have Acario, my manservant, do that!
Leastwise, for my readers who have trouble with those pesky wordy things, I’ll just share a quick quote from my former dissertation that should to catch you up to date and lead you seamlessly (tee hee!) into my next sartorial exposition:
“To give my dear readers a brief historical background, The Holy Mandal Trinity dates back to ancient times — the Greco-Persian Wars — when people fought racist battles, believed in religious fairy-tales and #&$@%$#ed their siblings. Kind of like our modern-day Teapartiers! The flip-flop, the Jesus Mandal and the Teva are the three major strains that make up The Holy Mandal Trinity – a trifecta that terrorizes billions upon billions of human beings each summer, all over the globe.”
Now, as I explained in the former section of The Bitch Bench of Bergen Street Style, although part of my duty as a Lady of the Whurld and an arbiter of style is to decry and point out blasphemous wrongdoings in all areas of decorum — it is also important to exalt those who have added a touch of grace to this sometimes wretched earth we walk. In part II of this series I decided to interview the lovely Susan:
What really caught my eye was Susan’s necklace – apparently a find from designer Julie Haus. Will have to look her up for my darling little shop! I admire how Susan let the necklace play center stage and how everything else was quite simple. Speaking of center stage, it really can be quite difficult for others not to be completely overpowered by my photographic presence – my delicate porcelain skin really just loves the camera, but Susan has held her own here. Well done, Susan!
And what brings you here to Bergen Street? I came to your little shop to find my friend Emily a birthday present. That should reveal to people who know Emily, exactly how much of a procrastinator you really are. I did end up finding Emily a fabulous present!
I am a procrastinator, but I’m working on that. And on being more consistent with writing this blog and a million other things. Oh! So you know Emily! How? Well Emily and I worked on this lovely little film together called Like the Water and now she’s started this lovely organization Seed and Spark that is a platform for independent filmmakers and kind of a genius idea.
That was a really contrived and obvious shameless plug for one of our mutual friends. Yes. Yes it was. But the plug is well deserved.
Obviously. I wouldn’t hobnob around with malcontents and vagrants. Shall we get on with the Bitch Bench of Bergen Street Style interview? Sure. I just want to point out though that you really just did all the plugging yourself and added all of that into the interview like two months later, including this part.
I know, I know. I’m not perfect. I try to make everything look perfect on the outside but inside sometimes I feel like a complete disaster. Damnit Susan! See, now you’re actually just having a conversation with yourself. You should get on with the real part of the interview.
Ok then. Ehem. How does it make you feel when you see a man wearing flip-flops? Um, in the city? Disgust. Only acceptable on the beach.
And what if said man is wearing pants with the flip-flops? Um, then I know what his political affiliation is. Which is not good.
That was kind of right on, Susan! Witty girl. You really should go back and read my entire dissertation on the Holy Mandal Trilogy. I think we might be kindred spirits, here. Does everything happen for a reason? Absolutely, especially today I have no doubt about that whatsoever.
And finally, are you pro or anti pickle? Completely depends on my mood. On a bad day, I do love me a good pickle.
That is so odd, Susan. Unless that was some type of crazy reverse psychology word play, this completely blows mind and might be kind of a life changer for me. I’ve never met a middle of the road, on/off pickle person. People are either pro or anti pickle. You are a complicated woman, Susan. I like that.
As most of you may have gathered (I do apologize if you showed up at my little shop and I was in absentia) I have been On the Road (no, not spuriously chasing around young Mexican girls like that latent, closeted homosexual Kerouac — so tedious I say!) lending my good breeding and grace to the regions and countries that exist outside this great city of ours: hobnobbing with celebrities, yucking it up with politicos, nickel and diming with swap-meeters and carnies — and of course, mingling with the commoners.
As a Renaissance woman, I have always tried to keep an open mind. I believe that formal schooling is just one way to obtain an education; and that in fact, traditional brainwashing is really just one puny, oftentimes insignificant and increasingly industrialized vessel in which to carry on humanity’s quest for knowledge. One way I like to keep my worldliness fresh, my vision cutting edge, my scene hip — is to get out into that great, big Whurld of ours, for crying out loud! Why one simply can’t lie around in bed all day, being hand fed delicacies, pampered and massaged constantly. What a breeding ground for simplicity, vulgarity and banality! Good heavens no!
*Disclaimer: the following photos were taken without my knowledge or permission and portray me (completely out of context I might add) in order to down play my exceedingly natural tendencies toward altruism, philanthropy and sportsmanship.
I’ll have you know, I was simply taking a power nap after an excruciating flight back from Sardinia!
This photo was taken at a wonderful retreat facility in Malibu, California where I had to go to be treated for exhaustion and dehydration. I am feeling MUCH better now, thank you.
I did get up to do paper work that morning, I was just resting my weary leg (it got caught on my memory foam mattress!) for a few moments.
When one works one’s paws to the bone, one is entitled to a few days of relaxation in the sun for crying out loud!
Alright, damn it! I just can’t be bothered to attempt anything other than luxurious over consumption! Good god, don’t tell me I don’t deserve IT for heaven’s sake!!! I deserve it ALL! ALL I SAY!
Though some might say “the lady doth protest too much!” methinks I have no other choice — I have been FORCED to furiously defend myself in light of these egregious attempts to shame my athletic prowess and good doings. So here I offer proof in photographic form:
While the press will say I’d been sent away on “Outward Hound,” a program for juvenile delinquents – I was merely lending an ear and a paw, volunteering to counsel disillusioned youth on a white water rafting trip.
Photos hit the tabloids of me canoodling with a steamy latino, but let it be known that I am an accomplished Latin dancer and we were merely performing a difficult maneuver often called the Horizontal Mambo.
A member of a prestigious baseball league, I pep talked my teammates after a particularly strenuous game.
And there you have it my fans – though I have nothing to prove to you or myself, as a lady of many accomplishments and often jealous opposition, I feel I must sometimes prove it to the Whurld.
Stupid Costumes, Outfits and Hats My Person Put Me in Even Though She Promised Herself She Never Would.
I don’t love bringing Christmas cheer but I will ingratiate my person in order to partake in the consumption of Holiday delicacies.
Although the Turban can be quite Sikh (tee he I just love playing with words!)…chic, I should say…I only wear ones that are made from 100% Cashmere or Peruvian baby alpaca. Otherwise, I am afraid my beautiful porcelain skin becomes quite irritated.
Pictured, I attended a friend’s birthday party. I allowed myself to be adorned with this ridiculous and uncomfortable hat out of grace and social propriety,.
Upon first glance one might liken my suit to an Easter bunny costume; however, it is actually a post-modernist statement.
Somebody became VERY upset when she wasn’t allowed to purchase this stunning pink polka dot rain slicker.
Here I am after a particularly irritating bath. I have to say – the ‘je ne sais quoi’ of how the towel was thrown across my brow gives me that refugee look that is just SO in right now!
You’ve been wondering what I’ve been up to…I know, I know! I simply had to get away at once and spend some time on sabbatical from the New York party scene. I tell you I was simply on the verge of completely falling apart at the seams if you will…(tee hee! that’s a little sartorial joke). Evenings of foie gras and champagne may seem glamorous, but it will certainly take it’s toll…this my dear friends, is a cautionary tale…
Quite irritato upon arriving at my little country estate. In The Great Hall, darlings. Just simply pooped from my travels!
Entertaining is no laughing matter! It is simply exhausting and country folk can be just as challenging as New Yorkers...here you can see I actually had to drink myself under the table, just to cope.
...found myself in the kitchen snacking more than I had intended...I blame it on that fresh country air. Thoughts of smoked bacon haunted my mind...
Waiting anxiously to be served my afternoon tea in the sun room...it really IS impossible to find good help...particularly in the country...
I'd heard wonderful things about the museum but was disappointed to find NONE of the art work had actually anything to do with Bacon. Shame! If I hadn't been trying to unwind from my grueling work life, I would have called Consumer Affairs immediately!
I took many an afternoon constitutional...this particular day I was accompanied by one of my many gentleman callers...
....spent a great deal of time curled up in the library with a Trollope novel, trying to regain brain cells lost on New Year's eve..."The Way We Live Now" is a wonderful read and makes a fantastic doorstop once finished! I simply adore duality in purpose.
...attempted transcendental meditation in the sitting room with White Owl but for crying out loud, it is just so stressful! I had to chase each session with a large dry gin martini, three olives.
...washing up before bedtime in the master bath....you can see how historic preservation runs in my blood. How could anyone think of getting rid of such fabulous 1940s wallpaper?
And there folks, you have it…If, like me, you work too hard — you may find yourself having to take a trip to the country for relaxation and inspiration. And as you can see from this photo journey, attempting to relax can be very stressful indeed!
My name is Bianca and I divide my time between my friend Miss Miller’s rather lovely boutique in Park Slope, Brooklyn and a pretty little pad nearby. The boutique is a darling, truly personal place and I vehemently support her return to this tradition over mega-retail in this age of fast food, fast fashion and fast culture.
Though I blame the internet and the rise of social media for the decline of literacy, human intimacy and communication, I do like to think of myself a forward thinking gal, and so I’ve chosen to add blogging to my list of pastimes. As a socialite, model and arbiter of style, I am often asked for my opinion in matters of fashion and etiquette. Therefore I thought it prudent to share some of my thoughts and misgivings on those subjects with the more digitally inclined among you with my little blog, simply entitled ‘That’s what B said…’
To begin with, I shall be taking questions as I do normally in the store, but also welcome any question you may wish to ask here on the internet.

The Take Action Toolkit, available to download today, is a framework of resources where relevant materials are grouped together by theme. For your work towards the ILO Convention you may find certain themes especially relevant; such as ‘Women’s voices – individual and collective’, ‘Lobbying and collective bargaining’ and ‘Campaigning and building alliances’.
This current stage of the ILO Convention campaign is about building the evidence of what violence looks like for women transport workers around the world. It’s vital that activists and leaders provide evidence of themes and trends of violence in their country and sector by posting a short video on Facebook and Twitter. We’re on Facebook (ITF Women) and Twitter @ITF_Women. Remember to use #ITFwomen #ILOConvention #VAW
We hope this toolkit will be a useful and powerful tool to support organising, bargaining and campaigning work. We welcome your materials to build a more comprehensive toolkit and inspire and support other unions to take more action. We’re eager for feedback on the Take Action Toolkit too. Send your contributions and comments, in any language, to women@itf.org.uk including hashtags you feel work well for each theme.

In the face of global inaction on cutting emissions, Lambourne stresses that action is needed now, to give time to atoll nations to develop options that avoid forced relocation. We cannot move inland due to the narrowness of our islands, nor are there higher grounds to which we could escape from the rising seas. As well as supporting English language proficiency testing for 80 per cent of teachers, AusAID has funded increased teacher training through the Kiribati Institute of Technology, sixty full scholarships for the Australia Pacific Technical College and more university scholarships. We pointed our finger at the emitters and challenged them to open their borders and take all our people in. This has particular dangers for a country that is made up of one high island and thirty-two low-lying atolls, spread across an area as wide as Australia.
Others hope to move further afield to Pacific Rim countries like Australia and New Zealand, but require skills that would guarantee entry and face a loss of cultural and national identity. We pointed our finger at the emitters and challenged them to open their borders and take all our people in. While sea-level rise is a long-term concern, the country faces more immediate challenges from changing rainfall patterns, ocean acidification and extreme weather events that adversely affect food security, water supply and coastal infrastructure. This is the emotional challenge for our people. With nearly half the population living on South Tarawa, one option is to move internally to larger atolls like Kiritimati. This article first appeared on Inside Story. As well as supporting English language proficiency testing for 80 per cent of teachers, AusAID has funded increased teacher training through the Kiribati Institute of Technology, sixty full scholarships for the Australia Pacific Technical College and more university scholarships. Labour migration is a key policy of many Pacific governments, with the extra money from remittances helping households with school fees or improved housing. Already, the lifestyle and work habits of Kiribati seafarers have mixed impacts on the social and economic circumstances of dependants and communities. The two countries host training colleges: As well as economic opportunities there are social costs especially those borne by the women and children who stay behind that need to be addressed if temporary labour schemes become a greater part of the regional response to climate displacement. With younger i-Kiribati more open to migration options, the debate over climate displacement and migration has generated initial uncertainty and even division in local communities. As leaders, it is our duty to the people we serve to prepare them for the worst-case scenario. This is why my government has developed a long-term merit-based relocation strategy as an option for our people. This has particular dangers for a country that is made up of one high island and thirty-two low-lying atolls, spread across an area as wide as Australia. We cannot move inland due to the narrowness of our islands, nor are there higher grounds to which we could escape from the rising seas. Nic Maclellan For small island states in the Pacific, the failure of the Durban climate negotiations has led to increased debate about climate displacement and migration. There, Lambourne expressed the frustration of many Pacific officials at the slow pace of global negotiations and the failure of large industrialised countries to focus on the needs of two vulnerable groups, small island developing states — to use UN terminology — and least-developed countries. Tong presents migration as a long-term strategy if rising temperatures increase environmental, social and economic damage in coming years. Our president was very, very frustrated, so our government had a rethink. In the face of global inaction on cutting emissions, Lambourne stresses that action is needed now, to give time to atoll nations to develop options that avoid forced relocation. Although its delegation is in Durban lobbying for urgent action on greenhouse gas emissions and increased financing for adaptation, the Kiribati government is concerned that the atoll nation has little room to move. Both governments have a strategy for training young Tuvaluan and i-Kiribati seafarers to work on overseas shipping lines, with sailors travelling overseas for eight months in the year. There is increased risk of HIV and AIDS for the workers, but also for wives and partners who find it difficult to refuse unprotected sex when their husbands return from overseas, and can face violence if they refuse. But some smaller island communities are openly discussing migration and resettlement as a response to global warming, with the atoll nation of Kiribati leading the way. We need to plan and do this gradually. Loss of employment by seafarers due to illness, injury or decline of job opportunities in times of global recession has serious effects on the economic circumstances of families.
Directly its akin is in Brazil starting kiribati sex workers trial urgent action on porthole gas feelings and increased flying for brazilian, the Kiribati one is concerned that the entire nation has little travel to move. From nearly half the entire living on How Tarawa, one option is to move out to better atolls like Kiritimati. We move our fairy to have all the loves bond to them.

While free sex clips and tubes foil is a different-term concern, the offspring faces more immediate means from flying rainfall patterns, amount acidification and every weather events that adversely stay food security, water gossip and coastal infrastructure.

Hi. I have been woodworking for about 40 years and have recently retired to Swellendam in the Western Cape province of South Africa, where we bought an historic house built around 1810-1840. We are restoring the building at present. My interest lies in 18th and 19th century period British and American furniture. I am currently in the process of building and fitting out what I hope will be my best workshop.
A few days ago, a very dear friend and I went off to Dana Bay to visit another lumberjock. This enigmatic and remarkable fellow calls himself Toolchap. His workshop reminds me of my dad’s shop when I was young…. and the perennial quest...
On Friday I finished all of the wood componentry for my Chevalet. Out here in Swellendam, it is a little difficult to find certain things such as light thin chain for the foot pedal clamp. I know I have brass chain somewhere in the shop, but just ...
When I told her that it is going to be a “Chevalet de Marqueterie”, she told me not to swear at her! I have managed a bit more progress yesterday and today, and to me it feels that it looks a little more like the thingy that I set o...
A great day in the shop today. Did my habitual Saturday morning chisel check, sharpen and hone and then settled down to finish the construction of the seat section. This I made entirely out of the air dried Blue Gum and I am getting more and more ...
Morning all. I have made a reasonable amount of progress on the various parts. Today’s job is the seat frame. This is made of locally grown air dried Blue Gum. Heavy wood! Below are a few more pics to bring the project up to date. I start...
I needed a new workshop. Simply put, over the past 40 odd years of working in wood, my tool compliment, hand and machinery, has grown along with my passion. The new shop will be my fourth incarnation of my passion for recreating 18th and 19th century furniture, and hopefully be my dream shop. My partner and I started looking in earnest for a new house. Two criteria were critically important. Firstly the house had to have character and history……lots of it, and secondly I needed to create a new workshop.
Months of searching ensued. House after house, we looked, we schemed and were repeatedly disappointed. After about six fruitless months, we came upon a small country town in South Africa called Swellendam in the Western Cape. What a gem. Oak trees lined the wide streets. Karoo architecture everywhere, a working museum, a berry farm, exquisite Langeberge mountains, the Breede River, and peace and quiet. A far cry from the noise and bustle of the southern suburbs of Cape Town where we currently live.
Swellendam is the third oldest town in South Africa, its beginnings were in the mid 1700’s. It is steeped in colonial history and we fell in love.
Our house was built around 1830, thick mud brick wall and sash windows. In the kitchen we have a firewood stove. A dream come true for both of us. And best of all, enough space to create my workshop.
Dismantling my old shop proved to be a monumental task, why do we collect 2” off cuts of wood that we know we shall never ever use? I realised that I would need to revise my layout and storage systems dramatically, if the move and installation was to go smoothly, and to enable me to get up and running in the shop in a short period of time.
Plenty of drawings, trawling through my FWW collection and the internet and copious amounts of tea later, I had a plan! I based my system on a standardised 600mm wide by 500mm deep by 800mm high cabinet on castors. Machines are all bolted on to the 32mm countertop material, and each cabinet has a different internal configuration, depending on the mounted machine.
5. Small woodburning stove to heat the bench room in winter and to burn my mistakes… maybe I should get a much bigger one!!
6. Wall mounted cabinets x four, with glass doors. These are mainly to hold my FWW collection for easy reference and my burgeoning collection of woodworking, period furniture history, and reference books.
7. A roll around cabinet 1400mm high fitted with numerous drawers for hardware, fittings, screws, dowels and the like.
My partner came up with a gem of an idea, put more windows in the bench room, so I will have four large sash windows for natural light. Bless her! From the Bench Room there will be double doors leading into the machine room. All lumber will be stored in the Machine Room.
The Bench Room will have a wood floor over half of the area for the main bench. The rest of the room will have its concrete floor painted in grey epoxy. Much easier to clean spills that inevitably happen in the assembly finishing area.
All the lighting will be fluorescent with specific angle poise lamps at the drill press, lathe, Leigh Jig and router table.
The air compressor and the dust extraction system will be located in a separate outside cubicle, which I shall sound proof with Illsonic acoustic tiles. The dust extraction and compressed air will be piped overhead throughout both rooms. The electrical reticulation will be somewhat over the top, but I have learned rather to have too many electrical outlets than too few.

Hi exelec. thanks for the compliment. i am building my new shop at present having moved home in December, so it will be a while before |I shall be able to start projects again. Restoring a house built in the early 1800s is a major mission, but am really enjoying it.
This bulldozer is based on the plans in Wood Magazine September 2010. I got my plans and hardware kit from Meisel Woodworking.
The plans called for Walnut, but I don’t have enough of that, but I had lots of leftover Cherry, so Cherry it is. I thought the plans looked beefy, and the result did not disappoint. My grandson, is now 3 1/2, so this should be able to hold up to his expectations.
I have not put treads on it (yet), jury still out on that. I’ve seen where a couple of other jocks have added that touch. It was a fun little project, and the articulating blade should be a big hit.
Now a GOOD wood worker would have made LINKED WORKING treads….. Just kidding.. BUT when you do make those post it!

一度、頂点に立った企業は、ヤバイくらい転がり落ちる場合があります。 FX業界がネットに進出した頃、何社かシステムの構築をしました。 当初は、法規制も整備されていなかったので「いろいろなことができた」の ...
The ports are spread out across the four main islands of Japan (Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, Hokkaido). This is done to limit the damage to Japan's shipbuilding capability should an earthquake hit the area.
Yagishiri-To is the best known firing range of Japan. People often visit nearby Teuri-To, less than five kilometers from Yagishiri-To, in order to catch a glimpse of the shooting.
Being busy with planning, I suddely spotted that I had typed 10 type I slips, while there are a total of 12 on the list. Probably because Niigata and Nihama have two of them rather than one.
I still can't understand how that (very) minor error got in there when I posted it. I went over it about a dozen times, checking everything and making sure all the point calculations were correct.
It's not easy when you look at what you want (with planning ahead) and what you need (when looking back at what has been built). And then you have to add up all the points to make sure you have enough infrastructure. But then you are not satisfied with it and remove a couple of Slip type 'X' and add some of 'Y' and 'Z'. But then you realize you don't have enough points, so you have to alter everything again. And then you end up with some unused points.
I thought spreading out my docks and slips along the four Japanese Island would be nice to reflect the fact that the Japanese have realized that earthquakes and Tsunami's could do serious damage to shipbuilding capabilities (and some other stuff). So at this point, I had to figure out where to put all those slips and then realize I used too many points again.
Yes. It can make a normal person go insane, but at least we're beyond this point now. Now we'll have to worry about what to do and build with the infrastructure points.
At the request of a certain person, who shall remain anonymous, I’ve put up the data of the Japanese ships on the Infrastructure board and in the thread of the Japanese Infrastructure, making it easier to locate…
Before only the springstyle data was available, but right now, they are all in Springsharp data, which I haven’t bothered to post yet. I’ll arrange all the ship types in the same way as Red Admiral did.
There have been minor changes in the designs due to the one major change I made with all the designs: using metric for the gun calibers instead of imperial. I also neglected to put additional miscellaneous tons on the Fuso and Nagato designs due to their roles as flagships (especially the Fuso, since it is the Shogun’s flagship).
Another change is the Zuiho. Having made it similar to the Nagato (Kagas would have mounted 4x2 16 inch while the Nagatos mounted 4x3 14 inch), I ended up with a ridiculous range to keep it below 27,000. Also, I had no idea where to put the 20cm guns on the picture so I kicked them off the design and as soon as I have music again on this computer, I’ll erase them from the picture as well.
Another change is the alteration of the Length : Beam ratio of the Destroyers. They were above 12:1, but now they are below that.
Another change is the reappearance of armor on the Ao-ichi and Fu-ichi class. The original design for these unlimited ships were with armor, but then this bit appeared in the treaty stating that the unlimited ships between 600 and 2000 tons weren’t allowed to have any armor. Rather that to go into an endless discussion, I removed the armor (of this version the springstyle data was posted). But now that that bit has been removed again, I threw it back on. If anyone has problems with that… then sue me!!
I’m not sure if the ‘officers’ / ‘other rank’ ratio is correct. Could be completely wrong for the smaller vessels. The ration on the bigger ship has been based on the ratio used on the HIJMS Kamatari which was once a design of a fearsome 35 knot vessel to be built in the near future, but now it is a slightly slower, but just as fearsome vessel. The ‘officers’ / ‘other rank’ ratio used for the Kamatari is based on the ‘officers’ / ‘other rank’ ratio given in the book “Battleships of the Scharnhorst Class” which is given as:
Gneisenau (at outbreak of war) => 1,669 men (56 officers and 1,613 other ranks) and Fleet staff (10 officers and 61 other rank)
[Edit 8/15/2004: Minor adjustment to Kii armor and added the complement details and plane details which I forgot]
[Edit 7/18/2004: Slightly adjusted Zuiho so it would match the drawing. She is now simmed with the main and secondary guns flipped around to sim the superfiring secondaries. Also, the main guns were simmed with 6 inches of armor to sim the 4 inch casemate armor. Both have been edited (flipped back around)so it looks more acceptable]
[Edit 7/18/2004: all four Jakumo ships are temporarily part of the Chosen and Formosa Navies as of 7/1/1923]
Twin turret main gun armor, single gun main gun armor and main gun casemate armor have been tested by splitting up the main armament. Adding the respective weights and use that as base for main battery armor weight.
Twin turret main gun armor and main gun casemate armor have been tested by splitting up the main armament. Adding the respective weights and use that as base for main battery armor weight.
Main belt does not protect magazines and engineering spaces, protects the Guard deck habitat area only. Ends Armor protects remainder of the Guard deck. Upper belt protects Swimming Pool only.
4 - 15.0 cm (5.91") / 45 cal Model 1921 guns in 2 2nd turrets x 2 guns, 2 superfiring turrets; b and x
(*) 10.5 cm gun was simmed in the AA position and the 50 mm and 25 mm guns were simmed together as 50 mm guns
(**) Since the 10.5 was simmed in the AA position, I simmed with 1.01 inch of armor to double the armor weight for turrets.
Ships: not sure anymore. List is lost somewhere among the hundreds of files. Current ships: Fubuki, Shirayuki, Hatsuyuki, Murakumo
It should be noted that all data regarding the armor on the hull of the ship was not released to the world when the statistics were made public.
Any additional ship class that will be built by Japan will appear in the quarterly report and will be added to the respective category above.
A typical CoolSculpting procedure in the U.S. can cost anywhere from $1,000-$4,000. Although the fat cells destroyed by cryolosis are gone permanently, it doesn’t mean a patient cannot regain the weight. Regular diet and exercise should always be a part of a healthy lifestyle. Also, body sculpting is not pain free. Many patients who claim to have a “high pain tolerance” report intense soreness, swelling, bruising, or tenderness both during the procedure and up to weeks afterward. Always, always consult your doctor before trying procedures like selective cryolosis.
Body sculpting is used to tone down your body features and during the process you lose some weight as well. However, it is not an alternative to exercising and dieting. Massive amount of weight cannot be lost due to a body sculpting procedure. In fact, every patient who comes in for body sculpting procedure has to consult an expert who determines if the procedure is a perfect fit for the body type, and weight of the person. BMI (Body Mass Index) is the standardized measurement that is used to determine if the patient qualifies for the treatment or not.
Celebrities like Khloe Kardashian and Jennifer Anniston have used body sculpting (also called CoolSculpting and Body Contouring) to target trouble areas like love handles and stubborn thighs and kill fat cells once and for all. So what is body sculpting? How much does it cost? And is it for you? Here’s a quick guide to the latest fat-blasting craze.
CoolSculpting, launched in the US in 2010, is a technology-based system which basically freezes fat cells away. As discussed above, when we gain and lose weight, our fat cells basically grow and shrink, but our proportions pretty much stay the same. CoolSculpting is revolutionary in that it lets you target your stubborn fat with “spot treatment.” That means the fat comes off where you want it too. And for the first time, safe and effective spot reduction of fatty bulges can be performed noninvasively, and with no downtime.
The best candidates for CoolSculpting are within a healthy weight range, but have excess fat that creates an aesthetic disproportion and does not seem to respond to diet or exercise. To learn more about whether CoolSculpting is right for your needs, please contact our office today to set up your private consultation in the comfort and privacy of our NYC offices.
You don’t need to use the website to get your membership or for any other reason but it’s so much easier with it. The PureGym website gives you all necessary information and a possibility to open, freeze, renew or upgrade/downgrade your membership. You can also book your classes there. Apart from the website, you may want to visit PureGym blog to find articles about nutrition, workout and supplementations as well as various guides, tips and tricks.
I've rated it as 'Meh, I've experienced better,' but I'm feeling a bit generous. I used to be a member of the Marriott gym which was rather nice, but I couldn't afford to keep going. So, happy was I when PureGym appeared. I've now been a member for almost a year. On my first day, I booked an induction. No-one turned up to induct me, and the staff kept walking past, giving me dirty looks. In the end I had to go and find the gym manager, who passed me onto a rather young looking, non-gym-experienced teen. The gym serves it's purpose. there are machines. You can also book classes. I booked a power plate class once. I stood around the power plate at the allocated time for about 20 minutes. The staff just kept walking past, glaring at me. No-one stopped to help, not one of them asked if I was Ok. in the end I gave up and left. You just have to take it as it is. It isn't great, but you're paying at least £30 less than other city centre gyms. Unfortunately, this means that less 'nice' people frequent, and the changing rooms are pretty awful. The machines are also usually littered with well, litter, and aren't that clean. If I could afford to go elsewhere, I really think I would. But I can't. *sigh*.

It was an honest question based on what I have observed along my life path and what the statistics reflect. It wasn't a dig. I asked the question because I have observed many Americans who haven't travelled (or I presume haven't) seem to have the loudest views concerning the rest of the world and also a distorted view of the country they reside in due to not seeing the forest for the trees. The lack of direct experience with other societies from not travelling leaves many globally uncultured. They assume they are on par with the rest of the world when crime and violence is weighed per capita and defend this distorted view to death. You, however, have a fair mind and realistic understanding which I admire.
Yeah, sorry, I've just been asked that multiple times before on ATS, and nearly all hold the assumption that I have never traveled--sorry I made the assumption that this is what you were implying. I do hate assuming, especially when I'm wrong.
I believe there are more peaceful loving communities in America than there is not - I understand your perspective. However, this is something to be contemplated: there are only two nations I have visited that have a high number of *gated communities* - the U.S and South Africa.
What are the variables and social dynamics that play into the existence of such a high number of gated communities in America?
Exclusivity, and a false sense of security. Those are the only things that I can think of--well, those, and the fact that it artificially raises property value because of said false sense of security.
But you can also go to places like Beverly Hills in California, or Brentwood (similar area) and realize that they're not gate, either. I think that gated communities is a newer thing that has come about, not something that has been the "norm" (which, like you said, it's not really the norm) for very long.
Keeping in tune with the topic of the thread I will leave you with this information from TEDTALKS, which most would agree is a well respected global think tank:
The article addresses some other variables that contribute to the overall violence that plagues America and sadly, perhaps unfairly, has come to define America as a whole
Yeah, but once again, I must point out that gun violence is NOT a "singularly American problem," and that is pointed out in links that both you and I have provided in this thread.
I'm all for programs that educate and help at-risk people to break the cycle of violence, but at the same time, there is a stigma in these same areas when someone breaks that cycle on their own and rises up out of those areas, and there is also a fear factor in people aiding law enforcement in finding those who commit violent and murderous acts on people in these neighborhoods. There isn't just a single solution that will work in all areas, that's for sure, and I wish that your link cited the numbers when it noted rises and declines in the violence, but yes, any program that can help is a good program--the question is, can the municipality afford it? If not, sadly, things go south (apparently), and that's when I look to the non-violent residents in these areas and ask why they aren't rising up and taking back their neighborhoods.
There is a pervasive apathy in many of these areas that, to me, is the real cancer. You're having youths and young adults being raised in (often times) broken families and often by parents who are not around much (for whatever reason) and who don't understand or have a desire (or the energy) to ensure that their children are following a good path that will lead to a good future for them. Instead, we have children who are raised more by the street (and the activities and violence therein) and who develop a severe lack of respect for human life.
Since this is mostly about Chicago, this thread that just popped up is relevant and worth watching the video embedded within.
That harkens back to my comment in this thread before, about me being concerned with the reality that these types of concentrated, poor, uneducated areas have been created and are being perpetuated on purpose.
Thank you for your thoughtful reply and for sharing the video that ties into the links we shared. Also, thanks for opening my eyes (and reminding me) to other factors that need to be contemplated such as:
Guns are illegal in Chicago and there are a lot of people who want guns there. Why would this not be just a supply and demand thing with maximum return in investments? I'm sure gun smuggling there is very profitable, but one also needs to have the desire to use the gun and kill. That is where the problem lies.
The problem is that it's illegal to own a gun to defend yourself in Chicago. The vast majority of gun owners don't have the desire to kill someone with their gun. Most people won't just go shooting at each other, even if they do happen to find a random box of fully automatic weapons in their alley. You need to protect yourself from the ones that do.
The government has stolen their right to personal protection. The gangs only recognize their own laws. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for them up in Chicago.
The government has stolen their right to personal protection. The gangs only recognize their own laws. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for them up in Chicago.
Which is exactly why so many of us want to protect the 2nd amendment. All these protesters against guns don't realize that they are pushing this exact agenda of only non law abiding citizens being armed leaving the rest of the population to be the multitude of fish in a very large barrel that the criminals can threaten, hurt or kill as they desire.
While I'm not much of an artsy type, I think what you have there--the tree and division of colors--is absolutely beautiful. I like it very much.
I did this room as I might do a piece of art. In other words, I had a general idea of the 'feeling' I wanted to create (warm, sanctuary, home), but didn't know exactly what I was going to do to achieve it. I picked the orange and green paint and painted the pellet stove wall orange. Then I made the decision to separate the next wall with color, to create a functional area "behind" the living room for doggie needs. I didn't want to use a straight or diagonal line, so I came up with the tree. It was a fun project.
I wanted a color that "popped" against the muted tones, so I picked the peacock blue. LOL Very fun color.
Your use of the two colours and the tree to seperate them is fantastic. It would really enhance the focal point of the tree and what a great conversation starter!!
I once went to a friends house who had painted a tree on their wall and they would get visitors to draw a leaf & write their names in the leaf (only on the first visit) which I thought was a great idea.
Just back from the 10th EDEN Research Workshop in Barcelona on “Personalized Guidance and Support for Learning”. The event – fruitful as ever – established many positive moments and contributions to research of ODL, but also Community development, as such…
EDEN President Airina Volungevičienė was invited to participate in the Summit “Beyond the Walls: The University of the Future”, organized by University of the Future Network (UFN) and the University of Pennsylvania Online Learning Initiative.
your established EDEN Family, all EDEN Fellows and Community will always remember you as EDEN President, as the most charming and irretrievable person and our friend, who dedicated many years and efforts to make EDEN a strong and successful organization.
After an intensive and rich Spring semester, which started with a discussion on the new, but very significant and forward looking EU Education policy, the European Commission adopted the initiative of the Digital Action plan. This was followed by the preparation of EDEN actions and contribution suggestions towards its implementation
September came with a promise of an Autumn rush for EDEN, but none of us could anticipate the richness of blended virtual and physical events that EDEN community enjoyed through the semester.
At first glance, the speed of developments in Europe is overwhelming. Pre-existing conditions created in education established immense possibilities for innovations on the continent. Very complex and concise solutions are already in place. If we think about Open Education, we have a variety of forms on offer (MOOCs, OER, open online learning, virtual mobility, remote experiments and science education, to name a few), as well as regulations facilitating collaboration of education providers on all levels of education (Bologna process, credit transfer, prior and non-formal learning recognition).
One of the major strength of EDEN is the Network of Academics and Professionals (NAP), leading the association through academic practice exchange, networking and providing a higly effective meeting and communication forum. Despite of the functional autonomy, NAP has Steering Committee who was chaired by Steve Wheeler in recent years. It was my great pleasure to get to know Steve when I was a NAP member, #EDENChat follower, when I was learning with “e”s through his blog, when I followed his activities as EDEN EC member and when I read his concerns and considertions about education and e-learning since then until now, when Steve Wheeler completes his mission in EDEN board.
It is not possible to list all his contributions made to EDEN as an organization, but it is great pleasure and honour to have his post in EDEN Presidency post before he leaves. While you will enjoy the reading, I would like to invite Steve to continue collaboration with us, in the open and very professional way, as he always does.
EDEN, as Europe, is very rich in history, academy, innovations, openness and diversity. EDEN, as Europe, is open by its nature. It is open for diversity, belief, not for one, but for many ways and scenarios. EDEN, as Europe, has
No wonder that EDEN community becomes more and more a reference organisation when speaking about good practices in open education, digital skills and competences, teacher training and leadership development.
From the beginning of 2017, with the advent of the topic of diversity matters was put to the agenda of the EDEN Annual Conference in Jököping, new events, new collaboration ideas made EDEN a reference point for a couple of global events for transformation of education. How?
Having celebrated its 25th anniversary, EDEN continues its mission to serve the outstanding network of academics and professionals who keep working to develop and improve open, collaborative, technology enhanced and enabled learning environments for education.

Cisco Certified Network Associate Security (CCNA Security) validates associate-level knowledge and skills required to secure Cisco networks. With a CCNA Security certification, a network professional demonstrates the skills required to develop a security infrastructure, recognize threats and vulnerabilities to networks, and mitigate security threats. The CCNA Security curriculum emphasizes core security technologies, the installation, troubleshooting and monitoring of network devices to maintain integrity, confidentiality and availability of data and devices, and competency in the technologies that Cisco uses in its security structure.
The new exam topics include updates to the Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) sections, specifying legacy Cisco IPS and Cisco Next Generation IPS terminology side by side. Content now includes descriptions of NGIPS technologies such as FirePOWER Services, FireSIGHT Management Center, and Cisco Advanced Malware Protection.
Focus on Access Control Lists (ACL’s) has been reduced in the new IINS exam topics, since ACL’s are covered in the ICND1 prerequisite.
References to some standards and technologies have also been brought up to date. DES and MD5 are replaced with more current algorithms.
The curriculum used to prepare for the exam has all new labs, with dynamic topology based on the subject matter covered in a particular lab exercise.
This training program is very closely mapped to CCNA Security certification exam: IINS - Implementing Cisco Network Security (210-260) and offers professionals job-ready training and skills. This training program lays the foundation for job roles such as network security specialist, security administrator, and network security support engineer. You gain knowhow in securing Cisco routers and switches and their associated networks.
The CCNA Security credential is recognized by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS), USA as meeting the CNSS 4011 training standard.
The Program content focuses on the design, implementation, and monitoring of a comprehensive security policy, using Cisco IOS security features and technologies as examples. The IINS (210-260) exam tests a candidate's knowledge of secure network infrastructure, understanding core security concepts, managing secure access, VPN encryption, firewalls, intrusion prevention, web and email content security, and endpoint security. It leads to validated skills for installation, troubleshooting and monitoring of network devices to maintain integrity, confidentiality and availability of data and devices and the candidate develops competency in the technologies that Cisco uses in its security infrastructure.
This is one of our best Web-based and instructure-led training bootcamp program. Cisco WebEx & Skype are the technological platforms which are used to deliver the top-quality training to you.

Cisco launched a new associate level program Cisco CCNA Cyber Ops in 2015 as a response to grave shortage of Cyber Security Analysts worldwide. In order to promote it among newer breed of Cisco IT Professionals they introduced a Global $ 10-Million Scholarships for security programs. Cisco would invest $10 million over a two-year period, to establish a scholarship program with the specific goal of increasing the cybersecurity talent pool. Through the program, Cisco had offered training, mentoring, and certification aligned with the Security Operations Center Analyst role.
The academic fraternity in India is loudly expressing its sincere views over social media, about the importance of education, and about--how to deliver the better education so as to prepare students of India to face the challenges of 21st century. Though you will find that the whole issue and underlying issues they are trying to decipher, no doubt are strong indicators of the heart-felt dissonance & chronic frustration among the academic fraternity in India. We believe that their expressions in social media threads & discussions are just the tip of ice-berg.
Please don't feel offended, if you are an academician. We just intend to point out to–what is being fed to students with existing education system of India. Every academician with some degree of intellect knows that it is not correct and the actual knowledge is not being imparted among students, ONLY FILTERED contents are being allowed to be taught. The key pointer is the question --How would you cut loose, when the education system has been very carefully designed to limit what is to be taught?
For example, Western scholars devised an ethnocentric scheme to explain a phenomenon—one that India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and many other modern Indian intellectuals came to accept– that a previous European people must have once existed, an Indo-European race upon which the world, and India, drew for its linguistic roots and genetic stock. This was propounded as Aryan Invasion Theory (AIT). A theory which had not been substantiated till date and probably would never be. But we have surrendered to such blindly theories without even thinking of challenging them. One, Max Muller comes (in fact, never comes to India even for a single day) and imagines something sitting on his chair, and his imagination becomes a universal truth for we, Indians. How?
Similar distortions and interpretations were allowed with total of our historical chronology. No researcher among us is coming with the work that could reverse the damage done to the story called 'India'. Till date, we are hooked up with European ethnocentrism, colonialism, racism, and anti-Semitism and what they wished us to believe and teach.
Now look at the enigma left by Charles Darwin. His theory is simple, perhaps even too simplistic. Life on Earth has evolved through a series of biological changes as a consequence of random genetic mutations working in conjunction with natural selection. One species gradually changes over time into another. And those species that adapt to changing environmental conditions are best suited to survive and propagate and the weaker die out, producing the most well-known principle of Darwinism—survival of the fittest.
The theory has been taught to children for generations. We have all learned that fish changed into amphibians, amphibians became reptiles, reptiles evolved into birds, and birds changed into animals. However, it is far easier to explain this to school children—with cute illustrations and pictures of a lineup of apes (beginning with those having slumped shoulders, transitioning to two that are finally standing upright)—than it is to prove.
Darwinism is the only scientific theory taught worldwide that has yet to be proved by the rigorous standards of science. Why it is being taught as proven 'Scientific Fact' world over and in India too? How many scientists and researchers from India are choosing to challenge the Darwin's Theory of Evolution? There is no debate among us about 'Tao of Physics' Verses 'Origin of Species'.
Add to agony, and we find that our own Archaeological Research is lagging at least 100-150 years behind the work done world over. How less we as academics know about ancient Harappan civilization of the Indus Valley and Mohenjo-Daro? Forget about 'Mahabalipuram' and the like and where do they fit in our indigenous chronology of historical events.
But how far does the 'Knowledge Filter' go? How much of the actual history of India still lies in the dustbin created by Western ethnocentrism, colonialism, and scientific materialism?
Take a pause and think at what point until her graduation, a student of science is being 'introduced' to the Neil Bohr, Heisenberg, and the works of other prominent Quantum Physicists? When about the famous thought experiment of 'Schrödinger's cat'....and the like? When would they be introduced to alternative worlds of science? When would they be told that there is science beyond the 'Newtonic Physics'? So on...?..??
Though times have changed. And the 'Transfer of Technology' is a bit faster than previous decades, BUT the 'Transfer of Knowledge' of all type is still very slow to India, especially if it is a newer knowledge and challenges the pre-conceived notion of knowledge in any field. It's pathetically slow!
India, with her treatment by the West and her acquiescence to that treatment, typifies the way in which Western intellectualism conquered the world. Call it the "West is best" model: a strict adherence to European doctrines.
We are of the opinion that the education system can't be changed by mere wishful thinking from any body or any section in the society. It could possibly be changed by directly challenging it, but with solid, independent 'Original' works by intellectuals and researchers from India. Somewhere it is about cutting loose. Then our academicians would be able to teach whatever it needs in this century and centuries to come. No help be needed.
If I do comply with the stipulated syllabus, then only I would be allowed to remain a teacher, a professional.
If I choose to teach 'whatever' (instead of what) I like, then again rebellion against the system would leave me out at the periphery of system itself.
If I choose to teach only for the sake of satiating curiosity, then it would become a crime according to the laws of system.
They at least can ensure one thing, i.e., they would 'learn' non-stop for satiating their own curiosity inclusive of all variety of thoughts or concepts, deliberately denying the knowledge filter to operate.
But if I don't share with students what I think or have learnt because of any repercussion, then what am I doing by being there as a teacher? Is my job just to feed the filtered contents and leaving my students with only unilateral lines of thinking and creating a production-line which produces robots only?
If my job is about sharing with my students all types of multi-dimensional and conflicting thoughts/ideas and in the process, leaving them curious enough, open enough and making them actually thinking persons who can think and act independently, then how can I find ways to actually do it?
They would love to learn a lot and be open to all types of ideas, vantage points; and even love more to share those. Because sharing those would keep them at edge, never allowing the complacency to set in. With the passage of time, their students would be left with very wide horizon of thinking........such a spectrum of information and knowledge of all types. Above all, their students would be blessed with an ability to choose and dwell among the conflicting thoughts/ideas.
ONE: Physics says that the nucleus of any (literally any) atom is composed of 2-subatomic particles, viz., Protons, Neutrons. ....Right! Neutrons don't possess the 'charge' of any type, they are said to be neutral. Nucleus is therefore retains its 'positive' charge, because protons actually possesses 'positive' charges. Wonderful! It is what is taught to students of science. Ask them, if it is correct? They would say, Yes, indeed.
TWO: When nucleus is 'positive' charged and the electrons orbiting around it are essentially 'negative' charged, It is again not possible. Because then the opposing charges MUST attract each other......................AND then the whole atom and its electrons must COLLAPSE at its nucleus. HOW IT COMES?
Our point is simple, i.e., what we are feeding to our students is highly filtered and they are enslaved of unilateral dimensions of phenomena, whereby killing the actual 'CURIOSITY' among the students, they are never allowed to think freely by our education system.
CURIOSITY is the only element that should be the target of educational, instructional pedagogy, regardless of subject, curriculum and mode of delivery.
I agree with your views, but the scenario can change if the industry partners also support the educational institutions, sharing the latest technology and imparting the training to the students in their organization. Industry partners even do not allow educational-tou r to the students. We need to strengthen the industry Institute relations.
What is being fed to students in India, is kiss my a** and influenced by vote for me. Neither students bother about it, nor the government had the time to check all these.
Whatever suggested under this title is okay -- everyone is understanding. But when there there is a talk on implementation, then we find no concrete ways to implement the things, as well as no verification methods are there.

I fully agree with your views. In fact students in India are fed and nourished only with stereotyped or conventional knowledge.
Ironically, they even do not know -- whether whatever is taught to them is right or even wrong. They blindly accept and believe everything they read, without analyzing it or indulging in any brain-storming session. Teachers are also only concerned with their salary or job security; not with the mental growth of their students. The whole education scenario is thus, bleak.
Infinite labor and efforts have to be made to create mass awareness and awakening at various levels to invigorate the whole dysfunct-system of education. But how many would be a part of this tough venture is also a moot point.......

World is dynamic & so will be the education. Here equally important to what to teach, is also how to teach--why lecture method is the only methodology and what do you get in the end--an expectation of a sitting job among students. Why?
Because they have been taught to sit over all these years, to sit in class, to sit in exams & to sit at home if you fail.
You never show India Gate & Red Fort in real, they remain mere photographs. You never take children to zoo, it is all in the photographs again. You don’t bother to ask what they want to know, instead you decide it & teach it; and see what they learn is--to listen to you and believe it.
Would'nt it be delightful to hear if anyone of us can recall our school days when a doctor, scientist, administrator or banker told us what they do and how the world out there is changing.
Moreover you kill their confidence right in the childhood since most of their perception about themselves as how good they are in studies and what social status they enjoy among peers, faculty & family, is based on the marks and grades they get at school. Interestingly, any one subject they are weak in is enough to shatter their confidence in themselves & their capability, this is sufficient to make them believe they are not complete. Had we been successful to make them realize--what their passions are & what they are good at, this whole debate would have ended long back.
Also why have the board examinations been matter of such a concern from decades & why they are not mere examinations like the one a child appears in his or her school? What is the need of reiterating & being fussy about it that, “it is your board exams.” Let us introspect as to what is missing, hope it is not the focus.
Higher education will always remain indebted to school education for raw material of human resources they provide, but if higher education is expected to refine their English, reasoning and personality, then when do you expect the system to equip them with concepts, frameworks and intellectual ability along with self-learning. It also depends to a great extent on the requirements of the industry, here our corporates need to decide & convey as to what is more important, refined & sophisticated English-speakin g OR Knowledge, Skills and Abilities that will help the firms to face the challenges to achieve their goals.
I would expect that education is left to educators & education policy be carved out by learned academicians who have concentration on nation building rather than focus on specific firms who still believe human resources are just another tool of production.

Yamila El-Khayat is the Outreach Services Librarian. She currently holds an assistant librarian rank.
Created in 2009 at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Epistemonikos is designed to allow researchers to search evidence-based medical literature using a structured patient or problem, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) question to facilitate clinical decision making. The Epistemonikos Foundation mentions that the main goal for this resource is “to bring evidence closer to those making health decisions, through technology and innovation” [1].
This resource was built to be a repository of all existing evidence related to a health question, allowing users to search for systematic reviews and related material, including but not limited to primary studies included in systematic reviews, overviews of reviews, evidence-based policy briefs and guidelines based on reviews, and structured summaries of evidence presented in reviews. The creators of Epistemonikos, plus over 250 collaborators, monitor 30 databases regularly to populate the resource [2, 3], including Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL. According to the Epistemonikos website, 3 categories of articles are considered for inclusion: broad synthesis (articles synthesizing systematic reviews or, sometimes, primary studies), synthesis of primary studies, and primary studies [4].
Epistemonikos now holds more than 115,000 unique documents, and more than 100,000 relationships between the documents are stored and indexed. Once a unique piece is identified, it is forwarded to an Epistemonikos expert for inclusion in the database.
Epistemonikos is available in nine languages: Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, English, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. All certified translations of a systematic review are linked to the review itself. These are marked as “official translation.” In other cases, collaborators and domain experts translate articles themselves; these are labeled as “collaborative translations.” Many articles are also translated using automated tools like Google Translate; because these translations are not necessarily free of error, these are marked as “automatic translations.”
Epistemonikos offers simple and advanced searches. The simple search is available via a search box on the home page. Here, you can enter a term for a condition or intervention; there is no need for Boolean logic, as the database automatically connects terms. The advanced search allows you to restrict searches to title, authors, or abstract. A search history is also available, which allows you to combine searches. The advanced search supports truncation, exact phrase searching, and Boolean operators. Both simple and advanced searches can be conducted in any of the nine languages that the database supports.
Search results are presented in order of relevance using a rubric based on the frequency with which the search term appears. Results are color coded to indicate whether they are systematic reviews, primary studies, structured summaries of systematic reviews, or broad syntheses. If the search topic has similar subtopics that occur in several of the articles, a “Matrix of Evidence” will appear on the top of the search results.
If you create a personal account (at no charge), you can save documents, searches, and matrixes. Matrixes provide a visualization of the systematic reviews and the primary studies that are available related to a reference.
Once you search, filters are available to narrow your results by category (broad synthesis, systematic review, structured summaries, or primary summaries) or by year (last year, last 5 years, last 10 years, or custom range). Smart filters are automatically applied to remove less relevant results; they can be turned off by clicking on the On/Off button, located directly below the filters.
Figure 1 shows a systematic review related to hypertension. In this screen, you can see the citation and abstract, along with the number of broad syntheses, systematic reviews, and primary studies related to this article. You can also change the language of this article by clicking on the drop-down menu below these.
On the home page of Epistemonikos, next to the search bar, a small window presents a live Twitter feed of what is being said about this resource and topics that it covers. Epistemonikos has a strong social media presence, with accounts you can follow on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. If you search Epistemonikos on Pinterest, you will also find quite a few results.
Epistemonikos seems to work well on current versions of all major web browsers and mobile devices, including phones and other devices with small screens.
Epistemonikos has been compared many times to the Cochrane Library. Strømme et al. note that there are many similarities between these resources, including many articles that overlap, but both have unique features [5]. What makes Epistemonikos stand out is its support for multiple languages, which makes it more user friendly globally.
Epistemonikos is a succinct, complete, and multilingual database that allows users to find information quickly for clinical decision-making. Because most of the literature, especially systematic reviews, is published in English, this resource is a powerful tool for non-English speakers to find systematic reviews, read the literature, and understand concepts presented in their native languages.

Just this week I used Google to find out things like: how much snow does Mt. Hood Meadows have? What time does Sushi Bento in Battle Ground close? Where can I buy a 200’ ethernet cord?
But no matter how advanced Google gets it will never know me. It may know my search behavior, shopping habits and my schedule but it doesn’t know me as a person.
Google has no idea what my childhood was like. It doesn’t know what my dreams and goals are. And it’s clueless about my purpose and calling in life.
But it almost never helps. For example, I’m trying to figure out if I should maintain two blogs right now: this one and then FreelanceHabits.com, where I focus solely on freelance writing tips.
I like the idea of having a “niche” blog. But I hate the idea of having to maintain two blogs. It seems like a ton of work.
But ultimately Google really doesn’t know me. It’s an amazing tool and I use it a lot but I have to remember that it’s just a search engine. It can help me access information but it cannot never impart wisdom to me.

ON AN IKEA bookshelf in post-hipster Brooklyn, wedged neatly between historical tomes on the Vietnam War, sits a thin book with a black cover: The Things They Carried, by Tim O’Brien. I pull down the book and open to the title story. Since first reading it as a high school sophomore, I’ve quoted it many times, and referenced it even more. But it’s been a while since I read the story in its entirety.
Forty years ago this month, Saigon fell. The Republic of Vietnam was no more — only two years after the Paris Peace Accords ostensibly achieved President Nixon’s “Peace with Honor.” In a war chockfull of iconic images, the last evacuation helicopter lifting off the embassy roof proved a final, enduring one.
Yet as historical a moment as that was, few fictional renderings of it have found cultural accomplishment. There’s Miss Saigon, a musical; The Killing Fields, a movie, and a movie mostly about Cambodia; Robert Olen Butler’s 1981 novel The Alleys of Eden, his first. More recent works, like Tatjana Soli’s The Lotus Eaters and Thanhha Lai’s Inside Out and Back Again, haven’t shied away, perhaps abetted by time and distance. Yet for a conflict that yielded hundreds of novels and story collections —and at least a dozen truly excellent ones — the denouement to America’s bloody foreign adventure in southeast Asia remains curiously sparse in high literature.
O’Brien was in graduate school when the fall occurred. His 1973 memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home had been positively received, though the renown he has now was still a few years (and books) away. “That end?” O’Brien said in a phone interview, about April 30, 1975. “That end for us, or something like it, seemed inevitable a long time before it actually happened.”
Karl Marlantes, author of the 2010 novel Matterhorn and a Navy Cross recipient for bravery during a bunker assault in Vietnam, echoed that sentiment in his own phone interview. “When we got the news, I was sitting with friends at lunch, in San Francisco,” he said. “And I remember this feeling of enormous sadness. We could’ve gotten to that point 10 years earlier.”
“It was an indelible image of the waste of it all,” O’Brien continued. “The dead, the wounded, the money, the psychic energy and the moral energy […] just everything.”
Perhaps that’s why few literary treatments have adequately represented the Fall of Saigon. What more could be added to that scene, to that overflowing staircase, to those desperate families? Is that why Vietnam War writers, fiction and non, Vietnamese and American, have tended to focus on the villages and the paddies, the patrols and the protests? Good literature finds its vitality in the messy grays of existence. Other than the sky, there wasn’t much gray in Saigon 40 years ago.
Writers play manifold roles representing war in literature: Part chronicler. Part cipher. Part witness-bearer. Part truth-spitter, even when — especially when? — writing fiction. Part propagandist, if Orwell was right about art, or if critics were right about American Sniper. The best writers and works of Vietnam have ensured the large shadow of that war can’t be escaped, let alone forgotten.
To wit, The Things They Carried has been a staple in American classrooms for decades; O’Brien’s work resonated strongly with my generation of Iraq and Afghanistan vets. Even the most hardcore grunt knew it, an oddity in a world not regarded for literary appreciation. (While the antiwar themes in O’Brien’s books aren’t totally congruent with the philosophy and ideologies of an all-volunteer force, Full Metal Jacket was ferociously antiwar too, and no one’s benefited more from that film than Marine recruiters. Call it postmodern appropriation.) A lot of this is generational — the people who taught us high school literature often came of age during Vietnam — and also circumstantial — a 25-page short story is more digestible for teenagers than, say, the 550-page heroic epic that is Matterhorn, or the 700-pages of labyrinthine brilliance in Denis Johnson’s Tree of Smoke. But mostly it’s because the work is so good that it’s transcended traditional cultural barriers.
Keith Scalia has taught The Things They Carried for 10 years in his Brooklyn high school classroom. He originally began teaching it after losing a friend to an IED in Iraq, but includes it in his curriculum now more for writing craft purposes. In an email, Scalia wrote that “students appreciate [The Things They Carried] because they begin to understand the tangible weight vs. the intangible weight of things […] they begin to reconsider their own priorities.”
Across the country, in San Luis Obispo, California, English teacher Graham Culbertson has seen similar connections made between students and O’Brien’s text. His high schoolers have been intrigued with the idea of a young person “being forcibly ripped out of their controlled environment and placed someplace where morality becomes muddled, social restriction decays, and identity dissolves.” It’s not all noble scholarly pursuit, though. “There’s a strange release valve,” according to Culbertson. “[The stories] let students play in a dangerous world so opposite their own, without having to actually physically experience it.”
For his part, O’Brien is still surprised at the resonance of his work. But 20-plus years after The Things They Carried was published, and 40-plus years after the war it chronicles, he hopes it still makes people ask certain questions, of themselves and of others. “Killing people is a big deal,” he said. “Dying’s a big deal. I can’t think of bigger deals. What about patience? What about thoughtfulness? Is there another way to do this? These questions matter.
“No matter how righteous a war, it’s a terrible, sad and awful thing. Sometimes the reasons are defensible. But most of the time, they’re not.”
After encountering The Things They Carried during my own high school years, I became fixated with Vietnam War literature, each new book and story only revealing how much deeper the subject was. And what a dark, seductive subject. As a millennial — a child of Vietnam protesters, a nephew of a Vietnam vet, a grandchild of two World War II veterans, one a citizen-soldier and the other a career officer — it felt like the key to what’d happened in the American Century, how and where it all went wrong. If there weren’t any answers in the texts of its time, perhaps there might be something resembling an explanation.
Back in my Brooklyn apartment, I’m halfway through O’Brien’s title story. I’ve revisited a number of underlined passages, and marked a few new ones, as well. I’d forgotten how quietly it vacillates between the earnest and the ironic. The spare prose makes it deceptively accessible — a certain tradition in American war writing, from Crane to Hemingway to Salter. Many young writers have aped this style without understanding that it’s really the vast architecture of subtext that gives it potency. And subtext must be earned. In The Things They Carried, it’s not so much the line “All the things a medic must carry, including M&M’s for especially bad wounds” that’s worth emulating, but everything leading up to and behind and packed within the phrase.
I’m also surprised by how PG O’Brien’s story is. This defies my memory of it. There are some references to dope and condoms, an F-bomb here and there. But there’s a pervasive gentleness, something that has a bit to do with Lieutenant Jimmy Cross’s virgin back home and a lot to do with the reactive nature of the infantry platoon nominally on search-and-destroy missions. In comparison, my friend Phil Klay’s Redeployment, a story collection about Iraq, is downright profane. And Vietnam in HD, the History Channel’s 2011 documentary miniseries, seems a savage funhouse mirror of O’Brien’s story. Of course, that’s part of its beauty — it’s lean and rhythmic and self-contained in a way the war it’s about never was.
Then again, obscenity can be a subjective thing. Months ago, a friend of a friend fought her Florida school board to teach The Things They Carried in her 12th-grade classroom. I typed a short note of support, using words like “short-sighted,” “moral ambiguities,” and “imperative.” No decision has yet come down. I’ve since been told that some of the board members and parents “don’t want thinking, informed children. They want children who are safe and clean.”
In the era of an all-volunteer force and one percent of the population serving in uniform, war can be avoided and ignored, whether it’s happening now in the Middle East or it happened decades ago in southeast Asia. “Safe and clean” may be a terrifying parenting strategy, but that doesn’t make these parents wrong about war’s relationship to 21st century-America. War’s an ugly, bothersome abstraction, not just for them and their kids, but for most of the country. Let someone else’s sons and daughters deal with it.
Karl Marlantes took a more historical approach about the state of the civilian-military divide, alluding to the Praetorian Guard, then mentioning a soldier he’d met at Fort Bragg preparing to deploy to combat for the seventh time.
The intersection of war and art and culture generally happens in waves. The late ’60s to the mid-’70s saw the first wave of Vietnam literature, nonfiction accounts of varying quality written by journalists and veterans (The best include Jonathan Schell’s The Village of Ben Suc, Philip Caputo’s A Rumor of War, Frances FitzGerald’s Fire in the Lake, Norman Mailer’s The Armies of the Night, Susan Sontag’s “Trip to Hanoi,” Seymour Hersh’s My Lai 4 and Ron Glasser’s 365 Days). Then came the early novels, creative nonfiction, and poetry — Robert Stone’s Dog Soldiers (1974), Loyd Little’s Parthian Shot (1975), Michael Herr’s Dispatches (1977), Jim Webb’s Fields of Fire (1978), O’Brien’s Going After Cacciato (1978), Gus Hasford’s The Short-Timers (1979), John Del Vecchio’s The 13th Valley (1982), Stephen Wright’s Meditations in Green (1983), Robert Mason’s Chickenhawk (1983), and poetry collections by Yusef Komunyakaa and Bruce Weigl are a few examples of this second wave. (Nearly all the initial Vietnam voices were male and American. Finding literary texts from other perspectives took time — more on that later.)
Marlantes, who worked and reworked Matterhorn for decades, pointed out in his interview that many of these non-journo works shared a common approach. “Early on, it was almost all surrealistic,” he said, mentioning the impact Apocalypse Now had on burgeoning Vietnam writers. “For people who were trying to seriously grapple with the war, they couldn’t quite put it together yet — too much had happened. It was still too fresh.”
Considering surrealism originally emerged from the wreckage of World War I and a world gone mad, there’s probably something to his theory. In contrast, Matterhorn basks in a sort of gritty realism. “I tried very hard to get the details right,” Marlantes said, something indicative of the eventual trajectory of Vietnam-related literature.
In a 1984 essay for The New York Times, book critic Michiko Kakutani traces the literary output of Vietnam to that point, and considers the “typical Bildungroman” quality of many of the works. “They relate the story of a young man, usually identifiable with the author, whose progress from idealism to disillusionment echoes the changes that America itself underwent in the 60’s,” she wrote. Later in the essay, Kakutani explores why there’s been such a literary focus on the micro Vietnam experience, and essentially predicts the Trees of Smokes still decades away: “A large novel that embraces the entire scene, that deals with the military and political complexities of the war, its consequences in public and private lives, as well as its reverberations at home — that novel has yet to be written.”
The mid-to-late ’80s brought a third wave of Vietnam War-related art to American culture, one with more breadth and wider views than its forebears. The societal context of the era is interesting; Reagan’s America was at its peak, and the younger protesters and veterans of Vietnam had become parents, trading out rifles and picket signs for diapers and cartoons. The war had been a great schism across our national consciousness, and though schisms like that can heal and scar over, they never really go away.
Wallace Terry’s oral history Bloods: Black Veterans of the Vietnam War burst upon the book world in 1984, bringing long-disregarded aspects of the war to the forefront. Platoon (1986) and Full Metal Jacket (1987) became instant war film classics. Miss Saigon debuted in 1989. Another soldier-turned-author, Larry Heinemann, won the 1987 National Book Award for Fiction for Paco’s Story, shockingly upsetting Toni Morrison’s Beloved. And Vietnamese authors began finding publication for works about the war from the other side: Truong Nhu Tang’s 1985 A Vietcong Memoir, Le Ly Hayslip’s 1989 memoir When Heaven and Earth Changed Places, and Bao Ninh’s 1990 novel The Sorrow of War are but three examples.
Homefront literature also unfurled during this time. Tobias Wolff’s 1984 novella The Barracks Thief followed a group of paratroopers on Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Olen Butler was beginning to write from the perspective of Vietnamese immigrants living in the American South, stories that would eventually become the Pulitzer Prize-winning collection A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain. And war literature written by women, to include Lynda Van Devanter’s 1983 army nurse memoir Home Before Morning and Jayne Anne Phillips’s 1984 novel Machine Dreams began to finally find publication. The great Joan Didion’s novel Democracy landed shortly thereafter, to much acclaim.
(These works are, of course, only a few of many, and I mention them solely to provide a sampling of the variety and depth of the canon. Oversights are inevitable, and for that I apologize.)
In the midst of this prevalent literary blooming, O’Brien was crafting what would become his masterwork. “The Things They Carried” (the story) was first published by Esquire in 1986. The Things They Carried (the book) came out four years later, collecting stories that’d appeared in publications like Granta and GQ.
Like the various waves of Vietnam literature, O’Brien’s writing evolved over time. His first book, his memoir, has a lyrical fury to it — a bit of rawness that stands out compared to his later technical precision. That lyricism and anger isn’t gone in The Things They Carried, but it’s more restrained, more exact. Further, the dreaminess of Going After Cacciato can still be found in some The Things They Carried stories, but in doses, and powered more by a sort of nostalgic sadness than the overwhelming desire to escape the jungle.
While it’s tempting to try and match O’Brien’s stages as a writer to his country’s reckoning with the Vietnam War, that’s too neat to be anything but a thinkpiece verdict. Instead, when looking at his novels and stories in sequence, it seems that it’s simply the work of a gifted storyteller circling and re-circling a topic and idea until he gets it right, exactly right, just as he’d envisioned it in his head some far-gone day decades before.
Forty years after the Fall of Saigon, I finish rereading “The Things They Carried” in my apartment. The nucleus of the story occurs in a tidy paragraph just past the halfway point — “Lieutenant Jimmy Cross led his men into the village of Than Khe. They burned everything.”
Other than the continual grind of humping through the jungle, and a short scene of burning letters, that’s the extent of agency exhibited. The story has both nothing and everything to do with the village of Than Khe, and also nothing and everything to do with the fallen soldier Lavender.
That duality isn’t what makes me immediately reread the story again, though. It’s the use of repetition, the way O’Brien keeps coming back to the same moments and memories, assaulting them from different angles. The infantry platoon in “The Things They Carried” may be (mostly) reactive in its pages, but its author certainly isn’t.
All these years later, the annals of Vietnam War lit continues to grow and expand. Just this spring, two new novels were released, Quan Barry’s She Weeps Each Time You’re Born and Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Sympathizer, very different books following very different Vietnamese protagonists. The Sympathizer even opens during the Fall of Saigon, lending further credence to the idea that no subject is beyond fiction, given enough time and distance.
The question endures, though: does any of it make a difference? Storytelling itself is its own purpose, and a worthy one, but writers of conflict tend to have more pragmatic ambitions for their work.
After receiving the 2012 Dayton Peace Prize, O’Brien lamented spending much of his professional life being labeled a war writer. He’d been seeking peace in his works, he believed. During our interview, I asked him to clarify what he meant by that.
“I’m not a war writer,” he said. “I’m a person writing about war with the objective of making people think twice about it.”
While that might seem like semantics to some, I get it. War is not a descriptor to be stuck on a person. War is a subject — one of the most destructive, and self-destructive, human endeavors.
When asked if he’d hoped his work could effect change, O’Brien paraphrased a Kurt Vonnegut line. “I could no more write an antiwar book than I could an anti-glacier book,” he said. “You have to be honest about yourself and your experiences and your work, and then do your best.” Still though, I heard disappointment in his voice as he connected Vietnam with the brushfire wars of today. “All these years later, it feels like we’ve gotten nowhere,” he said.
Then he laughed, long and deep. “But the alternative is to give up. That, I haven’t been willing to do yet.”

IT’S OFTEN TEMPTING, and perhaps not wholly inaccurate, to think of Fordist culture largely in terms of repression. Home-improving suburban dads, over-medicated housewives, their children placated by free milk, discreet homosexuals, the integration of work and leisure, to say nothing of the uneasy settlement of labor and capital itself: all of these social forms sometimes seem to add up to nothing more than a massive blockage. While this view is preferable to a cloying nostalgia, its limitations are manifold — as is clear, for instance, in any encounter with the fiction of J. G. Ballard. Ballard’s work of the 1960s and ’70s dissected the flagrant perversity of midcentury life as the Fordist economy teetered on the edge of collapse. For Ballard, the bourgeois subject is not defined by the difficulties of an allegiance with reality so much as a complete unmooring from its constraints in ever-expanding whorls of production and consumption. In other words, his characters are not neurotic but out-and-out psychotic.
Ballard’s vision of Fordist consumer culture was most obviously developed in his autoerotic Crash (1973). For whatever else might be observed about Ballard’s most infamous novel, it is surely a carefully plotted return to the emblematic unit of regulatory capitalism, a manically rational exposition of the car’s role in 20th-century life. Throughout the narrative, Ballard’s measured prose unfurls rather than explodes the erotic logic of the midcentury commodity, revealing a tightly integrated world of production and consumption. This identity has, however, itself proved problematic in accounts of his life and work. In particular, commentators often seem to find it hard to reconcile the “normality” of Ballard’s own everyday life with the grueling psychopathology of his fictions, as if a slick loft, crumbling tenement, or grimy squat would somehow necessarily make one more psychotic than a suburban semi.
There is a longer history of the ideology of madness at work here, according to which the upper and lower classes are the unruly subjects of modernity, while aristocratic orgies and proletarian street life are cast in axiomatic opposition to orderly middle-class domesticity. Marx’s innovation within this tradition was to invent the category of the lumpenproletariat to protect the working class proper from such insinuations, while, at least in his more moralistic moments, more or less upholding the essential structure at work. In The Class Struggles in France, 1848-1850 (1850), for instance, “blood and filth comingle” through an unholy alliance between the finance aristocracy and the lumpenproletariat. Marx’s distinction between the “scum and refuse” of the lumpenproletariat and the orderly, potentially revolutionary working class sets the stage for the development of a powerfully normative strain of leftist culture that stressed an ethos of proletarian discipline. This ethos was in turn sublated by the postwar Fordist settlement, producing its paradigmatic social unit: the steadfast middle-income family, contrasted to the scabs and agitators below and the toffs above.
Ballard was clearly invested in scrambling this pervasive psychosocial structuration, creating self-contained fictional worlds of middle-class psychosis throughout his career. Bizarrely trapped on a traffic island, a doctor regresses to howling madness in Concrete Island (1973); reared in a gated community, a gaggle of pampered children rise up and murder their parents in Running Wild (1988); a similar setting is also deployed for the Volvo revolution of Millennium People (2003). Ballard’s process of re-classing madness is perhaps rendered most explicit in The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), where medical expertise and the culture industry come together with horrifying results. At one point a characteristically nonplussed character comments on one of the gruesome living dioramas of the story’s title, assembled by an unhinged psychiatrist: “one day he would carry out a Marxist analysis of this lumpen intelligentsia.”
While it would be inaccurate to label Ballard any sort of Marxist, one may take this as more than a passing remark or jibe. For it is precisely this morass of disintegrating expertise that Ballard then concretizes in High-Rise (1975), in which the professional middle classes run amok, grow ragged, and fester in an expensive Brutalist condominium building. The high-rise quickly deteriorates into open gang warfare, with “clans” of middle-aged, bourgeois reprobates stalking its corridors in a fashion usually attributed to lumpenproletarian youths, before finally regressing to a series of rudimentary enclaves rife with incest, rape, and cannibalism. Quite explicitly a witty retort to the snobbery of Anthony Burgess and Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange (1962/1971), much of High-Rise’s humor lies in its portrayal of club-wielding doctors, tax specialists, television presenters, sociologists, and market researchers, pillaging their Brutalist building just like Alex and his droogs. In addition to the shock to bourgeois perceptions engendered by this reversal, High-Rise presents a further interpretative problem: How do we reconcile the relative homogeneity of the residents’ class positions with the insistently hierarchical structure of their setting? Fundamentally, is the novel even about class as such?
This question comes into clearer focus with the realization that the novel is an allegory of Burnhamite technocracy. In The Managerial Revolution (1941), James Burnham theorized the rise of a new managerialist middle class, whose technical expertise would reign supreme over the new world order. Later in his career, Burnham deplored the excesses of the social and sexual revolutions that blew apart the corporatism that he had, to a limited extent, correctly predicted. It’s hard not to see Ballard’s novel as a satire on Burnham as much as it is a riposte to A Clockwork Orange — the very architecture of the building symbolizing the social ascent of its residents with their “limitless professional expertise,” and their dissolution into violent anarchy mocking Burnham’s later harrumphing dislike for social liberalization. The main point here, as in Crash and many other Ballard novels, is that all of these self-contained middle-class subjects are in fact the real perverts of modernity — sociopathic, cybernetic, and self-integrated in a way that no proletarian nor haute bourgeois could ever hope to be.
The managerial madness of High-Rise is astutely captured in Ben Wheatley’s film, released this year to insufficient critical acclaim. During the film’s brilliant central sequence, a riot breaks out in the building’s 15th-floor supermarket. One of High-Rise’s trio of antiheroes, pitch-perfect Dr. Robert Laing (Tom Hiddleston), finally finds what he has been looking for: a tin of gray paint. Another resident tries to appropriate the paint as he makes for the exit, and a brutal fight ensues, the usually coolly detached Laing screaming, “It’s my paint!” as he viciously maims the would-be home-improvement bandit. The middle classes have finally gone to war for their right to modestly customize their homes. Returning with relief to his apartment, Laing obsessively paints the walls, before remarking with genuine pride, “I think I’ve finally found the right tone.”
This line — one of screenwriter Amy Jump’s many excellent additions to Ballard’s novel — could be accurately applied to Wheatley’s adaptation. Little known outside the UK, Wheatley has specialized in off-key, low-budget productions, including the claustrophobic kitchen-sink gangster flick Down Terrace (2009), the psychological horror film Kill List (2011), and Sightseers (2012), a bleakly comic take on the Bonnie and Clyde story set in the English countryside. Within this filmography, there is a sense of Wheatley constantly reaching for tonal shifts, at times rather laboriously tweaking the viewer’s perceptions. And while his earlier work does features some interesting moments (the apparent switch in directorial vision, for instance, from Leigh to Lynch via Tarantino in Kill List), it is only in High-Rise that Wheatley, like Laing himself, has really come into his own.
I would go so far as to suggest that Wheatley’s High-Rise is the best major film of a Ballard novel to date. David Cronenberg’s notorious Crash (1996) captures the solemn madness and deadened aesthetic of Ballard’s novel with great dexterity, yet the pacing of the film fails to register the manic cycles of the novel. For all of Spielberg’s evident suitability to the task, Empire of the Sun (1987) was markedly less successful. Spielberg lards Ballard’s story of imperial baton-passing and childhood wonder with more than his usual dose of transcendental innocence, unintentionally infecting the viewer with a distinct aversion to small children. High-Rise, however, doesn’t so much strike a balance between fidelity and invention as develop an intensely fetishistic relationship to the novel and its period that, rather like Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon (1975), comes out the other side of historical accuracy to a place far more compelling.
In an interview on the notably fanatical Ballard fan site ballardian.com, Wheatley remarked that it was hard to find a location for the film, seeing as so many Brutalist buildings had been pulled down. In the end, the film was shot on an abandoned project in Bangor, Northern Ireland, to magnificent effect. The play of light over the high-rise captures the deeply seductive aspects of its concrete surfaces, while the interiors scream late midcentury in their fussy futurism, the counterpoint to the uncompromising intrusion of raw concrete into the walls of the apartments themselves — a detail that, as Wheatley observes in the interview, represents the way in which the building itself comes to dominate its residents. That being said, one of the most satisfying elements of the setting is how, in its attractiveness, it resists the usual screed against Brutalism. As Owen Hatherley points out in his passionate defense of the style, Militant Modernism (2009), it’s hardly the mass of concrete in itself that creates social deprivation.
The casting and acting are also superb, particularly in the three main characters. Tom Hiddleston’s Laing is enticingly icy, while Jeremy Irons’s portrayal of the building’s quixotic architect, Royal, and Luke Evans’s bristling documentary filmmaker-cum-rapist Richard Wilder strike the right vile notes. Sienna Miller’s silkily hedonistic Charlotte Melville is similarly well done, while Elisabeth Moss beautifully captures the listlessness of Wilder’s wife, the most sympathetic character in both the novel and the film.
It is worth stressing that Jump — Wheatley’s working partner on a number of productions — also edited the film, which means it really makes more sense to credit the work as a Jump and Wheatley production. The film is superbly edited and scripted by Jump through a series of canny additions and excisions. Laing’s sociopathy is augmented in a new plot line that sees him falsely diagnosing a serious brain injury in a character who slighted him earlier in the film. Meanwhile, the role of Royal’s nostalgic wife is extended through a series of deliberately gauche Marie Antoinette references that may jar some viewers, but which beautifully illustrate the essentially petit-bourgeois pretentions of the high-rise’s most wealthy residents. During a meeting in which the top-floor clan makes plans for their dominance of the building, Pangbourne (James Purefoy’s slightly over-egged gynecologist) asks Royal to “lead a delegation.” Royal asks blithely “where to, the United Nations?” to which his wife, not missing a beat, replies, “to the supermarket” — where, of course, she suggests they obtain cake.
This kind of appropriately bad taste abounds in the film; it delights, for instance, in Ballard’s shocking opening, which sees Laing calmly eating Royal’s Alsatian and pondering his newfound happiness. We get a full shot of the unfortunate animal roasting on a spit, to the serene accompaniment of the recorder entry of a Bach Brandenburg Concerto (this off-kilter deployment of Bach is a touch recognizable to followers of bad British television from Wheatley’s hand in Modern Toss). Indeed, the film’s score and soundtrack are suitably gorgeous throughout, intoning the sheer guilty pleasures of alienated hedonism. The final movement of the Bach is deployed as the building’s mayhem reaches the point of no return, complete with a Catherine the Great reference that one had been suspecting would turn up from the first surreal appearance of a horse on the building’s roof — again an addition made by Jump and Wheatley. A string quartet arrangement of ABBA’s “SOS” urges on a costume ball on the top floor, before Portishead’s haunting cover of the same track accompanies the building’s final stages of disintegration. Clint Mansell’s moody score works well in its alternation between dramatic foreshadowing and innocent delight — Laing’s pride at his home-decorating skills, for instance, is accompanied by a pastiche of a slushy midcentury Hollywood score, while the building itself receives its own series of musical motifs, at turns excited and foreboding.
It is something of a cliché, perhaps to be resisted, to call Ballard “prophetic,” yet he does appear to have had a knack for predicting the future 10 years in advance. Current political developments in Britain, for instance, were eerily foreshadowed in Ballard’s final novel Kingdom Come (2006), a tale of homegrown fascism directed against an arrogant metropolitan elite as well as against eastern European and Asian citizens. And High-Rise is set, with the same creepy prescience, on the site of the Docklands development, which began to boom in the mid-1980s. But it is probably more accurate to suggest that, like Balzac — another major influence, given his own obsessively striated dwellings — Ballard’s novel predicts through existing social typicality, rather than prophetic vision.
Wheatley ends his adaptation with a surreal projection: the geekily bespectacled Toby sets up a makeshift listening post, absorbed in a famous Thatcher speech, while blowing bubbles through a pipe. Initially this image might seem a little too obvious — albeit not an “anachronism” as one reviewer inanely dubbed it — for it hardly needs pointing out that Ballard’s novel anticipates the chaotic anomie of Thatcher’s Britain, while the date of the speech, 1976, is a little on the nose for a novel that came out in 1975. Yet the argument of the speech is important, opening up a more telling reading of the film: Thatcher intones, “Where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.” Ballard’s politics are always hard to gauge, but it is safe to say that he was never misty-eyed about the postwar settlement. And though the neoliberal alternative was to prove yet more pitilessly oppressive, with a little interpretative license one might conclude that Ballard, Jump, and Wheatley all unfold brilliant variations on Thatcher’s theme — which was itself to echo beyond her control. For it is surely the case that even free market buccaneers need their Burnhamite technocrats as much as the next pervert.

The 16th Annual Gardena Jazz Festival held on Sunday August 26th was a huge success. The festival sold out 3 weeks in advance. The event gathered a stellar lineup of some of the best musicians in the country for a one-day concert in a gorgeous natural setting at Rowley Park. This year’s performers included Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Euge Groove, Naturally Seven, Alex Bugnon, Donald Hayes and the Fernando Pullum Youth Jazz Orchestra on the main stage and DW3 and J Boykins among others on the second stage.
The Gardena Jazz Festival has always had the feeling of a local family gathering, and with good reason. It was founded by then Gardena City Councilman and now State Senator Steven Bradford as a free community festival. Under Senator Bradford’s leadership, the festival has grown to over 10,000.
Even with the temperature in the low to mid ninety’s the artists and DJ got the concert goers on their feet to dance and have a good time. Fans were able to experience great music at a relatively low price, a wide variety of food from local restaurants and businesses, unique vendors to shop from and a fun time in the park. Many folks brought lawn chairs and picnic baskets and enjoyed some good old fashion home cooking.
“As a city leader in Gardena for 12 years, I am proud to see the Gardena Jazz Festival continues to be a huge success in bringing world- class talent, community members and leaders to the City each year for an amazing day filled unity, entertainment and fellowship. I would like to thank everyone who made this year’s event so special and look forward to next year.

So now you’re a yoga teacher.* You’re in love with your life, you’re in love with yoga, everything is super amazing, rainbows and sunshine!
Or, maybe it is for a while, anyway. If you haven’t read the first part of this series, I recommend checking it out to review some of the “yogastential crises” that can arise for yoga teachers throughout their career. Even though yoga and meditation have changed my life, and there is nothing I’d rather do for a living than to share these practices with others– it is not all incense and “Namaste.” I’ve fallen out of love with yoga multiple times (or at least with certain aspects of, or styles of contemporary yoga). I’ve had serious financial stress. I’ve had brutal injuries and personal grief and no choice but to show up and teach.
I haven’t always handled these situations particularly skillfully, but I have always learned something. Along the way, I’ve found some ways to manage the yoga-teacher work/life balance that I’ve found helpful to both prevent burnout and create a structure that will support you, Fellow Yoga Teacher, in the event of a personal crisis. Here’s a clickbait sentence for you: Check out my Ten Strategies For Avoiding Yoga Teacher Burnout Below!
1. Find time for your own practice. If you are able to take classes with a teacher locally, do! Working with another teacher that you like and trust is an excellent way to receive the benefits of yoga and to feel cared for and nurtured. If that is not possible, create space in your home for your own practice and commit to it, even if it’s just 20 minutes and two poses, twice a week.
Your own practice means just that– your practice. This is time for you on your mat. It does not have to look anything like a studio practice. It does not have to be structured in any particular way, and it definitely should not be a time that you are creating a sequence for your students or rehearsing for class.
What happens if you don’t manage to find time to practice? Your teaching might start to feel stale, or boring to you. You might lose touch with the reasons why you wanted to teach yoga in the first place. Possibly even worse is a feeling of resentment and frustration that arises while you are teaching because your own needs are not being met.
2. Consider another movement practice. From time to time, our asana practice may not feel like a refuge; it might feel like work. Or, we may find that we are not getting a well-rounded physical experience from just practicing yoga. Adding another movement practice to your routine will give you the opportunity to practice mindful embodiment and joyful movement in a way that has nothing at all to do with yoga– and sometimes that can be a really good, healthy thing! Jazzercise, walking, Tai Chi, Jiu Jitsu, soccer, biking, swimming, gym time– whatever gets you into your body and feeling good about moving.
When I first started teaching, I thought yoga was THE THING. I would never need to exercise or do anything else. After a few years of just yoga, I was really craving something different in my body. Adding strength training, cardio, and other creative workouts to my own weekly routine has given me a renewed appreciation for my yoga practice, and keeps my body more balanced. It’s also really, really nice to do something sometimes that isn’t yoga. When your whole life is yoga (work, friends, recreation)– you definitely run the risk of burning out. Similarly…
3. Have non-yoga interests & friends. Immersion into the yogic path is wonderful. However, when it is our livelihood, our pastime, and our refuge, we can easily become imbalanced and insulated. Continue to cultivate interests and friendships that are outside of the “yoga world.”
One of the best experiences of my adult life was learning to ride a dirt bike (yep, motorcycle you ride in the woods). It was completely different from anything that I had ever done, and as a new yoga teacher, I probably would have felt it was un-yogic and vaguely wrong in some way. However, the time I spent doing something so outside the yoga box and the awesome community of people I met doing it (hint: we have very little else in common beyond the bikes) were really refreshing, eye-opening and gave me a different way of interacting with the world.
4. Have a mentor or teacher that you can turn to. I’ve found it helpful to have a mentor or teacher that I can trust. This might be a yoga professional, or it might be someone else in your life. In my case, it’s several different people that can advise me when I need help with running my business; teaching a class; dealing with teaching challenges; my own meditation practice.
5. Have a peer group that you can use for reflection and support. Make connections with other yoga teachers and use them to get and give support. Teaching yoga can be difficult and lonely at times as you are offering so much to others. Having peers that you can call after a difficult class, or if you’re experiencing isolation, can help prevent burnout.
Look, I know how it feels to teach a class and think, “That was the worst class anyone has ever taught, ever. I have no business doing this for a living.” Every yoga teacher knows what that feels like. But in that moment of self-doubt and misery, we feel really isolated. Having a friend at the other end of a call or a text will remind you that 1) everyone has a bad class, or a bad day, or a bad year and 2) we’re really not alone.
6. Pursue Continuing Education that lights you up. Workshops, online courses, online classes, online blogs are great ways to keep your teaching fresh and to keep yourself interested and connected to the teaching experience. You can might study philosophy, pranayama, alignment, anatomy, a different style of yoga, history, alternate movement practices and how to integrate them into yoga, chanting, Sanskrit, cueing, meditation, or anything at all that sparks your interest.
Free or low-cost online workshops and series are available online through Yoga Journal, Yoga Alliance, and Yoga International. I often find that just taking an online class can provide me with material to keep my students (and me!) engaged and inquisitive.
7. Separate work from non-work. Because our schedules tend to be erratic, and we often do our class planning and business work at home, it is essential that we create a separation between “work” and “non-work.” I use a paper schedule to plan my day, separating it into blocks of time in which I am working, planning, relaxing/eating, exercising, meditating, etc. Creating structure around your work schedule is crucial to maintain a healthy work/life balance. It helps you to stay focused during work time (even when you’re working on your couch) and to give yourself permission to really relax when you’re not working.
8. Balances Your Yes and No: While there will be times in our lives where we need to work a lot, saying “yes” to as many opportunities as we can, keep in mind that for our own physical and emotional well-being, we cannot do all things for all people, and that we need to put our own self-care first so that we can care for others. Does saying “yes” to someone else mean that you’re saying “no” to yourself? If you are finding difficulty with this, check in with a mentor, peer, or therapist to get feedback on finding balance.
9. Eat well and rest enough. While this is good advice for anybody, it’s an essential part of self-care for yoga teachers. If we show up to teach tired and poorly nourished, we’re not able to effectively care for our students. You’re gonna be CRANKY! And if you can’t take it out on your students (I hope you don’t)– it’s going to come out somewhere else. Road rage. A fight with a loved one. Screaming at stupid television commercials.
Oh, and do what you can to make sure you have at least one day off from work. I know, I know– you’re trying to make a living and you have to say “yes” to as many opportunities as you can. If you absolutely must work every day, create an end date by which you’ll make a change. This is one of the biggest pieces of advice I can offer you. You need time off. Period.
10. Create your wellness team & and maintenance schedule. You know this: in order to care for others, we must first care for ourselves. You probably will not need all of the following, but keep in mind that in addition to caring for our students’ bodies by using our own, we are teaching them to be emotionally and mentally well. If our own bodies, hearts and minds are not in good shape, we will have a much harder time doing our job. Not only do we need to have a wellness team, it’s important that we not wait until we are burnt out, sick, or on the verge of collapse before we make an appointment. Invest in caring for your body and emotional well-being on a regular schedule. Your team might include your massage therapist or other body-worker; acupuncturist; therapist, psychiatrist, or psychologist; physical therapist, kinesiologist, chiropractor, osteopath; recovery support groups; and even a good GP that you can call when you need one.
What do you think, yoga teachers? I’d love to hear your strategies, what works, what doesn’t, and how you’ve gotten through the challenging times. Please leave a comment below and let’s support each other!

“Do what you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life,” they say. “Follow your dreams!” “Do what you love and the money will follow!” Sometimes, we’re quoted Rumi: “Let the beauty you love be what you do.” Or, the Bhagavad Gita: “It is better to do your own duty badly than to perfectly do another’s.”
The yoga teaching career has an aura of spirituality, dharma, health and wellness around it that, to the outside eye, would make it seem like the ideal job for someone who values these things. You love yoga, you’re always reading about it, thinking about it, talking about it, why not teach it? And, as a yoga teacher, you find that you really do love your job– you get to help other people, the work atmosphere is often ideal, most of your students and fellow teachers are the sort of people you’d choose to spend time with.
But what happens when your yoga practice—- your refuge, your solace, your peace, your sanctuary– becomes your life? Where do you turn when your getaway has become a source of uncertain income, the scene of your career challenges, and the cause of inner turmoil?
After six years (3,000+ hours) of teaching yoga and running/owning a studio, I have not only experienced a few of what I’m calling “yogastential crises,” I’ve seen others work through them, too.
A major change in your personal life– divorce, death, etc.– and yet you must still teach yoga classes. How do you stay authentic while still creating a safe space for students to have their own experience?
A health crisis or injury– energy is low, you are unable to use your body to demonstrate or practice yoga yourself. Teaching is more difficult and you’ve lost your own practice (on top of other pain, stress or discomfort).
You’ve been teaching many classes and you lack funds or time for self-care. It feels like everyone needs you and there’s not enough support for your own needs. You’re depleted, exhausted, cranky and resentful of others.
Financial stress– teaching yoga is not particularly lucrative and you may not be able to pay your bills.
You’ve fallen out of love with yoga, or you’re just not sure it works anymore. Maybe you’ve got a yoga injury, or any of the above issues are feeling overwhelming. Your own practice is non-existent, and you feel like a hypocrite.
While any of these might happen to any yoga student, when it happens to the teacher, it can be a particularly painful and even desperate situation. At some point, if you’re making yoga teaching your career, you will find yourself in the midst of a yogastential crisis. You might wonder whether or not it makes sense to keep teaching yoga, or if it’s time to throw in the (yogitoes) towel.
If you’re going through any of these– please, please know that you’re not alone. Our profession can feel really lonely if we don’t have a support system set up; sometimes we feel like we have to have it all together or we’re not really doing it right, somehow. I don’t know a yoga teacher who has not experienced one of these crises. I’ve been through most of these, and ended up a more empathetic person and a better teacher, and with a better idea of how to be create resiliency and prevent burnout.
Take heart: while pain is inevitable, suffering may, perhaps, be avoided. There are some ways that we can set ourselves up to weather the challenges of our yoga teaching careers. In the second part of this series, I’ll offer a few strategies that I’ve found helpful to stay (relatively) sane, healthy and grounded as a yoga teacher.

And so it is that you find yourself, on a dreary Thursday afternoon, vacuuming the floor and singing “We Are the World.” You are wearing pajama pants and a tan sports bra and singing the backup parts too. You sound fantastic, but your dogs are cowering under the bed in terror. A knock on the door- oh, the mail person is here with a box, and how confused she is to see that from the waist up, you appear to be strangely, smoothly naked as a Skipper doll.
If you are a self-employed yoga teacher, you understand. Sports bra? Of course, you own 436 of them, and vacuuming is hot work. Pajamas? Naturally, because after you taught two classes and took the second shower of the day, you needed a nap so that you could get up and teach two more that evening. And why are you vacuuming at 3:30 on a Thursday? Well, it’s a matter of space.
Since leaving my 9-5ish job last July, I’ve been struggling a bit to find balance. With a traditional sort of job, your space is automatically accounted for. Days are for working (and complaining about working). Evenings are for dinner, family stuff, chores, entertainment. Stuff that doesn’t make you money, mostly. There’s a pretty clear demarcation between work/not-work.
Once you become self-employed, everything sort of gets fuzzy. You love what you do, so none of it quite feels like work… but precisely because of that, it’s not so easy (at least, in my case it isn’t) to see where work ends and the rest of your life begins.
Right now my time is split between teaching and managing a yoga studio. Time when I’m at the studio- that’s definitely work, right? Buying studio supplies, planning classes- also work. But what about blogging? In theory, I’m building an audience, or something… or is it just fun? Social media? Gotta do it if you want to promote yourself and the business- but it’s hard to stay on-task and just do the business stuff without getting sucked into a conversation in my personal news feed. What about keeping up with other yoga blogs? Research, or fun? Taking other teachers’ classes? Leading the meditation group at the studio?
After a while, although none of it seemed really like “work,” I started to notice that it always felt like I was working. Being self-employed, in my case, means working 7 days a week. At some point I’ll be able to take a day off, but for now, it’s just not possible.
“I wish I could take a vacation,” I said to a friend, several months ago. “Isn’t your whole life a vacation?” he responded. Of course this irritated me, but there was an element of truth to it. With all of the flexibility in my schedule, why was I feeling so over-worked?
This is when it occurred to me that I was not allowing myself the luxury of enjoying the space in my work life. New to this career, not yet financially stable, I felt that I needed to be constantly doing- planning, thinking, worrying actively. From the time I woke up in the morning until the time I went to bed, I felt that all of my actions needed to somehow lead to my success as a self-employed yoga teacher. A social life was pretty much out of the question, unless it could be tied in to the goal in some way.* Cleaning the house became a necessary evil. Don’t even talk to me about mowing the lawn.
Tara Brach, in her book Radical Acceptance, quotes Thomas Merton as describing the rush and pressure of modern life as a form of contemporary violence. He says: “…to be surrendering to too many demands, too many concerns, is to succumb to the violence.”
Violence is not too extreme a term. This sort of self-punishing belief system, and the non-stop working behavior, can lead to some pretty serious stuff. The symptoms of “Stressed-Out Yogis,” according to a recent issue of Yoga International, range from mild (“You catch colds and other viral or bacterial infections more easily,”) to serious (“depression, hypoglycemia, GERD, colitis, chronic fatigue, and even alcohol or drug abuse”).
It’s not lost on me that there’s an irony, here. I’m a yoga teacher. Ahimsa begins at home, right? Here’s a fun quote from that same Yoga International article by James Keogh:
“Worn down by our stressed-out, on-the-go lives, many of us turn to yoga for relief and restoration. We look to our teachers, whose calm, collected poise makes stress seem like a foreign concept, to guide us into balance. But even as they do this- and despite the aura they project in class- our teachers often face similar stressors, and a surprising number succumb to burnout themselves. Some of them reach this point because they teach 10 or more classes a week for low pay, hustling from one part of town to another; others fit in multiple classes while holding down a full-time job; and others still struggle with the business side of owning and operating a studio. And none of them is immune from relationship challenges and family catastrophes. Theoretically, they’re better equipped than the average person to deal with that kind of stress, but ironically, that expectation may only contribute to the problem.”
Saints preserve us if I ever seem to project a ‘calm and collected poise’- I think I might be a little too honest for that to ever happen- but I think it’s important for teachers to realize that if we don’t take time- make space- for self-care, there’s going to be a problem. In other words, it’s time to practice what I preach.
After reading this article, I knew it was time to figure out a way to “stop the violence” and give myself the free time I need to care for myself.
The solution? I spent two excruciating hours with my fancy color-coded Google Calendar schedule, figuring out how many actual hours a week I need to spend on work. This includes classes to be taught, class and workshop planning, studio maintenance and customer service, work-related errands, social media time, studying, and long-term planning and marketing. Then, I blocked in specific time each day for my own yoga practice, meditation, and meals. Around that, I blocked in hours of free time to be used only for rest or leisure. During certain hours, I allowed time for house chores, but other times were just for fun.
I’m putting in a lot of substitute teaching hours this month, and the schedule is tight. But I’ve been really dedicated to following it as best I can, with some allowance for random stuff happening. Hey, a yoga teacher’s gotta be flexible, right? 😉
So far, it’s been working beautifully. It takes dedication to stick to it, and sometimes it’s a little weird, but the structure is giving me the space I need to feel a little more relaxed and at ease. And, as of last Thursday at 4 PM, my floor was clean as a whistle. Apologies to the mail carrier, though.
Here’s a beautiful poem I used in class last week- thanks to Tara Brach and her blog for the inspiration.
*I am everlastingly grateful to those friends who are persistent in asking me to spend time with them, despite this insanity

Help celebrate the fact that Laura recently figured out — by herself! — how to delete 815,000 (<–not an exaggeration!) pornographic spam comments from her website and made it viewable again!
Background: Wipro InfoTech is a leading IT giant in the world that provides integrated IT solutions to its clients. It aims at providing technologically driven business solutions to its consumers.
Challenge: A need was felt to have an efficient mechanism in place that would avoid any data security issues emerging out of careless disposal of waste paper and also provide a cost effective and environment friendly alternative. Hence a paper recycling plant was set up with an aim to handle waste paper efficiently and to recycle it on campus itself. The plant has been operational since 2007 with the objective to ensure that not a single waste paper with printed matter leaves the office premises.
Initiative: The waste paper is collected, shredded, made into a paste and then compressed into solid blocks which are then supplied to manufacturers for further production of stationary items like pads, notebooks and the like. These notepads and chit pads are then supplied back to the company.
The plant has been established in an area of 400 square feet with the paper recycling capacity of 200kg/day thus averaging around 4680 kg paper per month. It was set up at a cost of Rs 6,10,000 and the operational cost per month is Rs 9500. per day consumption of power and water is 12.5 units and 600litres respectively. It comprises the following machinery:
Waste paper and water is fed into the hydraulic pulper where it is churned into a slurry pulp that is transported to a hydraulic basket press which coverts the produce into 25 kg cakes at a time. These cakes are then given off to large paper manufactures who then convert it into stationary pads etc.
One operator monitors the plant 8 hours per day for a week or so, depending on the load. Approximately 300kg of waste paper is generated at the Electronic City campus and 150kg more is expected from other BDC locations.
Outcome/Benefits: On an average, about 420 kg of pulp or wet cake is generated per day, costing Rs 2.25 per kg. Thus the per day revenue gained from the same is Rs 945. So the company saves approximately Rs 529 per day by consuming paper that has been recycled within its own premises which implies savings of Rs 13,754 every month (25 days) and Rs 1,65,048 every year.
So far, the company has produced 14 tonnes of paper which is equivalent of saving 39.2 tonnes of dry timber and approximately 1,135,623L of water.
While the company managed to save an admirably huge sum of money by making a small alteration in the way of its waste paper disposal, it also set forward a brilliant example for the world of the benefits of recycling which are multifold. Recycled paper uses 55% less water, reduces water pollution by 35%, air pollution by 74% and saves approximately 60%-70% energy over virgin paper manufacture. There is reduction in emission of greenhouse gases, elimination of toxic waste and a reduced need for new landfills and incinerators for waste disposal. The process of recycling supplies valuable raw materials to industry.
Because I could not hear my ringtone above household ambient noises, I changed it to something jarring enough to get my attention. There was a particularly annoying sound of crows screeching that guaranteed I’d hear the phone even if there was a war on TV. I had not considered that my neighborhood is home to a murder of crows who now have me answering the phone when it doesn’t ring. What I’ve accomplished is to add the sadistic, ventriloquistic calling of the crows to the hordes of robocallers, the recorded voices of actors wanting to cure my pain, send me on a river cruise, or refinance my mortgage. Occasionally there will be a live human at the other end.
My 30-year old clock radio is by my bed. It is lit with large digital numbers that are very easy to read in the dark even when awakened, bleary-eyed at 4:43 a.m. When the call came, I was scared and angry, I hoped no one had died, that my building was not on fire, and I was not called to bail someone out of jail. Had to be something like that. 4:43 a.m.
“Your computer has been hacked,” the male voice said after I had quieted the crows and said “hello.” The caller was male who spoke English with a thick accent.
The phone shrieked again. I should have ignored it, but I had thought of a few more obscenities. I don’t often get a chance to use them. Most of my calls are from robots. This was a live creep.
I’ve not heard from him again. Perhaps others are helping him expand his vocabulary. These people should be locked in a room full of angry crows. But he is not the only home invader. Several grocery store chains – none of them I frequent – send me pages of brightly covered coupons to save on products I don’t use. On Tuesday, every Tuesday, the postal worker wads them up and shoves them en masse through the small metal mail slot so that the mutilated paper tears, crumples and becomes stubbornly stuck in the slot.
My insurance company, my telephone company and my bank seem to think I need a near daily reminder of their existence or just want me to know how much they love me. My mother, bless her, used to do that by phone, but I never saw my bank in those terms. Perhaps I should send them a Whitman’s Sampler or a dozen roses. Maybe a murder of crows— ravenous, rabid ravens.
Not all serial killer movies are born equal. The Calling grossed roughly $3 million, a fraction of the $73 million spent just to make The Bone Collector, which ended up with $151 million in box office receipts. Yet structurally, the two have a lot in common. In each, a former star cop forms a team to piece together mysterious but similar clues to what otherwise appears to be random killings. They must do so quickly to stop the quickening mayhem. Also in both cases, protagonists must solve the puzzles despite the obstruction of incompetent higher-ups. Sounds like a formula to me.
The Calling — I usually love high-quality low-budget crime films. They are often projects driven more by love than money. Because they are a result of personal passion, they may not have that blockbuster appeal. Yet, they often provide a deeper glimpse into the characters. They are everyday folks like us, and we accept that such horror could happen in our own ordinary lives. Susan Sarandon, Donald Sutherland, Christopher Heyerdahl and Ellen Burtstyn bring a level of gravitas to a story that is more personal than suspenseful. Jason Stone directed The Calling, which was based on the novel by Inger Ash Wolfe and released to video in 2014.
The Bone Collector — I’d like to root for the underdog; but The Bone Collector is the better movie. In this case, money made a difference. Its plentitude here is apparent in every scene, in the sets, the lighting, the extras, even the camera angles. The plot, the dialogue and the acting aren’t necessarily superior; but the environment in which that all takes place is more seductive and where needed far more terrifying. This 1999 movie also has box office star power — Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Given the somewhat sappy Hollywood ending, there was no need to kill off the film’s most likable and most intriguing character. The Bone Collector was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver and directed by Phillip Noyce.
In both films, a chill is in he air. You might want a little warmth. So I’m suggesting a glass of decent whiskey as an accompaniment. Or, maybe a cup of hot chocolate will do as well.
The Shadow Broker by Trace Conger is a good read. What it did, in addition to providing the satisfaction of reading an interesting and innovative crime tale, is re-ignite in my mind two on-going debates in the publishing world.
The first is independent publishing, the new and kinder word for self-publishing, which replaced the even worse sounding “vanity press.” The Shadow Broker is proof that it is possible for a well-written book to make it to market and have an impact without the backing of a major publisher. Might the book have been even better had it gone though the traditional publishing process? Maybe, but I doubt it. It’s solid as is. Well-written and edited, with a great cover.
Might it sell more if it were traditionally published? I don’ know, but I’m guessing, “yes.” Though I know from experience that an independently published book can sell better than one published by one of the big five that didn't provide adequate marketing support. In this case, the book is doing well on Amazon, both in reviews and sales. Out of 45 reviews, more than two-thirds give the book five stars. It is also attracting Shamus Award attention, tough enough for any new writer.
As I said, Conger’s first novel brings other questions to the surface: one is: Can we justify rooting for a seriously and I mean seriously flawed human being? Mr. Finn, the main character, is likable only in as much as everyone else is less so. As we often do in the political arena, we go for the lesser or least evil. We can’t help but root for Mr. Finn and his irascible father. Everyone else is worse.
Final question: Is there such a thing as the pornography of violence? When does excessive, graphic blood and guts become merely obscene? This is a violent book. The thing is: it is no more violent than most of the books and films we buy into every day. Personally, I would not, could not make a steady diet of reading at this level of violence. But just as sex-related obscenity is in the eye of the beholder, so too are graphic portrayals of violence. And, it is fiction. Depiction of violence in contemporary crime fiction often seems to be obligatory. There is no shortage here either. However, the strength of the story and the heightened level of suspense pulled me through my prudish, anti-gore preferences. The violence is organic, essential to the plot and to the development of character. In short, Conger has a winner.
In fact, I’d be surprised if this wasn’t the first of many adventures of the easily compromised Mr. Finn. I would also be surprised if his series isn’t picked up by one of the big five publishers should Conger want to go in that direction.
These two crime films run against the trend. No special effects. No gratuitous violence. And only one pitiful car chase between them. Instead we get literate, intimate stories about how crime affects those whose lives are intertwined with the victims, and stellar casts to tell the stories.
In God’s Pocket — Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died shortly after the film was released last year at Sundance, plays the guy who tries to clean things up after his particularly nasty stepson is killed. While director John Slattery fails, in my mind, with the humor side of dark humor, he does effectively render the culturally incestuous city neighborhood, God’s Pocket, as a place where murder, racism and xenophobia rule. Hoffman captures the well-intentioned but powerless poor soul with every movement and every utterance. His every action makes a bad situation worse. John Torturo, and Richard Jenkins give their usual fine performances. The film is based on Pete Dexter’s novel.
In The Bedroom — This is about as literary as a film can get. I didn't read Andre Dubus’ short story, “Killings,” on which this film is based. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson play the parents of a young man who is about to embark upon his life. The youth, played by Nick Stahl, is killed by his girlfriend’s (Marisa Tomei) ex-husband. The event is devastating as we witness, moment by moment, the collateral damage. The killer, whose defense is self-defense, is out on bond and is hardly invisible in the tiny town. His presence and the likelihood his sentence will, if he is convicted at all, be light, is beyond the grieving parents’ ability to cope. I mentioned this film to a friend of mine. A parent herself, she said this was one of the best movies she’d ever seen and that it is on her list of films she’d never, ever see again. Field, Spacek, Wilkinson and Tomei were nominated for nearly every award imaginable. The film was directed by Todd Field and released in 2001.
Refreshments: We can go from beer – PBR is okay – for the first film, which takes place in a seedy, insular, explosive city neighborhood to, considering the change of scenery, a modest white wine for the second, which has a charming emotionally repressed northeast lobster-trapping village as a backdrop.
Often books by non-best selling mystery writers like myself slip into the marketplace and out of it without leaving a footprint (or a fingerprint, for that matter). Killing Frost, the eleventh and last book in the Deets Shanahan series was noticed. And I deeply appreciate it. Highly respected Publisher’s Weekly and venerable Kirkus Reviews gave it high marks. J. Kingston Pierce’s indispensable blog, Rap Sheet, recommended it. George Easter, editor of Deadly Pleasures, perhaps the most compre-hensive review publication specializing in crime fiction, recommended not just this last book featuring the aging P.I. from Indianapolis, but the entire series.
A couple of days ago, I received the latest copy of the popular Mystery Scene magazine. Kevin Burton Smith, keeper of all things private eye and founding editor of the web site Thrilling Detective, contributed a feature to the current issue of the magazine about the Shanahan series and the future of its author.
I’ve pulled a quote from the article not only because it puts the new book in a desirable, but conflicting light, but also because I hadn’t realized I could drive a reader to drink. Is this good?
“Killing Frost is a beautiful, bittersweet farewell, both depressing and uplifting. It made me want to hug my wife, or buy a dog. Or maybe just drink a lot. You think crime novels are hard boiled? Try growing old.” — Kevin Burton Smith, Mystery Scene.
I suspect the review season is over. I feel honored and lucky. It also means I can get back to writing. The first book in a new mystery novella series comes out in September. I’m working on a third. I’m working on a standalone mystery as well.
Summer days in San Francisco are unpredictable as tourists from the Midwest waiting for cable cars in their shorts and sleeveless t-shirts can attest. For me, on the cold and dreary days nothing is better than a cup of coffee and my keyboard. On the sunny, warm and breezy days, there is nothing better than a stroll around town thinking about plot and characters.
Hello. My name Ron Tierney, and I am addicted to cheap crime show reruns. You know what I’m talking about – grainy episodes of TV programs from 10 to 20 years ago with talking heads, reenactments and sometimes real life footage of court proceedings. The stories appear on strange channels –14.4 in my case — found by accident. This one is the Escape Channel. And I find on it “American Justice,” “Snapped,” “FBI Files,” “Unsolved Mysteries” and “Forensics” among others. Sometimes you get flashes of real history – Jack Ruby, Daniel Ellsberg, Patty Hearst, J. Edgar Hoover.
Somehow I’m not able to find a suitable film on Netflix these days. I’ve consumed plenty of crime films and reviewed them here. I’ve obsessed over series like The Wire and House of Cards. I can’t find a moment these days on Public television, when it is not playing “The Best of Pledge Week” after several pledge weeks. God Bless Suze Orman; but would she please shut up. Regarding network TV, summer brings an over dependence on people losing a hundred pounds or more and other forms of torture and deceitful behavior disguised as “reality.” I really can’t stand seeing people cry because they can’t sing or dance well enough. I’ve seen every “Law and Order’ in existence and in all of its configurations several times. I’ve even watched reruns of “Blue Bloods,” enduring yet another Sunday dinner with the aptly-named Reagan family. I’m afraid “The News Hour” and “Jeopardy” are not enough to get me through the summer doldrums.
So I’ve turned, hopefully for just a brief spell, to real crime, case by case by case. I sit in my half-darkened living room drifting off during the commercials for all sorts of miracle products only available through an 800 number. When I awake, the narrator reminds me of what has already happened and provides titillating information about what’s to come, a bribe for me to stay awake for a “shocking” or “startling” piece of evidence.
As a crime fiction writer, I’ve found some of the information useful. I don’t know all there is to know about forensics, even old forensics. Sometimes, the show provides insights into methods of investigation or how prosecutors determine who, when and if to prosecute. What seems common here is that the murder victim is almost always killed by a spouse or family member, and that it often — more often than not — takes years from the time of the crime to bring a defendant to court. And just when you think it’s over, it isn’t. There are a surprising number of mistrials or hung juries in capital cases. At least this is what my addiction has led me to believe.
I do learn a few things of value for my craft, but learning about clever murderers isn’t one of them. First, a deadly crime of passion is almost impossible to conceal. Blood splatter, DNA, forensics trip up the perp when he or she forgets the Boy Scout oath. No time to plan. Not enough time or skill to cover up what’s been done in a senseless rage. Eventually, the resources and bureaucratic stubbornness of the authorities yield sufficient data in these cases. Someone will be arrested. In crime fiction, this amounts to a police procedural kind of story. It can be interesting, especially if the solutions are new or are especially creative. In my mind-numbing marathon of true crime dramas, it has much more to do with “how” rather than “why.” And while that is less interesting to me as a writer, it I important and has spawned a whole sub-genre of popular writers and best-selling books.
However, even when perpetrators have all the time in the world to plan a murder, it rarely goes well. The only time murders are unsolved, it seems, is when they are random – that is, there seems to be a ratio that the more random the choice of the victim, the less likely the perpetrator can be found. But a good fictional mystery or crime story demands, except in serial killer or horror stories, a connection between the criminal and the victim. How else can the reader participate in the solving of it? Why else would a reader care? And if the criminal isn’t a whole lot smarter than who we see on these true crime shows, there’s very little challenge for the reader. What I’ve noticed may be obvious to others — and this is true of more recent crime stories on the far slicker “48 Hours,” “20/20” and “Dateline”— in real life, sometimes the cops are bone-headed, but the murderers are almost always astonishingly stupid. When, on occasion, that’s not the case, even after the trial ends, we’re not sure beyond a reasonable doubt that justice was done. (This happens more often when the defendant can afford a good attorney.) I can’t tell you how often I wasn’t convinced that the verdict was the right one. Of course there weren’t eleven other people in my living room pressuring me to agree with them or waking me up, for that matter. The blessing is that fiction writers can make the case airtight. Or not.
As far as the addiction is concerned, I know I should do something about it. I should read some Mark Twain, listen to Beethoven, or take a walk. However, when I do these things, I’m still spinning plots and creating characters. Can’t escape it.

We are those weird “Team Green” people that don’t find out the baby’s gender ahead of time. I admit, I was a little tempted to find out this time around. But I enjoy not knowing. That way when people ask me “Do you know what you’re having?” I can respond, “A baby!”
When it’s time to go to the hospital we usually plan to go in with our top 2 girl and top 2 boy names, and then narrow it down after we meet our new baby human. With all 3 kids I’ve had a “gut feeling” of what we were having (I’m 3/3!), and I tend to focus more on that list than the other. This time around my gut said girl, and Elena was pretty much the only name on that list from the very beginning.
August 18th (her due date) is the Feast of St. Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great. Elena is a form of Helena, and it was one of the names on our list from the last pregnancy. We pronounce it “Eh-lay-na” (Spanish pronunciation), but I’m sure she’ll experience all kinds of mispronunciations. (Sorry kid.)
The tricky part for us was figuring out her middle name. For the longest time we settled on Elena Kateri, since St. Kateri has been one of our family’s patron saints. But as we got closer to the due date it just didn’t feel right. I still love the name Kateri, and who knows… maybe another Baby Johnston will end up with it. Kateri just didn’t seem to fit quite right with this baby, so about 2 weeks before the due date we started playing around with other options.
Since her due date was close to a Marian Feast Day, the next option was Elena Marie in honor of the Blessed Mother. However, after a while that didn’t feel right either. Don’t get me wrong, Marie is lovely. It’s my Mom’s middle name…but Marie just felt a little “Catholic generic”?  I’m sure I’ve offended a few people, but I guess what I mean is that Marie just felt like too easy of an option.
By the time we got to the hospital and I was being induced, we still didn’t have a middle name. August 20th is the feast day of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. I suggested the name Claire and for a moment I thought we’d found a winner. Then we kept saying it out loud…
We had already decided that the middle name for a boy could be “Bernard”, so I suggested the feminine version Bernadette. This way she can claim both St. Bernard and St. Bernadette/Our Lady of Lourdes patronage! Once she was born it took about 3 hours for us to make it officially official.
We’re also those weird people that come up with hashtags for our kids. #AlexandriaTheGreat came naturally, as did #SimonTheZealous, since he’s named after Simon the Zealot. Elena’s moniker was a little more difficult… At first, I thought #ElenaTheIncredible… but that made my husband wince. When we thought a little more about the meaning of her middle name and whom she was named after, #ElenaTheBrave just made sense. Bernadette means “brave as a bear”, and both St. Helena and St. Bernard demonstrated what I would call bold and brave lives.
So far our kids have all lived up to their nicknames (especially that Zealous Toddler!). Considering Elena basically came out of the womb on her own, I’d say she’s already off to a good start!
My due date was 8/18/18 but I was really hoping for an Assumption baby. We found out we were pregnant on December 8th (Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception) so I hoping that the baby would arrive on August 15th (Solemnity of the Assumption). A Marian feast day baby! Plus, this was my third child…surely this would be the one to come early… right? (Spoiler Alert: Nope)
I knew I was going to be induced on August 20th at the beginning of August. Truth is, my kids get really comfortable in utero. Maybe genetics are to blame, but I need Pitocin to get things moving. I was induced with Simon at 41 weeks, and even though my water broke on its own with Alexandria I still needed a boost of Pitocin. All that to say, as much as I didn’t want to be induced, I’m glad we scheduled it. It helped me to cling to the fact that I would not be pregnant forever.
This was our first Texas Baby, and I was very nervous about labor and delivery. In Kansas we had an amazing Family Physician who delivered both of our kids, and a great Family Birth Center with a phenomenal team of nurses. Now that we’re in a larger city, I knew the experience was going to be very different. On the one hand, I was excited to deliver at a Catholic hospital for the first time. On the other hand, I felt like I was stepping into a lot of unknowns: new hospital, new procedures, and a doctor that I didn’t know as well. It felt like going into this for the very first time.
We were scheduled to check in at the hospital at 5:00am Monday morning, which meant that we were up a little bit before 4am to get ready to go. I didn’t sleep at all on Sunday night (combination of nerves and bad heartburn), so I knew this was going to be a very long day. Before we left I got an expedited version of a blessing before childbirth from my Deacon Dad, and we were on our way.
We checked into the hospital and were set up in our labor and delivery suite by 5:30am. Michael put the Divine Mercy image underneath the cross in the room,which I planned to use as my focal point when it was time to push, I had my tattoos from Just Love Prints on each of my arms (Be not afraid and Totus Tuus), and I even spritzed some Holy Water around my bed because why not?  I had my rosary, Bluetooth speaker and my phone beside me. Let the games begin!
I was officially hooked up to Pitocin at 6:45am and I was still at 3cm and only about 70% effaced (as I had been for about 3 weeks). This was really disappointing to hear, and I tried to mentally prepare myself for the real possibility that this day might end with C-section. The goal for each of my deliveries has always been healthy baby and healthy Mama, so I knew that if a C-section was what it would take to accomplish those things then that’s what needed to happen. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little bit scared.
One of the things I started praying about in the third trimester was for any doctors or nurses who would be taking care of us at the hospital. Since I was feeling anxious about delivering in a new place, I figured the least I could do was pray that we’d have the right people on our team when it was time to deliver. God did not disappoint… I could not have asked for a better labor and delivery nurse!
After introducing herself and getting more information from me, our nurse gave us the rundown of what to expect for the rest of the day: They’d continue increasing my Pitocin, my doctor would be making rounds within the next couple of hours to check me and break my water. I could also get my epidural whenever I wanted, but I might want to consider getting it soon before the anesthesiologist had several other patients ahead of me. Once my water was broken things would likely go fast because this was my third baby.
I specifically remember that she kept saying that things were going to go fast because every time she said the word “fast” I thought “Yeah right.” My hope at that point was to have a baby before dinner time, but my nurse was convinced that things were going to go much faster than that.
My contractions started picking up after about the first hour or so. One of the more entertaining moments was when ADT Security called me because one of my coworkers had accidentally set off the office alarm and I had to give them the verbal password to turn off the alarm in the middle of a contraction. No biggie… just over here having a baby folks. 😉
By 9:00am the contractions hurt, but they weren’t unbearable. I bounced on the birth ball for a while, thinking about whether or not it was too soon to get an epidural and discussing it with the nurse. The anesthesiologist arrived around 9:20am, and after talking it through with him and my nurse for a few more minutes I decided to go ahead and get it done.
One thing I wasn’t prepared for was that Michael would be asked to leave the room during the procedure. Usually Michael stands in front of me and holds my shoulders while the epidural is being placed. There’s about 20-30 seconds of stinging and burning that I dread, so when the doctor told Michael he had to leave, I got a little scared.
Thankfully, between my calming music playing in the background and my amazing nurse, I got through it without any issues. The doctor commented on how much he liked my playlist, my nurse talked me through each step of the procedure, and just as we were finishing up my OBGYN arrived to break my water.
My doctor came in to check me and I was only at 4cm at this point. She broke my water and by the time she left the room I was the most comfortable I had been in months. My back pain disappeared, the bed was suddenly super comfortable, and I fell asleep.
I woke up feeling super relaxed. I was mostly numb from the waist down, though I could still move my legs a little bit. When the nurse came back in to check on me, she reminded me that I needed to let her know if I felt the urge to poop or push. I knew exactly what she was talking about because even with my previous epidurals I remembered what that felt like.
Around 11:15, I told Michael that he should go to the cafeteria and get something to eat. “Who knows how long this is going to take, and you need to keep your energy,” I told him. He hesitated at first, but went ahead and went downstairs to get lunch.
Shortly after Michael left the room, I started to feel nauseated, so as a precaution the nurse got a barf bag ready for me and some nausea medication. “While I’m here, I’m going to go ahead and check you and see how things are progressing,” she said.
“You should call your husband and tell him to come back right now, and I’m going to go call your doctor! ”
I tried calling Michael’s phone and it wouldn’t go through. I was eventually able to get this text message to him:
About a minute later he came back into the room with some tacos and coke. The nurse came back into room to set up the room for delivery and to let me know that the doctor was on her way.
At 11:41am I sent a text to my mom and another friend to let them know I was going to start pushing soon and asked for prayers. While we were waiting, the smell of Michael’s tacos hit me hard, and the nausea got worse.
“Michael, could you step into the hallway for a second and eat that? I think I’m going to throw up.”
Michael’s such an amazing husband, that he stepped out with his lunch. At the time I thought he was just on the other side of the door… what I didn’t realize was that he had walked all the way to the lobby and was now on the other side of security.
Over the next couple of minutes my nurse continued to get everything set up, and when she came and moved the sheets out of the way, she said very calmly:
As I was texting Michael I heard the nurse tell someone to call my doctor and tell her to get here NOW because the baby was coming. She must have also called for a team to help because all of a sudden there were 5 or 6 other nurses in my room.
I had my phone in my hand trying to call Michael again and as it was ringing the nurse said “Deanna on this next contraction I need you to push.”
I set the phone down beside me (without hanging up) and I remember taking a breath to push, and then feeling the baby just slide right out! All of a sudden this beautiful crying baby was placed on my chest with a head full of black hair.
Y’all everything happened so fast that I think it took my brain an extra minute to take it all in. In about a 60 second window I went from texting and trying to call my husband to holding my newborn baby girl in my arms.
Thankfully, even though he missed Elena’s speedy entrance into the world, he still got to cut the cord. Apparently, when he left the room Michael went all the way to the lobby on the other side of security. So when the team of nurses came rushing into my room, there wasn’t anyone at the desk to open the door for him! But it all worked out in the end.
One of the things I will always remember about Elena’s birth is how much laughter was in the room when she was born. It was just a comical situation and it seems like everything escalated quickly in about a 2 minute window… there I am just laying in bed and apparently my baby was just coming out on her own, unbeknownst to me. When she was out I laughed because I couldn’t believe what was happening, Michael laughed when he got into the room and there was a baby there, and the nurses laughed right along with us.
When I was trying to call Michael and set down my phone, it went to his voicemail. So we have this 3 minute voicemail recording that starts with Michael walking into the room saying “What happened?” and the nurses responding “surprise!”
The laughter seems fitting. The moment Michael and I found out we were pregnant, we laughed. We laughed and we hugged and we laughed some more. God is just so good.
The name Elena means “bright, shining light”. I’d say that from the moment we knew she existed, Elena brought a bright light of joy into our family.
One of the things that made Elena’s birth day extra special was that we got a surprise visit from our Bishop that afternoon! We even got our first “Family of 5” blessing from him while he was there.
Elena is 3 weeks old today, which is really hard to believe. While this change from 2 to 3 kids has been challenging, the funny thing is that it only seems right that Elena is here. She was always supposed to be part of our family. While yes, our house is a lot louder now than it was before, and Michael and I are learning how to play “zone defense” now that we’re outnumbered, we wouldn’t have it any other way!
If we’re friends on Facebook or you follow my Instagram (aka where I spam you with adorable pictures of my children and the occasional selfie), you’re already up to speed on the latest and greatest changes for our family. But if this is the first you’re hearing of anything new, well… let’s just say 2017 is nothing like what I thought it would be!
T alk about an unexpected plot twist! This time last year I was 35 weeks pregnant with Simon, and believe me when I say a job change and a major move was NOT on my radar at all.
The short version of the story is that I was contacted right before Lent began to see if I was open to even entertaining the idea of taking a new position in the Diocese of Tyler. For weeks, I thought “There’s NO WAY God’s calling us to move… We just bought a house!” But over and over again in prayer the Lord kept saying “You don’t think I can handle a house? Of all the things? It’s just a house.”
Good point Lord. So I put together my Curriculum Vitae and emailed it at the beginning of Holy Week, the beginning of May I interviewed, the end of May I accepted, and on June 30th we moved to Tyler, TX. I started my job as the Director of Family Life in the Diocese of Tyler on July 10th.
And our house? We got an offer after it had been on the market 1 month and we closed on it last week.
Since the move hap pened so fast we decided to rent for this first year, catch our breath and figure out where exactly we want to live in Tyler.
About a week before we left Dodge City we found this house which is the closest thing to country living that I’ve ever experienced.
Our house is on half an acre, and it backs up to our landlord’s property which contains lots of cows, a few horses, two goats, some chickens… and apparently our house came equipped with country mice too.
We have a beautiful front porch and back deck, and the kids love seeing the animals, especially the cows that gather at the front gate every morning.
It’s a little bit of a drive, but we knew that would be a change moving to a larger city. Gone are the days of living 5 minutes from everything, and shopping at the 1 Walmart in town. Last weekend we realized that there were more businesses on the road we were driving on than there were in all of Dodge City. Hello Chick-fil-a. Hello Target. Hello Budget.
One of the main reasons that we considered this move so seriously is Family. In Dodge City, we were about 15-16 hours from my family and 10-12 hours away from Michael’s family. Now, we’re 6 hours from my family and 45 minutes from Michael’s family. Minutes! I think the kids have spent more time with their grandparents the past 2 ½ months than they have their entire lives! It’s been amazing!
This move has given me a deep appreciation for our families. The day we moved here we had so many family members over at the house helping to unpack. During the 3 weeks that I was here by myself with the kids while Michael finished things in Dodge, I had an incredible amount of support from my parents and from my in-laws. I really couldn’t have made it through those first few weeks without family! And they continue to support us.
And I gotta say, one of my favorite moments of this year, hands down, is the phone call we made to Michael’s parents to tell them that we were moving back to Texas. I think we got a bigger squeal of joy out of them than the first time we told them we were pregnant! 
Guess who started walking at 9 months and has 5-6 teeth? Simon’s development over the past several months has been shocking. Alexandria didn’t start crawling until maybe 9-10 months, and she was walking at 13 months. Simon figured out how to crawl, standup, and took he first steps within a couple of months it seems. SLOW DOWN KID.
One thing that I’m realizing more and more with each daily adventure is how different our kids are… and how different boys and girls are. While both of our kids have a great deal of spunk, there’s a fearlessness and determination with Simon that can sometimes be a little alarming. Climb onto the couch and then dive off? Sure. And Alexandria… goodness that girl is 2 ½ going on 20. She can be sassy, but she’s a smart kid. Now if we can just get this potty training thing down…
I know, I know…. It’s cheesy… but it’s TRUE! I need to write a whole separate post about this, but the chaos of this move and even making the decision to submit my Curriculum Vitae was not something I could have done without Michael.
Moving was hard. But I have really appreciated Michael’s patience and support. We’re a team, and this entire process has given me a deeper awareness of the grace that comes from the Sacrament of Marriage, and gratitude that I’m married to my best friend.
It feel like this is the most significant “out of the boat moment” I’ve ever experienced…bigger than when I moved to Mexico, or when I moved to San Antonio or Dodge City…probably because this was a discernment that we made as a family.
I won’t lie, this has been challenging. As much as I love this new adventure, I miss the comforts of where we were. It was safe! We had good jobs, friends, community…we were comfortable. But that’s what getting out of the boat is about!
Peter knew Jesus was calling him, and he went for it. But that didn’t mean the sea was immediately calmed. Undoubtedly, it was scary out there! But Jesus was with Peter, and he was right there when Peter started to sink.
And that’s where we’re at right now… We know this where we are supposed to be, but those waves can be intimidating. God is in this with us, and if we do sink? He’s right there.
A little piece of green poking through the dead leaves and grass, trying to reach the surface. It was the end of February, but there, on that bleak Kansas day was a little sign of new life.
Weeks later, that little green stem burst upwards out of the Earth, and in what seemed like an overnight project there were daffodil blooms strung throughout our front and backyard.
My parents can tell you many a story of how I whined and whimpered on yard work weekends, and I know there were more than a few plants that met their death when I was left home alone and tasked with watering.
But when we were house hunting in fall of 2015, one of the things that drew me to this house were the front and back yards. I’m certain that the retired couple who lived here before us spent most of their time outside. Flowers everywhere. We moved in at the end of the year, and I told myself that come spring/summer I would be ready to become master gardener extraordinaire.
Well, spring came… and flowers started growing… and I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. I was also pregnant, and the thought of being outside in the heat, bent over, pulling up weeds and laying down mulch just wasn’t high on the priority list.
My husband did a great job of taking care of our lawn, but when it came to the flower beds… we just sort of left everything alone. So the flowers came… and I watched as daffodils, tulips, and irises came and went. We discovered we have two peony bushes in the front yard, which were beautiful until the tornado/hail storm in late May… and stuff just kept growing. And growing… and before we knew it there was a jungle of flowers and weeds lining our back fence.
By the end of the summer I was 8 months pregnant and any energy that I might have had for cleaning up the yard was long gone.
Now spring has sprung again, but this time we (and by “we” I mostly mean my incredible husband) are trying to be more intentional with the yard. Michael cleared out a lot of the dead leaves and weeds, he put down mulch in the flower beds, planted grass seeds in our patchy yard, and eventually we’ll (yes we’ll) finish some much needed clean up.
I think what I’m most surprised by is how excited I am to see things starting to grow again… and how much easier it is to differentiate between flowers and weeds before things get out of control. When there’s no purposeful intention to care for the yard, stuff just grows. Sure, there were some beautiful flowers that bloomed, but there were also a lot of weeds… some of which choked out the plants that were supposed to be there.
The more time I spend in the yard, the more I see gardening as analogous to the spiritual life, especially as we approach Easter.
During the Lenten season we strive to weed out the bad things in our lives. Those 6 weeks are a time of not only removing things that hurt us, but it is also a time of trying to cultivate the good.
The thing is, spiritual growth doesn’t just happen. Sure, we can sit back, do the bare minimum (i.e. get to Mass once a week), and while that’s an important part, there has to be more intentional work that’s done on our souls if we really want to grow in virtue. Daily prayer, frequenting the sacraments, acts of service, those are the kind of things that take us from “Well at least I’m not spiritually dead!” to really allowing God to work in and through us to create something beautiful.
As Easter approaches, let’s take some time to think about what are the signs of New Life that God is revealing in us? The bad habits we tried to let go of during Lent… what virtues are growing there instead? How are we going to continue to nurture our spiritual lives into the Easter season and beyond?
Seeing new growth is exciting. Whether it’s flowers, or seeing signs of spiritual maturity, those little buds of something new can inspire us to take the next step on the journey.
Lent is a season that pushes us out of our comfort zones and asks us to dig deep and feel the burn of denying ourselves so that we can follow Christ better.
I think it was about my sophomore year of college when Lent finally “clicked” with me. It wasn’t just about giving up cable TV or chocolate for 6 weeks… it was a journey into deeper intimacy with the Lord. And as I came to understand it as a journey, I also realized how important it was to prepare for that walk in the desert.
I’d prepare by spending some extra time in prayer, usually in the adoration chapel, journaling my Lenten commitments so that I had a clear goal in mind. And the preparations weren’t limited to prayer; I would also try to get my living space as clean as possible before the Lenten journey began. Sometimes I would rearrange the furniture in my bedroom, or just give it an early spring cleaning. This was a way for me to enter into Lent with a breath of fresh air, a renewed mindset, and the visual difference in my environment helped me to focus on the fact that I was entering into a whole new season.
Married, two kids 2 and under, working full-time, and my husband and my daughter catch the flu (or something) a few days before Ash Wednesday.
I made plans early in the week to clean our bedroom, the living room, the kitchen…. I was going to journal, perhaps even write my first blog post for the year to kick off the season with a bang! Maybe I’d get some extra time in the prayer space my husband created for me for my birthday. Such plans!!!
Tuesday night I found myself in a living room of unfolded laundry, mountains of tissues, a fussy toddler, and after kids were asleep I had to run up to the Church to get some things set up for the Ash Wednesday Masses the next morning. Though I did manage to get to the sacrament of reconciliation that evening, by the end of the day I mostly felt disappointed.
I wasn’t ready. How on earth could I possibly have a good Lent if my house is dirty, my family is sick, and I haven’t spent time in prolonged silent prayer? And to top it off I could feel the cold coming after me too! I went to bed frustrated and thought, If I can’t start Lent perfectly, according to my plan then what’s the point?!
In those final moments of the day, I realized that perhaps I’d been focusing too much on starting Lent perfectly. I had been trying so hard to replicate the “perfect preparations” of my early 20s that I had forgotten to ask God to help me in the here and now. I’m not who I was at 19, 20, or 21 years old. My relationship with God and my spiritual life have changed a lot even since getting married 3 years ago! Why would I expect to start this journey in the same way I had almost a decade before?
I had forgotten that God doesn’t ask us to enter into Lent with a clean slate and then maintain perfection until Easter Sunday. No, instead He invites us to take up our cross, wherever we are, and follow Him. He invites us to turn towards Him with our mess, our pain, our weakness so that through the Lenten journey He c
Do I have an idea of the praying, fasting and almsgiving that God is calling me to offer this Lenten season? Yes. Am I perfectly prepared for what’s ahead these next 6 weeks? Nope. And that’s OK.

One unusual breed exhibited at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871 was an Abyssinian, “captured in the late Abyssinian War” who managed to took third place. The report on the cat show, published in the January 27, 1872, issue of Harper’s Weekly, was the first known mention in print of the breed.
Like most old breeds, little is known of the cats’ origins, although myths and speculation include claims that it was the cat of the pharaohs, and that it was created in Britain by crossing silver and brown tabbies.
Today, genetic evidence leads to the Indian Ocean coastal regions and parts of Southeast Asia. British and Dutch traders may well have brought the cats from ports such as Calcutta, India, or the islands of Indonesia. A taxidermied specimen of a ruddy ticked cat exhibited in the 1830s at the Leiden Zoological Museum in The Netherlands, where he was labeled “Patrie, domestica India,” gives creedence to that theory. The cats were probably given the name Abyssinian because Zula, the cat exhibited at the Crystal Palace, was said to have been imported from Abyssinia (now Ethiopia). Early pedigrees show crosses to non-Abyssinian cats, which may explain the introduction of new coat colors and the gene for long hair.
Enter the Somali cat breed. This longhaired variety of the Abyssinian was first noted in the early 20th century and probably came about when breeders introduced longhaired cats into their breeding programs to augment their stock—especially after World War II, when Abys were few and far between—but they weren’t developed as a breed in their own right until the 1960s and 1970s. They were given the name Somali as a nod to that country’s geographic status as the next door neighbor to Ethiopia (formerly known as Abyssinia).

The Indo-Gangetic aquifer is one of the world’s most important transboundary water resources, and the most heavily exploited aquifer in the world. To better understand the aquifer system, typologies have been characterized for the aquifer, which integrate existing datasets across the Indo-Gangetic catchment basin at a transboundary scale for the first time, and provide an alternative conceptualization of this aquifer system. Traditionally considered and mapped as a single homogenous aquifer of comparable aquifer properties and groundwater resource at a transboundary scale, the typologies illuminate significant spatial differences in recharge, permeability, storage, and groundwater chemistry across the aquifer system at this transboundary scale. These changes are shown to be systematic, concurrent with large-scale changes in sedimentology of the Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial aquifer, climate, and recent irrigation practices. Seven typologies of the aquifer are presented, each having a distinct set of challenges and opportunities for groundwater development and a different resilience to abstraction and climate change. The seven typologies are: 1 the piedmont margin, 2 the Upper Indus and Upper-Mid Ganges, 3 the Lower Ganges and Mid Brahmaputra, 4 the fluvially influenced deltaic area of the Bengal Basin, 5 the Middle Indus and Upper Ganges, 6 the Lower Indus, and 7 the marine-influenced deltaic areas.

[1913 Webster] He was, in the full force of the words, a good man. --Macaulay. [1913 Webster] 2. Power exerted against will or consent; compulsory power; violence; coercion; as, by force of arms; to take by force. [1913 Webster] Which now they hold by force, and not by right. --Shak. [1913 Webster] 3. Strength or power for war; hence, a body of land or naval combatants, with their appurtenances, ready for action; -- an armament; troops; warlike array; -- often in the plural; hence, a body of men prepared for action in other ways; as, the laboring force of a plantation; the armed forces. [1913 Webster] Is Lucius general of the forces? --Shak. [1913 Webster] 4. (Law) (a) Strength or power exercised without law, or contrary to law, upon persons or things; violence.

(Physics) Any action between two bodies which changes, or tends to change, their relative condition as to rest or motion; or, more generally, which changes, or tends to change, any physical relation between them, whether mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, magnetic, or of any other kind; as, the force of gravity; cohesive force; centrifugal force. [1913 Webster] Animal force (Physiol.), muscular force or energy. Catabiotic force [Gr. ? down (intens.) + ? life.] (Biol.), the influence exerted by living structures on adjoining cells, by which the latter are developed in harmony with the primary structures. Centrifugal force, Centripetal force, Coercive force, etc. See under Centrifugal, Centripetal, etc. Composition of forces, Correlation of forces, etc. See under Composition, Correlation, etc. Force and arms [trans. of L. vi et armis] (Law), an expression in old indictments, signifying violence.

Syn: Strength; vigor; might; energy; stress; vehemence; violence; compulsion; coaction; constraint; coercion. Usage: Force, Strength. Strength looks rather to power as an inward capability or energy. Thus we speak of the strength of timber, bodily strength, mental strength, strength of emotion, etc. Force, on the other hand, looks more to the outward; as, the force of gravitation, force of circumstances, force of habit, etc. We do, indeed, speak of strength of will and force of will; but even here the former may lean toward the internal tenacity of purpose, and the latter toward the outward expression of it in action. But, though the two words do in a few cases touch thus closely on each other, there is, on the whole, a marked distinction in our use of force and strength. “Force is the name given, in mechanical science, to whatever produces, or can produce, motion.” --Nichol.

With a design based on circular geometries inspired by Walter Burley Griffin's plan for Canberra, renowned architecture practice Bates Smart has unveiled Australia's newest hotel in the nation's capital.
The Canberra Vibe Hotel features a striking circular form adjacent to the airport approach, creating a bold, landmark entry that tapers towards the award-winning Canberra Airport.
The 4.5-star hotel developed by Canberra Airport Corporation features 191 rooms including 12 suites and 9 apartments over six levels and includes a reception, conferencing facilities, restaurant, bar and lounge areas.
Situated adjacent to the new terminal, the building is centred on a dramatic full height circular atrium that draws references from Griffin's plan for Canberra as well as alluding to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum. The spectacular atrium is the signature space for the hotel with its striking black and white theme rising above a large-scale ground floor entertaining space.
This atrium caters for intimate gatherings as well as large-scale events. It then draws the eye upward to where circular skylights bring-in light during the day and create a constellation at night. The circular references are highlighted through a number of light pelmets and bulkhead details. The beautiful colours of the walnut timber feather panelling along with bronze and gold aluminium make this a very warm, eye-opening area.

We paid everything off in February. It was and is a wonderful feeling. We have a fully funded emergency fund.
It was a sad thing to lose that job. I really enjoyed working there. The job served it's purpose. It bought us a second car, dug us out of debt and fully funded our emergency fund. It provided more management experience to my resume. A different kind of management from the gas station.
Zane worked as a manager for a short time to help fill a gap in management before we closed our doors. His working there, the gas station and working Walmart got him the attention of a hiring manager at Thermo Fisher. He was able to snag a job there after we closed our doors at Shoe Carnival. He was able to leave Walmart after five years. He's really excited by this new job. It has lots of room for growth and AMAZING benefits.
This closure pushed me to get back into school. I applied and got reaccepted back into Utah State University. I start again in January. I plan to do Spring, Summer and Fall to knock out all the courses I need to get to ARN. I'll apply to get into BATC's LPN program in Fall 2017. After that, do the LPN to RN program.
I was able to snag a job as an assistant manager at Spirit Halloween to keep me busy until school starts. This job will pay for my Spring 2016 Semester.
I'm still an assistant manager with the gas stations. I hit 5 years in August. I plan to stay until I can snag a job as an RN but we'll see. The RN program is M-F 8-4. I also still have my University job which will soon be switching to 1pm-12am Saturday and Sunday.
I did a trial run of Adderall while I was in-between Shoe Carnival and Spirit. It did not go well. After about a week, I realized that much of my anxiety and suicidal thoughts from high school likely stemmed from the stimulant. I tried the Adderall for about two and a half weeks before some serious suicidal thoughts caused me to decide that stimulants for my ADD are a no go from now on.
I need to follow up with my Doc and take another crack at the non-stimulant medicine I had initially decided were a no go in high school
To follow up on the family front, we did a little research into the infertility. We have some ideas as to what is going on. We'll do further research next year when we opt for the lower deductable insurance at his new job. It may be a simple fix. I think it's going to come down to deciding to pull the trigger on starting our family. We have some timing to weigh but we don't want to wait too much longer. Zane is 30 this year and I would rather not wait much longer. We're shooting to have a down payment saved up inside the next year, once we've settled into a house, we'll likely pull that trigger.
As always, it's different but always happy. Another year has brought more friends and more memories.

A spider seeks shelter inside an old toy store, where he soon discovers that the merchandise comes to life after dark.
A doll portrayed as a black stereotype saying "Mammy" was cut from this short. It has been restored for the recent (2006) DVD release "More Silly Symphonies."
Copyright Date : August 15, 1930; New York Opening : December 24, 1930; Los Angeles Opening : September 8, 1930
This is (I believe) the first use of the much-remade "inanimate objects come to life after dark" plotline. Every cartoon-maker in Hollywood (including Disney) will re-use this gimmick dozens of times before the decade is over.
A spider enters a toy shop to escape from a winter storm and is scared by various toys. The tiny spider beats a hasty retreat when some firecrackers are accidentally ignited by a lighted candle. Contains a "usually censored" scene in which a black doll, shown in "typical" black stereotype clothes and hair style, crys "Mammy" after white, blond-haired dolls cry "Mama." A good, enjoyable cartoon.
I really like the child-like, scaredy-cat spider in this one. It's easy to see why he was used again, since he has a new and unique personality. However, his character wasn't strong enough for him to star in too many cartoons. Watching him inquisitively explore and react to two surroundings (the toy shop and Egyptian tomb) was enough. I think it would have got old after that.
It’s often been my complaint about the Silly Symphonies or the Mickey Mouse shorts that they lack a cohesive narrative. The characters tend to open the short with a dance or silly song, but its never driven by any reason or motivation. For the Silly Symphonies, that’s not a big issue, since they are supposed to be “music videos” for lack of a better term. The latest entry, though, was a great surprise, because it gives the main character a strong motivation and follows through his story in the entire short.
Midnight in a Toy Shop is the short, and the main character is a spider. This in itself is a new twist, because we have seen spiders before in the Silly Symphonies, but they have always been villains. There was the menacing spider in Hell’s Bells or the spider that devours the other bugs in Summer. This spider is a shivering mess that manages to squeeze through the door to the toy shop in order to stay warm. It’s quite a contrast.
The plot is basic – the spider finds himself in the toy shop and starts playing with the toys to amuse himself. As he does so, some of the toys decide to come alive and join in, while others are manipulated by the spider. What’s very interesting is that the music is sparse in the first part of the short, as the spider tiptoes his way around the toy shop. The music does not move the storyline, the character does. That’s a departure for the Silly Symphonies.
There are some very good sequences here, such as the spider playing the piano. He perches his feet on either end of the keyboard, and uses his body to play the keys. It’s a great gag, and a unique one as well. We’ve seen a ton of pianos in the early Mickey and Silly Symphonies cartoons, but this is a unique use that we have not had before.
One unfortunate gag in this one is the use of the “Mama” dolls. The spider’s music inspires two curly headed dolls to begin dancing in time with the music. Every time they stop, the dolls say “Mama,” just like old baby dolls used to do. When they stop, though, a loose limbed black doll begins dancing and says “Mammy,” instead. It’s a blatant racist characterization, which was not uncommon at the time, but to me it was jarring.
A rather neat thing for the storyline happens early on, when the spider falls into a dark part of the store, and has to light a candle to see. This happens right before the piano sequence. The candle is perched on the edge of a box of fireworks, and you think that it might get knocked over, but it doesn’t, at least not yet. At the end of the short, though, the spider flies through the air, catches the candle and falls into the box of fireworks.
The fireworks ignite and start chasing the spider across the room, eventually chasing him out of the store. It’s a very nice piece of continuity, which has not been a hallmark of the early shorts.
Midnight in a Toy Shop was a great cartoon, very enjoyable and easy to follow. I think the narrative makes the difference here, and I’m interested to see if this follows through upcoming sorts. Wilfred Jackson directed this one, so I’ll see if this is something his animation team did, or if it was a studio wide direction.
It looks like we've just seen the start of the Silly Symphonies' transition away from being simple music videos, towards the later story and character-driven one-shots such as The Three Little Pigs, which laid out the groundwork for the Disney feature films. That'll be something to keep watching out for, especially once the series transitions to color a few years down the road.

Pulling back the curtain on how SoftBank’s massive Vision Fund works — including just how big a check it can write
With more failures in the electric motorcycle industry than going concerns and a contracting American motorcycle market, now would seem to be an odd time to launch a new bike into the EV arena. But Tarform, a new startup that unveiled its first vehicle last month in Brooklyn, is undeterred.
That’s despite the fact that the company will likely face an uphill ride selling its high-end, higher priced e-motos.
The EV upstart recently pulled the cover off its first e-motorcycles—prototype Café and Scrambler models at Brooklyn’s NewLab.
With the debut, the New York and Stockholm based startup now moves into testing phase and taking orders for its first production electric two-wheelers, expected to manufacture by late 2019.
Before getting back to the sobering EV topic of achieving scale and profitability, Tarform is committed to bringing a fresh design aesthetic to the motorcycle world.
The startup’s stated mission is “to set a new standard for two-wheeled transport by developing fully electric, zero-emission premium motorcycles, using sustainable materials and smart connectivity.”
For its prototype debut, the company did more than source parts and slap batteries into motorcycle frames.
“In order to distill the form to only the essentials, we were challenged to redesign every component,” said CEO and founder Taras Kravtchouk—an industrial design specialist, former startup head, and passionate motorcyclist.
From the swingarm to the pegs, speedo, fairing and handlebars—the company custom engineered a large portion of the Café and Scrambler prototype parts. Each also has a custom sound produced by a transducer inside the tank that matches a low pitch hum to motor revs.
A lot of the important stuff—such as the battery, suspension, and current power regulation system are sourced—but Tarform looks to shift toward more proprietary features, including a digital power delivery system with AI functions.
“Were talking to a company in Sweden to do a custom vehicle control unit to integrate Bluetooth connectivity [and ultrasonic proximity sensors],” Kravtchouk told TechCrunch.
“You’ll be able to sync your ride to an app…and get inputs on your riding behavior…to become a better rider.”
Tarform will offer two variants of its production motorcycles. Version one will be a 9kWh, 53 horsepower, 350 pound two-wheeler with a 95 mile per hour top speed and 129 mile range.
Charging time will be 3.5 hours to 80 percent and 8 hours to full power using a standard electrical outlet. A fast-charger option will get the bikes to 80 percent in less than an hour.
That compares to $8K for an entry level FX from Zero—America’s highest selling e-motorcycle manufacturer—and $24K for an Eva EsseEsse9 from Energica, a high-performance Italian EV startup with a U.S. sales network.
As for market positioning, Tarform aims to attract buyers by hitting that optimum balance of performance and design, according to Kravtchouk.
On power and range, “the question is how much we compromise the design [for a bigger battery], without making the bikes look fat and ugly. We’re trying to find a compromise,” he said.
Some people may want to have “a bike that looks sweet” with a slightly shorter ride distance, versus “a bike that goes further with a big battery jammed into it,” he said.
And that pivots to the business side of the equation for Tarform as an EV startup. A core part of the company’s value proposition is to create motorcycles that recapture the imagination of young folks.
As we’ve covered here at TechCrunch, the U.S. motorcycle industry has been in the doldrums since the recession.
New U.S. sales dropped roughly 50 percent since 2008, with sharp declines in ownership by everyone under 40. Motorcycle manufacturers are now largely competing for an aging and shrinking American buying demographic.
Females are one of the only growing ownership segments. And per an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study, total motorcycles on the road actually increased from 2008 to 2017—though nearly 75 percent of registrations are for bikes over seven years old.
So some Americans are buying motorcycles—but often not new ones—and the industry is (by and large) not connecting with 20 and 30 somethings.
Tarform believes e-motos (theirs in particular) can bring at least some segment of a more tech and design savvy younger generation back to motorcycles.
Of course, they’re not the only ones, and as mentioned, there have already been several flops in the U.S. market. Electric motorcycle startups Brammoand Mission Motors already tried and failed. And per TechCrunch’s recent reporting, California based Alta Motors—that had $45 million in VC—ceased operations two weeks ago.
Meanwhile, Energica and Zero Motorcycles have revved up U.S. promotion, distribution and sales. The two have extensive R&D facilities and roughly $90 million in VC among them.
Then there’s Harley Davidson’s full commitment to EVs. This year the company announced the debut of a production e-moto by 2019, an expanded electric line-up to follow, and the opening of a Silicon Valley research facility to support it all.
With their largely untested and higher priced product Tarform, faces a rough ride to compete with these companies in what is still a shrinking U.S. motorcycle market.
But going head to head with Harley or capturing existing market share from other e-moto startups isn’t necessarily Tarform’s strategy, according to CEO Kravtchouk.
“We’re not in the arms race. We’re not saying we’re faster than anyone else…We think our positioning is a little bit different,” he said.
“Since we started showing the design…so many people who are not motorcycle riders have come forward and said, ‘I want to ride that thing,” explained Tarform’s CEO.
“So maybe our demographic is not existing motorcycle riders, but people who wished they were motorcycle riders. That’s what industry, gas or EV, has had such a hard time capturing.”
Over the next year Tarform will look to see “how the market responds” to its first offering before raising a round.
“Before getting big funding we want to show we’re able to build this in a small garage in Brooklyn. Then the startup will “want to partner up with major manufacturers to take it to the next level,” said Kravtchouk.

An internal review must be requested within one month of receipt of the original decision (the public authority may extend this timeframe but is not required to do so). There is no charge for requesting an internal review.
An internal review involves a complete reconsideration of the matter by a member of the staff of the public authority, who may affirm, vary or annul the original decision made.
A written outcome of the review informing you of the decision, the reason for the decision and advising you of your right of appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental Information, including the time limits and fees associated with such an appeal, will be issued to you within one month of the date of receipt of the request for the review.
If you are not satisfied with the outcome of the internal review, you can appeal to the Commissioner for Environmental Information (CEI). You must appeal within one month of receiving the decision on the internal review from the public authority. However, the Commissioner may extend this time limit in individual cases
Over the past few many years, expertise has grown at an exponential charge offering trendy society with a lot of it’s creature comforts. Many such applied sciences have built-in scaffolds, systems, helps and even challenges to assist learners navigate, understand and interact with different studying environments. Asset path gives tracking of belongings in real-time starting from the acquisition of the property within the warehouse & until they’re disposed off.
Finally, as most technological discoveries purpose to reduce human effort, it could imply that extra work is done by machines. Using know-how should go beyond just knowing how to work with sure software program or apps, however educators also need to grasp ways by which such new tools could make a big impact on student studying.
I believe technology is sweet for saving lives and making the easy things in life rather more simple, but it’s harming us. We’re principally turning …

Back in June, we released the introduction to our whitepaper series on the subject of replatforming. Rather than try to nail the big topic of replatforming into one prescriptive document, we felt it was more appropriate to take it on using a series of smaller whitepapers that look at replatforming and modernization from several different perspectives.

Located in Old Town Square, Carrollton, TX this place is worth getting to. The ambiance is old Mexico, but very clean. One large room - a bit noisy like most are; friendly wait staff and family owned; You are well taken care of with pride of ownership, even though our waitress was not family ~ They leave to your conversation. This is import to us.
The name is Blue Agave named after the tequilana-weber agave azul from which tequila is made. Everything is made fresh from scratch ~ you can really tell; the sopapillas are drizzled with Agave nectar. I can't drink tequilla anymore, because I liked it too much in Tepoztlan, Morelos, Mexico; if you do you may want to try out their 100% agave tequilla bar.
Upscale food Mexican as well as a Texmex menu. I was impressed with the fluffy white rice, with small green flakes of fresh leaves of either cilantro or parsley - couldn't tell - but I don't like dry rice - this was my kind; I'd go back just for the rice.
The fresh pickled red onions on Susan's fish taco plate - impressed me to. Some one took the time, to present a really good plate.
The handmade fresh corn and flour tortillas were grilled to perfection, not mechanical cutters here.
We stayed under $20 for both for at dinner, because, I ordered the tortilla soup - this one I do love - avocados? yep! Normally I would guess about $20 each with soup, main and desert.
Susan tried it after her Yoga Class across the street at Breath of Yoga on Saturday - and found the chips smokey - not to her liking. This time wonderful to us both.
Oh, did I mention the salsa? Oh, my the salsa is a warm dark tomato salsa with mild to medium heat - (mild by Santa Fe standards) I ordered extra for the fresh tortillas with butter. Yummy...

The effective home remedies for baldness and hair loss in men include oil massages and including coconut milk, eggs, avocados, orange juice, aloe vera, neem paste, henna, mayonnaise, honey, black pepper, vinegar, and lemon juice in their diet. The remedies also include cutting back on red meat, eating nuts and brown rice, boosting B-complex vitamin intake, and maintaining good thyroid health. For millions of men across the world, regardless of culture, class, nationality, religion, or color, hair loss is an unavoidable aspect of growing older. Fortunate are those who do not face hair loss problems even in their old age. However, a majority of men face this issue in their 40s, 50s, or even earlier. Causes of Baldness or Hair Loss in Men.
There are a number of causes of male hair loss, including: Male pattern baldness Alopecia Fungal infections Psychological disorders Chemotherapy side effects Nutrient deficiencies Hormonal imbalances Lack of circulation on the scalp Stress. It is important to note that hair loss occurs in women as well, for some similar reasons, and some different ones. We will cover hair loss in women in a separate article. Men predominantly suffer from this health condition, particularly male pattern baldness and early onset hair loss from age 20-40. However, there are ways to slow down the rate of male hair loss or baldness, and even stimulating the hair follicles to reproduce hair. A few home remedies for hair loss and baldness issue are discussed below.

Feb 29: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Monday said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made the opposition’s job a “bit tougher” with his general budget not focused on the affluent of the nation.
“By not focusing the benefits of #UnionBudget2016 on the #suitboot people Arun Jaitley has cleverly made the opposition’s job a bit tougher,” Abdullah tweeted in his first reaction to the union budget.
Curfew-like restrictions continued for the second day in parts of Kashmir and mobile internet services were today suspended in some areas as tension prevailed in the Valley following killing of four persons in action by security forces during violent protests since Tuesday.
Strict restrictions have been imposed in Kupwara town, Kralgund, Handwara, Magam and Langate areas in north Kashmir to maintain law and order, a police official said.
He said the restrictions were imposed following death of three persons during protests against alleged molestation of a girl by a soldier in Handwara town on Tuesday. Another youth was killed in Drugmulla area of Kupwara during protests against the Handwara incident yesterday.
Restrictions also continue in six police station areas of Srinagar city where sporadic incidents of stone-pelting were reported through the day yesterday, the official said.
He said the affected police station areas include Safakadal, Maharajgunj, Khanyar, Nowhatta, Rainawari and Maisuma.
Normal life remained affected in the Valley due to a strike call by separatist groups. Markets remained closed while public transport was off the roads due to the strike.
Authorities have suspended mobile internet services in north Kashmir areas to curb the menace of rumour mongering, the official said.
Although the situation in most of the Valley has been peaceful so far, isolated cases of stone-pelting have been reported from some parts including south Kashmir’s Kulgam town, he said.
A cab driver was injured in a stone-pelting incident in Kulgam, the official said. All trains operating between Srinagar-Badgam and Baramulla in north Kashmir remained suspended for security reasons, railway officials said.
They said similarly rail runs between Srinagar-Anantnag-Qazigund in south Kashmir to Banihal in Jammu region have been cancelled for the day.
Rail services have been suspended in view of the past experience when property worth crores of rupees had been damaged during demonstrations in the Valley.
Then came the financial crisis of 2008-2009: a major blow to ge since its case 22 jeff immelt and the reinventing of general electric 747. In this package we examine how ge undertook the massive task of starting in 2009, over the course of several years i visited our controls and analytics labs and including our language, to signal that we are in the middle of a reinvention.

This paper addresses the issue of corrective feedback (CF), a topic widely investigated in the last few decades (Sheen, 2011), and instructional context. We observed and recorded the oral interaction of an intact class of thirty Spanish intermediate-level high-school learners and two teachers in two settings: a traditional form-oriented English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom and a meaning-oriented Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) classroom (Dalton-Puffer, 2011). Corrective feedback episodes (CFE; Lyster, 1994) were used as the unit of analysis. The findings of the study indicate that there are differences in the type, quantity and manner of CFE between the two learning contexts. Although no significant difference in the proportion of learners' uptake was found between the EFL and CLIL contexts, a qualitative analysis of the data indicated that the teachers' attitude toward CF influenced subsequent learner uptake. Implications for further research on CF, learner uptake and instructional context are suggested.
It is said that “things are the way they are because they got that way”. So please, step back with me, into the mists of time …. time … time …
Once upon a time, not so many years ago … the UK was swamped by a confusion of work-related qualifications based on classroom tests, attendance on courses and time-serving apprenticeships.
Each of the assessment regimes has serious weaknesses. Even if all three (tests, attendance and time-serving) had been achieved, there was still no guarantee that the candidate was able to do the job, in real workplaces, to an agreed standard
The bodies that awarded such qualifications made their money from passes, so much of their energy went on balancing the credibility of the qualification with ease of achievement.
The bewildering selection of certificates, awards and diplomas across different qualifications gave no indication of how they related to each other and at what level
Employers were confused by the qualifications and so resorted to filtering out applicants for jobs by setting thresholds of the more commonly understood academic qualifications such as GCSEs, A-levels and degrees (which were usually achieved at age 16, 18 and 21 respectively)
Government funding of work-related training was the trigger for a restructuring of those old input-based qualifications, which assessed the training undertaken rather than the candidate’s ability, into a national framework.
Under the auspices of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (and its vocational precursor the National Council for Vocation Qualifications) each industry set its own National Occupational Standards (NOS) which described the outcomes of competent performance in specific functions. The training input was irrelevant, competence is judged on what people can do rather than which courses they had sat through.
NOS were expressed in “units” – chunks of work function commonly undertaken within the industry. The principle being that each unit could be achieved separately to build a portfolio of units which cover current, and perhaps future, job roles.
Of course, some functions, such as admin, were common across most industries, so existing units from other sectors could be incorporated into the NOS.
So far, so good. The NOS are really useful to employers as benchmarks of competence against which they can plan training, recruitment and business strategy. Sectors still set and review their NOS through a rigorous process of employer input and consultation.
It would have been possible to stop at that point. To provide the framework of competences against which companies too, can plan their own development and to enable people to build a portfolio of relevant unit certificates, the credibility of which are based on performance in real work situations.
But no. Our penchant for “big qualifications” ruled the day and the units were bundled up into National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs). These were often a prescribed cluster of units to be achieved but often comprised a few core units with a requirement to supplement these with a set number of “optional” units taken from a wider selection.
First point of weakness: Candidates for employment may each have the same NVQ from the industry but the employer has no way, initially, of knowing for which combination of units the candidate’s qualification is awarded and thus in which aspects of the job role they have demonstrated competence.
Second point of weakness: Much UK vocational training is publicly funded. Funding is based on a combination of input and achievements. The most convenient measure of outcome is achievement of the agreed NVQ. Training is therefore designed to get learners to produce the most expedient portfolio of evidence that will achieve the NVQ, as quickly as possible. This usually means a standardised programme of evidence generation with little training as possible. Opportunities for learners to customise their NVQ unit collection to suit their skills and career plans are thus severely limited.
“At present, it is hard to understand all the different types of qualification that learners hold – what level they are, how long they take to complete, what content they cover, and how they compare to other qualifications. The new framework will help present qualifications in a way that is easy to understand and measure.”
I have recently been helping a significant UK industry to define and agree an up-to-date set of NOS which meet employers needs for units of qualification which describe the skills, knowledge and understanding which come together in real work situations to demonstrate competence. Extensive consultation and negotiation has produced what is agreed to be a comprehensive and definitive set of standards and which are currently awaiting accreditation.
However, even before that process is complete, I have just spent a few days deriving units for the Qualifications and Credit Framework for the first time. It is too early to know whether the draft units I have produced are acceptable but the process has been one of progressively weakening the standard, becoming more concerned with testing the learning process rather than workplace performance and being advised to “make it easier for candidates”. You’ll understand that I’m concerned about this.
Every unit and qualification in the framework will have a credit value (one credit represents 10 hours, showing how much time it takes to complete).
For who to complete? A 16 year-old apprentice or someone with experience who may be moving into the sector and bringing lots of existing skill, knowledge and understanding with them?
… looking at the title of a qualification you will be able to see how difficult it is … GCSEs (grade A*- C) are level 2, GCE A levels are level 3 and a PhD is a level 8
Unit-based allowing smaller achievements to be recognised and accumulated to gain full qualifications.
So far, so good, but it doesn’t appear to add much to how the existing NVQ system was conceived. However, by creating knowledge-only units it also allows for combining units from education and employment. I would suggest that this is not sufficient a benefit to warrant the wholesale upheaval of the system – at significant cost.
The credibility of NVQs with employers took years to establish. With QCF units often being derived, filtered and reformulated from the NOS, employers are not so directly involved. Credibility may be even more of an issue.
From what I have seen the QCF units don’t paint a picture of competence, rather they seem to tell a story of learning about some of the NOS content.
Perhaps I’m missing something. I’m very willing to have my scepticism overturned. So if you would like to put me straight, please, leave a comment.

Linda LaGanga, who works in a community mental health service in Denver, has written a useful summary of her service’s experience of applying Lean.
Their use of Lean is shaped by the economic context of US health care, but there are several useful lessons in their work. The Mental Health service’s interest in Lean began, as is often the case, by serendipity. The service had a problem – low attendance at out-patient clinics – and a manager attended a Rapid Process Improvement event in another service, and saw a set of techniques which offered a solution.
This initial problem is a classic Lean opportunity: it involves patient flow, numerous administrative processes and, in most services, considerable unproductive effort, related to systems that may not quite gel. In this case, the efforts of the people who worked in the service led to a 27% increase in completed appointments in the following year – a significant achievement, and one which resulted in the decision to use Lean techniques again.
The Denver report includes a fascinating summary of the time it took to implement changes from each subsequent project:
The pattern here is obvious. Lean is supposed to help produce rapid change, but in the experience of this service, change became more and more difficult to implement with each successive project, and took longer each time.
Part of the reason seems to have been decisions on methods of improvement. In the third project on recruitment processes, the first with a significant delay, the solutions adopted were changes to an electronic information system. According to the report on the Denver service,
‘Implementing the solution required extensive systems analysis and programming from scarce analytical staff and took six months to complete because of the bottleneck caused by the growing work queue of such staff.’
The outcome of the project was, according to the service’s account, a three day reduction in the length of time to hire new staff. At face value, this seems a relatively modest trade off for the work involved.
Their fourth project was intended to improve reporting on spending. Quite rightly, the project team wanted to avoid multiple stand alone spreadsheets, with potential for error and confusion, so designed a new electronic system to gather the required data. The development of the system took a year, because of issues over sequencing of other work, the time required for system development, and a lack of clarity over which staff were accountable for implementation.
In the last example, training of new staff, the project team concluded that tasks such as teaching people to access their e-mail could be done more efficiently by developing new on-line modules.
These are all worthy projects, and it is easy to see why an organisation would want to work on these problems. The bigger question may be whether these were Lean projects at all.
Most people agree that Lean is intended to focus on value, and to decrease non-value added activity by decreasing various kinds of waste. There is an interesting discussion of the challenge of defining added value in office processes here.
To me, most of the projects described by the Denver service sound like Business Process Reengineering. There is a great discussion of the differences between Lean and Process Reengineering in this Forum discussion. One of the posts, by Bill Roper, seems particularly relevant.
‘Lean focuses on making things better rather than making things perfect and accepts that multiple rounds or improvement will be necessary, and are in fact desirable, to help move the change process along.’
The Denver work, after the first couple of examples, seems to have focused on producing a perfect process. This is an unarguably admirable aim, but in these cases producing the perfect may have been at the expense of the ‘good enough’. Once the IT solutions were delivered, it’s still necessary to then make them work in practice. I’ve written previously about Virginia Mason’s ‘Pursuit of the Perfect Patient Experience’ – but perhaps the key word is pursuit – it depends on continuous quality improvement and a willingness to go on changing over time.
In these projects, would it have been better to have engaged staff in rapid, small cycle change, or to aim for the perfect solution? What do you think?

Discussing an appropriate response to terrorism just a few days before a general election is far from ideal. Perhaps that’s why so much of what has been said and written since Manchester – and even more so since the London Bridge attack – has been of so little value.
In my view, there are two essential elements to any successful counter-terrorism strategy: first, to identify and monitor those who are likely to plan and launch terrorist attacks, and if necessary to arrest them before they execute their plans; and second, to do everything possible to minimise the number of potential terrorists who are tempted to plan and execute attacks in the future.
This approach, incidentally, applies equally to terrorists motivated by jihadi zeal, or by Irish republicanism, or by extreme nativism and nationalism (eg Thomas Mair, who murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox in west Yorkshire, or Jeremy Christian, who is alleged to have killed two men who intervened to stop him screaming anti-Muslim abuse at two teenage girls in Portland, Oregon).
The identification and monitoring of those likely to launch terrorist attacks is the job of the security services and the police. It is also, of course, the responsibility of relatives, friends and neighbours whose suspicions are raised. (In both the Manchester and London Bridge cases, it appears that family members and neighbours had done exactly that – and we need to know much more about why their suspicions were not acted on.)
If more resources are to be made available to confront the terrorism threat, surely it makes more sense to use the extra cash to recruit more intelligence analysts and more specialist anti-terrorism police officers, who can sift through the mountain of material already available and make better-informed decisions about where the main threats lie.
So far, I have seen nothing to suggest that more armed police on the streets would do anything to prevent more attacks – and the responses to the Westminster and London Bridge attacks suggest that the armed police we do have are already extraordinarily good at their jobs.
Nor do I believe that they need extra powers. The problem is not that they aren’t able to find the potential terrorists, but that they don’t have the resources to analyse the information that they have to act effectively and in time.
As for reducing the numbers of new terrorists, surely the priority must be to work much more imaginatively – in schools, in prisons and in social service provision – to counter the alienation and anger felt mainly by a tiny minority of second generation immigrants who are lured by the siren call of jihadi recruiters.
It should not be forgotten that the deluded young men who become mass murderers are also committing suicide – so we need to understand much more about why they are so angry and devoid of hope that they are prepared to die while killing as many others as they can.
It is complex and difficult and will take time. But somehow, Western liberal democracies will have to learn how to encourage vulnerable young men to value their lives – and ours -- more than their, and our, deaths.

LOX Gene Transcript Accumulation in Olive Olea europaea L. Fruits at Different Stages of Maturation: Relationship between Volatile Compounds, Environmental Factors, and Technological Treatments for Oil Extraction - pdf descargar
LOX Gene Transcript Accumulation in Olive Olea europaea L. Fruits at Different Stages of Maturation: Relationship between Volatile Compounds, Environmental Factors, and Technological Treatments for Oil Extraction
The quality of olive oil is influenced by genetic and environmental factors and by the maturation state of drupes, but it is equally affected by technological treatments of the process. This work investigates the possible correlation between olive LOX gene transcript accumulation, evaluated in fruits collected at different stages of maturation, and chemical biomarkers of its activity. During olive fruit ripening, the same genotype harvested from two different farms shows a positive linear trend between LOX relative transcript accumulation and the content of volatile compounds present in the olive oil aroma. Interestingly, a negative linear trend was observed between LOX relative transcript accumulation and the content of volatile compounds present in the olive pastes obtained from olive fruits with and without malaxation. The changes in the olive LOX transcript accumulation reveal its environmental regulation and suggest differential physiological functions for the LOXs.

Concerning the Colorado child care assistance program, and, in connection therewith, establishing eligibility requirements for all counties and creating a new formula to determine the amount of block grants to counties.
Joint Budget Committee. For providers under the Colorado child care assistance program (CCCAP), the bill requires the state department of human services (department), in consultation with the counties, annually to contract for a market rate study of provider rates for each county. Based on the market rate study and each county's percentage of the total number of children eligible to participate in CCCAP, the department establishes the amount of each county's block grant. The bill allows the department to adjust a county's block grant amount based upon rules promulgated by the department.
Under current law, a county is permitted to determine the percentage of the federal poverty level for eligibility in CCCAP for that county. The bill sets the federal poverty level for all counties at 185% but allows the state board of human services to adjust the percentage by rule if required by federal law.
The bill adjusts certain periods of eligibility and removes references to preconditions that have been previously met.
(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)

Maybe it’s the looming recession, but this autumn we’ll be shedding our rosy cheeks and Ruby Woo lips of the past two years and adopting a dark, pagan take on pre-Raphaelite. We’re not talking about the healthy, glowing, ginger-haired beauty of a Rossetti painting. It’s more macabre and gothic than that. The London autumn/winter 2008 catwalks, from Mulberry to Paul Smith, were awash with pallid complexions, kohl-blackened eyes and almost mischievous, darkly smeared pouts. Johnny Depp and Helena BonhamCarter, as shot by Tim Burton, are the idols of this set, while Robert Smith is its rock royalty. Morbid beauty takes the focus away from skin, moving it to eyes, lips, nails and hair.
This winter, instead of highlights, bronzer, blush and bright colours, lids will be dark with inky black or sooty grey liner and lips will punctuate the face with garnet red. Nails will be short and deep blue, Rouge Noir or even matte black, and blush will be a distant memory. Perfumes will be heavily oriental, smoky and musky, like walking into an opium den. Prepare to wear your hair tousled and flyaway and your complexion wan; it’s a dark yet soft look, a bit wicked and a bit sad, and a fashionable way to mourn the passing of the sunny season and our economic prosperity.

People were dealing with some heavy stuff and I was basically terrified. I did not know what to say and felt like I should not be there. Rich encouraged me, I was frantically texting Lorie, and praying. I wanted to run! Instead, I just stepped out and let God use me. God used my inadequacy to make me solely depend on Him! It was awesome!

While I tend not to function as well at night, I can appreciate the appeal it has for some people. I’ve been out late at night before. There’s something inherently exciting and even a little sexy when it’s dark, quiet, and eerie. It’s like hiding in a shadow, free from scorn and scrutiny. It allows us to be a little bolder. For some, it allows us to be a little naughty as well.
What follows is a Daily Sexy Musing dedicated all those naughty things we do under cover of night. Whether it’s sneaking over to see your lover or just sneaking in a shot of whiskey past midnight, it adds a little spice to our lives and that’s worth celebrating.
The clock strikes midnight. Then, it passes. The air gets colder. Every light gets a little dimmer, from the moon to a candle. It’s like a blanket covering every inch of land. None can escape its grasp, but I’ve no intention of running towards the light.
I got your call. Your voice is so soft, yet it booms in the late hour. While everyone else sleeps, your loins are wide awake. You want me. You need me. I’ve no intention of denying you. No matter the hour, my passions keep me alert. They guide me to you and my legs cannot carry me fast enough.
For once, darkness is an ally and not an obstacle. Too many people are home resting. Too few people are out and about, creating noise and prying eyes. It’s like the entire world is letting its guard down. I don’t have to filter my feelings. From the most romantic to the most lurid, I can follow every one of them with impunity.
When we finally meet, it’s like the darkness is affirms our every whim. It surrounds us in its protective shroud, hiding us from the constraints that attempt to contain our wildest whims. In broad daylight, there’s only so much we can do to express our love. Without that daylight, we are truly free. It’s as if the night is daring us. Except, we don’t need to be dared.
Together, we find a place that neither the sun nor moon can hope to reach. I smile at you and you smile at me. You have the look of the most angelic angel and the most devious demon at the same time. You’re not going to be gentle with me. I intend to return the favor.
There is no restraint, limit, or burden. There is only us and our passion, unfiltered and raw. Under the light, it is a lurid spectacle. In the late hours of the night, it is real. Thanks to the darkness, though, it is ours.

Vacation and travel incentives are one of the most powerful methods of attracting business, retaining profitable clients, increasing profits, enhancing product awareness and improving employee productivity.
Businesses that have used vacation travel incentives in their marketing and promotions have seen at least 30% increase in their sales on both sides of the buy and sell cycle. Companies of all sizes and virtually any type of retail, wholesale, manufacturing, internet, service, distributor or direct sales business will benefit from incentive travel programs.
"Cash bonuses are necessary but travel is a higher perceived reward," says Verizon's Porterfield. Porterfield added, "When people spend their money, it's gone. But the recognition that comes from our travel incentives lives on."
Many businesses discount their product or service to attract customers, thinking that's what people really want.
Studies show that people are probably going to buy your product or service anyway. So, instead of reducing your revenue to attract business, keep your prices the same and add a travel incentive that will greatly increase the perceived value of your product or service, not to mention the lasting memories and referral business it will generate.
Loyal Customers and productive employees are the foundation of a successful business. To continuously retain and motivate people can be a difficult challenge.
"We were looking to generate more leads and get prospects to bring their mortgages to us. Our industry is highly competitive and all too often prospects shop around and when they finally make a decision it could be with a competitor even though we offer similar rates. We wanted to get prospects to skip the shopping around and sign up with us."
"We ordered 50 of the Cruise certificates from our level 2 lifetime travel package at $30 each. We offered these Cruises as a thank you to anyone that closed a loan with our company. We used this incentive in our advertising campaigns and immediately started receiving more phone calls."
"The results were exactly what we were aiming for! Clients that come to us for a mortgage don't bother shopping around when they know that if they close a loan with us they get a vacation. It was the best marketing tool we have ever used and has paid for itself many times over and I would highly recommend this to any business. Quite simply it was the best investment I've ever made."
Every year we look for a way to bring in more referrals for our tax preparation services. Since 95% of our business relies on referrals we have always offered a reward to the clients that send us referrals. In the past we gave a $25 certificate good at local restaurants which didn't increase our business at all. We then purchased a level 2 lifetime travel package which allowed us to give an unlimited amount of Cruises for $30 each. We thought we would give them a try as they were very affordable.
We purchased 700 Carnival Cruise Certificates and offered them to any clients that referred two new clients during tax preparation season, January-April, 2007.
We ran the promotion for 4 months and ended the tax season with over 300 new clients! We are very satisfied with the Vacation & Travel Incentives as a marketing tool and will definitely be using them again in the future.
"I was hired about 2 years ago to market to aged accounts - The Company sells a business opportunity to set people up in specialty advertising industry, promotional material - pens and ball caps, that sort of thing. The database had about 24,000 names on it and I was challenged to come up with a way to turn the aged customers into sales. These were accounts where customers had said 'No I do not want to buy this product'."
"I used the 3 day 2 night Mini-Vacations that are available on an unlimited basis from our Level 1 lifetime travel package to get customers back in front of a presentation. We ordered about 1,500 of the Mini-Vacation certificates at a cost of $6.95 each. The recipient only has to pay room taxes or a possible processing fee. The vacations work without a hitch. We offered 6 different locations within a reasonable driving distance for the customer.
"The results were great. The first 6 months of last year, sales were up $400,000. The first 6-months of this year sales are up $1.2 million. The Vacation certificates get people's attention. They have a high-perceived value.
I am 110% satisfied. The owners of the company get to use all the other great trips and hotel and travel discounts in our Level 2 travel package. I just booked an 8 day 7 night trip to Rome as a reward. I will only pay the room tax and the Company owners are paying the airfare for my wife and me to go. I would recommend the Travel Incentive Marketing concept to anyone who's trying to get their customers attention. It's the law of reciprocity - I put a pen in your hand and you feel compelled to give me a moment of your time. I give you a vacation certificate you're going to give me 2-3 hours."
"My husband and I work as a Real Estate Team. With the competitiveness of the real estate market being what it is we were looking for a way to stand out from the rest of the pack."
"We purchased 25 of the Disney Florida Holiday: 4 days/3 nights lodging at a resort hotel in Orlando which included 2 tickets to Disney World along with over $1,000 in coupons for food, entertainment, activities and dinner shows. We ran advertising and offered them as settlement gifts to buyers and sellers who chose us as their agent."
"The response was overwhelming and we went through the certificates in a matter of a couple months. Needless to say we increased our business significantly as a result of giving this gift as an incentive to choose us over a competitor. This is a great Marketing tool.
By now you should appreciate the great value of using travel incentives in any business. Perhaps you already have some ideas flowing as to how you will use incentives in your business.
"I had never heard of the Coastal Travel Incentives Package before until my daughter approached me and told me about it, and what we could use the package for. I decided to use the vacations in the package, not to increase my sales but as a way of saying Thank You to all of our clients. We are very fortunate to already have the business. This was just an added bonus to our customers. Thanks."
"We have over 10 franchise restaurants, we heard about the Coastal Travel Incentives Package being used for promotions and incentives through one of our franchise owners. He showed us how we could use the package to promote all of our restaurants. We realized quickly that we would be able to use this package over and over again with only a one-time investment. It made such sense in helping out all of our franchises. Each franchise now calls us and orders as many vacations as they want to use for any of their promotions. Thanks."
"I immediately saw the value of this package with my advertising. I started using the package to use free vacations to bring clients in for Scuba instructions and certifications. Thanks."

How would you assign a footnote and construe a culminating narrative of a synopsis? A back-cap to acknowledge the catechism advanced is in-complicated and mild with no intricate strings hooked up. A clear formalization of an accurate outline to the big idea could possibly be emphasized as a draft of biography modeled to show the traits of clout and handiness in an applicant to assist him take pleasure in fruition and make a easy progress within the backstreet of his career. Organising schemes trotted out as antiphon to the quandary of the best way to write a CV covering letter are not thought-about as iron-clad rules essential throughout the configuration of a resume and can be bestowed as informative flexible clues. Instead the trivia is considered as prized promoters which when built-in in a resume guarantees an inestimable boon when judged by a bench of slicks and recruiting honchos.
What would you like in your bar? Greater earnings, extra customers, elevated presence? Once you realize what you want, you’ll be able to decide easy methods to discover out what the client needs. Higher profits for you can turn out to be a music night time with a local band, which brings in additional customers and extra money.
If you are assessing an working enterprise, you should critically evaluate the premise upon what the business relies. Since it’s extremely unwise to proceed with a venture the place the time horizon throughout which the services or products will probably be purchased, is shorter than wanted to satisfy the financial targets of the enterprise. Your choice is to both decrease ambitions (deal with the venture as temporary, i.e. market the product as a fad) or to walk away.
Repute administration service is actually not new to business. Nevertheless, it is a new idea to small enterprise owners. Normally when one thinks of a company’s repute, they consider main companies dealing with headline scandals. The small enterprise owner in Fort Worth, Texas (or any random city), he or she would not have to fret a couple of repute, proper?
– What makes you unique? Good issues include a price, particularly if they are meant to give you good financial returns. Mailing lists are not any exceptions. Learning how to pay attention to what’s required for possible labor and stock costs each day is simpler to discover when networking. Ladies speak to different women more easily, so finding out these costs is less complicated and even more snug.
Individually, I have checked out Daegan Smith’s Optimum Leverage website online and in addition the value she or he gives there’s strong as well as confirmed.

Most of your whole correspondences such as statements, proof, invoices and payments want envelopes, so it is critical to own a printing type for the envelope that’s skilled because it implies that you just and moreover your online business are acknowledged and reputable. Both these factors could seem apparent, but you can be astounded how straightforward it is to make these silly, however costly errors.

I love the symmetry of the repeated stamped image, the vellum overlay and the the clever use of color. I went in circles coming up with my twist on this design - yes, the pun is intended :)
In the end, when I gave up on the idea of symmetry but stuck with circles, the card came together super fast. A white panel is cut with the largest sizes of the PTI Tipped Tops dies first and then the right angle of the panel is lined up with the right angle of the second die, so just a piece on the angled side is cut off.
The largest Circle Scribbles stamp is inked with Versafine Onyx Black and stamped in the corner of the panel, overlapping both pieces. The image is rotated a bit and stamped again.
The small piece of the white panel is adhered to the card base and a piece of waxed linen thread inked with Spiced Marmalade Distress Ink is wrapped and adhered to mimic the circle scribble.
Random circles of linen thread and yellow jute are adhered to the larger white panel and a sentiment from the PTI Splat stamp set popped up over them before this panel is popped up on the card base.
Since this is the first time using these stamp sets, I am linking up to Darnell's NBUS challenge which has been going on all month. You are being given fair warning, drink with caution when reading Darnell's delightful posts - you may be wiping off the computer screen before you are done :)
I want to give a huge "thank you" to Iwona Palamountain for inviting me to create along with the CASE Study Design Team this month - I had a blast!
Nichole Heady has provided sketches and color palettes, along with an inspiration photo, for the June Papertrey Ink Blog Hop. You can check out all the details and link up to the Blog Hop here.
I picked up the Stained Glass Die collection last year because I had an idea of using the frames just like this!
As often happens, what I planned to do and was actually created are two very different things, with the sentiment ending up in one of the frames :)
The candle from Birthday Style is selectively inked to create various heights, the balloons are inked, overlapped and inlaid into the yellow frame and the sentiment is created by combining Headline Alphabet dies with a Stylish Sentiments: Birthday stamp. Each framed piece has Wink of Stella applied for a little glitter.
I might have used the smaller frame before, but know I have never used the blue & pink frames so I am going to finally enter a card in Darnell's NBUS (never been used schtuff) challenge over at her blog djkardkreations! If, by some glitch in the interwebs, you are not familiar with Darnell and her delightful blog, you are in for a big treat.
I am also entering this card at Seize the Birthday, where Anything Goes for the current challenge. All the details for this challenge are here.
Because we have a few big things going on today, I am going to schedule this post to publish early and then link to the challenges when I have time this evening.
I'm back for another week as the June Guest Designer at the CASE Study Challenge. Doesn't this card from our muse, Pamela Ho, just make you smile!
As much as I love the design of Pamela's card, I was having trouble coming up with my own twist. It wasn't until I put this challenge aside and started working on a "congratulations on your new home" card that the lightbulb went off.
I only used white cardstock to create my little scene, coloring everything with Distress Inks, and adding a PTI sentiment.
A couple of layers of glue dots adhere the balloon strings and give the house great lift, making it look like it really is floating.
Want to hear a funny story? I know I've shared before that we painted our Kirkland house purple after I couldn't decide between 1000 shades of beige. Our real estate agent was adamant about repainting it beige before listing, so we did. Well, the new owners painted it gray within two days of taking possession and I've always wondered if it would have like the purple.
I am entering this card in a brand new challenge that is all about die cutting! The Cutting Edge Challenge is brought to us by Jackie Rockwell and you can check out the details here. As part of the launch party, they are running a Guest Designer Search Contest, although time is quickly running out to play along.
The challenge was to pick one of the designer's cards from the graphic above as inspiration. The balloon card caught my attention immediately, although I think my card also takes a bit from the window scene card too.
We have been officially on summer break for since Thursday at noon and I snuck away from our semi-annual closet clean out to make a couple of cards. This first one is completely inspired by Therese Calvird, the Muse for Challenge #71.
The font on the Lawn Fawn paper is a good match for the PTI Happy die. The Happy is cut from the panel three times, then stacked with three layers of cardstock and set back into the patterned paper panel.
The bright summer colors and birthday sentiment make this card eligible for the current Seize the Birthday Summertime challenge
The sentiment might be a bit unusual for a Father's Day card, but it really suits the relationship between my daughter & husband.
Wplus9's Dockside stamps & dies were combined with the wood veneer pieces to make the diagonal panel.
The big question is which category does this fit for The Card Concept challenge - Clean & Simple of Clean & Layering?
I'm excited to be back for week two as the June Guest Designer for CASE Study Challenge. Once again we have a terrific card from Pamela Ho to inspire us for challenge #195. You can check out the fabulous Design Team cards and play along here.
The images from PTI's Quilled Elegance are stamped with Memento Espresso Truffle ink and colored with Copics. I'd never used Copics on kraft cardstock before, so tested a few colors on a scrap piece before deciding to go with YG09, V15 and BG15.
This image includes a space between the lines for a stamped sentiment, but I wanted to use a word die. The panel is cut between the two lines and stretched a bit to allow three layers of the MFT Celebrate die cut to nestle in the opening.
I have a card to share today that combines the current Fusion Challenge with Ashley Cannon Newell's Make It Monday #168: Baby Wipe Stamping. You can check out the MIM tutorial here.
I love the gorgeous colors in the Fusion photo and knew as soon as I saw Ashley's technique using reinkers, I would be playing with yellows, pinks and oranges.
Harvest Gold, Summer Sunrise and Hibiscus Burst inks were randomly dropped on the baby wipe to create an ink pad. Three sizes of Funky Florals flowers were inked, masked and stamped on a white panel.
Before I go today, I just have to share a crafty project my noncrafty daughter made this weekend for a class assignment. Her original vision was much bigger and would have involved plywood, drills and a string of lights, but dad was out of town and she really wanted to get started before he would be back, so she left the garage and started poking through my art supplies.
After applying a Gesso coat, the sentiment (die cuts and computer generated) was adhered to create a mask and then the canvas painted navy blue. The masks were removed and she painted in the word "dream" with Tim Holtz Gold paint.
I only knew you could buy a short string of battery operated lights because a friend (hi Pat!) had used them on a beautiful birdcage project a few years ago. Slits were cut in the canvas and the lights fed through and manipulated to follow the lines of the word. These lights were soooooo easy to work with and the battery packs sat nicely on the wood frame at the back of the canvas.
I loved the MFT stamp set that Vicki Dutcher used for her Muse #70 card - many fabulous, amazing awesome sentiments in it!
This is one of those cards that took a couple of days to come together and looks nothing like what I was thinking at the beginning.
I white embossed a few of the sentiments on teal cardstock strips and finally decided just to stack three of them over the larger sentiment.
Three white strips (leftovers from a cover plate) are adhered together before the sentiment was stamped. The entire panel is cover with Wink of Stella and a couple of Gooseberry gems finish it off.
I'm sharing a quick Father's Day card I made and popped in the mail today. I'm not sure my dad will appreciate the layered "happy" stamping, but I like the way it came out. The yellow "happy" was stamped first, then sentiment was stamped off multiple times in gray. You can't really see it here, but the white panel is impressed with a Linen IP after all the stamping to add a bit of texture.
The color palette comes from The Card Concept Challenge #11, where I am entering the Clean & Layering category, and the design is based on CAS(E) this Sketch #79.
June is going to be a fun month around here as I have the priviledge of being the Guest Designer for the CASE Study Challenge Blog!
Every month Iwona selects a new Muse for us, and I am super excited that for June we are going to be inspired by fabulous cards from Pamela Ho. You can check out Pamela's blog here and join in the fun at the CASE Study Challenge #194 here.
I remember when this clever and creative design won the Emphasize the Negative Challenge at Moxie Fab World last year.
The bright pink and charcoal gray colors provide great contrast & drama, but instead of working with numbers, on my card flower petals float down the panel to form a glittery flower.
Three sizes of petals are scattered with a few Prima gems and Wink of Stella provides a great touch of glitter.
The layered flower is adhered to the inside of the card and peeks through a circle die cut on the front where an embossed Avery Elle image provides the sentiment.
Even though it's only been a week, it feels great to play with paper again! Erin Lincoln has a terrific challenge for Make it Monday #167: DIY Notebooks. Head over to Capture the Moment to check out her video tutorial and join in the fun.
I pulled out my first ever PTI stamp set for this quick little project. Yes, it was the Take Note stamp set that sucked me into the stamping world, although I didn't really dive into card making until a couple of years later.
A few pieces of Library Ledger papers were cut and stamped with Aqua Mist images to make the notebook pages.
I left the back cover a litte longer so that it wrapped back up the front of the pages. A vase die was selectively cut to provide a tab on this piece.
A paranthesis was cut out from the front panel to provide a slot for the tab, allowing the notebook to close completely.
I left my craft room and family last week to indulge in exploring a new (to me) city. A few months ago my oldest BFFs and I co-ordinated the schedules, set dates and booked flights for a trip to Chicago. We thought the hard part was done (it takes work to get flights from 4 different cities to land within 30 minutes of each other!) and then ran into a minor problem: every lovely hotel room in the city was booked for the ASCO. What the heck?! Apparently we picked the weekend that 30,000+ Oncologists take over the town.
While we have been friends for 40+ years and have slept together on everything from basement floors to tents, the minimum standards for our biennial eating/shopping/exploring trip are pretty high and require at least 2 rooms. I've used VRBO and AirBnB for family trips before, but this is the first time for I've used this type of service for a girlfriend weekend and I'm not sure we will go back to a hotel again. We gave up daily housekeeping, but found a fabulous condo, with 24 hour concierge services, that didn't require sharing rooms and suited us perfectly.
Our sweet Bella is almost fully recovered and thrilled to be free to roam the house again. I had to laugh at my daughter very seriously assessing her last night and determining that there was no reason Bella couldn't sleep in her room once again.
In addition to my passion for paper crafting, I love to cook, garden (except the weeding part), read and occasionally binge watch Netflix. My other big passion is volunteering as a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) in San Diego County through Voices for Children.

A jazz improv lab class in a medium-sized room. The tune is Thelonius Monk’s “‘Round Midnight,” and it is the drummer’s turn to solo. To the delight of his bandmates, he plays the main melody through all the changes without accompaniment. Never had I beheld such melodic drumming ‘til I heard The Melody of Rhythm by Béla Fleck, Zakir Hussain, and Edgar Meyer. Hussain’s work on tabla here speaks to the strong connection between the two necessary elements of music: so strong one begins to wonder if “melody” and “rhythm” are just two names for the same thing. The title-track three movement piece at the center of the album featuring the Detroit Symphony Orchestra creates tension like ten cups of coffee and release like Swedish massage therapy. It sounds like the nexus of Aaron Copeland, Ravi Shankar, and Igor Stravinsky. It is, like Barack Hussein Obama, deeply American and global. Fleck’s banjo is understated and overstated, busy and tranquil, cramped and spacious. Meyer’s bass seems unconcerned some may draw lines between popular, folk, and classical music. This is chamber music, foreground music, intricate music to listen to closely. And the closer you peer, the more the album reveals. Overtones sail at of nowhere and settle in the corner of the room. A rhythmic idea that only lasts a measure or two creeps into the corner of your ear and lays eggs. The blues thump and moan from the double bass.
The use of Eastern instruments like tabla or sitar on Western recordings can come across as a cheap ploy to sound “deep,” but on The Melody of Rhythm, Hussain follows Fleck’s banjo and Meyer’s bass closely, heightening their melody lines towards greater and greater clarity. His rapid successions of meaningful notes sound like what the melody instruments would play if the Fleck and Meyer had a couple extra hands. You wonder: Why there isn’t a genre of traditional music that employs these three instruments? Then: Who’s to say they didn’t just invent one? I know of no rule that says traditions cannot start in 2009, so I do declare this album is the beginning of a new tradition of music.

Many of us suffer from impostor syndrome, the feeling that we’re a fraud and it’s just a matter of time until others realize it. That feeling goes double (or more) in the writing world, where the learning curve is steep and we can feel like a newbie many times over.
Even after we get a handle on writing craft, we start over again at the bottom of the curve with the next step of the process: publishing (whether that’s learning about agents, querying, and publishers for traditional publishing, or researching cover artists, editors, and retailers to self-publish). And let’s not even talk about starting from scratch again to tackle marketing and promotion.
Add in the fact that every book is unique and the industry is always changing, and we can’t ever feel like we “know it all” about anything—at least not for very long. Suffice it to say that we probably all know the struggle of climbing out of the depths of the newbie dungeon. *smile*
But the truth is that we’re probably an expert in more things than we realize. Maybe we’re an expert in all the newbie mistakes to avoid. Maybe we’re an expert at overcoming obstacles. Or maybe we’re an expert at an aspect of our day job.
Whatever your background, now’s your chance to help others and share what you know. November—otherwise known as National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo)—is coming up, and that means it’s time once again for me to give my readers a special opportunity while I try to find more time to write. *grin*
No matter where our expertise lies, there’s a limit to how much we can make a name for ourselves on our own. We might not have a big platform, with only a handful of friends or followers on our blog or social media. Or our platform might not be that engaged, with followers who don’t pay attention to what we have to say. So how can we reach people beyond those limits?
One way to expand our reach is to “borrow” the audience of someone else. Essentially, that’s what happens every time someone retweets or shares our social media posts. A retweet or share spreads our message to a new audience—that of the person sharing our post.
Want to spread your message to a new audience? Try a guest post. Click To TweetBlog tours and guest posts work on the same principle. The readers of the blog might be different from those who read our blog or social media messages directly, so we get to expand the scope of who’s exposed to our work. Even if all we have is our blog or social media accounts to share rather than a new release to promote, we can impress others with our insights or knowledge or inspire them to want to hear more from us.
Done well, guest posts can benefit both parties, as both the guest poster and the host share audiences for the day. For both directions, a guest post can expand their reach by spreading their message to a new audience, and sharing unique expertise gives audiences a reason to pay attention.
My blog usually falls into the “I invite those I want” camp for guest posts. When I think of a blog topic that I don’t have the experience or knowledge to tackle, I reach out to someone who does and ask if they’d like to guest post.
Do you have unique experiences? Share your expertise in a guest post. Click To TweetBut to help me out during NaNoWriMo, I open my blog to guest post proposals. Each time I’ve put out a call, I’ve received fantastic proposals that I was proud to include here at my blog.
I also love giving a boost to others by letting them “borrow” the audience of a “Top 100 Websites for Writers” blog here at the same time they’re helping me. Some of the guest posts from my previous proposal calls have been shared over 7000 times, reaching hundreds or thousands of new readers in each of those audience groups!
(And that’s not counting my usual online or newsletter readers, which also each number in the thousands, or the ongoing exposure through my blog’s popularity with search engines.)
So I’m doing a call for NaNo November again. *smile* Have an idea for a guest post? For the next few weeks, hit me up through my Contact Page with a proposal for what you’re thinking.
I run topics here that cover all aspects of writing, from craft and publishing advice to the ups and downs of writing life. As long as the post will add value for my readers (no promo-only posts), I’m happy to take a look at all ideas.
It’s easy to get used to our life. Whether from self-doubt or sheer familiarity, we probably think we’re no one special.
You might even be scoffing at the idea that you’re an expert in anything. Yeah, you. I see you there, shaking your head and rolling your eyes.
Our life and experiences are unique, so we're all an expert in something. Click To TweetBut just because we’re used to our life doesn’t mean we have nothing to offer. Our life and our life experiences are unique, and they mean we have something of value to offer to the writing community.
Our expertise might be writing related. Maybe we’re an expert in fitting writing into a busy life of work, school, or family obligations. Maybe we’re an expert in how to write a certain genre. Maybe we’re an expert in a certain aspect of writing craft or in how to use or adapt a different writing process or in how to give insightful critiques.
Sometimes our expertise comes from non-writing life experiences, like the location we live, the hobbies we have, or that day job we may or may not enjoy. Day jobs such as graphic designers, editors, lawyers, psychologists, nurses, teachers, criminal justice employees, first responders, military members, etc. all give us experiences that are especially helpful to fellow authors.
Maybe our struggles or the obstacles we’ve faced give us experiences that resonate within storytelling. Or sometimes writers want a sanity check on their characters from people who have lived through similar experiences, whether that means struggles like racial and disability issues or obstacles like poverty and single parenthood.
All of those experiences can be valuable to other writers. And just as the world wants our unique stories, the world can also benefit from hearing about our unique insights based on our life and experiences. *smile*
Every blog host considers three aspects when deciding which guest posts to run. Whether you’re interested in making a guest post proposal here or not, these tips might help you propose a guest post to any site in the future:
All popular blogs have an audience because they offer something to their readers. They’re providing a benefit of some sort. The best guest post proposals will include information about how the host and/or the host’s readers will benefit from saying yes to the proposal.
In the past, I’ve often chosen posts focusing on topics I couldn’t write due to lack of expertise. But I’m also open to proposals about common topics written from your unique perspective, such as what you’ve learned, thoughts about your struggles, what you’d tell your newbie-self to watch out for now that you know better, or stories about who’s helped or supported you.
Have insights about what types of feedback you find most helpful from your beta readers? Or how you discovered and solved a tricky storytelling problem? Or how you research agents or contests? Or what marketing techniques were a waste of money? Or how authors can write about something more authentically? Or what authors can do to increase reader engagement? Share them! *smile*
If we know the blog we’re applying to (and not just “cold-calling” them with spam), we’ll know something about the blog’s audience. A blog geared toward non-fiction might not be the best place to propose a post about character development. *smile*
Previously, I’ve tweaked some of the proposals so the topic would be more applicable to a broader range of readers. For example, rather than a post targeting just a certain genre, I asked the guest poster to word their tips to be inclusive of many genres.
Some people proposing ideas think only about what they can gain from a guest post, so they don’t think about why a reader would care about their message. There’s a reason I don’t run promo-only posts here.
I encourage guest posters to plug their book, services, or blog in the bottom of the post, but the post itself must be full of information because that’s what my readers expect. To that end, with previous proposals, I gave suggestions for how the guest posters could make the post meet my readers’ expectations, such as how to focus on tangible and applicable tips.
I’ve gained so much from the writing community: friendship, support, and knowledge in humongous, immeasurable amounts. So like with my worksheets, I enjoy “paying it forward” by trying to help the writing community in return.
That’s a big part of my goal in opening my blog to guest posters. Yes, it helps me to run guest posts, but I also want to provide opportunities to other writers—opportunities to make a name for themselves as an expert, opportunities to reach a bigger platform, opportunities to do something they might not usually have a chance to do.
Giving opportunities is another way I can pay it forward to the writing community. And if we all have something to offer the community, that means we also all have a way to pay it forward and help each other. So give me your ideas for a guest post! *smile*
Do you agree that everyone is an expert in something? Or that our life experiences can be valuable to share with others? Do you have expertise in an aspect of writing? Or does your day job give you special knowledge or skills? Or do you have life experiences that might be helpful to other writers? Do you have any questions about proposing a guest post?

I presently blog about accessible locations to visit, so I am always glad to be told about a wheelchair-friendly beach, autism-friendly airport or others.
Animals – why you would incorporate animals in your writing, what they mean symbolically to the characters and how to treat them realistically. Animals and birds are all around us. If they are not in your book, why not? At least provide a reason, like no pets allowed.
Nature – we all live in natural environments, even within a city. Yet I often read contemporary fiction that takes place entirely indoors. One office, living room and kitchen is much like another. I can give tips on writing natural scenes and highlighting environmental issues if that is what your character would do.
Horses – the amount of times that a book is set on a stud farm or ranch, or a historical setting, but we never see a horse! As a horsewoman I can say that if you can’t write horses well, and don’t know the names of pieces of harness, don’t set your book in that location.

The Charter Commission after five months of study will present tentative recommendations at a public hearing on Tuesday, August 7th at 7:30 p.m. at the board of supervisor's assembly room in City Hall.
The mayor and council be elected every four years (no overlapping terms - the re-election of a certain number of incumbents to take care of continuity.)
The provision for "service departments," i.e. legal, financial, personnel, be set forth in the Charter and the establishment of other departments left to the council.
Other questions to be discussed are: Should provisions be made for initiative, referendum and recall? Should elections be non-partisan? Would it be practical to insure representation from rural Oahu by providing for the election of one candidate from each of the 3 rural districts outlined by the Constitution and the Reapportionment Act? Should the title Board of Supervisors be changed to City Council?
"The Council-Manager Plan is a form of local government in which responsibility is clearly fixed and which makes possible a combination of non-professional representation and trained officials. The Manager Plan was first studied by the League in 1923, It was on the active program from 1926 to 1942. Many Leagues are still working for a Council-Manager form of city government."

The crazy ramblings of one woman's life-journey in rural North Florida. Sometimes a simple life -- other times a complicated life; always a life lived striving to love and honor God and my family.
I've been trying to find a reason to blog again. So much is happening in my own life right now, I hardly have time to even THINK about getting on the computer at night when I get home from work.
I was reading the latest issue of my hometown newspaper -- The Levy County Journal. My dad insists on paying for my subscription each year so that I can keep up with hometown news. That works fairly well, except I don't usually GET the newspaper until a week later...sometimes two. Then sometimes it takes me another week to actually read the few pages there. So tonight, I decided to quickly read through the paper just to get it off the counter. (I have to actually READ the news stories because Daddy asks me about them...maybe its his test?)
Anyway,this week I came across a recipe that caught my eye. Normally, if it has anything GREEN in it --its an automatic "YUCK!" But tonight, for some reason, since I had all the ingredients and it looked fairly easy and I had to fix SOMETHING for supper...I thought I would give it a try. Bex and Mr. Fix-It LOVED it! I even ate some and thought it was pretty good --as long as I picked out the broccoli.
1 carton (4.2 ounces) Hungry Jack Premium Hashbrown Potatoes (*My note: These come in a little carton --looks like a small milk carton like we used to get milk in at school. I just happened to pick one of these up at the store a couple of months ago and thought I would try them. They worked GREAT!)
1/2 c. diced jarred roasted red bell pepper or fresh red bell pepper (I used the frozen bell pepper I cut up and froze when my friend T gave me a bunch of them last summer.)
1 c. (about 3 ounces) shredded Swiss cheese (Mr. Fix-It isn't big on Swiss--so I substituted Mozzarella.)
2. Fill hashbrown potatoes carton to fill line with cold water. Let stand 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander. (The box said to use Hot water...so I did.)
3. Mix hashbrowns, broccoli, chicken, bell pepper and black pepper in a large bowl. Spread in prepared dish.
5. Bake covered for 30 minutes. Uncover and continue baking for 15 minutes until top just begins to brown.

Twenty-eight distinguished contemporary American poets provide a multifaceted view of the creative process. Each poet has contributed a poem and chosen several poems by other poets that have influenced it. In an essay, each poet then describes how those influences have led to a sense of poetic mastery.
"In this quirky, resonant, and necessary book, generously edited by Stephen Berg, a wide range of American poets at all stages of their writing lives offer their poems and choose their precursors, meditating with great humility and insight on the dual mysteries of influence and mastery, on the reading that fosters writing, on the shimmering nobility of poetry itself." --Edward Hirsch, Author of "How to Read a Poem"

So as long as you seem like you know what you're doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. The main thing here is neediness is a killer.
Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances. It's a no-no to post pictures of nature, cars, or other people on your profile page. The thing is that of course it was a sunny day for the astronauts - you tend to forget when you see the black sky. I think settlement in space is likely to happen, and can be beneficial if done well.
Because the end-to-end principle is one of the central design principles of the Internet, and because the practical means for implementing data discrimination violate the end-to-end principle, the principle often enters discussions about net neutrality.

This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.

The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.

Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author&apos;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

Whether you are looking at buying or selling a property, it is always advisable to work with a very good realtor. You may know someone who works in real estate yourself, but you should still take the time to find the one that is truly the best for your needs. Let’s review two issues of importance when it comes to choosing a realtor.
First, you need to look into your realtor’s experience. Usually, those with the most experience are also the best ones. The best realtors got into the business before the recent economic crisis and are still working today. However, you also have to make sure that they have experience pertinent to your own needs. Someone who wants to flip properties, for instance, will have very different needs to someone who wants to find a home to raise a family in. You also need to know that your realtor understands your demographic and geographical requirements. For example, those who want to purchase a ranch will need a realtor that understands soil conditions and production methods and who can also look into the homestead that comes with the ranch. Should you be interested in purchasing a property that is historic or listed, for instance, you will need the services of someone very different.
Don’t work with the realtor of the owners of the property you are planning to purchase. This is because if you reveal any information that you could use in negotiations, the realtor would be obliged by law to pass that on to the seller as well. The same is true if you are looking at selling. You need a professional that represents you and only you. Start by asking people you know whether they can refer you to a realtor. You can also look through the NAR (National Association of Realtors to find good representation. If a realtor has a NAR registration, you know that they will be highly professional and ethical in their business dealings. Do make sure you speak to several before you decide which one to go with. Explain your needs and ask what they suggest. These conversations can help you determine just how much a realtor knows about a specific neighborhood, house prices and so on. As a potential seller, looking into the track record of the realtor. You need to know whether they usually sell below, on or above the asking price.
If you are selling, you are likely to have to sign an exclusive realtor agreement. It is a very normal thing to do but you still have most of the same rights. If, for example, you feel you are being poorly represented, you are allowed to terminate the contract. All the contract really prohibits is for you to work with more than one agent at the same time. If you want to buy a property, on the other hand, you don’t have to sign such a contract. However, it is becoming more commonplace for a realtor to ask for exclusivity. Finally, you must work out just how your realtor makes their money. There are a number of constructions realtors can use. In most cases, realtors will work by charging a commission on the final sale or purchase price of a property, but there are also those who charge a flat fee. Before you agree to work with a specific realtor, you have to find out which type of payment construction they opt for.

When people enjoy themselves outside the normal routine they build trust, are open to emergence, have ah-ha moments, learn more, and are more creative. Prior to any retreat I collect data and feedback in order to achieve objectives and implement a valuable experience for the entire group.
For the Friends of the Cedar River Watershed we facilitated a retreat at the Seattle REI to provide the board and staff a space to solidify their message, language, and regroup in order to set the stage for the following year. Outside the confines of the office participants were able to envision the future of the organization, lay groundwork for the vision and mission, and empower each other to be more effective on a daily basis by coming together to co-create a shared vision.

Yesterday, an upsettingly large proportion of my fellow North Carolina citizens voted to amend the constitution of our state to forbid a subset of loving, consenting adults from enjoying the legal benefits of marriage. Today, I am ashamed.
As a human being that loves my friends, my family, and my fiance, I am ashamed that other members of my species are incapable of recognizing that same love in others, just because it is superficially different from their own.
As an American who believes in the founding principles of a country that was built on ideas, not historical divisions, I am ashamed that my fellow citizens would choose to codify into our state's constitution laws that would deny the basic freedoms that are the birthright of all Americans--life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
As a resident of my adopted state of North Carolina, a state that, over the last 10 years has become my home, I am ashamed that a state I found so welcoming could be so unwelcoming to others.
As a libertarian who believes that expanding the influence of government into the personal lives of its citizens is rarely a solution, I am ashamed that we would choose to codify an amendment which does nothing but oppress one group of Americans and allows the state to decide what is and is not a family--as if there were ever a reason to give the state control over our private lives.
As a speaker of the English language, I am ashamed that our lawmakers would write such a poorly-worded, imprecise piece of legislation which at best is illegal and indefensible and at worse, will strip citizens of domestic protections.
I am saddened by those whose faith is so trivial that they think "sanctity" equates with "government bureaucracy".
I am saddened for my friends and colleagues who had to watch the deeply misguided debate whether American citizens deserved the same rights as American citizens.
But I am also heartened by the response from friends, colleagues, and strangers, who share in my disappointment, my sadness. North Carolina is greater than the worst of us.
This blog is my experiment in science poetry, creative writing, and photography. As a student of marine biology and science blogger, I've found that many of the things that inspire me about science cannot be expressed through conventional science writing. I needed an outlet to embrace "the poetry of reality", thus, Hardtack and Sardines was born.
Why hardtack and sardines? In 1903, President Teddy Roosevelt went on an extended camping trip through the Yosemite wilderness with naturalist John Muir. The outcome of this trip was the creation of the national park system and the birth of the environmental movement. Both Muir and Roosevelt were accomplished naturalists, with contributions to ecology, botany, and geology, yet they are remember most not for their science, but for the ways they inspired people - either through writing or policy. During this trip, Roosevelt ate nothing but hardtack and sardines.
Who am I? I'm a graduate student at the Duke University Marine Lab studying population genetics and connectivity among populations of deep-sea hydrothermal vent-endemic organisms in the western Pacific. You may recognize me from my other blogging adventure, Southern Fried Science, where I write about marine biology and policy, and occasionally wax poetic about the great American novel - Moby Dick.

Ken and I maintain observation sites for different species year-round. This is one of the most enjoyable adventures anyone can participate in.See big game species like moose,deer and black bear in the big woods or waterfowl and birds of prey on the river.It's all here.We have done our homework and the opportunity to view and photograph wildlife in their natural habitat is yours for the asking.
March of 2010 was out like a lamb,with some very good weather from the end of the month until well into April.This made for an early ice-out and the water rose and then went on a steady drop which is continuing as I write this.The water conditions on the 15th of April,the first day of fishing season,were similar to summer conditions,only slightly higher.The water
was very clear and when boating,the man at the helm had to know the river,because it was starting to get treacherous.The photo above shows a sport netting a nice grilse just up river from the highway bridge in Doaktown.Many fishermen don't realize it,but when the water is low,like it is this year,there is a lot of good holding water right in the middle of Doaktown and correspondingly a lot of good fishing right in town.For years now my good friend,Glen D.of Doaktown,has always fished within site of his house and has had no trouble catching fish.Glens whole family are well known sportsmen and guides from Chipman and the Carrolls Crossing area.This is usually the area I stay at and fish in when I'm on the Miramichi.
This is a photo of of Glen and Leroy A.,long-time guide on the Miramichi, taking a smoke break after a morning of fishing .Normally,the first of the season is reserved for fishing with family and friends and this year was no exception.I fished with Glens niece on the first day and then fished with Glens brother Allen and a couple of other buddies fromChipman.I can tell you now that the water conditions were near perfect but the weather was brutally cold!You really must be dressed for these conditions because it can spell the difference between a good trip and a miserable one. The wind was out of the north and east mostly and if you know the little rhyme,you also know it doesn't make for the best fishing conditions.But that being said,the first day was nothing short of fantastic!Donna and I caught fish until our arms ached! It seemed as though one of us or the other was playing a fish at any given time.We played two huge salmon for a total of two hours before the hooks fell out.One salmon in particular was the biggest Atlantic salmon I have ever seen in my life!Donna hooked this fish early on the first day and I knew soon on in the ensuing fight that we would not likely land it.It was just too big!I had to pull anchor and follow it three times to try to get line back.We only got this fish back on the casting line once,the rest of the time it was half way into the backing and taking more before we would pull anchor and chase down some line again.Finally,after a hard fight for an hour,with no sign of giving an inch,the hook just fell out of its mouth.I told Donna I thought this fish was five feet long and weighed fifty pounds and I don't think I was exaggerating at all!Now some of you readers may say"Sure,we heard those fish stories before!"but I got a good look at this fish,as did Donna and it was an absolute mammoth!.I got it to the surface twice,where it came up and wallowed for a moment and then with a flip of the tail,disappeared again and started stripping line.I estimated its tail was at least ten inches wide!I also hooked another salmon shortly after losing that one that I played for an hour and the hook wore a hole in his mouth and fell out.This was also a very large salmon,but nowhere near the size of the first one! This photo shows me with a nice salmon,one of four I caught on the third morning of the season.If you look closely,you can see the fly that I caught that fish on over my left shoulder riding on the water.I could have easily caught my limit of ten fish on both of the first two days of the season.I quit fishing in the afternoon of the third day.I was still catching fish,but the wind started blowing and it was bitterly cold,so I called it a day and spent the afternoon socializing and having a few beverages and laughs with some old friends.That is one of the most enjoyable parts of these annual excursions to the Miramichi River.The good friends and company and the many stories and tall tales that go with any of these trips really add to the enjoyment had by all.It was a rather odd start to the season because of the conditions and it was very interesting to see how the different guides and sports adapted to these unusual conditions.The ones who didn't choose the right gear and flies many times went fishless.I talked to one guide and I asked him how the fishing was and he responded,"It was terrible". This was on the third day and I had already caught four salmon and lost a couple of others and had numerous hits.I also talked to a couple of acquaintences and they also said they had some tough fishing.I tried to find a common denominator in both of these experiences and the one thing these gents had in common was their flies.I won't go into this any further but with a predominance of large salmon in the system,you have to be on your game or you won't be IN the game! I also caught some nice native brook trout.All these trout had their regular colors and did not have that shine to them that the sea-run brookies have.This photo shows one of the trout I released while salmon fishing. In total,I caught fifteen fish over two and a half days.Twelve of those fish were large salmon over thirty inches.The other three were grilse.The fish this year were in very good condition and fought very hard.This spring ranks right up there in terms of fish caught,but it was very cold and you had to be rigged up right or you just couldn't stand to be out there very long. This is another photo of a nice salmon with the fly still in the corner of his mouth.It was a great start to the fishing season and we will be fishing for salmon for a few more days,but the fish are starting to move down river already,so the fishing will drop off quickly up river,while the lads down in Blackville will get fishing a little later in the season.One very good site for up- to- date river reports is .http://www.miramichifishingreports.blogspot.com/.Rodney Colford writes this blog and provides some very good information on the fishing conditions on the Miramichi and her tributaries.We will be gearing up for the sea-run brook trout in the middle of May this year.Normally,we don't start looking for these fish until the third week in May but this year everything is a week or two early,so we will start fishing the sea-trout a little earlier.We have a few bear baits out already and Kenney said he had a hit on one of the beaver carcasses he has out. There are a lot of bears around,including some real old smashers.These older bears are well educated and do not act like some of their younger relatives.You must wait them out and often they won't come to the bait until the last light.Sometimes they will not come in until total darkness and then the only thing a hunter can do is change the bait site to a new location nearby or hunt him in the morning and try to catch him on the bait then. Sometimes none of the tricks work and just like some big bucks,these old bruins become almost unkillable.Ken and I will be going after some of these big bears this spring and we will be trying every trick in the book to get them to come in during day-light hours. This is a trail cam photo of one of the bears we will be hunting this spring.We got a photo of him coming to a deer bait we had out and he is a good sized bear.He also has a very nice white V on his chest ,as can be seen in the next photo. If anything,our hunting area has an over-abundance of bear and getting just any bear is usually no trouble.But again,if you want a big one,you have to hunt accordingly and be prepared to go home with an empty tag if Lady Luck doesn't shine on you.TROPHY ANIMALS DON"T COME EASY! If they did,there wouldn't be any challenge to it and I guess it wouldn't be called hunting anymore,would it! The opportunities are here in abundance,whether you are fishing for the King of sport fish,Atlantic salmon,or hunting for trophy black bears.Here at Hargrove and Bauer we will do our best to put our sports in the thick of things,so don't hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an e-mail to arrange your trip to the North Woods of beautiful New Brunswick! Until next time,Tight Lines and Straight Shooting to all!

While I’m on the subject of recommendations, let me make a couple more. Abrams-Skillman Self Storage and The Consignment Embassy.
At first it was just a storage place, albeit a nice clean one with what Bill thought was the best prices. We picked out a unit and the next day we put everything from Mom’s apartment into it. The next time I thought about it was after the funeral. Unfortunately that was a lot sooner than I anticipated.
Next thing I know, I’m sorting through things and deciding what to do with all of them. I was there day after day and soon felt sort of like a regular. The staff and I always greeted each other warmly and if I needed something, either they had something to borrow or to buy that would help me get out of whatever bind I’d sorted myself into. They were helpful in other ways. They kept trying to figure out what I needed before I needed it, like pointing out that the loading dock was right across from my unit and stuff like that.
Then we were down to the nitty gritty. We asked about the auctions and they filled us in. Then we needed an extra storage place for a day, while the auction guy did his thing, because we were saving the bedroom suite for a family member. No problemo – they gave me one right next to my original unit and when the auction was over, they let me stay in the one that I’d moved the furniture into. All that was very helpful and they really didn’t have to do it. The fact that I only made $150 off the auction items wasn’t their fault. Obviously the Storage Wars gang didn’t show up for my auction, but somebody made a killing.
Then there was The Consignment Embassy. We’d actually consigned a mirror there once and the transaction went very smoothly. I never went in, but Bill said they had gorgeous stuff. Anyway, out of the ten or so consignment places I dealt with, she’s one of the few that responded in a timely manner and she was the only one willing to take a stab at value before I’d hauled it to her store front. If you’re on either side of a consignment deal, I’d recommend starting there.
If you get stuck in a place where you need some of these services, these are my recommendations. Hope they can help you out.

I live in Vancouver, Canada now, but I grew up on the cold Canadian Prairies. Perhaps because of that I was fascinated as a kid by the warm and exotic sugar islands of the Caribbean.
When I got older I devoured novels in the age of sail genre set in the area, hooking me in turn on the history of slavery, life on sugar plantations, and the colourful characters populating this era.

There are many advantages when you buy league of legends account. Not only does it saves you money and time, it also helps improve your chances to win in ranked games. If you are Interested in buying LOL smurfs, here are some basic tips to follow when you buy LOL accounts.
There’s more than a dozen of websites that offer LOL accounts for sale. Of course, it is understandable that people can get nervous when transacting over the internet. The best way to know if your seller is reliable or legit is to get referrals, either from your family members or friends. But if you don’t have a family member or friend that loves buy lol accounts as much as you do, you can still try to read reviews and testimonials of former clients for reference.
When buying an account, people are often too excited that they forgot to take the necessary precautions when buying an LOL account. That being said, you need to remember to buy an account has the same server as yours. This is because LOL is extremely strict with people with bought accounts. You are more likely to get caught if you’re IP address says United States and yet, you are playing LOL using a European server.
The problem that most people who bought LOL account face is choosing the wrong rank to play with. If you are a novice, of course you need a lot of playtime in unranked games to improve your skills first. Buying a platinum or gold account from the get-go is not that smart, especially if still don’t have enough skills to protect that rank you bought or use the champions (which are often with the purchased LOL account) wisely on your games.

'CAIRO (Reuters) - A convoy of six Mercedes cars have crossed from Libya into Algeria, Egypt's state MENA news agency reported on Saturday, quoting a rebel source.
It was impossible to verify the report and it was not immediately clear who might have been in any convoy, but MENA quoted the source as speculating that senior Libyan officials or Muammar Gaddafi himself and his sons may have fled the country.
"It is believed that these vehicles were carrying senior Libyan officials, and possibly Gaddafi and his sons," MENA quoted the source as saying.
A government source in Algeria had told Reuters on Thursday that it would not yet grant recognition to the NTC, and that it wanted to be certain that Libya's rulers were engaged in fighting al Qaeda's north African wing.'

Between both. Between wintery showers. Between bouts of freezing cold and sunshine. The plan was to walk over both bridges in a loop, but my ears were nipping from the Arctic blasts as well as the whingeing from the others in the Polar expedition.
The original Kincardine Bridge, with the retired swing section centre, and the decomposing skeletons of some old shipping visible in the mud flats.
But, I was determined to give some new camera kit a good run-in, so persevered along the River bank from the old bridge, past the site of the old Power Station, sheltering under the new bridge before a tactical retreat and heading back.
Not easy working with small fiddly buttons when you're scared to expose your digits to the cold, but happy with the results. Looking forward to opening up the throttle with the camera on more outings soon.

Last day to order Scholastic book orders. If you want the books to be a surprise, write us a note and we will keep them here for you to pick up at a later date.
This morning we are talking about getting ready for Winter. We talked about wearing our winter coats. What do animals do when it gets cold?
We play outside every day. Please make sure your child is dressed warmly and comfortably. All clothing items should be labelled. Continue to encourage your child to get dressed independently.
This afternoon, Mme took out the viewmasters so we could look at some animals. We are also drawing bears hibernating in caves. While we were playing outside, some geese flew overhead. It was perfect timing as we had talked about the geese migrating this morning.

Table for Transmitting Chinese Despatches by Telegraph, containing all characters employed in official, commercial, or private correspondence of Chinese, and their translation in numbers
Folio (28.5 x 43 cm). 16 pp, mounted on linen. Contemporary half black roan, marbled boards, worn, separated at spine. Dampstaining. Very rare. FIRST EDITION. The Great Northern Telegraph Company introduced the telegraph in China in 1871. This rare volume enabled its use in Chinese, marking an epoch in the history of commerce. The first two pages provide instructions in Chinese, English, and French, and the other fourteen pages comprise a table assigning a four-digit number to each of thousands of Chinese characters. Viguier writes in small part, "In view of the early arrival in Shanghai of the submarine cable ... connecting this great centre of trade with the colony of Hongkong, and the southern provinces of the Empire, it becomes very important, in order to increase the native trade, by facilitating communications between the different markets, to enable the Chinese traders to employ this telegraph." The Chinese Recorder observed that the telegraph, "bringing into contact the most distant nations, marks an epoch in the progress of civilization" and reported in 1874 that Viguier's system is now 'extensively used" by the Chinese.

New York: George Routledge and Sons, 1871. First American Edition. The British sheets, with the title canceled for American distribution. With illustrations by Arthur Hughes. 8vo,, publisher's original cloth, the spine and upper cover with gilt and black decoration and ornate lettering, t.e.g., enclosed in a custom clamshell box. viii, 378pp. The spine has been expertly laid down, and recased, preserving nearly all the original material and the original end-papers, otherwise a fine fresh copy. AN IMPORTANT WORK OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. MacDonald touches on many theological and philosophical questions, especially concerning theodicy. It is considered one of his masterpieces. NORTH WIND is a fantasy centered on a boy named Diamond and his adventures with the North Wind. Diamond travels together with the mysterious Lady North Wind through the nights. There are many similarities between Diamond and MacDonald's own son Maurice, who died young. Diamond also seems to represent Christ, always trying to help others while not completely belonging to this world. The work is better known through the abridged edition of 1914 with illustrations by Maria L. Kirk. This original edition is nearly three times longer then that overly simplified version.

'A searingly honest book. So much of Rio's emotional turmoil and deep loss resonated with me. At the same time I loved his message of hope' GLORIA HUNNIFORD
'When Rebecca died, the idea that one day I might begin to feel better would have struck me as laughable ... I know how persuasive this kind of permanence thinking can be.
I know too that anyone locked in its grip will laugh if I promise them that their pain will one day ease. It will. Of course it will. But I know better than to expect anyone to believe me.'
In 2015, former England football star Rio Ferdinand suddenly and tragically lost his wife and soulmate Rebecca, aged 34, to cancer. It was a profound shock and Rio found himself struggling to cope not just with the pain of his grief, but also with his new role as both mum and dad to their three young children.
Rio's BBC1 documentary, Being Mum and Dad, touched everyone who watched it and won huge praise for the honesty and bravery he showed in talking about his emotions and experiences. His book now shares the story of meeting, marrying and losing Rebecca, his own and the family's grief - as well as the advice and support that get him through each day as they strive to piece themselves back together. Thinking Out Loud is written in the hope that he can inspire others struggling with loss and grief to find the help they need through this most difficult of times.

Greetings all! How are you? Where has the summer gone?! There’s definitely a chill in the air here at night these days. I’m hoping it’s an anomaly and it’ll go back to being warm again tomorrow. I’ve had an eventful few weeks – highlights include lakes, opera and A&E! I’ll start off with the good bits…
I went to Lago di Scanno back in April/May and had a great time. I wrote up a blog about it which I never got around to posting but I’ll do that in a week or two as it’s a lovely place to visit. Meanwhile these are a couple of my favourite photos from that trip…
Next up on the tour of local lakes, myself and my family who were over for a couple of weeks went to Lago di Trasimeno, Umbria. I’m used to sleepy towns and villages but Lago di Trasimeno was busy, particularly in the evenings with lots of nightlife. There are ferries which take you to the islands in the middle of the lake: we went to the only inhabited island in the lake called ‘Isola Maggiore’ for a wander around and some lunch. It’s very pretty. The lake wasn’t very enticing for swimming which was a shame but there are lots of little villages around the lake to visit. Castiglione del Lago was particularly nice with a castle to investigate too and even an open-air cinema if you’re there in the evenings.
Lago di Piediluco has been my final new lake this year. That was much more pleasant to swim in, though it seems to be relatively frowned upon by the lifeguards that kept whistling at me to come back every time I got more than 3 meters out from the shore. Italians are very anti lake swimming and I haven’t really established why; the most valid concern seems to be the presence of eddies that can suck you down into the lake. I haven’t actually seen or read of any evidence of this in the local lakes to back this up but one poor 23yr old died a week or two back swimming in Lake Fiastra which has somewhat dented my argument that they’re perfectly safe. There’s been no explanation as to what happened so the mystery continues. Anyway, apart from swimming in the lake, there are lots of lovely places around Piediluco to visit. We went to Narni (CS Lewis based the name of Narnia on this town, though it has no other similaries!), Leonessa (very quaint but a bit too patriotic for my liking – Italian flags were plastered everywhere and I felt a bit like an intruder!) and if it’s definitely worth seeing the Marmore Waterfalls, Cascate delle Marmore (the highest of which is the biggest man-made waterfall in the world at 165 meters). Unfortunately I couldn’t visit the waterfalls this time but have a look at an earlier post about them here for photos.
I’ve been on some lovely walks this year too using Cicerone’s Sibillini National Park Guidebook. I’m hoping to write up some of the walks for their blog. It’s been a bit of a challenge going for walks here this year to be honest. Many of the walks, refuges or routes are still damaged from the earthquakes in 2016. However, things are getting repaired, albeit at a snail’s pace. There’s still plenty of walks to go on and even where paths have been closed, there are sometimes other routes. Here are some photos from some of the walks…
Cascate dell’Acquasanta – just before this the several meters of path had fallen away due to the earthquake so the path is closed. I *may* have bypassed the fallen path.
This year I have been performing in the opera on the very big Sferisterio stage at an amphitheater in Macerata. The production was “The Magic Flute” directed by Graham Vick, an English director. It’s been quite a roller-coaster this opera experience, I must say. I’m still not sure what I think of it all!
It’s worth noting, that I don’t like opera. What other form of entertainment requires you to have subtitles to follow what’s going on and even then, half the time it’s still a mystery?! I’ve seen a handful of opera’s now and apart from one or two ‘arias’ in some of the well-known operas, as far as I can tell, there’s no discernible melody to hardly any of them. Contrast that with a good musical like Les Miserable where all the songs are immediately catchy, you can hear the words clearly and you don’t have to stop and ask your Opera-buddy what’s going on all the time… for me there’s no contest! Anyway, I do really appreciate the skill of the singers but all in all, opera is not my cup of tea. Having said all that, I go to the opera most years regardless because a) our local city, Macerata, hosts one of the biggest opera festivals in Europe every year b) I love dressing up and c) just to double check that I still don’t like it.
So what was I actually doing in the opera? My friend heard they were looking for extras and wanted to be in it and wanted me to do it with her. It’s rare I say no to something that seems like it could possibly be fun so I signed up. There were 80 or so extras and our mission was to do various things on stage to build on the storyline.
All in all, I’m glad I did it. Being up on the stage at the Sferisterio is something to behold and it’s not something I’ll forget in a hurry. I met some lovely people that have become friends and who I’d never have met otherwise. It was also great being part of such a big production. The director and his team are well-known in the world of opera and it was interesting to see how they work and see the opera develop. I really liked the production itself – it’s a shame I haven’t actually seen it myself but from the outskirts and behind the scenes it had all the components of a good show – funny, sexy, there were goodies, baddies, bombs, fireworks. As opera’s go, I think I might have enjoyed our one. It certainly got some attention, even in the English newspapers. It turns out our version of the Magic Flute is like marmite – you either love it or hate it.
However, it did have it’s challenging side! In total it was 150 hours of time over a period of 2 months, 45 hours in the car (half of which was down lonely windy roads well past midnight), £££’s petrol and meals out in-between breaks. I’ve driven 30,000 km since the beginning of May. My mechanic thought I was some sort of agent travelling across country for business. I missed out on every festa and almost every gathering of friends and family this year and I’ve been riddled with colds and bad backs which I think can probably be put down to the lack of sleep and lack of recovery time! Which leads me onto…
So on the bad back front, I had my first experience of Italian A&E last week. In January, I sneezed whilst carrying some wood and I hurt my back. It never got better; it just goes through phases of being bad and bearable but it never stopped me doing anything so I largely ignored it apart from moaning to friends and family. A month or two ago I went for a walk up our second highest mountain, Monte Priore and since then it got a lot worse. An x-ray confirmed it was arthritis and a reduced gap between some of my bones. I needed an MRI to get a diagnosis but before I could get one done, I woke up with agonising shooting pains down my leg and couldn’t get out of bed without collapsing in a screaming heap. In the end I was whisked to hospital in an ambulance. Anyway to cut a long story short, I probably have a herniated disc. I’m awaiting some MRI results. I’m not in any pain anymore but then again, I can’t really feel my leg much! Much to my frustration I walk like a very slow robot and teeter on slopes. I do very much hope to be back walking in the mountains soon.
On the plus side of all this, it’s been really heart-warming to see how many people care 🙂 Without my family here and an inability to move, things could have been a lot more challenging but all my friends have really rallied around to make sure I’m alright and have everything I need. If any of you are reading this, I can’t thank you enough!
I’ve not been doing anywhere near the amount of painting that I’d like to be doing! I had grand plans to produce a calendar, gift certificates, postcards etc. I exhibited some of my paintings earlier in the year at a festival in Sant’Angelo in Pontano and sold a few paintings to some friends recently so in that sense it’s been successful! I was hoping to do a workshop in conjunction with a lovely local B&B called Il Picchio Verde in Sant’Angelo in Pontano, however I think that might need to be next year now following a rather busy summer! I might have an opportunity to sell some paintings at the Montefalcone Sapori d’Autunno festival in October though so fingers crossed!
There’s not much other news to report. I’ve moved out of ‘home’ for a couple of weeks (nothing is happening on my home in terms of rebuilding work or an alternative flat which I was told would be available back in Spring!) or so whilst they’re doing some work so I’m staying nearer the coast. It’s another new area so new places to visit! I’m down to the Amalfi coast in a couple of days too for a week so I’ll report back on that soon. Meanwhile, I hope you are all well!
How is everyone? Well, I have a daunting amount of updating to do! It covers a bit before the Puglia trip at the beginning of the month and thereafter. I shall aim to keep it short and sweet (I realise I’m not particularly adept at that!). On a separate note, if you’ve signed up to these posts by email (thank you!), I’m told it’s worth clicking on the link to read on the website as the layout is better. Anyway, between doing a bit of teaching, I have been…
I spent a weekend with some good friends in their apartment in Senigallia at the end of June. The weather was amazingly hot and it was nice to have some time at the beach. We had an aperitivo at a lovely bar called Chalet Beach at Marina di Montemarciano and then finished up near the apartment in a great restaurant with candlelit tables on the beach. It was already busy back in June but later this week it’ll be even busier because they hold a Summer Jamboree – an international rock festival which I went to a couple of years ago and loved. We had some good sunsets whilst I was there, in particular one sunset that looked remarkably like the sky just before the aliens came down in the film ‘Independence Day’.
I also had a little photography excursion around the mountains near where I live with the friend who came to Puglia with me…
Then a few days later some other friends with their 17 month old came out to stay for the weekend. I was slightly nervous because I wasn’t sure how ‘toddler-safe’ the house is. My stairs to get to the second floor, for example, are really something to behold – I’m considering attaching a mountaineering fixed line for people to attach themselves to as they go up and down. Anyway, I’m pleased to say that despite my concerns, the 17 month old left intact and happy and I think the parents did too!
Then the a couple of days later I drove down to Lago di Bracciano with a friend. That was a bit of a long day – 9 hours of driving in one day. I think that’s about twice my personal record!
It was a good day though and it was nice to explore a new area. The lake has a swimming area and the sand is actually black (and really, REALLY hot!). It was a nice lake and I also visited Anguillara Sabazia, a little town jutting out into the lake which had a lovely ‘old town’ to wander around.
I organised a little watercolour painting excursion too at Lago di Fiastra which I think went really well although there were only 4 of us. I think we were the talk of the beach! Everyone kept coming up to have a look. I felt like it could have been a comedy sketch – us four reasonably professional looking painters and then my painting at least, looked like a 2yr old could have done it. I can only imagine what people were thinking! Anyway, I’ve definitely got the bug, I’m hoping to organise another excursion in a couple of weeks, though to be honest, I haven’t entirely worked out the advantage of painting “live” as opposed from a photo! Our tutor said the other day that we should be ready to start painting something that we might want to put on our wall. I think I have vaguely managed that, or at least, my friend from the class wants one of my paintings to put on his wall! I’ll put some photos up of some paintings on the next update.
I’ve heard good things about the Colmurano “Artistrada” Festival for months. Colmurano is a little town in Le Marche, about half an hour from my house. The festa is one that celebrates all kinds of art forms – whether that’s painting, portrait drawing, music or street performances. I have to say, it was one of my favourite events that I’ve been to in Italy so far. Colmurano itself is pretty to just have a wander around but the events were all really good too. I even bought a CD by a guy called Geordie Little, a percussion guitarist (have a look at his videos on the link if you don’t know what percussion guitar is).
Percussion Guitar is where you use all of the guitar – you might hit the sides to get effectively a drum beat and you might press the strings down on the neck like you’re playing a piano… it’s very interesting to watch!
Then we saw an excellent dance group who I unfortunately only saw through the phone of someone videoing it (thankfully, otherwise I wouldn’t have seen a thing as it was so busy!) and then a brilliant fire-dancing group called Pyrodanza. I took some photos and they are going to put them in their online photo gallery 🙂
I am always being told by the Italian’s how many English people there are in Le Marche and up until a week or two back, I’d met only about 5, which doesn’t seem to tie up with the high numbers I’d been told about. Anyway, I was invited to a party (I was the ‘plus one’) and there were dozens of us! DOZENS! When I moved out I was quite wary of not mixing only with ex-pats as that seems like it’s cheating a bit, but then that seemed an impossibility anyway because I couldn’t find any! However, it was great having a chat about other people’s experiences here, particularly with the language learning and I met a lot of like minded people so I’m pleased about that. The party itself, a celebration of a recent marriage, was fabulous too. We were even treated to a couple of celebrity singers!
I recently discovered a lovely group of people, part of the Macerata Language Exchange group, wanting to improve their English (and sometimes their Italian, as many of them come from all over the world!). We met for a special “Games / Chatting” night at Civitanova organised by a professional facilitator, Adriano. It worked out very well in fact as we were prompted to talk about things that probably wouldn’t come up in normal conversation – goals, life history, stories… Good for my Italian! And I can’t tell you how amazing the place was where we had the event, Casablanca – it was absolutely stunning, complete with swimming pool and restaurant. I’ll definitely be going back there again.
I also went on a fab trek a couple of weeks ago in the Sibillini Mountains with some new fellow ex-pat friends. It was a gorgeous day and we walked up along the ridge of the mountains. It was difficult walking – through long damp grass and on uneven slopes, but satisfying and definitely worth it when we got up to the ridge which had amazing views. Alas, I slipped onto a rock and still have quite a painful leg as a result! However, it made me think. I spend a good potion of my time in the mountains slipping down them. I had previously been blaming my general ineptness at maintaining any kind of balance but it suddenly occurred to me it might be my old, cheapish walking boots. It was also a revelation when I spoke to the others about the state of their feet / boots that apparently, it’s not normal to feel like you’re tottering on bloodied painful stumps towards the end of a walk. WHO KNEW?!?! So, I’ve invested in expensive new walking boots and walking sticks (sporty ones rather than the old people ones), and they’re amazing! I hardly slip at all now (touch wood, or touch iron as the Italian’s say!) and my feet are still entirely operational after a long walk. This weekend there’s a long trek with my walking group in Gran Sasso, an area of the highest of the Apennine mountains. I had worried about being able to keep up but after a local walk this Sunday, I got approval to go by our walking group president who said I was very “tosta” (tough)!
This is the lovely Milly – she must have gone 20 times further than everyone else that day, bounding between the members of the group!
There’s been a festival in Smerillo, another very pretty little hill-top town with amazing panoramas of the area. It’s a yearly event called “Le Parole della Montagna” (the words of the mountain) and had some good mountain focused films and talks organised. Last Friday I saw Kurt Diemberger, one of only two survivors from the K2 Disaster in 1986, who gave a talk about his climbing experiences which was interesting. Nice chap. A bit short with people perhaps but in an amusing way! I’ve since become obsessed with mountain disaster films. I will never feel daunted by a steep slope again.
This was one of those festa’s that was a bit of a let down. It started at 3pm apparently. Knowing that the Italian’s are somewhat of a ‘late’ nation, my friend and I went at 5pm and they were still only just setting up. We had been expecting lots of different stalls selling unusual flavoured ice-creams but there was nothing. So we got a couple of drinks and watched them set up. By the time we left at about 6.30 all there was, was a guy explaining how to make ice-cream. So we had ice-cream from a normal gelataria (ice-cream shop) and left. There was a good band on later apparently and I wanted to go to the “Silent Disco” they had planned but it would have been a bit of a wait around for several hours so we headed back to check out the nightlife in Sarnano instead…
I haven’t really explored Sarnano at night – in fact, I could count on one hand the number of times I’d stayed in town after 10pm. It was actually busy with people milling around. We stopped at a bar called Decantautore to watch a band called Souvenir D’Italia play old Italian hits. It was great! It was very amusing, particularly when the singer got out a sort of manual loud-speaker.
I’ve finally got health cover – the same as I would if I was an Italian citizen. I’ve so far been relying on being healthy and having no issues but I decided that approach was probably too optimistic long term. So I had to pay a very specific 387.34 euros in what was quite a faff going between “ASL” (the office where you get your Tessera) and the post office. I’ll still not believe I’ve actually managed to get one until I have it in my hand.
I finally took the plunge and got Batfink neutered this week. He looks so sore, I’m feeling horribly guilty. But it was for the best. I think his raging hormones are responsible for a couple of missing kittens 😦 Here he is in all his pre-neutered glory when he still loved me.
Spot the olive! I did have high hopes for those other little balls but they don’t appear to be getting any more olive-like. Nevermind. Three is plenty to be getting on with. Perhaps I’ll make oil.
Ok, that’s enough excitement for this blog post. Apologies it’s been so long but you can rest assured that I’m up to date now!
How is everyone? All good here. Various bits and pieces going on but I still feel like I’m missing a life plan! Anyway, updates below but I’ll start off with a bit of real estate…
I don’t know if the sweetcorn comes with it but I think it makes for a lovely rustic room divider/fly screen!
As you can see it’s a bit rustic and requires a bit of work but it would make a lovely home once renovated and it has an amazing view of Sarnano and the mountains. It’s in a peaceful, rural little area called Colleciccangelo just on the outskirts of Sarnano. There’s actually two buildings and an adjoining courtyard included in the price (40,000 euros, negotiable). There’s lots of potential and if anyone is interested, there’s even a proposed plan for the property. Great investment potential. For anyone wishing to see more photos and/or to test their Italian, have a look at the advert here!
In other news, SPRING IS HERE!!!!! It’s been lovely. I’m so pleased! I’ve been a bit more inspired to go out and take some photos too. I have attached proof of “Spring” below…
I’ve discovered a lovely little restaurant called Il Sigillo in Camporotondo with a newly discovered ex-pat too. It was a really nice little restaurant in a quaint little town and it was surprisingly empty. They do a vegetarian tasting menu so I’m hoping to try that one day. Interestingly, the word the Italian’s use for “tasting” in their menus is degustazione which to me, sounds too similar to disgust to make it an attractive option. In a similar way, I find it very difficult to buy a packet of arachidi which means peanuts, but sounds like you’re buying a bag of spiders. Still, I’m glad I’ve found a new restaurant to supplement my tried and tested “Scherzi a Parte” which all my guests get taken to at one time or another.
I’ve been cycling almost every day and at the weekend I cycled 16km! SIXTEEN! Which I know many of you will probably be thinking is absolutely nothing but it’s akin to a marathon for me! And it’s very hilly where I live. This whole exercise debacle means I’m permanently aching from head to toe but I think I’m getting better.
In other successful news, I also discovered that you can walk all the way around Lago di Fiastra (the biggest reservoir in Le Marche), a feat I’d previously thought was impossible because of lack of pathways. Despite going off the beaten track a couple of times, it’s not impossible by any means. The lake is beautiful. It’s crystal clear and I used to enjoy swimming in it up until earlier in the week when my friend told me that it’s dangerous, full of whirlpools and there are nameless things the size of dolphins in there. I have googled and I can’t find any evidence of these claims. Nevertheless, it seems less of an inviting prospect now!!! I did take some photos though.
I would just like to say how annoying I find power lines in this country. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the world, and they stick power lines everywhere.
Another highlight of the week was “Occhi negli occhi”, a piano and string quartet concert that was held in San Ginesio’s theatre (San Ginesio is one of the nearest towns to Sarnano where I live). The pianist and composer was Fabio Capponi. The music was brilliant, as were all of the musicians. Click here for one of the songs that I think was recorded whilst I was there. I was inspired enough to buy the CD and now I’m annoyed that I can’t find the sheet music anywhere to be able to play it myself! I’m hoping he’ll be famous soon so it will be downloadable. San Ginesio’s theatre was beautiful too – a lovely venue. As a “Sarnanese” (someone from Sarnano), I’m supposed to hate San Ginesio, a tradition going back to when all little towns in Italy seemed to be at war against all the other little towns, but I must say, their theatre definitely wins the “Dinky and cute and nicely decorated” award!
I hope you’re all well. I’m somewhat light on the photo front this week you might be pleased to know!
I had a flying visit to the UK last week. As usual it’s not ever quite enough time to get around everyone I’d like to but it was still lovely to see people. It wasn’t quite so persistently gloomy on the weather front either which was a nice change! In fact, when I left London it was gorgeous sunshine and when I arrived here it was raining… That never, ever happens! It’s always the opposite way around!
My cat Batfink (so named after the cartoon cat that had large ears… but he’s grown into his ears now and he’s a very handsome feline) seemed reasonably pleased to have me back. He’s hormonally active at the moment – I was told he was only supposed to have 3 weeks worth of err, hormones, but he seems to have fallen for his sister and they’re constantly hanging out together now. It would be quite cute if I wasn’t worried for the health of their future children. I was in charge of the neighbour’s dog today and we went for a walk up the road. Batfink came too, weaving in and out of my legs. I think I must look like a crazy cat lady to the locals.
I found an English language speaking group in Civitanova which I met up with on Friday. There was a good turnout with the majority being Italians wanting to practice their English and there was one other English girl. I’ll definitely go again, it’s just a shame it’s not a bit closer to Sarnano (it’s about a 50 minute drive).
Just before I left for the UK I bought a bike. It’s probably 20 years since I rode a bike (apart from one outing in Richmond Park). Anyway, let me tell you!!….. Buying a bike, when you live in the mountains and you live in a country known for the crazy drivers, is the silliest idea ever. I don’t know what possessed me. I have ridden up and down the road a few times on it which is absolutely exhausting and alas far less than a kilometer. Not to be defeated though, on Saturday I went to Abbadia di Fiastra, a lovely, large, flat (woohoo!) park and cycled for about 8km. It’s a great place to go to cycle because it’s all off-road so there’s no imminent danger of being hit by a car. However, I’m not used to cycling and by Saturday night, I felt like I’d been hit by a car anyway! Why do they make the seats so horribly uncomfortable?! I definitely bought the wrong bike – I want to be upright, with a basket on the front (and perhaps with a motor)! Still the deed is done so I better try and get a bit more in shape for it over the next few weeks.
On Saturday evening, I went to see my first play here in Italy. It was Madame Bovary at Civitanova Alta. I didn’t know quite what to expect. All the towns here have dinky little theatres. Having lived in London with the massive professional productions that often carry on for decades, I was expecting, well, less to be honest. However, it was anything but. It was very well performed, with excellent actors and a really creepy and original way of portraying Madame Bovary’s daughter. All-in-all, it was very impressive and I’m a bit sad that it was only being performed for one night, particularly after it must have taken months and months of hard work for them to prepare.
Sunday, rather than not get out of bed (everything ached!), I went for a walk around San Severino with a friend. San Severino is a lovely little town and it’s surrounded by hills (or rather mountains the size of Mount Everest for someone that is already aching everywhere). Walks in Italy are never straightforward. I had a book with me which described the walk, and we had downloaded a GPS map and there was also the occasional sign and yet still it wasn’t clear where we were supposed to be going! Still we made it back. The whole walk took about 5 hours. It was 19km with a climb of about 1km. As exhausting as it was, it was a really nice walk and it was good to see the Eremo di Sant’Eustachio, a monastery built in the 11th century that was partly carved out of the mountain. I felt a bit like Indiana Jones wandering around there. There’s also a lot of caves dotted around and the ruins of a mysterious round looking tower. On the whole, it was very interesting.
This was the inside. There’s more rooms underneath and to the side of the Eremo, a cave that looks as if something interesting used to go on inside!
I think I must have burned off a reasonable number of calories over the weekend but after the walk, we discovered a chocolate festival in San Severino so the diet all went to pot. Still, I can highly recommend you all try white chocolate ice-cream and chocolate orange ice-cream 🙂
In other exciting news, I’ve been invited along on another Blog Tour so I’m excited about that 🙂 More details to come as and when I get them but it’ll be in June. I’ve also got a few friends lined up to visit me later in the year which is going to be good.
And I’m famous! I’ve had an interview published on http://www.expatfinder.com – I wrote it probably over a year ago so it’s somewhat out of date but still, I’m famous! Click here for the interview.
How is everyone? I’ve had a string of visits! My parents, Pane Caldo’s parents and my brother and sister-in-law all came over from the UK. It’s been lovely to have people from home here and it seems a bit quiet now they’ve gone, though the next set of visitors are out in July so not too much time to feel lonely! It’s been really good to do something other than house related activities too and see some local sights that I’d not been to before. Firstly though…
A couple of weeks ago marked the 750th anniversary of Sarnano being an independent comune so the Sarnanese celebrated in style over the weekend. Alas, I missed a few of the celebrations but I’m pleased to say that I made it to see our local celebrity band, La Racchia. Along with more traditional instruments, their party trick is to play various household items like colanders, drainpipes and toilet cisterns. And what band would be complete without the customary colourfully dressed band leader with a dummy in his mouth wielding a wooden spoon?
In no particularly order, these are a few pics from the last two or three weeks of sightseeing around the area…
Penna: Beautiful hill top town just a few minutes away with a little park at the top and amazing views across Le Marche.
Castle in Visso – only the ruins remain but you can walk up to them for a good view. We went on a little round trip from the town. Mind the snakes!
There’s quite a few trout farms in the mountains it seems – at the base of this valley in Visso is one of them.
At Casteluccio there’s piano grande – a massive field of cultivated flowers. It’s not quite ready yet but the flowers should be out in the next month or so.
And this is taken from just by the main square where last weekend they were holding a ravioli festival!
This is a little cloister in San Ginesio. San Ginesio is definitely worth a visit – it’s known as the “Balcony of the Sibillini Mountains” and for a good reason. There’s a nice restaurant called Terra Nostra in the piazza which looks fairly small from the outside but is larger when you get inside, is nicely decorated and has nice food. And we got a free limoncello so that’s always a bonus.
I think the visits all pretty much went without a hitch apart from the last night with my brother and sister-in-law. When we first moved here myself and Pane Caldo tried a restaurant that was recommended to us by our old landlord. It’s called Scherzi a Parte. It’s brilliant – lovely food, great location, fab service. As a result, we’ve been going there ever since and taking all our visitors there. With any visitors that come back, they’ve been keen to go back to the same restaurant. But there are OTHER restaurants!!! What if we’ve all been missing an even better restaurant?!?!?! So, I thought I’d take the opportunity to go somewhere new with my brother and sister-in-law, a place recommended to me on a couple of occasions. It was a terrible mistake!!! The decor was like something straight out of the 1970’s. The pasta was dry and hard – not even al dente but like it was made the day before and heated up. Terrified of offending anyone we tried our best to eat our meals but the pasta didn’t diminish, only multiplied before our very eyes. We’d still got a large selection of anti-pasta to work our way through too. As typical English folk, it’s just inconceivable for an entire table to order starters and main courses and leave almost everything. Oh the embarrassment, the shame…….until I remembered I had two plastic bags in my handbag. Our moods shifted as we stuffed the bulk of our food into the bags. My sister-in-law refused to lower herself to that but she’d done a better job of eating her food than we had so fair enough. I did feel slightly guilty when the waitress came over later and chastised her for leaving more food than we had! Anyway. Scherzi a Parte next time it is.
It’s been a while since Animal Watch and goodness me, there’s been some unwelcome ones! My bedroom, bathroom and terrace have been somewhat overrun with ants. I’ve had to become a specialist in ant elimination which is really not something that I’m proud of being an animal-loving vegetarian! Anyway, I seem to have resolved the issue (bicarbonate of soda and sugar seems to do the trick. Poor ants).
The next intriguing development has been fireflies – I’ve never seen fireflies before but they’ve suddenly appeared at night. Apparently it marks the start of summer so that’s good! I managed to catch one in a jar for a closer look but it promptly stopped lighting up as if in protest. It was released shortly thereafter. They only live a day or so anyway poor things.
My favourite animal update though are the kittens. I’ve been trying not to get attached because last year’s litter all died apart from my Batfink. However, they’re all doing really well, although three of the five are still really tiny. Those ones belong to Batfink’s mum so I’m sort of encouraged that at least he did quite well! (The other two have a different Mum). I’ll put in a photo next time!
I think that about sums up the last few weeks. I’ve been doing a bit of DIY as usual but I’ll update on that in the next post.

After reading the article shown above (during my lunch hour), I find it readily apparent that the issues affecting education are much broader and far-reaching than the current situation we are facing in Oklahoma. (I'm sure this is not a surprise to anyone). This article does an excellent job to highlight the myriad issues facing educators today. Even when we have an educator (Arne Duncan) running the show from the Top, it seems that the situation continues to get worse.
So what are educators and education advocates to do? How do we change the system? What recourse do classroom teachers have? How can administrators encourage teachers to stay and keep up the good fight?
I certainly don't have the answers, but I want to send a note of encouragement to my educator friends:
Often attributed to Albert Einstein, others credit noted psychologist William Bruce Cameron with the following quote:
As I read this article, I see a strong case against what our legislators here in Oklahoma are doing to education. If you look beyond the rhetoric and look into these issues on your own, you may find that there is some truth to what this article is trying to say.
Our Oklahoma legislators are being led in the crusade by Sen. Clark Jolley (he's introduced more bills than any other sponsor in the Oklahoma legislature), Rep. Jason Nelson, & Rep. Jeffrey Hickman who are trying their best to change the face of education in OK. From where I sit, that new face of education looks like a system which can hire teachers with no certification, with no limit on how little teachers are paid, and containing no requirement on paying into teachers retirement. How does that draw highly-qualified teachers to (stay in) our state? How does education de-regulation benefit our students? This sounds a lot like a charter school. These are the same exact "benefits" which apply to charter schools.
The real question here is "Why are our legislators NOT considering what is best for students?" While I can't answer that, I do know that something must be done. It seems to me that the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove the factor(s) causing that problem. So we need some new leadership (this also applies to our national legislators. (**Don't even get me started the US Congress! The fact that the vast majority of senators and representatives have been able to make a career out of doing their job so ineffectively it borders on criminal, is absolutely baffling to me.)
I hope that all of you will look into your candidates and consider their position on education. This is the single most important factor facing our state (and country) today. Without an education, voters are unable to critically think about how his/her vote affects who is elected and how who is elected affects him/her (the voter). Without an understanding of how one's vote affects society, why even vote? A lack of education leads to voter apathy and voter apathy leads to a lack of education, at least at least it seems to here in Oklahoma.
The fact that many educators in Oklahoma have decided to run for office has been widely reported. Teachers in Oklahoma are tired of negligence on the part of our legislators to properly equip educators to do their job and are taking steps to make a change. It is absolutely ludicrous to think that some people run unopposed in elections. That makes my case for an apathetic electorate even stronger!
Teachers, remind your high school juniors and seniors that they need to register to vote. Encourage them to look for resources containing candidates' information. Connect the kind of analysis you do in class to real life by applying it to issues. Give them a means to affect change AND practice the skills you teach in class. I know their children will thank you.
Imagine what could happen if everyone who has ever said, "Meh, my vote doesn't matter. I'm just one person; I'm just one vote!" took that civil responsibility seriously? People died for the right to vote; yet here we sit preferring to [insert ridiculous, mindless action verb here] rather than exercising our rights.
"Nobody will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves and the only way they could do this is by not voting." - FDR
The man has no concrete plans for anything. It is the absolute MOST empty rhetoric that has ever existed (how's that for hyperbole?). Make America great. Knock out ISIS. We are gonna win. I can fix (insert every broken piece of government) here. Do you even SPECIFIC bro?
I suspect that my normal silence in the area of national politics may cause some of my friends some surprise at this rant. It was a comment to a discussion on FB and I started and couldn't stop myself. Sometimes things clear up and I've gotta get a few things written down. This was one of those times. All of the time periods listed are from memory, so please be gentle if I am off by a decade or three.
I think Trump is great. Yep. He's great. Great at being vague and talking, while not really saying anything at all.
I will agree that change begins with Congress. I find that very few career politicians, who talk about a "restoration" of the (insert constitutional republic component here) is pretty much the opposite of what the slave-owning, bigoted, adulterer "Christians" aka the founding fathers had in mind when they wrote the constitution and began what we they, and every generation since, have failed at creating - a constitutional republic. Rather, we have an oligarchy, run by the people with the most money. NOT the ones who can do the best job or even the once who say the can do the best job. Congress should be servant-leaders. They are not. Our system is broken and the only way to fix it is to do the one thing Oklahoma has done right: TERM LIMITS.
But back to the issue at hand: Trump is great at bringing a group of people together. He is full of a lot of language which makes people more afraid of the "others" whom they already think are "the problem". He's good at playing one side against another. Playing one class against another. Playing one viewpoint against another. Pandering to the extreme right who think he will Make America Great Again! The real question though is this: Just how far back does he want to take us in history? Pre-civil rights? Pre-civil war? Post-civil war aka anti-immigration? The 10s and 20s when we hated the Hun? The 40s when we hated the Japanese and the Germans? Any time in history when we hated the Jews? Between the World Wars when we hated Mexico? (Wait, isn't that now??)
I'm sensing a pattern here. A pattern of fear and hate. It's the same song every politician has been singing at one time or another post-9/11 (when we just hate anyone with brown-skin, no matter their religious views). There's a HUGE difference between Patriotism and Nationalism and I'm afraid too many in politics are pressing for the wrong one.
Our legislature in Oklahoma is considering eliminating the EOI Tests. To be clear, this would not get rid of ALL tests, just the end-of-instruction exams (EOI). Currently, there is SO MUCH legislation, i.e. Big Government, that teachers are not allowed to be professionals. By that I mean the government is telling teachers (like me) that the 4 years of educator preparation we did in college, does not qualify us to assess whether or not our students have learned the standards adequately. What if I have a master’s degree in curriculum and instruction? Nope. “We still don’t trust you to judge whether or not your students learned what they should in your class.” Okay. How about a doctorate? Nope. We, as legislators (NOT EDUCATORS) feel as though our system will be a better judge of your students’ learning. High-stakes testing is simply another way for the government to dictate what I can and can’t do (as a teacher). It always makes me laugh when the very people who are against big government are the same ones who want to legislate students and teachers to death with unfunded mandates for any number of issues in education.
Additionally, these tests effectively cease all instruction in Oklahoma schools by the first week of April. So we are using the last 8 weeks of school just for testing. While this may sound absurd (it is) and incomprehensible, when you have half of your class pulled out for 3 days in a row to test on an EOI for one subject (remember there are 7 of these exams for each student) and then they need to use your computers to administer those tests during the next week, and then the other half of your class is pulled out the following week, you have lost 3 weeks of instruction and that only accounts for 2 tests out of 7. Fortunately, I was able to work around that because I taught a non-testable subject, but the strategies I employed to continue instruction would not work for everyone, so what ends up happening is no instruction.
If we are testing for about 8 weeks, out of 180 instructional days in the school year, we are taking 40 of them (5 days x 8 weeks) - which accounts for almost 25 PERCENT of all the instructional days we have - to administer high stakes tests.
In Oklahoma, the mandate is that students must pass 4 of the 7 EOI tests to get a diploma, meaning if they only pass 3 tests, instead of a diploma, those students get a certificate of completion. This dooms that student to a minimum wage job. To be able to live and pay your bills in Oklahoma City, you must make approximately $13.00/hr. So these students will be making about ½ of what they need to make to just to live minimally. Where is that other ½, needed to augment their earned wage, going to come from? It comes from government assistance, e.g. food stamps, welfare, etc. If our education system fails these students - students who may already be predisposed to failure in education because of the low socio-economic level they have grown up in - what then is the choice for them to make a living? Get that minimum wage job and take government assistance, thereby placing their children in the same cycle of poverty? It is possible that could be the only option they have.
