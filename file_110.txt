This invention pertains to bullet proof clothing that has graphical user interface circuitry in it, that allows it to control other systems, such as the Retina Heads Up Display System, the Artificial Telepathy System, nearby weapon systems, vehicle navigation, aircraft navigation, and other similar military and law enforcement systems. The technology would work by using a display system that is seen through the fabric from the inside, however there would be an additional layer of protection in-between the circuitry and the body.
This type of see-through Kevlar would use carbon chains stitched together on a nanometer scale, to allow the maximum amount of security, that allows an interior layer of clothing to see through, or optical circuitry to blend in the soldier or police officer with the background by bending the light around the user’s body with fiber-optics. The material can be magnetically charged, which will repel bullets before they impact the material.
This fabric can be used with a Heads-Up Display helmet that allows 360-degree vision, and services like the ability to create wireframes that can see through buildings, including the persons moving inside the buildings, the ability to track bullet trajectories, the ability to hear inside buildings with directional parabolic microphones, the ability to connect to all surrounding WiFi and other types of wireless networks and devices and display content, the ability to re-create crime scenes digitally, and the ability to re-create crime incidents digitally.
This system is ideal for combat or policing in metropolitan areas, while it also has applications in virtually all environments, including a version that can act as a space suit. The system runs with an Artificial Intelligence system that handles all of the computations.
This invention pertains to a vest or jacket, or both, that have Pelletier cooling elements that can either make the interior cool, or make the interior hot, by separating the differences of the hot and cold elements through Pelletier cooling technology.

The Austrian Architektur Fachmagazin have featured our Pharmacy on its newest issue May/Jun 2017 together with some fine international projects.
Very few American priests have been as famous or have had as much influence on the Catholic church in the 20th century as Father Leonard Feeney, (S.J.) M.I.C.M. The doctrinal firestorm that arose when he accused Archbishop Cushing of Boston of protecting and defending certain priests and teachers at Boston College who were openly denying the thrice-defined dogma that “there is no salvation outside of the Catholic church” was front page news in 1949 and is still a burning issue today seventy years later. Three years after the Boston Heresy Case burst upon the post World War world, Father’s Bread of Life was first published, and it has remained continuously in print since then.
This is the only edition since the first to appear with anything but the original text. Three articles written by loyal and ardent disciples of Father Feeney are included in order to clarify certain questions that have arisen since the original publication in 1952.
As the modern world continues to find itself largely lost and bewildered 100 years after Our Lady appeared at Fatima and 78 years into the atomic age, the challenge of the everlasting message of the Catholic Faith is more relevant than ever. “Oh beauty ever ancient and ever new” was the cry of Saint Augustine 1600 years ago, and this is still the same joyful utterance made by Saint Benedict Center and the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to an unbelieving world.
Leonard Feeney was born in 1897 in Lynn, Massachusetts. In 1917, he entered the Jesuit order. His theological studies were completed at the Jesuit Woodstock College in Maryland. After a few years teaching high school, he undertook more studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1927 he was sent to the Jesuits’ House of Studies in Weston, Mass., where he was ordained the following year. Before then, at Weston, his first collection of verse, In Towns and Little Towns, was published. He did three years of post graduate work at Oxford. Returning to America in 1931, he was assigned to teach at Boston College.
Here began a virtually uninterrupted profusion of literary works, poems and essays. He was named literary editor of the Jesuit Magazine America in 1936, given an office in Manhattan, employed as a preacher and retreat master, and commenced a rewarding apostolate among the blue-collar workers of the big city. He also found time to evangelize millions Sunday nights on the CBS radio’s
Catholic Hour. In 1940, he returned to New England to teach theology at Weston’s House of Studies. Two years later he was introduced to Saint Benedict Center in Cambridge and was appointed by his superiors to be its spiritual director. Bread of Life was published in 1952.
After his dismissal from the Jesuit Order until his death, he was the founder and spiritual director of the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, a religious order, comprised of men’s and women’s branches, dedicated to working for the Conversion of America. Father Feeney died and was buried on the Slaves of he Immaculate Heart of Mary property in Still River, Massachusetts, in 1978.

"We need a car mom!" I often hear this from my kids but I don't see why we need one. Vienna has the most efficient transportation from buses, to trams to trains for local and regional use and even European rails. I have always been comfortable going about the city with the Wiener Linien. I always get to where I should by simply looking at the map provided at the stops, the help offices are very willing to help too.
Whenever we passed by the used cars dealers near our place, the kids would, as if on cue, point one and tell me "Look ma, it's just 4000euros, it's not much!" True, there are cheap Volkswagen used car that one can have for as low as 4000euros or a Ford for 9,800 eurso, but the maintenance and the insurance you'd pay, the changing of tires and all the headaches included makes me forget the idea of owning a car without batting an eyelash. Then Drivetime has launched the DriveCare program warranty for used cars. Including a 3 year 36,000 mile warranty on used cars, a first in the industry indeed!
The warranty package is available on all vehicles purchased on or after December 1, 2009. A warranty for 36-months/36,000-miles on major mechanical and other electrical components. In addition to this they are also giving complimentary oil changes, roadside assistance and more.
With such, I think not only me would be having second thoughts but those who are wanting to buy a used car as well. I have, however, already forgotten how to drive, so I think it's up to the hubby to decide on this. ;)
I have always planned a renovation of my mom's house. I wanted a new and bigger kitchen complete with a stove and baking range. :D I've been scouting on some contractors and I was lead to the house plans and more website. I did not only learn of the many house plan designs available in many styles, I got much better ideas of what would fit my mom's one story house.
The website further have other projects in detail like cabin plans, deck and gazebos, fences, children's playhouses as well as indoor projects like furniture and storage units.
I am impressed how detailed the website is with all the house floor plans, I mean I enjoy playing Simcity because I get to design my own place, but housefloorplans do it for real!
Check out this kitchen layout from their blog and be inspired! I just couldn't resist sending my mom this photo I got from the HousePlansandMore.com website.p
My tummy? I wish! I'm one of those who had problems with the tummy. I have many times been enticed by those ads: how to reduce stomach fat. So I just decided to join a belly dancing class! Yesterday was my first and I was glad that we were only 5 in class, it means I do not have to worry embarassing myself in front of a lot of people. :D I did enjoy that hour though the half hour was lost because I wasn't told where the class would be held. The teacher has been teaching for more than ten years so one would see the difference how she does it compared to us but hopefully we'd get better and maybe, just maybe I'd be able to wear something like this too! (seriously...)
I said I'd be coming back to Yili, the prim resto that I visited awhile back that offers soups, wraps, salads and crepes. I went back yesterday along with the little boy. I asked him what he wants to eat and he said he would like the ice cream crepe (the photo probably enticed him). So I ordered one and a bed of salad in balsamic vinegar with coconut shrimps (more like ebi tempura, lol). I also got him a kiddie box with orange juice, chicken and wedges (toys and candies included). I took off a bit to get him a spoon but when I came back he already had a shrimp on his hand...I settled for the salad and we shared the platter of sweet treat...though I had the bigger share haha, talk about ruining a diet.
One time I picked up the little boy from the daycare center, his playmate came to me and said hello. He's a cute little boy with blue round eyes...just when my son started in the day care, he was just a baby. Time really flies fast, I said and the caregiver, the boy's mom are in agreement with that. The mom said how fast was is that her son is so tall now, upon hearing this my little boy said, we all grow, even us parents. The caregiver jokingly said yes, we grew bigger and wider not taller! True, we're not getting any younger nor thinner, this is really depressing it makes me want to believe that there are really diet pills out there that can help me shed off some pounds. Sadly, they turn out to be fads most of the time. I heard maybe you've heard about lipozene, fenterdren or the ever famous bangkok pills but I haven't heard of one that is a surefire way to help ypu reduce weight...*sigh*
Have you been thinking about giving a new look to your old, conventional kitchen? If you want to replace it with a sleek and modern modular kitchen, then you are definitely on the right path. Modular kitchens are not only beautiful, but also very convenient and highly functional. Another great thing about modular kitchen is that you don't really need a huge space. With creativity, you can setup a beautiful modular kitchen in a small space. In fact, that's what modular kitchen is all about. Its 'modular' style enables you to make the most of the kitchen space so you can store as many things necessary in there.
If you want to turn your old kitchen into a modular one, you can start by searching for modular kitchen designs on the Internet. You should be able to find a lot of great designs for your recommendation. But it doesn't mean that you could just copy-paste the design you like, because every kitchen is unique, depending on the space you have, your cooking habits, overall design of your house, and many other factors.
However, there are a few basic things you need to take into consideration if you want to create a perfect modular kitchen for your home, as follow:
When you search for modular kitchen designs for your recommendation, you will find that modular kitchens are available in thousands of different colors and patterns. It might be confusing to choose the one that's best to apply in your kitchen, especially if you haven't had any design plan in your head. Some popular colors for modular kitchens include sunny yellow, lime green, bright red, fiery orange and cobalt blue. There are also many modular kitchens designed with elegant shades, like deep grey, earthy brown or steely white.
There are a lot of different materials to choose from when designing your modular kitchen, whether it's for the countertop, cabinets, floors, accessories, or other parts. But most importantly you should make sure that the materials you choose are durable, can withstand heat from fire or hot oil splashes, scratches from sharp objects and also easy to clean.
How active are you in the kitchen? What is the size of your family? How often do you shop for groceries? How tall are you? These are important questions that you should answer before you start remodeling your kitchen. Actually there are many more questions to ask, but basically those are the questions that will finally help you personalized the new kitchen based on your needs.
When it comes to modular kitchen designs, there are two main elements that you should pay more attention to. These elements are what differentiate modular kitchens from regular kitchens; they are the counter top and cabinets. If you execute these elements perfectly, then your modular kitchen will not only look great but also will function well.
Every fully functioning kitchen should have sufficient amount of kitchen appliances and cookware, but unfortunately these important accessories often make the kitchen looks messy. The solution is to create enough cabinets to store everything inside. This will make your kitchen looks neat without clutter and spacious.
Big appliances like dishwasher, oven, refrigerator and other appliances should be placed carefully in a way that they don't ruin the layout of the modular kitchen. A chimney should be placed on top of the gas oven and it should fit perfectly to the whole design of the kitchen. Another important appliance is the kitchen sink. Usually the best option is either stainless steel or porcelain, just make sure you choose high quality material.

I decided to spend some time at lunch today thinking about the things I thought about a conference this past weekend at which I was with the 'cream of the crop' of educators here in Oklahoma. It was a valuable conference and worth every penny spent on attendance. The conference was a Google Apps for Education Summit (#gafesummit)
I was privileged to attend the pre-summit which began the process of preparing me to become a certified Google Education Trainer. This was some very valuable training and helped to further conceptualize how you can integrate SO many different apps/programs/sites with GAFE.
I think initially when I thought about attending the pre-summit, I thought it would be good for some 'on-the-side' consulting work as more and more districts/schools will be moving to GAFE in the coming years. However, after attending, I realize that I have more than I can handle to get my own faculty ready to meet the coming challenges of the Digital Education Environment.
I learned some new things, such as croak.it and some more innovative uses of socrative.com. The pre-summit was a great time of thinking about the challenges we face in education with our students and how to overcome those challenges.
If you aren't a teacher, you may not know the wide variety of access many of our students (don't) have. Some students have some access at home (desktop, wireless internet, etc.), some have smartphone access only, some have both, while there are some students who have no access to the interwebs at all. One of the primary questions I have (as a teacher) is: "How do I get each of my students equal access?" (at least while they are in my classroom) As an instructional designer, that question changes slightly. Rather, how do I get my faculty to (1.) allow their students to have on-demand access? (2.) How do I help those faculty create a culture of trust for technology use in their classrooms, especially when we aren't modeling that culture of trust? (3.) What are the pre-requisite issues I need to solve/change with my faculty in order to empower them to innovate in their classrooms? In other words, just because I am not married to ANYTHING I do in the classroom, my faculty may not be quite so willing, so how do I sell innovative practice to them?
Often, when I attend conferences, I may not learn a ton of new things (beyond the new webapp or add-on for browsers), but I am pushed into thinking about my faculty and how we can move their student engagement up a notch, how to deepen their understanding of difficult concepts (through on-demand remediation) and/or how to push their students to be learners who (1) enjoy learning (2) are motivated to learn (3) and are able to see the relevancy of what they are learning. This conference really did that for me.
I had an opportunity to meet some great folks and expand my PLN, both here in Oklahoma and throughout the US. I heard some great keynotes by Holly Clark, Mark Hammons, and Lise Galuga. We thought about the adjacent possible, moved toward future-ready, and decided that an elephant is best eaten one bite at a time. Overall, the weekend was a total success.
Thanks @edtechteam for a great learning experience, thanks @bmchs1 for hosting, and thanks to @BekahHightower for your hard work in coordinating the entire thing.
One more thing, I did present a couple of sessions, but my favorite was the new presentation I did about the great work we are doing here at Canadian Valley Technology Center using Google Scripts. I had a full session so I broadcasted/recorded on YouTube so others could attend virtually.
I've been at a conference for the last couple of days and had an opportunity to share some of the great things we are doing at Canadian Valley Technology Center, specifically in using scripts to create calendar events (like a bus request), automated progress reports, professional development transcripts, and teacher evaluations (coming soon).
The first script I ever used was one which would send the results of a form to someone other than the person submitting it. I found it online, changed the email address, and made it work. That looks pretty simple now, but it started me on a journey which has led me to my current place in learning programming.
We have started using scripts (which are bound to Google spreadsheets, calendar, forms, etc.) to take the results of a form (set up as a way for instructors to enter their professional development for the semester), create a copy of a template, replace all information in <<>> with information from the form, move it into a shared folder (one shared with the teacher's supervisor), share the document with the teacher (view rights only), and email a link to the document to the teacher.
This was the first project we used to integrate the automation power of Google Scripts. We have since created an automated transportation request (auto-creates) an event on the bus/van/etc. calendar. We have also moved to a Google Sheets gradebook (from an Excel template), with automated progress reports.
We are on about the 4th iteration of each of these as it has been a somewhat large learning curve for someone like me who had zero programming experience. I have done about 1/2 of the codecademy.com Javascript course which has enabled me to begin to conceptually understand Scripts within Google.
Like every other kind of technology I have ever used in the classroom, yes, it takes a lot of time. However, all of the time you invest on the front side (development) you will get back probably two-fold on the backside. Time spent doing paperwork is reduced to nearly nothing. I remember the first school I worked at had a person who taught part time and the other part of her job was tracking professional development. This first script would have eliminated that entire part of her job. Not that I am in favor of people losing their jobs, but maybe that person could focus more on instruction? Or remediation?
If you are a Google District and you have someone who is willing to learn or already knows Javascript, I would highly recommend giving someone the autonomy to begin integrating something like this. There are scripts already written which people will/can share (I'm glad to share any I have done) and if you need help, some great resources are the Scripts documentation and stackoverflow.com. I do a lot of searching for help.
If you would like to connect more about this topic, I'm happy to do so. You can connect through about.me/jbowie. If I can help you with anything, please let me know!
I registered for a Google Summit, which is happening in February, here in Oklahoma City. These events are held world-wide and one is coming to Oklahoma City??
Additionally, I submitted two different presentations. Here is the information for the first one and the second one. I have given the "Google Apps will Change Your Life" on many previous occasions, so I have many resources for that one. However, the "Use Google Scripts without being a Coding Expert" will be more of a challenge. I have only been using the program for about six months and am fairly new to programming. I will definitely learn something while I get ready for it, though. I usually do.
I will have to gather a significant number of resources for programming, such as stackoverflow.com, codecademy.com, and w3schools.com. I use those resources a lot when I am working on Javascript and they have helped me tremendously in the last several months.
I will also get to attend a bootcamp specifically for trainers of Google Apps. Here's what the website says about it:
Google Educator Trainer (GET) Train the Trainer (T3) Bootcamp serves two purposes: to raise awareness about how Google tools can be used in education to; ignite inquiry, promote collaboration, and allow for authentic publishing and sharing, (with students and among colleagues), and to prepare participants to pass the Google Educator Test and submit their certification application.
Become a Google Educator to be recognized for your mastery. Each session includes an interactive overview, top tips from the Google Educator Training Center, hands-on activities, and inspiring ideas for how to use Google for teaching, learning, and professional collaboration. The activities are flexible, designed to help new users quickly understand the "core magic" of each app - and to challenge veteran users by revealing features and innovative uses they never imagined. The experience is grounded in Google culture, complete with high-energy fast-paced demonstrations and challenging activities that can truly be called "hard fun." There is no better preparation for teaching and learning with Google Apps - or for passing the Google Educator tests.
So if you are reading this and need a trainer to consult with your district about integrating Google Apps for Education, consider contacting me and letting me work with you!
You are at:Home»News»When Drones attack! (or more likely, when people attack themselves though stupidity)
(Warning: This post contains graphic images that show blood and fresh wounds and my be disturbing to some people.)
The most dangerous part of any UAV is the operator or programmer. Failure to pay attention, or double-check your surroundings, or your power systems, or your control system, can have catastrophic results for you the operator or for innocent bystanders.
But to be sure, the person most likely to be injured by a UAV is you the operator. Fingers are cut or lost, arms and faces slashed all due to negligence on the part of the person most likely to get close to the craft while it is powered, once again you the operator.
By following these 2 rules the worst thing that can happen is a shock due to faulty wires (surprising but not likely to scar you.) Or if you have long hair, it could get caught in a motor. And that’s it! Problem solved,
If you follow the rules above, in order, you will avoid almost 80% of injuries that happen in the remote-controlled aircraft hobbies.
(Warning: The images below will show in detail the injury that i suffered from spinning 9″ props. These images show blood and fresh wounds and my be disturbing to some people. Viewer discretion is advised.)
I was finishing up with a new UAV project in my kitchen one night and was showing it to my wife. (Yep, I had an audience for this one…) After showing her some of the cool remote-controlled features of the craft i realized that the motors were armed and thought “Hey, I’m done showing off the crafts remote features, i will just turn off the controller so i don’t accidentally bump the throttle!” Genius move, forgot about the “fail safe”.
I have had crashes in the past due to a loss of signal so in an effort to avoid having craft fall from the sky like a brick, I set a “fail safe” in my receiver. This fail safe protocol meant that upon a loss of signal from my transmitter, my craft would pop the throttle to medium and go into a slow turn to allow me to regain control before it hit the dirt.
The instant my transmitter turned off the craft sprung to life. Before I even knew what happened I had about 10 very closely spaced cuts in my arm and one very deep gash. The angle of the prop had the craft digging trenches up my arm and towards my body. What saved me was the fact that as this project was incomplete. I had not yet built a holder for the battery and therefore was holding the pack in my hand. Had I not been holding the battery, my craft would have kept going and reached my upper arm, face, and neck within fractions of a second.
once the craft reached the end of the battery wires it pulled loose of the plug and fell to the ground silent just as fast as it sprang to life. I looked down and saw that I had a gash in my arm deep enough to see my tendons, fat and open blood vessels. This was bad. I was in shock and my wife, who was watching the whole show was frozen in fear. My first reactions were pressure, elevate, lay down, so I did not pass out. a neighbor was called and a trip to the emergency room ensued.
I got the bleeding stopped and the emergency room doctor put me back together again as best he could. I have no feeling around the cut due to nerve damage in the tissue but the scar looks bad ass. (I have to create a better story for how it happened, I’m thinking “Shark attack”)
You can see that the blade hit the bone keeping the cuts small until it got passed my bone and made a nice deep cut.
In the end, all of this could have been avoided if I followed the 2 rules above. None of what I was doing needed a prop on the craft. This was just me, in a hurry, not paying attention.
Be smart, take your time and NEVER arm you craft with props on while you are working on them. It takes just a few minutes to remove your props and can be the difference between a fun time working on your hobby and a long day/night at the hospital or worse.

Jose’s teaching is based on strong technique and he makes the learning process enjoyable with his great sense of humor. His goal is to share his passion for Latin music and dance with the local community. While learning the steps and rhythms of salsa, students also build a strong self-esteem and learn individuality and how to treat others with respect. Jose says, “They will not only learn how to dance, but will learn how to socialize, communicate with others and become a confident adult. No matter where they are from, even if they don’t speak the same language, they make friends all around the world when they dance salsa.”
Jose offers Latin dance and rhythm instruction. Students learn the basic steps and rhythms for styles including salsa, merengue, cha cha cha, bachata, cumbia, and Cuban salsa. In the process, students also learn interpersonal skills and learn about Latin cultures.

Boycotting something because there are people there who you disagree with sounds pretty snowflake-like to me. Reminds me of safe spaces at colleges which are meant to shield students from being offended. It’s indicative of extreme cognitive and emotional fragility.

You should begin to get comfortable working in such situations. To get a good understanding of an abstract piece of mathematics, start by looking at an example using concrete numbers, as in Example 5, before going on to a more abstract setting, as in Example 6. Suppose b is a real number and h > 0. (a) Write the inequality |x − b| < h without using an absolute value. (b) Write the set {x : |x − b| < h} as an interval. solution (a) The absolute value of a number is less than h precisely when the number is between −h and h.
To see why transitivity holds, suppose a < b and b < c. Then a is left of b on the real line and b is left of c. This implies that a is left of c, which means that a < c; see the figure below. a b For example, from the inequalities √ 15 < 4 and 4 < 21 5 we can conclude that √ 15 < 21 . 5 c Transitivity: a < b and b < c implies that a < c. Often multiple inequalities are written together as a single string of inequalities. Thus a < b < c means the same thing as a < b and b < c. Our next result shows that we can add inequalities.

You will get regular updates about Machetes gigs, events and releases. You will also get a chance to win merch, tickets to gigs, and other special features.
Machetes formed as if by fate, fueled by the common craving for excitement and creativity. A whirlwind of coincidences drew each member together, dragging them from their respective spaces in the wide music landscape of Toronto. The beginnings proved to be quite proliferating, as the girls’ unique and diverse musical backgrounds clashed and converged, creating a mosaic of sound and imagery that injects passion and drive back into the limp, sterile body of rock and roll.
The integrity and glamour of Machetes comes out in both the music and their show- it’s the love child conceived by a massive orgy of music that includes Siouxsie Sioux, Love and Rockets, Iggy Pop and Black Sabbath- and that’s just for starters. Influences range from art-rock to brit-pop, punk/post-punk to glam, each member contributing equally to the overall look and sound. Playing weekly to overcrowded underground clubs and attracting a diverse crowd of dedicated followers, their shows are a delicate blend of mayhem, beauty and aggression driven by powerfully delivered songs.
To date, Machetes have shared bills with Woodhands (sold out, debut show at the Wrongbar, Toronto), Born Ruffians, dd/mm/yyyy and Semi-Precious Weapons, while releasing their first E.P, 'Too Dirty To Be a Rat", on Jan. 7. 2009, produced and recorded by Rob Sanzo (Signal to Noise Studios, Lioness, Controller.Controller, and more...)
Machetes are managed by Roger O'Donnell (the Cure, more..) -- Ten 55 Artist Management --- http://www.99songsoutof10.com/tenfiftyfive.html .
Their first E.P, Too Dirty to be a Rat, is planned for official release Jan. 7. 2009, produced and recorded by Rob Sanzo (Signal-to-Noise Studios).

Croatia manager Zlatko Dalic was not happy after France were awarded a critical penalty in the first half of the World Cup Final.
With the game tied at one late in the first half, Argentine referee Nestor Pitana used VAR to award a controversial handball penalty against Croatia. Pitana judged that Croatia’s Ivan Perisic intentionally handled the ball in the box, awarding the penalty that ultimately made it 2-1 to France.
1000% a penalty. If France were England, and Kane was in behind him, I think a lot of people would have a different opinion. #Volleyball pic.twitter.com/Bc5WLpzhzK
After the match, Dalic gave credit to France, but made clear that he felt the penalty award was ridiculous.
#cro coach Zlatko Dalic to @ben_rumsby on penalty given by VAR: "I never comment on refereeing but let me say one sentence: in a World Cup Final you do not give that kind of penalty. But it in no way diminishes #fra's win."
VAR has definitely had an impact on the World Cup. Many would argue that, rightly or wrongly, it had a huge impact on the outcome of this match as well.
FOX’s World Cup coverage ended somewhat awkwardly, with what should have been an iconic shot of France lifting the trophy going somewhat awry.
After French captain Hugo Lloris was handed the trophy, FOX cut to a wide shot to capture the entire group of players celebrating their 4-2 victory over Croatia. There was just one problem: almost immediately after cutting to the shot, three men made it impossible for viewers to see what was going on.
The image of the World Cup winners lifting the trophy is an iconic one every time, and FOX will not be happy that their view of it was spoiled here. It wasn’t even FOX’s only gaffe of the broadcast, though the other one may not have been their fault.
This was the first time FOX Sports televised the World Cup, and their coverage wasn’t always popular with fans. Just about missing the trophy lift isn’t going to silence critics.
France have officially been crowned the kings of the soccer world, and the most powerful man in their nation is as excited as anyone about it.
Following his team’s 4-2 win over Croatia in the World Cup final on Sunday, French president Emmanuel Macron was so elated that he jumped onto a table and threw his arms in the air.
French President @EmmanuelMacron reacts during the final match between #France and Croatia at the 2018 soccer #WorldCup in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia. pic.twitter.com/SxIN0QcMFr
After the match, Macron headed down to the field to individually congratulate all of the players. He clearly didn’t mind the pouring rain after the skies opened up in Russia.
Amazing moment as French President Emmanuel Macron embraces each member of the #FifaWorldCup2018 championship team…in the pouring rain. pic.twitter.com/x0N4BKdTVp
We also saw some tremendous displays of sportsmanship from Macron and Croatia president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.
In a game that featured everything from remarkable goals to one of the worst goalkeeping blunders you will ever see, Macron’s unmatched enthusiasm was a fitting end.
France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made some remarkable saves throughout the World Cup, but he made one of the most embarrassing blunders during the final match against Croatia on Sunday. Fortunately, France had a sizable lead at the time.
Lloris received a pass from one of his teammates roughly halfway through the second half, and he tried to dribble around a Croatian attacker rather than simply booting it away. Let’s just say it did not go well.
That was about as bad of a blunder as you’ll see, and all of the good things Lloris had done to that point would have been forgotten if France didn’t have a three-goal lead.
It should be noted that Lloris made arguably the best save of the entire World Cup to help France advance to the final, so he deserves credit for that. Either way, he’d love to have his error from Sunday back.
The first half of the World Cup Final on Sunday featured about as much action as possible, and some fans were furious that they were forced to miss a small portion of it due to a broadcasting error.
In the 40th minute of play between Croatia and France, Xfinity customers had their broadcast of the game cut out for a commercial. That’s not supposed to happen in the middle of a half during a soccer match, and fans went ballistic on Twitter:
Fox cut off World Cup final to show #xfinity commercial It said “future is awesome”, but what about present!!
This #WorldCup in a nutshell. Fantastic back and forth game in the final, and @Fox goes to commercial during play.
France were leading 2-1 at the time. Their first goal came by way of an own goal, and the second was on a penalty kick that was awarded due to a handball in the box. Sandwiched between France’s two goals was a laser from Croatia to tie the score at 1-1, so you can understand why viewers didn’t want to miss any of the action.
There were many fears over whether Russia was prepared to host the 2018 World Cup, but at least one team had a very good experience from start to finish.
England manager Gareth Southgate had nothing but praise for the tournament’s organizers after their 2-0 defeat in the third-place playoff, stating that, despite a difficult relationship between the two countries politically, the tournament had been an excellent experience for the team.
Southgate thanks Russia 2018 organisers & volunteers. 'Our welcome in every city in Russia has been outstanding … there's a lot talked about the relationship between our two countries. On a personal level, mixing with people, we couldn't have been made more welcome'
There were definitely worries about how things would go in Russia, which faced criticism over some repressive government policies and fears of racism. One England player was so worried about the latter that he asked his family not to make the trip with him. Fortunately, it seems that the worst has been avoided, and overall, Russia’s issues were a lot less significant.
One French magazine is feeling pretty confident about France’s chances of beating Croatia in the World Cup Final.
The front page of Saturday’s L’Equipe depicts a massive celebration on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, accompanied by a simple headline: “See you tomorrow.”
It’s certainly a show of confidence from the French publication, who clearly believe they’re going to see off Croatia to win their first World Cup since 1998.
There is, however, the risk of Croatian players seeing this. One openly criticized the English media for underestimating them ahead of the semi-final, but nothing they did was quite as blatant as this. Perhaps they’ll see it and use it as motivation in the final.

Few mere mortals have ever embarked on such bold and heart-stirring adventures, overcome myriad monstrous perils, or outwitted scheming vengeful gods, quite as stylishly and triumphantly as Greek heroes.
In this companion to his bestselling Mythos, Stephen Fry brilliantly retells these dramatic, funny, tragic and timeless tales. Join Jason aboard the Argo as he quests for the Golden Fleece. See Atalanta - who was raised by bears - outrun any man before being tricked with golden apples. Witness wily Oedipus solve the riddle of the Sphinx and discover how Bellerophon captures the winged horse Pegasus to help him slay the monster Chimera.
Filled with white-knuckle chases and battles, impossible puzzles and riddles, acts of base cowardice and real bravery, not to mention murders and selfless sacrifices, Heroes is the story of what we mortals are truly capable of - at our worst and our very best.
'Assured and engaging. The pace is lively, the jokes are genuinely funny, and Fry once again proves himself a master of great learning worn lightly' - Observer

Anyone who's fooled around with doing pure-CSS layouts knows that the common 3-column layout can be pretty tricky (a design layout we take for granted in a table-based layout). Someone's compiled a list of other people's common layout techniques here, with a brief summary of the merits of each:
Those guys donated $10,000 in the name of Jack Thompson when he rescinded his offer of $10,000 to charity, claiming it was a joke.
The long and short of the story is this: Jack Thompson is a lawyer who likes to sue game companies for making games that aren't intended for kids. Now I have my own thoughts on these matters, and they don't totally align with a lot of the gamer community, but I'm not here to talk about that just at the moment. Suffice it to say that parents have a responsibility to control access to such things if it would negatively impact their child, and I agree with making tools available to parents to facilitate this.
Jack's offer was this: He'd give $10,000 to a charity if someone made a violent video game that he proposed, wherein the main character took bloody revenge on game company execs, and game store clerks when the character's son was copycat-murdered from a game.
He was presumably trying to make game companies feel the heat of their actions; where actions is production of adult level games. The guys at Penny-Arcade predicted that any successful creation of such a game would be deemed insufficient, and indeed it was. Only after someone actually created a mod to an existing game, which fully met the requirements put forth by Jack, did he claim the original offer was only sattire; rhetoric if you will. Most sattire I've encountered includes laughable values, not realistic ones. If it were sattire, wouldn't the figure have been $10,000,000,000, not $10,000? If it were sattire, would it not have included ludicrous requirements such as counting score in the number of innocents slain?
I think it's plain to even "all of [us] gamers on drugs" that this is back pedaling of olympic proportions. Hang in there Jack, maybe in the next olympics you'll medal in this new talent.
Anyhow, Gabe & Tycho ponied up to the rescinded offer, and put up Jack's money for him. Read some of the community responseOne
I'm a very minor Sci-Fi fanatic; by which I mean I'm a soft core fanatic, not preferring some of the old cheesy (or "classic" depending on your perspective) Sci-Fi works out there. I recognize them for their greatness to the time they were written, but unlike fine wines and cheeses, Sci-Fi doesn't get better with age.
Now that I've alienated you hard core Sci-Fi fans, I'll go another step further. Despite many encouragements from friends to get into Battlestar Galactica, I just haven't really been able to appreciate the show. This could largely be because I've been unable to watch its consecutive showings, which I know can ruin the experience of an otherwise really good show. I never appreciated Star Trek: Deep Space Nine until I was able to watch it on DVD in the order it was written. Turns out there's a whole lot of sub plots and over plots to that series which you'll never get a feel for if you don't watch them the way they were meant to be watched. Now I'm a really big fan of the series.
Despite the fact that some hard core Trekkies will probably lynch me for the statement, my favorite Star Trek series was Voyager, and I didn't care at all for Enterprise.
I own a number of Sci-Fi movies and series on DVD, including all of Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager. I'm currently working my way through Farscape, and enjoying its freshness.
All of this I basically put forth to establish: I'm a nerd who's spent a fair amount of money on Sci-Fi.
I had honestly never heard of a Sci-Fi series called Firefly while it was still on the air. Maybe it's because it got the Futurama treatment by Fox, which is to say, bad and inconsistent time slots, little advertising, small budget, and even airing the episodes out of order from their episodic chronology (the same treatment that caused me to not care for Deep Space Nine when I self-inflicted it on that series).
However, after the death of the series, I started hearing a lot about the show. It almost immediately established a cult following of dedicated fans. That by itself doesn't mean much to me, there's cult followings like this for shows like Enterprise, which I think betray the rest of the franchise. However, after repeated encouragement by friends and sources which I generally trust on such matters, I finally decided to buy a used copy of the DVD's. Hey, $25 is less than it costs to take a group of friends out to dinner, and I was pretty sure that if I ended up wasting the money on a bad series, my friends would end up owing that much to me.
Wow, my reservations on this front were poorly placed. This series is a fully cut and polished diamond in the cesspit of modern television. I was hooked after the first episode, and I've never been so mournful to reach the end of a box of DVD's as I was when I got to the final disc in Firefly. Like Futurama, this show failed in spite of its quality. Who knows how Fox executive minds work, or what secret grudge they had against Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, which I never cared for that much, but which my sister-in-law loves, and I do consider her tastes to be more refined than mine, so my guess is I never really gave Buffy a chance).
Anyhow, I strongly recommend you get yourself a copy of Firefly. It's currently my most favorite Sci-Fi series, by a long shot (sorry Gene Roddenberry). You can get it new or used from Amazon.
Firefly the series is currently canceled, after 1 season aired, and without even all of those episodes broadcast. However there are a lot of people hoping it'll get restarted because of the hoped-for success of the new movie based on that series (not a blockbuster so far, but expectations are that it'll have real staying power in the theater, and exceptional DVD sales).
Serenity is the name of the movie which came out this past weekend based on the Firefly series. I went to see it with friends (all also fans of the series) this past Saturday. Every one of us walked out of that theater absolutely stunned (in a positive way).
I'm not exaggerating when I say it's been the most significant movie experience of my life. Non-fans of the series will probably not feel this way, but largely because they don't know and care about the characters like series fans do.
The movie has one of those "Luke, I am your father" moments in it. Which is to say, it was very hard to fight the urge to discuss the happenings of the movie as you're walking out of the theater, past the others who haven't gone in to see the movie yet. It's something that could easily ruin the movie for another fan, but it is so hard not to talk about it before they've seen the movie.
I've babbled enough about this for now though. I recommend you watch the series before you see the movie, because although I feel as if the movie does a good job of catering to the non-series-fan as well as the series-fan, I guarantee you'll miss some of the jokes, and the overall events and purpose of the movie will mean a lot less to you. If you don't want to watch the series first, well, it should still be a good movie. Just be careful about what reviews you read, because I've heard a few give away the ending, and that's akin to walking out of Star Wars, saying, "Man, I can't believe Darth Vader is Luke's father," thus ruining the experience for others.
In closing, I've only ever watched one other movie more than once in the theater, and that was the The Matrix (original), which I saw 3 times. I've already got plans to see it in the theater at least once more, and perhaps twice more. Go watch this series, then go watch this movie, you won't be sorry.
If you won't take my word for it, then take Orson Scott Card's word for it (author of Ender's Game -- best Sci-Fi book ever). In his words, "I jealously protected the movie rights to Ender's Game so that it would not be filmed until it could be done right... If Ender's Game can't be this kind of movie, and this good a movie, then I want it never to be made." High praise indeed.
Thanks to you guys, LoGD sent a grand total of $2043.23 to Child's Play. This is an initial donation of $500 in early November, plus the money you guys donated throughout the month (minus our operating costs).
Eric--thanks so much! Robert was tabulating CP donations this morning and exclaimed "Whoa! Our Paypal account just jumped!" With this contribution you definitely are going to make a real difference in the lives of sick kids.
By now most of you are almost certainly aware of the changes that were put in the Inn on bribing Cedrik. You folks can move on to the next paragraph. For everyone else, there was a bug in bribing Cedrik where the middle tier of the 3 options guaranteed you a successful bribe. This bug has been in place for a long, long time; probably over a year.
This really was a bug, and was definitely not intentional. I'm not sure when exactly it got introduced, but until today, I was not aware of it at all (for real life reasons, the short of which is that I only have a few hours a week worth of time that I can use for myself). It should be obvious to most people that this was a bug -- otherwise why offer three tiers of bribery if the second tier always was successful?
I'm astonished at myself that I left such a hideous bug go unaddressed for so long, but I'm also astonished that it went unreported for so long. I really would have thought that *someone* would have realized this was a bug, and brought it up.
Well, I'm sincerely sorry that this was left in place so long. I now understand why so many people believed the inn was such a dangerous place to be. I'm also sorry that we're 'nerfing' it, but a bug is a bug, regardless of how long it's been in place. Our decision to fix bugs doesn't include any consideration for how long they've been there, but only for whether they were intended to be there in the first place.
My wife and I took a bus trip with her parents yesterday down to Washington D.C. We hit the Air & Space museum, Washington Monument, Lincoln Monument, and the Natural History museum. Of course one day is not enough time to do all of those things and give them sufficient attention.
The other thing we did, and about which I would like to talk today, is visit the new World War II memorial. I've never been in a war, and I hope never to be. I cannot fathom what this experience must be like to have lived through something like this; it's somewhat like water understanding what it's like to be oil. They share many of the same characteristics, and can even look enough alike that it might be difficult at times to tell them apart, but when you mix them, there is a certain quality that causes the oil to rise above the water, and a barrier that will always separate them from each other, even if they do live at times side by side. The price for owning this quality is far more than any person should be expected to pay, and never previously has that been more dramatically demonstrated to me than when I was standing in the midst of a crowd of people, many of whom were standing, mouths open in silent awe, in the WWII memorial.
There is this wall of bronze stars above a reflecting pool. Each star represents 100 people who died. I wouldn't have been able to hope to count them all with out resorting to my calculator to multiply the rows by the columns, and even then, it'd have taken no small amount of time to count the rows and columns. In the distance behind these stars is the half-mile long reflecting pool, and at the far side of that is the Lincoln monument. Standing in front of the stars with your back to them, you'll see the Washington monument staring down on you.
It is a truly humbling experience. If for even a moment, standing in here, you feel anything but humble, you should turn and allow the crowd to part for a moment, just long enough to glimpse a single star on the wall, and when you see it, realize that every single person you are close to, as well as many if not all of your acquaintances and relatives do not collectively represent the price that that tiny bronze star represents, sitting nondescript among so many thousands of other stars.
As impressed as I was with this memorial, I took 53 pictures. At one point, I had a perfect shot lined up in my view finder of a great stone bench engraved with "To Restore Freedom and To End Tyrany," above which rises a bronze pillar and a U.S. flag at half staff. I'd been waiting several minutes for the crowd to part long enough to get a good shot of it, when just as they did so, this old guy walks on to the scene and sits down on the bench. Not thinking, I lower my camera and grumble to my wife about my ruined shot. "I think he earned it," she says quietly. Ashamed, I had to agree.
This memorial is positively beautiful. If you are ever in the area of Washington, go and see it. I attached a couple of images here.
Those pictures are at 800x600 resolution. If any would like a higher res version, I have 2560x1920 images (should be bigger than your desktop no matter how high your resolution, hehe). Just send me a yom with your email address. The files are each about 1 meg just so you know what you'd be in for.
As I mentioned in a previous blog, I've recently switched to DirecTV. DirecTV is cheaper than Comcast for our area, and when you sign up, you can elect to get a TiVo for $99 (other than that there's no sign up or setup charges). Let me tell you what. I love that little guy. The only complaint I have is that he's silver, while the rest of our TV and associated equipment is black. My wife, (Crazy) Audrey won't let me get near it with that can of black spray paint I bought either.
TiVo watches what you watch. That's a concept that fundamentally bothered Audrey at first, since it reports your viewing habits to the TiVo central brain in a fashion that we're assured is anonymous. Personally, I'm all for this. The Nielsen group didn't elect me as one of those people who get free television in exchange for letting them watch my viewing habits so that I can shape what the networks put out there, so TiVo is the next best thing. I like the idea that a company watches what I watch. Maybe then they'll get the hint that I always pause TV (a feature of TiVo) when certain commercials come on which I find offensive, annoying, or are for products which I'm personally boycotting, then fast forward once enough time has elapsed that the commercial should be over. Maybe I'll also have some small say ultimately in what goes on TV. I hope that network execs pay attention to the TiVo stats; this is much more real than the smaller Nielsen sample base of people who are actively aware that their viewing habits are being used to shape the future of television. As an aside, I always wondered if such people were ever approached by show producers, and offered sums of money to watch a show that might otherwise get canceled, or to artificially inflate ratings to drive advertising dollars.
Anyhow, TiVo watches what you watch, and it learns what you like. There's little green and red thumbs up and thumbs down (respectively) buttons. If you see a show that you don't like, give it 1, 2, or 3 thumbs down. If you see a show that you do like, give it 1, 2, or 3 thumbs up. Eventually TiVo gets a good idea of what you do and don't like, and takes it upon himself to record things he thinks you'll like in his spare disk space. So you come home from work and find nothing on the TV, you can check out what TiVo recorded, and chances are good you'll see something you want to watch there.
You can also tell TiVo that you want to automatically record certain shows using a feature called "Season Pass." You can set it to record each showing, or just first-runs. It's also smart enough to not record two copies of the same episode (it knows what each episode is). TiVo takes care of disk management on his own, automatically erasing the oldest stuff (unless you mark something as a keeper) to make room for new stuff.
Enough about TiVo. I enjoy my DirecTV service in general, we've not had any reception problems even in a hail and wind storm, and the picture is more clear than our regular cable was. There's a broader channel choice (especially if you're in to sports, which I'm not), There are 5, count them, five Discovery channels. And the on-screen interactive guide to what's on and what's coming up is golden. You can see little synopsises of each upcoming show, then just push the Record button if you want to record a specific show that'll not be on until another day.
I don't yet have experience with their billing department, but that's about the only thing that still has much chance of disappointing me about DirecTV. If you're thinking of switching over, I'd recommend it. DirecTV is cheaper than cable, and if you have cable Internet, you can switch to DSL (Verizon offers CHEAP access if they're your phone provider, much cheaper than Cable Internet), which is more secure, and just as fast unless you elect the uber-cheapo-I-don't-want-good-net-access plan. You'll have higher quality service on each front, and you'll be stepping on the toes of Comcast, who I personally believe is chaired by an evil entity of firey origin.
Urk, what a couple of weeks. I want to formally apologize to all you loyal players (you unloyal ones get only an informal apology) for not being more present the past two weeks. No one sent any GuildWars reviews, so I wasn't able to grace you with the editorial prowess of any other players on this subject. I apologize for that also. I did however get an unsolicited review of LoGD. I got a few emails from players who tinkered with GuildWars while it was available, but nothing in sufficient depth to merit a post here (nor were they intended for such).
You'll notice the server has sped up some recently. This is thanks to the server side optimization of Turck MMCache. For you technocrats, this is a caching engine that intercepts the post-compile PHP scripts, crams them in RAM, and re-serves these next time the same script is requested. The result is that the server is spared the torment of repeatedly reinterpreting and revalidating each PHP script on every page hit. We typically see anywhere from 3-4 hits per second to 10-12 hits per second, depending on the time of day, so although this represents a small amount of work for any given page hit, it represents a significant overall savings on a busy site.
Thanks to JT for picking up the slack on working on the code while I've been busy. But someone please find out where he came up with the name Degolburg =).
Anyhow, I'm going to go have dinner with my wife, and enjoy her company. It helps reduce the random shoulder-launched kitten attacks from her Scratch of Fury 2000 brand kittens. Given the expense of such late model kittenry, it's cheaper just to take her to dinner and satisfy her physical hunger than it is to to satiate her appetite for kittens of mass destruction.
The Scratch of Fury reference is a PvP Online reference. The story arc begins here and the specific reference comes from somewhere about here. I recommend you read the whole thing and not just go from link to link.
It should be noted that Guild Wars is the first MMO (to my knowledge) that comes with out any monthly fees. This to me is a highly attractive feature.
For those who didn't know, the Guild Wars E3 for Everyone event went live a day early, so those eagerly awaiting a taste of the up coming MMO had an extra day to try it out (it was not supposed to go live until today). This event runs until Friday some time, and allows you to get a preview of the game some time before the beta starts, for free.
I played this for a couple of hours last night, and had quite a bit of fun with it. I have all kinds of good things to say about this game; it, like City of Heroes, plays much like a single player game, though they also provide significant incentive to take on missions that require a full group, in that these missions are only accessible if you have a group, ala EverQuest's Lost Dungeons expansion. The missions I experienced are more clever and make better use of strategy than the missions in EQ's Lost Dungeons.
The graphics are positively beautiful. They are the best graphics I've personally experienced first-hand in any MMO, and they are as rich for the modern gaming age as the original Unreal's graphics were for that age when it came out. If you do nothing else, find some water. I'm blown away by the water.
The interface is fairly polished for how early the game is in development, and it's certainly very usable, though it could still use improvement. It's better than I expected for the developmental stage the game is in though.
Everyone starts at level 15, and is locked at level 15, just for the sake of this event. You also are born with a set of equipment and skills appropriate for a level 15 character.
My experience in the game was very pleasurable, but I don't have time today to go in to a lengthy play by play of this game like I have done with others. Given the short nature of the E3 for Everyone event, I'd like to solicit reviews from any of you who've played it, and are inclined to write a review about it. Any reviews I feel are insightful and appropriate, I'll post up here for the general enjoyment of the LoGD players.
When I complained last month about Verizon's billing department having some screwy policies, I got a lot of very positive feedback. Little did I know when I wrote that, that many of you are also frustrated by companies who get so big that they can no longer bother to accurately account for their billing with us individuals.
Today I received a letter in the mail from Comcast. It's printed on a nice mint green paper, and says in bold letters at the top, "DISCONNECT WARNING." Dear customer, it says, our records show you have no idea how to pay a bill, and are late paying your current ones. Our billing department is infallible, and so you should send us lots of money for services for which you've already paid.
I'm no stranger to this particular letter. I've gotten it before, also from Comcast. The last 3 times though, it was printed on a pinkish-red paper rather than the nice mint green that it came in this time. Whereas before I felt like a bull in the streets of Madrid, this minty green paper makes me feel as though I'm skiing down the slopes of some famous skiing mountain, eating a peppermint patty. Well, so I assume, I've never really skied on any famous mountains with any sort of confection.
The last time I got one of these letters was about a month ago, which came at the tail end of a month and a half of effort working toward a resolution, and 3 similar letters before that one. At the time, Comcast stated I was delinquent on at least two bills some time between November and March; which months they couldn't say, but they were certain. Not just delinquent, they asserted that I never paid them at all, and certain enough that they were paying some other company to call me and harass me at work. I don't want to bore you with the gruesome details of this quest, but let me assure you, my coworkers had the radio off for the better part of a month as I talked to numerous different people within Comcast, each of which assured me they really had this thing solved this time. I knew I wasn't late on any bills, and that they'd all been paid, because I used my bank's automatic payment system, which sends the payment without my interaction on a schedule and amount that I specify. I had complete records showing I (or rather my bank) paid each bill on time, and these payments even happened entirely electronically so there was no check to lose.
I finally really honestly did get this all straightened out. A director of the billing department (who's apparently a level above a supervisor of the billing department, who's above a senior billing analyst, who's above a traditional billing analyst, who's above what ever company they pay to harass their customers) and I were on a first name basis, inquiring about each others kids and the like, and finishing phone conversations with, "Talk to you tomorrow." This latter part is rather an exaggeration, but not by much; I don't have kids.
So I was pretty surprised when I got yet another notice that my account is delinquent from a company which had all but offered a formal public apology for the inconvenience they'd caused.
I've already described in the previous blog how the old translation system works, and how it's not especially efficient. The difference between that system and the system I have partially deployed now is that the new system was based on a fundamentally different design concept. It's important to let people play the game in a non-English language, and I should alter my programming style to accommodate it. I don't have much time to describe it, but I'll do so briefly.
The new translation engine employs the sprtinf() function in PHP, which operates the same way that the one in C does. Those of you who have done some C development will recognize the sprintf() function, and can skip this brief description of it, picking up on the next paragraph. If I want to output that Farmboy Joe has 7 gems, and I'm using sprintf(), I do this: sprintf("~#%s~3 has ~^%d~3 gems.",$session['user']['name'],$session['user']['gems']). What this does is replace %s with the value found in $session['user']['name'] and %d with the value found in $session['user']['gems']. So if we're translating to German, we can change "~#%s~3 has ~^%d~3 gems." to "~#%s~3 hat ~^%d~3 Edelsteine." For more information on sprintf() under PHP, check out the PHP documentation.
If we need to change the order that the words appear in, we can do that also, by using this instead: "~^%2$d~3 Edelsteine hat ~#%1$s~3." (I hilighted the parts that are significant). This is an important difference between the old translation system and the new one, where we can change the order of variables in the output under this system, while we couldn't before. Another important difference is that we can now be sure that we only replace entire strings of data, rather than having to look for partial replacements within the data.
Looking up an entire string can be accomplished much more quickly than having to look within a string. As this is something that happens very rapidly, we wanted to take advantage of a hard coded lookup procedure, and conveniently PHP's associative arrays provide us this opportunity, while also being very easy to implement. PHP uses strings as the index to their arrays and does lookups on them using an ordered map. Those familiar with the data structure called a hash table are already familiar with the map data structure, as hash tables are an implementation of maps. In the end, what this comes down to is that you can locate a given string in a giant pile of strings, with out having to compare against each string in the pile until you find a match. Instead you use cleverness to eliminate the majority of possibilities within the haystack, and are left with only a small handful of hay through which you have to look for your needle.
Now all we have to do is populate a PHP array with From => To pairs, and we can efficiently look up translation pairs. It is still a little hairy to have to dig through code and locate all the output strings though, so each time text goes through the translator now, those who have the translator tool turned on will see a tiny T appear. The T will be red for those spots that no translation pair is found in their current language, and blue for any that were found. Clicking the T brings up a window that shows the the text that went through the translator at that point and allows them to specify a translation, establishing the pair.
The system will also collect previously unseen translation calls, and allow the translating player to pour over a list of untranslated text, providing translations for them.
As you may have guessed, translation pairs are being stored in the database, that's the only feasible and universally functional way to store data that's being updated dynamically like this. It's not a good idea however to load the text for the entire game each page hit, when only portions of the text are going to be needed on any given hit. So we introduced the idea of namespaces. When the engine enters a new translation namespace, it loads the pairs for that namespace if it hasn't already, and translation pairs that weren't defined in that namespace aren't examined. This lets us put, for example, all the buff output messages in the "buffs" namespace, and then no matter what page they're called from, the text will display properly, while not having to load text from the inn while we're in the forest. The namespaces operate as a stack, so if while in a forest fight, we do something with buffs, we would push "buffs" on the stack, and when we're done with the buffs, we pop "buffs" off the stack, and the translation namespace returns to whatever it was before we started working with buffs.
We automatically set a number of namespaces. For example, all page hits default to the script name as the name space. Any time we're executing code within a module, we're in a namespace tied to that module's name. We don't have to worry about that. The only times we need to worry about setting a namespace is when certain text appears in more than one place, such as with the buffs, or the Vital Info in your nav over there. Buffs, as I mentioned, go in the "Buffs" namespace, and vital info goes in the "global" namespace (reserved for those texts which appear on every page, eg, "MoTD," "Ye Olde Mail: %d new, %d old," and "Petition for Help".
If a multi lingual admin installs a module, changes a buff, or does something else which leaves some text untranslated, they have only to click the T and provide a translation, and they're fixed. No need to dig in code at all, and we could grant rights to anyone we want to provide a translation in any language they know.
In the future, we may be taking applications for translators, but we're not just now; no need to barrage me with requests to be a translator just yet =). The reason for this is that the system isn't totally done and it's not yet ready for public consumption.
I hope this satiated the sick curiosity a number of you have demonstrated in to how we are running the translator =). I'm fairly flattered that so many are so curious as to how I structure things, though I can't take credit on all that structural stuff, JT spends many an hour telling me why I'm an idiot for structuring things a certain way (I've spent a few reciprocating that, but not as many).
Thanks for those who were interested, and for those who weren't, why are you still reading by this point in the blog? You're crazy!
Seems not a few of you are curious about this translation engine thing I mentioned before. So here's the gory details.
To appreciate the new translation system, a bit of understanding about the old translation system is in order. A design principle I took when approaching the old translation system was, "I speak the language this game was written in, so I don't really get much out of a translation engine, thus it shouldn't really affect the way I approach my main code." Toward that end, I built it in such a way that it was compatible with all the back code I'd done at the time.
In order to specify a translation on a given line of code, the person translating would open translator_XX.php (where XX is the language code) and find the section in that file that indicates the page they're working on. If they were going to translate the sentence "Mary has a little lamb" they'd add this to that section:
and whenever "Mary has a little lamb" on the page in question was output, this would be replaced with the translated version. As soon as the engine located a valid translation pair, it stopped looking for others for that bit of output for efficiency reasons. That works ok, except where I include variables inline with the rest of the output.
where I'm using the ~ instead of the backtick (or grave to you frenchies) since there's no way to represent one in a blog with out it thinking it's a color code =). The output of that would look like this:
Now this represents a problem, because the variables are put in place by the PHP engine, and by the time it reaches the translator, "Farmboy Joe" and the "7" are already there. You obviously don't want to do translation pairs for every combination of player names and how many gems they might have. So I made it so that any one line could have multiple replacements done on the same line. To do this, the translating party simply specified an array of possibilities:
as one line in the translation script. If the engine got to this line and saw a "has" it would do all the replacements in the array, and stop looking for other translations. This successfully translates the gems line, but you have to be careful about the ordering of this. Because "has" is a common word, you need to put it low down in the listing so that another line doesn't get translated by this pair first.
It was functional if a little difficult to tweak, reorganizing lines here and there if a translation happened out of order. But it was hugely inefficient. Each output that went through the translation engine required one substring replacement for each translation pair. Well, not exactly, since it stops for the first successful pair that it finds. So the growth order of this algorithm is somewhere about O = n log(n). The log(n) is the searching for translation pairs, and the n is the length of the string we're searching through. That's not a superb growth order, we'd prefer to see something like O = n, or O = log(n), but at least it's not O = n^2. What all that fancy talk means is simply that the more data we put in this thing, the less efficient it gets. Once you get an entire game pushed in to the translator, it comes to a crawl. This is something I didn't see when developing it in the first place because I only translated bits and pieces just as a technical (not scalar) test of the system. Honestly it wasn't important enough to me to pursue it in more depth than that.
Well, the new translation system should be much closer to a log(n) growth, which means that if you're doing almost no translation, you see a higher price paid for this system over the old one, but as you begin to grow the translation or the output that you're doing, it surpasses most other translation systems by far. Unfortunately I ran out of time just now to talk about how that works, I've got to go to work. I'll try to toss an entry on that up here later today =).
I mentioned in a MoTD that there was a password upgrade. For those who want to know, what we're doing now is utilizing a javascript based md5 algorithm to hash your password before it is sent to the server. This is then md5'd again server-side and compared against the hash in the database. If they match, your password is good and you get to sign in. If you don't have javascript enabled, the game picks up on the fact that your password was in fact *not* md5'd, and md5's it two times before comparing to the database. Ultimately the password stored in the database is a double md5 of your original password.
We don't md5 the password two times for a that being any harder to reverse than a single md5, but rather this way your password doesn't have to go across the network in plain text, so no one can sniff you, and even the hash that goes across the network is also not stored directly in the database. Not having the hash that you send across the network be the same one we store in the database means that if I wanted to look in the database and steal your password to log in to another LoGD site by forging the javascript, it won't do me any good. For the same reasons we md5 a password before storing it in the database, we md5 the hash you send us when you log in before storing that in the database. You're afforded two levels of protection, one against prying eyes, and one against prying admins.
The other upgrade we're doing security-wise is using a new module to control administrative access by IP address. With this module, should I go over to a friend's house, I'd not be able to perform most administrative tasks. Although that part's not particularly fantastic, what is fantastic is that if someone managed to figure out my password (or the password of another admin) the worst they'd be able to do would be to get that admin killed in the forest, and post some comments. All too often someone claims to have admin passwords, then I end up doing a bunch of detective work to find out they indeed don't. Now it won't matter so much even if they do get it because they won't be able to go crazygonuts on the game.
We already protect against password brute forcing on admin accounts, so this adds yet another level of protection.
Also this update brings us a new translation engine, but I doubt most of you really want to hear all the boring details of *that*. Sorry if any of the above didn't make sense, it's the end of the day, and I haven't had coffee for over 10 hours now. YoM me if you don't understand something and are curious, and I'll try to answer you =)

The DNC lawsuit, designed to prove the unprovable, which the FBI, the CIA, the NSA and the Inspector General could not prove will backfire on the DNC. Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s campaign did not “collude with the Russians,” nor with Wikileaks.
The Obama Administration, The DNC, Hillary Clinton and the Hillary Clinton Campaign for president all had a lot more to do with Russians, Their genuine emails, copies of which are held by WikiLeaks, will prove it.
The DNC is on a mission to self-destruct. Their “Russia, Russia, Russia” calls, backed up by the corrupt non-journalistic mainstream media resulted in no findings against Trump and his campaign. What was eventually found is that some Russians paid for facebook ads to test distracting Americans in an election year. Those distractions clearly did not have a political bias for one candidate, because some were anti-Tump and others anti-Clinton.
The Special Counsel apparently indicted these Russians for paying for ads that Facebook, an American company, vetted and allowed to be published. That sounds like a felony right there. NOT!
The DNC, unhappy that the FBI, DOJ and Special Counsel found nothing, decided to take matters into their own hands, with a lawsuit against their nemesis. Democrats disrespected their black and latino base, treating them like naughty children daring to disobey commands.
This new lawsuit against Trump, Wikileaks and Russia obviously has not been thought through. It is perfect! What Democrats have not thought through is that filing a suit opens both sides to discovery. Obviously, the defendants have little to hide – the FBI found nothing. The plaintiff, on the other hand has a lot they don’t want to come out into the light.
That’s why this lawsuit will backfire on the DNC, Hillary Clinton, her campaign, their financiers and even Barack Obama. It could be a complete disaster for them.
The DNC is in a sad and sorry state. They used their base to attack Donald Trump, the man whose policies resulted in record low unemployment for blacks, hispanics and women. The DNC lied about Trump, misleading their base, feeding their fears, hoping to get them to do DNC dirtywork.
And it worked. Thousands of lefty sheep supported Black Lives Matter, Antifa and crazy lefty causes. In many cases, they trashed their own neighborhoods, destroyed local businesses. But, as someone (possibly Abraham Lincoln) once said, “You can fool all the people some of the time and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.”
Realizing that Democrats have lied to them, many more blacks and hispanics are now thinking for themselves and standing with Donald Trump. There have always been black intellectuals, black free-thinkers and small numbers of black republicans. But now, thanks to the overconfident stupid DNC playing dirty tricks,more blacks are waking up to the lies.
This not to say that Republicans are perfect. Far from it. There are corrupt politicians on both left and right. This has already been seen in some of the many resignations of politicians in the past year.
This DNC lawsuit is so implausible that a rational person could conclude they actually want to get rid of corrupt democrats in their ranks.

Paris Jackson, the daughter of the late King of Pop, Michael Jackson, is now being represented by IMG Models, she wrote on Instagram Thursday.
“Thank you @imgmodels,” she wrote. “I feel very lucky and blessed.” The agency confirmed the news with an Instagram post of its own.
Jackson, 18, told Rolling Stone that after she graduated from high school in 2015, she spent one year in community college before deciding she wanted to do something else with her career. Because her adolescence was plagued by constant criticism from online trolls who mocked her appearance, she found modeling to be cathartic.
“I’ve had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time,” she said. “Plenty of people think I’m ugly, and plenty of people don’t. But there’s a moment when I’m modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer’s telling me – and I feel pretty. And in that sense, it’s selfish.”

Some 11.5 million read metropolitan and national newspapers across seven days, and they spend an average 30-plus minutes with them. TANYA SHINN discusses the preferences of this huge audience when they pick up a copy during the week, and then at the weekend.
One of the great commercial strengths of newspapers is their scale – 74 per cent of the adult population read a paper – and the levels of engagement with the content on weekdays and at the weekend.
Readers have a different mindset, depending on the day of the week and their prime motivation for buying, such as a favourite section or magazine insert.
The research shows that 9.6 million will pick up a metro or national newspaper during the week, whether they buy a copy or read it at their local café or workplace. By comparison with weekend papers, readers have a more focused intent on finding out the news of the day.
Essential information about major economic, political and social events at home and overseas are key motivators. And while they might have seen headlines or quickly consumed articles on their phone, they seek a credible and more in-depth experience in print.
Finance and business content rate highly among weekday readers, who are 14 per cent more likely to read business and finance content than weekend readers, according to emma data.
The value of a weekday paper is not lost on younger audiences. Those aged 29 or under are more inclined to pick up a newspaper than during the weekend. More than one-in-five (22%) say they will read a newspaper during the week. In total, 2.1 million in this demographic say they’ve picked up a paper in the last month.
A similar trend reveals itself for those aged 30-44, whose preference for weekday news sees audience figures increase by 240,000 during the work week to 2.3 million.
Older readers prefer the weekend experience. Those aged 45 and over make up 59 per cent of the weekend print audience, or three out of five readers.
By comparison to weekday readers, those who enjoy a paper on Saturdays and Sundays have a far more relaxed approach and enjoy the greater depth and variety of the journalism.
Weekend readers, who total 9.3 million across a month, are 22 per cent more likely to read arts and entertainment content and 15 per cent more likely to read sports content than weekday audiences.
By taking the day of week into account, along with the content environment and the character of the type of newspaper, advertisers have a variety of powerful choices to reach readers with a message that strikes a chord.
Strongest daily newspaper readership exists in the Northern Territory with 66 per cent of the population reading a newspaper in the past four weeks.
Some 62 per cent of Victorians read a weekday newspaper while 58 per cent of West Australians and South Australians do the same. Residents of NSW register at 50 per cent for weekday readership, and in Tasmania and Queensland readership sits at 47 percent and 41 per cent respectively.
Western Australia and South Australia rank among the most prolific weekend newspaper readers with three in five reading a weekend paper in the last month. Similar numbers consume weekend newspapers in the Northern Territory and Victoria where weekend readership registers above 50 per cent.
Newspapers are a powerful tool for geographic targeting as different classes of newspapers provide different advantages. Metro newspapers, unlike metro TV stations, provide effective reach into both metro and regional Australia across the states, making them effective in regional markets as well as the major cities.
Data reveals that during the working week readers spend an average of 30 minutes every day reading a newspaper. On the weekend, more than half of the readers (51%) spend more than 30 minutes with their favourite newspapers.
When we look at the time of day readers choose to consume newspaper journalism, it is clear that early mornings are the preference. Readership of weekday newspapers peaks early in the morning with smaller spikes at midday and in the early evening.
The early morning consumption of newspapers puts them in a unique position to determine what the key news agenda is on any given day – an advantage that extends to advertising content as readers plan the day ahead.

One doesn’t usually think of a bustling corridor of shops, businesses and residences as home to an airfield, but Beacon Hill in the heart of the Route 1 Corridor was just that in the early days of aviation. Thousands of pilots were trained there prior to World War II and it remained an airfield until the late 1950’s. After the war and before the creation of the Interstate Highway System, Route 1 was the major north-south highway from Florida to Maine, and this community was home to scores of motels, shops and restaurants to serve travelers. A handful of those old motels are still around, but most have given way to housing developments, commercial and retail centers over the last 30 years. Tucked between the George Washington Parkway to the east and I-95 to the west, the Route 1 Corridor still handles a lot of cars every day as a major commuting artery, but now has a more distinctly suburban feel than even 20 years ago.
At almost 1,500 acres, Huntley Meadows Park is a green escape in a very busy suburban community. Home to some of the largest and most pristine wetland areas in Fairfax County, Huntley Meadows is a real jewel. Every type of housing in every price range can be found in the Route 1 Corridor, and there’s plenty of “big box” retail and restaurants to support this evolving community. INOVA Mt. Vernon Hospital offers quality care to the community’s residents, and has a particularly strong reputation for orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation. There’s also a long-established farmer’s market every Saturday morning (in season, of course) in the shadow of the Hospital at Fairfax County’s Mt. Vernon District offices.
The car is king, but there are multiple bus routes offering access throughout the region as well as feeding to the Huntington Metro, the beginning of the Yellow Line. Route 1 runs north-south right through the middle of the community, serving as the area’s travel backbone.

How do I Register to bid? Upon arriving at our state-of-the-art facility, buyers register for a bidder number. If this is your first visit, we ask for a valid driver's license or other government-issued photo ID, along with some basic information. Once registered with us, your next visit will only require the last four digits of your phone to receive a bidder's number for that auction.
Before the bidding begins: Find a seat where you will feel comfortable. Take the time to preview the items that will be presented for bidding. Check items according to your own set of criteria - size, color, condition, maker, style. It is often helpful to bring along a magnifying glass. If you have questions on an item, find a staff member or the auctioneer. We will be more than happy to provide additional information when we can. Take note of the items you are interested in and what you are willing to pay for each item.
During the auction: Give yourself time to learn the rhythm of the auctioneer. Each auctioneer has a different cadence and style. Before the item you are interested in comes up for bidding, listen to how the auctioneer starts the bidding.
How do I Bid? The auctioneer begins the auction by providing basic information about the auction. The opening bid is set by the auctioneer. Follow along with the auctioneer and when the bid offered is in your range, raise your bidder's card. The auctioneer will then volley your bid with other members in the audience that are interested in that item. When a high bid is reached, the auctioneer will repeat the bid offered and announce "SOLD" or will announce the winning bidder's number. Your bid and bidder number is then recorded on the JAS computer system, providing accuracy for the bidder on amounts paid and for the consignor to track the amounts due to them.
Bidder's Choice - The high bidder on a group of items has won the right to select an item from the group last auctioned. Once an item is selected, the auctioneer will repeat the bidding on the same group to determine a new high bidder. This new high bidder then will select an item from the active auction lot. This process will continue until the entire lot is sold or the auctioneer opts to sell the remaining items as a lot. The auctioneer also may opt to open the lot to a back-up bidder prior to reopening the bidding. The back up bidder is the last bidder, just before the high bidder.
Times the money - If a group of items is being auctioned, the winning bidder will have the option to select multiple items from the group. The high bid is then multiplied by the number of items selected.
Buyer's Premium - At most JAS auctions, the buyer's premium is 13%, with a 3% discount given for cash, debit cards or checks known to us. This fee is added to the winning bid. The premium is included to assist the auction house in covering the costs associated to the development of the auction and preparation of the auction items. For example, if your total bids are $100 - the buyer's premium would be $13. The total amount due at the checkout would be $113, plus applicable taxes.
How do I know if the final price is a fair price? An auction provides a forum for determining the current market value of an item. The best way to know a price is fair is to do your homework. Set your bidding limits BEFORE the auctioneer starts the bidding. This helps to keep the excitement of the auction at a controlled pace. The auction process is a method for informed and competitive bidders to determine the market value of an item.
How are Sales Tracked? JAS Sales are computerized, providing the buyer and seller with an itemized listing of purchases and sales.
What if I can not stay for the whole auction? JAS accepts absentee bids. Absentee bids are also a method of bidding when you can not attend the auction at all. Once you have found an item you interested in, contact us or return to the registration area and inform the cashier you would like to leave an absentee bid. You will receive stickers with your bidder number. The clerks will then track the item. When the item is presented for bidding, your absentee bid will be initiated. As the bidding begins, the auctioneer and clerk will reference your high bid to keep you in the bidding up to and including your highest offer. If the item is won, JAS will notify you of your win!

It’s not like search engine optimization uses and abuses haven’t been in the news before, but this is a good reminder that our World Net View comes filtered, not at the least by anything we ourselves do, but by the whims of one company. Don’t get me wrong; I like Google and really do believe their shtick about doing no evil (unlike Apple). However, they are a business. And a business’s continued existence relies on earning money.
However, what this article did was to highlight a secret even dirtier than the “Black Hat” tactics: search engines require secrets. Right after my initial response to the article (thumping my desk, saying this is a problem in need of an open source solution!), I realized that an open-sourced search engine, whose search and ranking algorithms were publicly known, would not only be open to abuse out of the gate, but would encourage it. And so the searches would fail.
And so must we live with One Engine to seek them all and in the darkness find them, trusting that market competition will keep it from doing evil? Or should this become a government operated function–like a utility or even more so, like the Mint? After all, part of that function is to prevent counterfeiting. But do we really want the”success” and “efficiency” of government control involved? It seems that there would be as much temptation for abuse as there is in the private world.
The article can be found here (and speaking of link manipulation, note that this link includes a variable being passed to the NYT that gives credit to the site from which I discovered the article. This is a legitimate way to give credit to the people who find and share this information (after all, I didn’t originally go to NYT’s site); but just in case it bothers you, here is the direct link)
I couldn’t help but notice in my last post that Firefox’s spell checker didn’t recognize the word, Obama. So just out of curiosity, I googled around for information that explained who maintained their dictionary. All I could find was this blurb (emphasis mine):
The contents of dictionaries are not maintained by Mozilla. In some cases they are not maintained by anyone. If you think the contents of a dictionary should be updated, you might be able to find out who maintains it by looking in its README file (if it has one). You can find the README file by using a zip tool or jar tool to open the dictionary’s installation file. .xpi files can be opened in windows explorer by first changing the .xpi extension to .zip
Well, I couldn’t find the readme file, so it may be that I’m just blind. However, I am concerned about that bold statement. Not that I’m a prescriptivist when it comes to language, but if you are going to offer a reference tool, should it not reflect the most current (accepted) data? Of course, not EVERY nonce word or even proper name should be included, however, a sitting president’s name ought to have more clout as it is bound to be relevant to many people. That lack of relevant data defeats the purpose of the tool and it’s ability to help me, the user. My pet turtle’s name–okay; I get it. And yes, I know I can add words to my personal dictionary, but why should the current president’s last name be relegated to my personal dictionary? After all, I don’t think the president would think its my responsibility. This falls under the category of a good idea, but lack of follow-thru… (and yes, FF did catch that one…)
UPDATE: I DID find, at least I think, who is responsible for the dictionary FF uses: http://hunspell.sourceforge.net/ I was immediately happy to learn that that they support more than one product:
“Hunspell is the spell checker of OpenOffice.org and Mozilla Firefox 3 & Thunderbird, Google Chrome, and it is also used by proprietary softwares, like Mac OS X, memoQ, Opera and SDL Trados.”

I receive a lot of inquiries about my upcoming novel, especially after reading the prologue. I decided I would give my Prosers a little preview from one of my chapters. The Davenports will grace us with their presence December 2017! Thank you for remaining interested and supportive! ~ Mara Prose
Deep in her soul, she had a yearning to bring justice to those responsible for her brother’s death. She never believed it was an accident; wouldn’t allow herself to accept that fate would be that cruel to her. She was furious with her father’s cold disregard of the passing of her beloved brother. Since Cale had been her father’s pride and joy, she had expected him to honor her brother by launching an additional investigation after the ruling of accidental death was made. Much to her dismay, Makhail simply isolated himself and moved on as if her brother had never existed.
The pain from these memories still burned strongly within her. She had never been able to let it go, and nothing she did allowed the wounds of her loss to heal. This trip home was imperative to her future – not only for healing but for vengeance. Alessandra wanted the world to pay for the void left in her life, and the first person to suffer would be her father, Makhail Davenport.

Sometimes the LTWA only includes an entry that should be inflected (if equilibria is not abbreviated, check equilibrium).
For non-English titles untick the checkbox (watch out for: wrongly applied matches from other languages; grammar issues, e.g. German compound words; other transliterations from slavic languages).
articles, conjunctions and prepositions are omitted (except prepositions at the beginning, like From zero to hero, or locutions like in vivo);
A psychological phenomenon in which the mind responds to a stimulus (an image or a sound) by perceiving a familiar pattern where none exists.
Successful politicians are good at exploiting pareidolia to let voters hear what they want in their words. If that makes sense to you, you may find what you are looking for in my book.

If the Union was a dog it would be a Shepherd. It listens unbeatable secure to your input and combines it with a incredible fast reaction. Interesting is the Airush invention of the Dyneema Load Frame. It is used again in the third version of the Union. Which means Airush is convinced it is the answer to its competitors triple and even quadruple wired canopy. Is this a strong answer? And will the Shepherd show its teeth when needed?
We have a very nice recall on our test almost 2 years ago on the Union V1. The possibilities to adjust the Union to the conditions or personal preferences is very interesting and probably will be adapted to more and more kites in the future. By changing the setup of the bridles at the leading edge and the (3m) extension on the lines on or off makes the kite so much more versatile. The test team had a common enjoyable and good kiting experience on the Union while learning which set up suited best. Which made most of us wanting to own the Union ourselves.
As we understood the V2 wasn’t different to that of the V1, but the V3 (if it is a 2017 or 2018 model is not clear) has been “re-designed from the bottom up…more lift and hangtime when going for Big Air, along with quicker and more responsive steering.”
Most details on the Union are as you may expect from a grown up brand like Airush. A “Boston” wide inflate, clean and universal way for suicide mode, down the bar swivel, single line total flag out and well protected depowerlines. The Union is also a fraction lighter (we weigh all the kites). Most 9 meter kites are just over 3 kilos but the Union is about 10% under it. It might be due to the fact it hasn’t got any battens in the canopy, while most of the comparable kites (like the FX and Dice) have 4 or even 6 battens to support the canopy.
Almost all brands have switched from the universal (and inferior) small inflate to about 4 different wide inflate connections. The one Airush is using (“Boston inflate”) is a pretty common one. Without getting into details on which system is better or worse, we would like to send a message to the industry: get one universal system. Less plastic (one pump should fits all) means a cleaner environment, which is protecting our own playground.
Similar to the previous versions we are happy to see the V2 Core bar has extensions so you can adjust your kite to some extend to the conditions. Sadly the Airush website doesn’t provide you the details on them. The lines itself partly mention some answers, but still it is kind of confusing. We did some measurements; With all lines attached (which is 10M+9m+3m extensions+ longer bridles than average) compared to a 22m North bar you get 1.5m more length (23.5m total). Good for low end, less good for mega loops. When removing those extensions you get 20.5m.
The Union is not an extreme beast. Rather the opposite. It combines a superb stability with the most reactive properties a stable kite can have. If you get it to stay poot, for example at 12 o’clock, it will wait (just like a Shepherd) completely still exactly where you set it. Eagerly waiting for the command to immediately run off at your command. It is almost like the Union has it tongue hanging out of his mouth, like that of an eager dog from enthousiasme. It is a very trust full feeling which advanced riders and wave riders will appreciate in particularly. On top of that we loved -again- the fact the line extensions (on or off) gave us a much wider wind range than kites with just one length. In doubt about which length to use? We preferred on average the longer line set up (extensions on). The Union is fast enough to still get a fun and responsive feeling in this setup.
The Shepherd doen’t really show any aggression when going for an freestyle move. Unhooking, especially in under powered situations, it tends to back stall suddenly. This is the Union major Achilles heel. Just like a Bandit or Dice the Union tends to stall when powering up too much the back lines on light conditions. With the Union it just happens much more suddenly and abrupt compared to other kites. It happened more on the wider setting of the bridles, which made us prefer (by far) the inner settings.
Does the Dyneema Load Frame have a noticeable direct effect on the performance? Our idea is that it will help to support a longer and better canopy on the long run. But we think we have noticed an effect from the Dyneema load Frame on the performance. The Union has a quite particular power buildup. It can be best compared to that of having a second lift while jumping. Usually this (only) happens when you get an extra gust of wind while hanging in the air. The Union sort of always have a late or second pull. It is something to get used to, especially when going for a (mega) kite loop. The power peak, roughly half second later as other kites, can get you surprised.
The Union sort of always have a late or second pull. It is something to get used to, especially when going for a (mega) kite loop. The power peak, roughly half second later as other kites, can get you surprised.
When I was learning to kiteloop on Bandit 9m and 10m I also felt that second lift, I thought it was pretty common on those kites, that's why a lot of people recommend pure C kite for learning kiteloop because power is more constant through the loop and doesn't spike as bad.
The kite accelerate through the loop and midway it peaks which yanks you out of place then kite stalls slightly. Once you know how to loop you have better technique in term of core strength and you are ready to take the yank but when learning that yank will throw you leg behind you overhead screwing the line tension making really hard to learn kiteloop.
Maybe on 7m and 8m it's less important because kite is faster so it catch you better but on 9m with 24m line boosting off flat water it's quite critical. Though on 20.5m maybe it's less an issue but it will yank you really bad when powered...
The review looks good overall but the lightwind unhook part and the kiteloop part makes it unappealing to beginner to intermediate. Looks like you need to graduate from unhooking on low end and be confirmed on kiteloop before you get that kite.
Really like C but I will probably try to find a hybrid at some point for better hangtime and versatility. Can't do any one footer or board off with my C ;( or not good enough to learn on it at least.
The Union is ok in Waves, but not as good as the Wave kite. The Wave drifts better and doesn't mind the slack line scenario you can get when on a wave. The Union can be fine, but not as refined in those kind of conditions like the Wave is
If you're going to specifically ride in Waves, then get a Wave kite, if you're mostly into freeride & boosting, with a little bit of Wave action, get the Union.
I tested a Union V2 12m on very small waves and I was pretty happy with it, but since I hadn't had a chance to test it on bigger waves, where drift and stability of the kite when there isn't any tension on the lines is important, I decided to ask here.
I finally purchased a Union V3 12m for wave riding and boosting when I'm not racing with my foil. I'm also planning to share this with my wife, and she's a newbie riding a TT.

The United States Medical Licensing Examination is a single, three-step exam for medical licensure in the United States . The USMLE provides a common system to evaluate applicants for medical licensure. The United States Medical Licensing Examination is sponsored by the Federation of State Medical Boards of the United States, Inc. (FSMB) and the National Board of Medical Examiners ® (NBME ® ). The USMLE is governed by a committee consisting of representatives of FSMB, NBME, ECFMG and the American public.
You can take Step 1 and Step 2 in either order, provided that you meet the respective eligibility requirements for these exams. However, before applying for Step 3, you must have received official notification that you have passed both Step 1 and Step 2. For descriptive information about the content of Step 1 and Step 2, refer to The Three Steps of the USMLE on page 2 and Examination Content on page 6 of the USMLE Bulletin of Information . For information on the format of these exams, refer to Format of the Exams in this publication and to Test Lengths and Formats on page 9 of the USMLE Bulletin of Information . Sample test materials for Step 1 / Step 2 are available on this website, the USMLE CD and on the USMLE website at www.usmle.org.
The Practice Sessions use many of the same sample test materials that are available on the USMLE website and on the USMLE Orientation CD; however, the Practice Session does not include any multimedia items and uses an older version of the test delivery software (FRED V1). NO NEW SAMPLE TEST MATERIALS ARE PRESENTED AT PRACTICE SESSIONS.
To be certified by ECFMG, international medical graduates must, among other requirements, pass a medical science examination. Step 1 and Step 2 of the United States Medical Licensing Examination™ (USMLE) are the exams currently administered that meet the medical science examination requirement for ECFMG certification. To meet the medical science examination requirement for ECFMG certification, you must pass both Step 1 and Step 2. You can take Step 1 or Step 2 in either order, provided you meet the eligibility requirements for these exams.
Step 1 is the basic medical science component of the medical science examination. Step 1 assesses whether you understand and can apply important concepts of the sciences basic to the practice of medicine, with special emphasis on principles and mechanisms underlying health, disease and modes of therapy.
Step 2 is the clinical science component of the medical science examination. Step 2 assesses whether you can apply medical knowledge and understanding of clinical science essential for the provision of patient care under supervision and includes emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention.
In 1999, the United States Medical Licensing Examination was converted from paper and pencil format to computer-based format. As a result, paper and pencil administrations of Step 1 and Step 2 are no longer offered. Computer-based based administrations of Step 1 and Step 2 are offered continuously at test centers worldwide. You can apply for Step 1 and Step 2 at any time , provided you meet the eligibility requirements for these exams.
The eligibility requirements for Step 1 and Step 2 differ depending on whether you are a medical school student or a medical school graduate.
If your eligibility for an exam changes after you apply but before you take the exam, you are required to inform ECFMG immediately of this change in your status.
To be eligible for Step 1 and Step 2 , you must be officially enrolled in a medical school located outside of the United States and Canada that is listed in the International Medical Education Directory (IMED) of the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) , both at the time that you apply and at the time you take the exam. In addition, the "Graduation Years" in IMED for your medical school must be listed as "Current" at the time you apply and at the time you take the exam. Your Medical School Dean, Vice Dean or Registrar must certify your current enrollment status on the application. This certification must be current ; the official must have signed the application within four months of its receipt by ECFMG. As soon as you graduate and receive your medical diploma, you must send two photocopies of your medical diploma and one full-face photograph to ECFMG (see Provision of Credentials and Translations ). The photograph that you send must be current; it must have been taken within six months of the date that you send it. A photocopy of a photograph is not acceptable.
In addition to being currently enrolled as described above, to be eligible for Step 1, you must also have completed at least two years of medical school. This eligibility requirement means that you must have completed the basic medical science component of the medical school curriculum by the beginning of your eligibility period for Step 1.
In addition to being currently enrolled as described above , to be eligible for Step 2, you must be within twelve months of completion of the full didactic curriculum by the beginning of your eligibility period for Step 2.
ECFMG reserves the right to re-verify with the medical school the eligibility of medical school students who are registered for Step 1 and Step 2. If ECFMG requests re-verification of your student status with your medical school, ECFMG will release your score report for the USMLE Step 1 and / or Step 2 only after re-verification of your status has been received by ECFMG.
CK The Practice Session is a maximum of 3.5 hours and is divided into three 1-hour blocks of 46-50 multiple-choice test items each. When you complete the session, you will receive a printed percent correct score.
The practice session is a maximum of 4 hours and includes five blocks that vary in number of multiple-choice test items and three Premium® Computer-based Case Simulations (CCS). All of the test items and Premium cases used in the Practice Session are drawn from the Step 3 practice items on the USMLE website or on the USMLE Orientation CD. When you complete the session, you will receive a printed percent correct score for the multiple-choice items and feedback on the Premium CCS cases.
The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) consists of three steps with four exams designed to assess a physician's ability to apply a broad spectrum of knowledge, concepts, and principles to evaluate the physician's basic patient-centred skills.
The Step 1 exam is a multiple-choice exam designed to test how well the examinee applies basic, integral science concepts to clinical scenarios.
CK - The Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) is a multiple-choice exam designed to determine whether the examinee possesses the medical knowledge and understanding of clinical science considered essential for the provision of patient care under supervision.
CS -The Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) is a separate "hands-on" exam that tests the examinee's clinical and communication skills through his/her ability to gather information from standardized patients, perform a physical examination, communicate the findings to the patient, and write a patient note.
Minimum score to pass: No score—Pass/Fail (Must pass Integrated Clinical Encounters, Communication and Interpersonal Skills, and Spoken English Proficiency subcomponents).
This two-day exam assess the examinee's ability to apply medical knowledge and the understanding of biomedical and clinical science essential for the unsupervised practice of medicine, with emphasis on patient management in ambulatory settings.

In the suburb where I grew up, I can still picture the house of a younger friend in the cul-de-sac, the split-floor entry, the metal banisters, the dirty carpet. I even especially remember the parent’s bedroom, and the mirror on the door, and I remember it because this is where their kid and I would take turns saying cuss words. We’d stand in the empty house, fourth grade or so, and try out the ones we knew—which, to no surprise, was most of them—watching our faces in the mirror as we said them. It’s funny to think about that now, but also strange how lurid that memory even now seems to surface. The things we do in privacy…
For whatever reason I was thinking about memory, and the staying power of certain past moments, many that seem this inconsequential. What is it that some memories go, no matter how much we will for them to stay, and others stay that seem painful, or seem not to matter at all? And I remembered an essay I read from the great psychoanalyst Adam Phillips, called “On Getting Away with It.” He talks about the power of these particular issues in human life, of “getting away with something, of avoiding what are deemed to be the inevitable consequences of certain actions.” He says these moments are issues because, “if the human subject, as described by psychoanalysis, is a split subject, in conflict, by definition, with himself and others, then getting away with it…is not an option.” In other words, we remember times when we’ve gotten away with something, mostly because our inner-conflicts have not, therefore, been resolved.
“Getting away with it.” Where do we find people saying this? Where does the heist take place, and what have we nicked? Generally, it seems that we have escaped some fate or consequence. If we’ve “got away with” never having kids, we imply that we understood the consequences of what having kids meant, and got to live without it. If we’ve “got away with” an extra day of paid vacation, we got the pleasure of skipping out of work, without the deserved infraction of an unpaid wage. If we’ve “got away with” an affair, we’ve enjoyed the fruits of passion without the price of monogamy. “Getting away with” anything is costless freedom—it is a kink in the chain of cause-and-effect.
‘I won’t be punished’ is both a fear and a wish. Because the other thing getting away brings up, or brings on, are the authorities; if you get away with it, does that mean the authorities don’t really love you, don’t really care about their rules, are in fact quite unable to enforce their rules, are secretly complicit with your breaking them—in short, are not all that they are cracked up to be, cracked up to be by you and yours? If you get away with it, is God impotent, absent or negligent? Cynical, or just biding His time, letting you sweat and boast, but leaving you unsure? After all, when do you know, when do you really know, that you have got away with it, that you can finally relax? Or perhaps God is merciful, or sympathetic, or think you deserve time out, or time off, or whatever He can do with time to make it kinder. Whatever it is, getting away with it is going to make you think, perhaps like nothing else, about the authorities. They are never more present than when you seem to have slipped their attention. When I am having the all too common fantasy of getting away with it, I am thinking about the rules, and how they work and if they work, and what happens to me if they don’t.
Psychologically, Phillips is giving Paul’s Romans 2 recitation, that the secret crimes that only you know about are enough to bring the courtroom in. While “getting away with it” maybe the time where the courtroom is absent, in its absence it is most (inwardly) present. Sometimes, therefore, the punishment sits privately within for years and years, with no avenue for reconciliation. Unlike moments where the punishment has been dealt swiftly with the crime, there is no “sense of an ending.” The payment-loop is not closed and so, “for however long, you are on the open road of unpredictable consequence,” like this 63-year-old woman:
…You could say that external punishment, or at least external acknowledgment—being found out—would have freed you from the burden of guilt and enabled you to void it, to evacuate it by some kind of penitence and reparation. It was a mistake, an error, a falling short of an ideal, and it could have been in some sense recognized as such, and corrected. When someone admits such things in analysis they want to bring their getting away with it to an end. A patient describes in quite lurid detail how, as a ten-year-old child, she stole a friend’s gloves and buried them in the back garden; she describes it with such trepidation and terror that you might think—and we, as analysts, would think—that she had, at least unconsciously, committed a terrible crime. But the terribleness of the crime has been subsumed for her by the terribleness of having never been caught. She left a mystery in the world; her friend’s gloves were lost unaccountably, and even though the world may have mostly forgotten them, this sixty-three-year-old woman has not. The world went on making sense for her because she knew how it happened; but everyone else involved was left with what she called ‘a hole in the net’…you are living a version of a private language. You know the crucial thing, the essential fact; you are not the person supposed to know, you are the person who knows.
…[No one else] will ever know unless they (the sufferers) tire of getting away with it; unless, for some reason, as with the patients I mentioned, a time comes when it seems essential to speak about the experience of getting away with it, which, in itself, brings that experience to an end, in its terminal and irrevocable breach of a hard-won and often hard-worn privacy.
Here is where memory meets law, and begins to make sense, not just from a psychoanalytic frame of mind but, dare I say, a pastoral one. What does one say to a Legion, plagued by the voices of crimes that, in their secrecy, cannot be righted or paid for? How does one reach into the recesses of memory and feel where one has not gotten away with it? It seems that if a minister, or a friend, could do so, it would be there that the weight of such secret guilt could be alleviated by a God who says you have not gotten away with anything, but that all has been paid for. Only then could an undefinable consequence be given the gift of an ending.
What role might a “seared conscience” play in all of this. We all seem to know people who appear remorseless about current (let alone past) indiscretions.
Do they still secretly suffer from the same desire to be found out? Or is there a Romans 1 “God gave them over” type conscience that so suppresses the truth that a person can get to a place where they no longer seek their own guilty verdict?
Howie, that’s an interesting thought. I would think, yes, that remorseless indiscretions are still waiting to be, yearning to be, found out, however subconsciously. Like Augustine said famously, “Our hearts are restless until they rest in thee.” On the other hand, I have to think that the case with all our inner-criminals, that there are–with all of us–both a desire to be found out, and a desire to justify what one has decided consciously to do. Look no further than Walter White…
I love holiday cards. I love giving them, I love receiving them, I love holiday stamps, and I don’t even care if you write Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays or a Festive Festivus, I’m happy to get a card in the mail from you. I hang them up in our dining room, commenting on how children have grown, or so-and-so has moved to another state. I love Christmas letters, even though I don’t write them very often. I know not everyone feels the same. But I love cheap drugstore cards and heavy, fine paper. I am the stationery industry’s dream. I love it all.
When it comes to sending cards, I genuinely enjoy the process of crafting a pretty design with photos of my adorable kiddos on it. I keep a copy of each card and string a ribbon through it, so it becomes a Christmas ornament for our tree for years to come, and then I can comment about how much our own children have grown. This is my sentimental, sweet highlight-reel version of us. I confess I sometimes need that little bit of snapshot perfection to hang so delicately on evergreen branches when I’m in the midst of winter anxiety.
My anxiety doesn’t so much focus on the holiday itself, but if you’d like a little peak into the mental hell that lives between my ears around late December, just google “peak norovirus season emetophobia seasonal affective disorder small children in the house.” Or maybe don’t. Suffice it to say, even with the Prince of Peace about to be born, we still have a lot of waiting to do, and we might as well make some cute cards while we endure it. [My favorite card was the one we sent when our oldest child was almost one year old. I put him in a Santa hat, which he tried to pull off while he cried and made a pathetic face. We captioned it: “Christ was born for this?!” End scene. Big hit.] So the photos, the addresses, the cards, and the stamps are all a nice distraction. I have a google spreadsheet and discounted stamps from Costco – it’s work that’s easy to accomplish while watching Elf.
The difficult part comes when sending a card to someone who might be really mad at me. This year, I’m sending cards to at least two people who have unfriended me on Facebook, a sister who hasn’t spoken to me in nearly two decades, and a friend with whom I had a very painful falling-out four years ago. I’m sending cards to people who are probably upset with me for reasons I don’t even know yet. To be clear, I could get very self-righteous and list the reasons that I should be mad at them, too, but trust me, it’s not worth your time, and not worth mine, either (not that I ever let that stop me from stewing).
These cards are small tokens of vulnerability, sure. I’m not calling up that angry sister on the phone, or knocking on the doors of the friends whom I’ve angered. But I’m sending a flat, 5×7 olive branch of love in their direction, and I have to believe that it’s a small step in the right direction. This is the beginning of the hard work of reconciliation, and even though I get to use a pretty envelope and watch Will Ferrell tower over Bob Newhart while I’m doing it, I kind of hate sending out these difficult season’s greetings. But I’m doing it. This act of teeth-gritting goodwill might stall out somewhere, or it might go in some big reservoir of yuletide affection that someone, somewhere is holding for us until we know what to do with it.
My other favorite tradition this time of year is reading Gail Godwin’s Evensong, which takes place in the season of Advent, and contains this kind of comfort and joy amidst the uncertainties of our imperfect life on earth:
“Surrounded by such uncertainties, whether they play themselves out in a year, or ten, or a thousand, what else can we do but appeal for mercy and protection to a love beyond clocks and calendars and mortal frailties, a love wise and faithful beyond all imagining. Yet somehow, over eons, we have become able to imagine it – in part. And sometimes even to practice it – in brief spurts.”
By sending holiday greetings to those whom I’ve wronged, or have been wronged by (likely both/and), I’m trying to practice that “love wise and faithful beyond all imagining … in brief spurts.”
I don’t expect reconciliation to come from my efforts alone. Reconciliation, and forgiveness, and mercy, and grace, all come from God, and so I’m waiting … waiting … waiting … for that baby in the manger. I can’t type an angry email while I’m affixing labels to cards, and I can’t speak ugly words while I’m licking envelopes, so maybe I can keep myself out of a little bit of trouble with this little project. If I can’t keep myself out of trouble (and let’s face it – I know I can’t), I wait for God, and with God, for Earth to receive her King. My own little heart can prepare Him room by cleaning house of some of the old cobwebs of resentment. And even when I can’t, I know I can count on the Wonderful Counselor, the Prince of Peace to do that for my sad, anxious, messy soul. Let heaven and nature sing…

Juggling is a physical skill involving the manipulation of objects for recreation, entertainment or sport. The most recognizable form of juggling is toss juggling. Juggling can be the manipulation of one object or many objects at the same time, using one or many hands. Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most common props are balls or clubs. Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as knives, fire torches or chainsaws. The term juggling can also refer to other prop-based manipulation skills such as diabolo, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, contact juggling, hooping, and hat manipulation. (source: wikipedia)
The most important aspect of juggling is: You can juggle everywhere, in any country, any climate, indoors and outdoor, alone or within a group, for recreation or to burn extra energy. Juggling is gentle for the joints and it trains all these small muscles you need for good posture and body tension. Also, it taxes your patience, discipline and frustration tolerance. Most people are able to learn to juggle even at advanced ages - doing other motion based sports will help, though.
Moreover, jugglers around the world form a network enabling you to meet people, find friends and get support wherever you are. When I moved to Ulm, I knew only some jugglers here, but my stuff got from the car to the flat in record time. For some years now, jugglers have been my family, spread all over Europe. Among jugglers the words commitment, teamwork and volunteering still mean something (and they don´t mean you will end up doing the work alone). Everyone can be part of this community - being a good juggler is no prerequisite - come as you are!

Do you know when to compensate employees for travel time? Make sure you're compensating correctly and staying in compliance with federal laws.
Many companies do not understand how to compensate an employee properly for time spent traveling to destinations other than a regular work site. Many companies send employees to conferences and other work sites using commercial travel and personal vehicles. This timely topic will enable you to understand how and when to compensate an employee for travel time away from a work site. You will find out how to determine which employees are entitled to travel time pay and at what rate. With air travel being as busy as it is today, it is very important that you understand how to compensate employees when they are delayed as a result of flight cancellations. This important topic will show how critical it is to communicate the rate of pay, the requirements of travel and the travel tracking necessary to compensate the employee properly. Also learn about typical problems that arise with travel and other FLSA issues, such as meals during travel. The focus of this topic is on federal law rather than individual state law.
He mea­sured life in years and fifty-two had gone. Sometimes he thought, on a dif­fer­ent scale, one dri­ven by a num­ber that val­ued rich­ness and ful­fill­ment, but that num­ber was too low for his lik­ing. He had done lit­tle worth remem­ber­ing, and since it didn’t mat­ter, years were used. One lone­ly evening, he wan­dered about his house in search of a pho­to or note worth sav­ing, but found none. From room to room, nei­ther clos­et nor draw­er con­tained any bit of mem­o­ry. He was as new­born. He attempt­ed sleep and failed, leav­ing him to real­ize a past could not be invent­ed. Then a feel­ing set­tled upon him that his life, years after it had begun, was about to begin, and he did sleep–there was a woman in a book­store in the trav­el aisle. In short order they were dis­cussing dream vaca­tions from either side of cap­puc­ci­nos. Not long after, their first trip abroad, his first. More would fol­low. The years flew past faster than he could imag­ine, but he no longer mea­sured his life in years. Richness and ful­fill­ment far obscured his age. He was a hap­py man, not an old­er one. The woman who start­ed it all put her book on the night table, took the pil­low next to his, and they slept togeth­er, his heart fill­ing with the mem­o­ries and dreams, the voy­ages, the far-off lands, the splen­did sights and scenes and spec­tac­u­lar vis­tas, the col­ors, the sounds, the scent of his­to­ry – until final­ly, fatigued by the trav­el, he came to pre­fer home to hotel, receiv­ing post­cards to send­ing, and at that time, at fifty-two, his eyes tight­ly shut, he died a qui­et death. In his sleep. With mem­o­ries.

Trick or treating, dressing in costumes and masks and jack o' lanterns. All these customs originate from ancient traditions. Just why do we ask for candy on October 31st? Why don ghoulish masks and scary outfits? What is it with all those black cats? And just what is the significance of the Jack o' lantern at Halloween?
If you've ever wondered about any of these curious Halloween traditions, then read on for some of the more curious answers.
The origin of Halloween can be traced back to Celtic times and an ancient festival called Samhein (pronounced sow-in).
The race of people known as Celts inhabited Ireland, Great Britain and much of northern France around 200 years ago. For the Celts November 1 was the accepted date associated with the end of summer. The harvest was completed, the days began to grow shorter and the long, cold, dark winter was nearing. Typically winter would see greater numbers of deaths than other times of the year. It was believed that on the eve of the new year, October 31, the spirits of the departed were able to enter the living world. This was celebrated in a festival called Samhain. The Celtic priests, known as Druids were believed to gain more power during this event, which enabled them to “see” more clearly and so make more accurate predictions.
Celebrations included lighting of bonfires where offerings of crops and animals would be made as sacrifices to ensure a bountiful year to come. People wore costumes of animal skins often complete with the head. Fortune-telling was an important part of the festivities.
At the end of the celebrations, the people returned to their homes to re-light their fires, which had been put out prior to the celebrations.
The Romans brought with them two festivals which they incorporated into the Celtic celebrations. Feralia was a day in late October when time was taken as a society to remember departed loved ones. Early in November Romans held a festival in honour of Pomona, the goddess of fruitful abundance. Apples figured large in the celebrations. Pomona is often depicted with a large tray of fruit or a cornucopia. It is easy to see the similarities between these customs and many of today’s Halloween traditions.
With the arrival of Christianity throughout Celtic lands came the need to adapt existing holidays to events, which were more acceptable to the church. It is thought that Pope Boniface IV’s nomination of November 1 as All Saint’s Day in the 7th century was a deliberate move to overshadow a festival which was considered Pagan with a holy day, which could be endorsed by the church. This became known as All-hallows and therefore the night before became known as All-hallows Eve.
According to History.com “Even later, in A.D. 1000, the church would make November 2 All Souls’ Day, a day to honor the dead. It was celebrated similarly to Samhain, with big bonfires, parades, and dressing up in costumes as saints, angels, and devils. Together, the three celebrations, the eve of All Saints’, All Saints’, and All Souls’, were called Hallowmas.”
Pumpkin carving is a popular part of modern America’s Halloween celebration. Come October, pumpkins can be found everywhere in the country from doorsteps to dinner tables. Despite the widespread carving that goes on there every autumn, few Americans really know why or when the jack o’lantern tradition began.
People have been making jack o’lanterns at Halloween for centuries. The practice originated from an Irish myth about a man nicknamed “Stingy Jack”. According to the story, Stingy Jack invited the Devil to have a drink with him. True to his name, Stingy Jack didn’t want to pay for his drink, so he convinced the Devil to turn himself into a coin that Jack could use to buy their drinks. Once the Devil did so, Jack decided to keep the money and put it into his pocket next to a silver cross, which prevented the Devil from changing back into his original form. Jack eventually freed the Devil, under the condition that he would not bother Jack for one year and that, should Jack die, he would not claim his soul. The next year, Jack again tricked the Devil into climbing into a tree to pick a piece of fruit. While he was up in the tree, Jack carved a sign of the cross into the tree’s bark so that the Devil could not come down until the Devil promised Jack not to bother him for ten more years.
Soon after, Jack died. As the legend goes, God would not allow such an unsavory figure into heaven. The Devil, upset by the trick Jack had played on him and keeping his word not to claim his soul, would not allow Jack into hell. He sent Jack off into the dark night with only a burning coal to light his way. Jack put the coal into a carved-out turnip and has been roaming the Earth with it ever since. The Irish began to refer to this ghostly figure as “Jack of the Lantern,” and then, simply “Jack O’Lantern.”
In Ireland and Scotland, people began to make their own versions of Jack’s lanterns by carving scary faces into turnips or potatoes and placing them into windows or near doors to frighten away Stingy Jack and other wandering evil spirits. In England, large beets are used. Immigrants from these countries brought the jack o’lantern tradition with them when they came to the United States. They soon found that pumpkins, a fruit native to America, make perfect jack o’lanterns.
This Halloween why not take your own personalised reusable, very special trick or treat bags that you can use again and again year after year. A simple but special item which will become an integral part of your family's tradition

The total combined diamond weight for this pendant is 1/5 carat. With polished gold whiskers topping off the look, this coy little kitty is simply irresistible. The pendant presents on an 18-inch rope chain, also in 14 karat white gold.
The Celtic Druids eventually came to be viewed as witches, and the subsequent witchcraze led to the horrific murders of vast numbers of women, men, and animals, particularly nocturnal animals, with cats most frequently targeted. It was believed that witches could shapeshift, and that they would most often take the form of cats, which were believed to be their familiars. In some cases cats were thought to be reincarnated witches as well. The widespread slaughter of cats during this time contributed to the human death toll from the black plague, as cats had kept the population of rats that carried plague-bearing fleas under control.
In the UK, black cats were believed to bring good luck, but in North America, the opposite superstition took hold. The association of the Celtic Druids with witchcraft ensured that witches and cats became two of the most enduring Halloween symbols and gave rise to a number of superstitions surrounding black cats in the New World. To this day, there are people who continue to associate black cats with evil.
Back in the Middle Ages it became common practice for the poor to go door to door asking for gifts of food at Hallowmas on November 1 in return for prayers for the dead on All Souls Day the following day. This was known as souling. The practice finds its roots in Ireland and Britain but was also known to have happened as far south as Italy and was mentioned by Shakespeare in his play, The Two Gentlemen of Verona in the line “puling like a beggar at Hallowmas.”
In 19th century Scotland the practice of guising on All Saints Eve involved revellers door-knocking in costume and being rewarded with gifts of cakes, fruit and money for their efforts.
According to Wikipedia “The earliest known use in print of the term “trick or treat” appears in 1927, from Blackie, Alberta:
Hallowe’en provided an opportunity for real strenuous fun. No real damage was done except to the temper of some who had to hunt for wagon wheels, gates, wagons, barrels, etc., much of which decorated the front street. The youthful tormentors were at back door and front demanding edible plunder by the word “trick or treat” to which the inmates gladly responded and sent the robbers away rejoicing.” ”
I actually didn't know anything about Halloween so this was very informative. I allow my kids to dress up for Halloween but we usually go to the church for a "Trunk or Treat" instead of door to door, you don't have to walk as far and you're guaranteed lots of candy.. ha ha ha
Thanks! I learned a lot about the traditions of Halloween. It's one of my favorite holidays because of the transition to cooler weather and fall nesting. I love the colors and the symbols, not so much the commercial aspects of it. When the temperature is in triple digits and stores are already displaying Halloween cards, there is a disconnect.

GE Oil & Gas is to supply gas turbine-driven compressor train technology to Malaysia’s national oil and gas company Petronas for a floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility that is being developed for use about 180 kilometers off the coast of Bintulu, in Sarawak.
The start-up of the FLNG facility is scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2015. It will be designed to produce 1.2 million tons a year (mtpa) of LNG, and boost Malaysia’s total LNG production capacity to 26.9 mtpa, from the current 25.7 mtpa.
GE was awarded the contract with Petronas primarily on the basis of its technology as well as its experience in the LNG and offshore sectors. The order also takes advantage of GE’s global frame agreement with Petronas.
“This contract with Petronas underscores the confidence that gas producers have in our compressor technology to support the global LNG industry—including for one of the world’s first FLNG projects that represents an important growth initiative for our respective companies,” said Prady Iyyanki, president and CEO—turbomachinery for GE Oil & Gas. “We look forward to working with Petronas and its project partners to demonstrate how FLNG can help address Malaysia’s energy needs.”
GE compression trains are vital elements of the liquefaction process, which cools natural gas to a liquid state. GE’s scope of equipment supply includes four of its PGT25+G4 gas turbine generator systems, two PGT25+G4 gas turbine driven compressor units and two electric motor driven centrifugal compressors modules. GE is scheduled to deliver its equipment to Malaysia in August 2013.
GE Oil & Gas has a long relationship with Petronas that dates back to the Malaysia LNG project, about 20 years ago.
GE Oil & Gas and Brazilian energy company Petrobras have signed the world’s largest subsea wellhead production contract, worth nearly US$1.1Bn. This includes the delivery of approximately 380 subsea wellhead systems and installation tools needed in oil well exploration, and more than 75 percent of the parts will be made in Brazil.
GE announced the award of the contract at the 2012 Rio Oil & Gas being held September 17-20 in Rio de Janeiro.
“This new agreement between two of the world’s largest companies shows our commitment to collaborate in the development of the oil and gas sector in Brazil,” said João Geraldo Ferreira, president and CEO of GE Oil & Gas for Latin America. “In recent years our investments and efforts have been focused on preparing our company to support market growth and to be ready for contracts of this size, developing the entire supply chain. We want to grow with the country.”
“The new contract builds on our existing relationship with Petrobras and follows previous successful projects,” said Rod Christie, vice president of GE Oil & Gas Subsea Systems. In 2009, GE Oil & Gas and Petrobras signed what was then the biggest wellhead contract in history to date (in terms of number of wellheads), worth US$250 million.
“Through the acquisition of VetcoGray in 2007 and Wellstream in 2011 and ongoing investments in technology, GE has become an established player in the offshore industry,” said Christie. “With more than 5,000 subsea employees operating in more than 50 countries we are supporting some of the industry’s largest and most challenging projects.”
Petrobras plans to install the subsea wellhead systems in various oil and gas fields in Brazil, including sub-salt. The equipment will be produced at the GE plant in Jandira (São Paulo), where GE has invested US$30m to expand production capacity.
“The Jandira facility has been crucial in allowing GE Oil & Gas to provide world-class technology and has prioritized Brazilian-based production, which is a critical component in local social and economic growth,” said Fernando Martins, president of Subsea Systems for GE in Latin America. In the last 30 years, more than 1,200 GE wellhead systems and 180 subsea Christmas trees have been produced and installed in Brazil.
Petrobras is an integrated energy company that operates in 27 countries on five continents. It is a world leader in deepwater and ultra-deepwater oil production and operates approximately 100 production platforms, 15 refineries, 30,000 kilometers of pipelines and more than 6,000 service stations.
GE Oil and Gas is committed to business growth in Brazil and continues to invest in new capacity to take on orders and new industry demands. The US$30 million invested in Jandira (SP) was used for capacity expansion and modernization of the operation. In Niterói (Rio de Janeiro), GE is investing US$200m to expand its flexible line plant, to serve the new sub-salt fields.
In June 2012, GE announced the completion of the US$32m expansion of its plant in Macaé (Rio de Janeiro), tripling the size of the facility and making it GE Oil & Gas’s most modern subsea system services provider in the world. This expansion increased the workforce at the site by 150%.

Just two months after the contract was signed with the private equity firm Panda Power Funds for the turnkey supply of a natural-gas-fired combined-cycle power plant in Temple, Texas, Siemens has been awarded a second order by the same customer for an identical project in the city of Sherman. Siemens will supply the plant in consortium with its partner Bechtel. The order volume including a long-term service agreement is approximately USD300 million. The power station with a gross installed electrical capacity of 758 megawatts (MW) will be able to supply the power needs of approximately 750,000 homes in the North Texas area.

The Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) Consortium met in Hull, UK, for a quarterly meeting to discuss their latest research and administrative business. The ASM Consortium is an industry organization that includes a wide range of industrial manufacturers, vendors, and universities. The members of ASM have been collaborating for nearly 20 years to address process safety challenges by pioneering innovative automation solutions and operational excellence best practices for managing abnormal situations in industrial facilities. The consortium’s Quarterly Review Meeting (QRM) serves as a platform for members to share ASM best practices and discuss new challenges faced in plant operations.
The meeting had two key aspects: firstly a visit to BP’s Hull facility, and secondly a workshop around the impact of procedures on abnormal situations. BP has invested in good human factors practices including control room design, operator interface, alarm rationalization and operator training at its Hull facility.
In addition, consortium members and guest speakers discussed how human factors relate to abnormal situation management, and ways it could improve plant safety and efficiency. Julie Bell, from the UK Health and Safety Laboratory, discussed challenges in assessing high-reliability organizations, adoption of best practices in human factors and assessing human error in process hazard analysis. Dr. C Marijke Gordijn, from the University of Groningen, discussed the impact of lighting on operator performance and health. Other presentations included: “Digital Oil Fields,” “Alarm Enforcement” and “Progress on ISA106.”
“Human performance is critical to plant safety. To continue to reduce the impact of poor human performance on safety, we need to continue to improve approaches to operator training, development and use of procedures, and operator interaction with control systems including alarm,” said Andrew Ogden-Swift, Development and Deployment Lead for the ASM Consortium. “User centered design of facilities and systems will lead to safer and more efficient plants.”
The ASM Consortium started in 1994 to address customer concerns about the high cost of incidents at their plants such as unplanned shutdowns, fires, explosions, or emissions, and this was termed Abnormal Situation Management. An injection of funding from NIST enabled the consortium to spend several years researching and developing highly-advanced concepts to address the problem of abnormal situations. Since then, research has continued and increasing effort has been put into development and deployment of ASM solutions that incorporate ASM knowledge.
The basis of the ASM Consortium is collaboration and information-sharing. By working together, members achieve far more than they could working alone. Research results are published for members, and often further shared by means of webinars, seminars and workshops. User members also guide Honeywell in selection and development of product solutions that incorporate ASM knowledge. Non-members can benefit from ASM Research as ‘ASM Effective Practices Guidelines for Alarm Management’, ‘Display Design’ and ‘Procedural Practices’ are available for purchase on Amazon.com.

Yokogawa Electric Korea Co has won an order from Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co to supply a control system for an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant. This is the first IGCC plant in South Korea and it is being constructed in Taean, South Chungcheong Province, by Korea Western Power Co, a subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corporation.
This IGCC power plant will have a total output of 300 MW. Following a commissioning period that will commence in December 2015, the plant will begin commercial operation. This order is for the Centum VP integrated production control system, which will control the gasification section, a core plant facility. This order also includes the ProSafe-RS safety instrumented system, which will be used to shut down the gasification section safely in the event of an emergency. Both systems will be delivered in December 2013.
IGCC is a promising next-generation power technology that relies on high temperature and pressure to convert coal to synthesis gas (syngas) for use in gas turbine generators. The exhaust from the turbines is sent to boilers to generate steam, and additional power is generated by steam turbines. This type of plant is thus more efficient than a conventional coal-fired power plant.
Yokogawa Electric Korea was able to win this order because of the high reliability of Yokogawa’s control systems and its excellent engineering capabilities. Founded in 1978, Yokogawa Electric Korea has been offering highly reliable solutions to customers for over 30 years, and has become a top manufacturer of control systems and sensors in its home market. It established a power plant department in 2008 that has been actively promoting sales in the power market. Encouraged by the success in winning this order, Yokogawa will expand this business by offering appropriate solutions to developers of innovative technologies that generate power more efficiently and have less of an impact on the environment.
ABB has won orders totaling $140 million from Vale S.A. to supply automation and electrical equipment for the world’s largest iron ore project investment, which comprises in the development of a mine and a processing plant located in Brazil.
Located in the Amazon region in northern Brazil, the Carajás Serra Sul S11D project, comprising the mine and processing plant, represents an $8 billion total investment. The project is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2016 and Vale is expecting the issuance of the project’s implementation license in the first half of 2013.
The project will use shiftable conveyor belts instead of off-highway trucks to transport the iron ore from the mine to the processing plant. This is the first time a “truckless” solution will be used on a large scale at an iron ore mine. Truckless systems significantly reduce operating costs and produce lower carbon emissions. If the S11D mine were to be operated using trucks, it would need around 100 off-highway trucks and consume 77% more diesel per year.
For comparison, Vale’s Northern system, located in Carajás, produced 110 million tons in 2011; S11D will have an estimated nominal capacity of 90 million tons per year after the ramp up phase is concluded.
Increased development of mineral resources and mining technologies across the globe represent a key global mega-trend that is an important focus area for ABB’s long-term growth. This project profits from ABB’s deep understanding of advanced solutions for the mining industry.
“This unprecedented project will use the latest ABB automation technologies to truly create the mine of the future, a benchmark in terms of productivity, safety and sustainability,” said Veli-Matti Reinikkala, head of ABB’s Process Automation division. “The project will allow Vale to increase production by approximately 90 million tons, while substantially reducing emissions and improving operational efficiency and process safety.”
ABB will provide the automation and electrification to transport the ore into the processing plant, and will completely automate all plant processes. The order includes a centralized 800xA control system for processing operations, so that personnel can be located away from the site, for improved safety and continued production. ABB’s solution also enables the automatic recovery and piling of iron ore by controlling and positioning equipment through satellite signal and via GPS, and by using 3D scanning for field screening.
ABB will also provide electrical infrastructure for the new processing plant, related energy distribution equipment for reliable and consistent power supply, and engineering and installation services. The delivery includes medium and low voltage motors for use with frequency converters, the primary power transmission stations, duplication of the telecom system for the railroad and 37 secondary substations in self-contained E-Houses (electrical houses).
New Delhi, June 8 (IANS) The task force on shell companies set up by the government has identified more than 2.25 lakh such firms which will be removed from the register of companies in the current financial year, an official statement said on Friday.
A Finance Ministry release here said that in the 2017-18 fiscal ended March, the registrar of companies (ROC) removed the names of over 2.26 lakh companies from its register and disqualified 3.09 lakh directors.
“During financial year 2017-18, ROCs identified and removed from the register of companies the names of 2,26,166 companies, while 3,09,619 directors were disqualified,” it said.
“A second drive is to be launched during the current financial year 2018-19. A total of 2,25,910 companies have been identified for being struck-off under section 248 of the Companies Act.”
The task force under the joint chairmanship of the Finance and Corporate Affairs Secretaries had been constituted last year. It has compiled a database of shell companies by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office, the statement said.
“The ex-directors/authorized signatories of the struck-off companies have been restricted from operating the bank accounts of these companies and they cannot withdraw any amount from these bank accounts, other than for specified purposes, till the company is restored u/s 252 of the Companies Act,” it added.
Chandigarh, July 3 (IANS) Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday ordered investigation into the recent spate of drug-related deaths in the state and directed that stringent action be taken against those found guilty, without considering their political affiliations.
Nearly 35 deaths have been reported in the state in the past one month itself due to drugs abuse and drugs overdose.
The probe was ordered after some social activists met the Chief Minister on Tuesday to highlight the rampant drugs abuse in the state.
The probe order came just a day after the Punjab cabinet on Monday resolved to recommend, to the to the Union Government, death penalty for drug smugglers and peddlers.
Describing drug abuse as a disease requiring treatment, the Chief Minister stressed on the need for rehabilitation of the victims and for making the anti-drug campaign a people’s movement.
Amarinder Singh, who had in 2016 taken a religious vow to wipe out drugs from Punjab within four weeks of coming to power has not been able to deliver on the promise through the government that he heads in Punjab since March 2017.
The opposition AAP and Shiromani Akali Dal have criticized the Congress government for failing to fulfill its promise on curbing drugs abuse in Punjab.
Drugs abuse is rampant, particularly among youth and rural population, in Punjab for the past over two decades.
Los Angeles, Aug 12 (IANS) Singer Britney Spears’ first single “…Baby one more time” will complete 20 years this October. Recalling that moment, she said it was such a fun and crazy time.
“Wow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur,” Spears told The Guardian.
She said: “The whole song is about the stress that we all go through as teens, I knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, but I don’t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.”
After hearing a demo of the song, written by Max Martin, in New York, Spears agreed to go to Sweden to record the track, as well as a handful of the album’s other singles.
“I think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time,” Spears added.
Released on October 23, 1998, “…Baby one more time” became a huge hit and till date, has sold over 10 million copies.

Kannur (Kerala), April 24 (IANS) A woman was arrested here on Tuesday night after she confessed of killing her parents and her nine-year-old daughter by poisoning them in a gap of four months this year, police said.
Soumya was taken for questioning when she was convalescing at a state run hospital near here after being admitted for nausea and indigestion – incidentally the same symptoms that her parents and her elder daughter suffered before they died.
While her mother died on March 7, her father passed away on April 13, her daughter died on January 31. However, following a complaint from a relative, the body of the child was exhumed after rat poison was found in the viscera of her parents.
According to police, Soumya however denied of any role in the death of her one year old daughter in 2012.
Incidentally this incident happened in the home village of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and it was only after his intervention did the police speeden their investigation.
The woman was separated from her husband and according to police, her motive was that her parents and child were “impediments to her wayward life”.

Lauren . 20 . YorkshireWelcome to my Huggled, a beauty and lifestyle blog written by a student nurse.
Yesterday I asked Jonathan Chait about a characterization of Gerald Ford that Chait had included in his Los Angeles Times’ column Sunday about President Ford:
In Ford’s time, to be a conservative meant to be cautious and prudent. Ford opposed deficits, and he vetoed spending hikes and tax cuts alike. His recently released comments criticizing the Iraq war (made in a 2004 interview but embargoed until after his death) show how alien he found the current president’s reckless foreign policy. In his post-presidential career, Ford emerged as a critic of the religious right and an advocate of political reforms, both of which placed him far to the left of today’s GOP.
Gerald Ford as an example of a “good” conservative versus George W. Bush as a “radical” is a meme the left loves to promote, and of course it is absurd.
I asked Jonathan for evidence for this and other assertions, but none has been forthcoming. I did get this e-mail:
I couldn’t find anything either, so if Ford “emerged as a critic of the religious right,” he did so in the same way as he “emerged” as a critic of the Iraq war –in a way that the ordinary conventions of journalism cannot authenticate.
Perhaps Jonathan has a secret stash of Ford denunciations of Jerry Falwell, but my guess is he “recalled” this as being the case and ran with it –confusing Barry Goldwater and his late-in-life denunciations of the religious right. with Gerry Ford’. Barry, Gerry –you can see how any serious journalist could make that mistake.

After a stirring discussion with the publisher of Huntington News Network about a documentary film on Iran's desire to be a nuclear power -- a prospect that scares the you-know-what out of dozens of nations in the Middle East and Europe -- I swore to him in an e-mail that I would stay away from controversial subjects, and concentrate on book reviews and other non-controversial subjects.
The same day I made this resolution, I couldn't resist rearing up and blogging after seeing my congressman's latest rant. My congressman is a national figure, Ron Paul, R-TX, and I'm a proud supporter of this man who represents 651,000 residents of coastal Texas, from Galveston south almost to Corpus Christi. I voted for his re-election in both 2008 and 2010. We moved to Port Lavaca, Calhoun County, Texas, in July 2008 after living since 1992 in West Virginia.
I've long believed that our so-called foreign aid is a form of corruption, for both us and the recipients. I'm opposed on principle to foreign aid and I include democracies like Israel in this category. Israel is a prosperous First World country and doesn't need money from us -- money we've borrowed from competitors and potential enemies. In the case of one of these lenders, China, we've already fought them directly in Korea and by proxy in Southeast Asia.
Speaking of Israel's economic standing based on per capita income, the true or false political site Truth-O-Meter examined a comment by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Ron's son, who called himself a supporter of Israel, but one who wants to end aid to the country. Rand Paul said a few days ago that Israel's "per capita income is greater than probably three-fourths of the rest of the world. Should we be giving free money or welfare to a rich nation? I don't think so."
Truth-O-Meter found that "If you consider purchasing power, in 2009 Israel was No. 25 on the list of countries, with per capita income of $27,110. No. 1 was Luxembourg with $59,550. The United States was No. 5 with $45,640. If you don't consider purchasing power, Israel is No. 23, at $25,790. On this measure, Norway is No. 1 at $84,640, and the United States is No. 8 at $46,360. Either way, Israel makes the top 40, which puts it in the top 25 percent of the World Bank listings. We find Paul's statement True" based on the 192 nations who are members of the United Nations.
So it was with pride and pleasure that I read Ron Paul's latest "Texas Straight Talk", where he had the good sense to agree with my position! Following is the complete text of this important statement. I voted for Ron Paul for president in 1988 when he ran on the Libertarian Party ticket and I'd vote for him again in a Texas minute:
By Ron Paul The events in Egypt of late have captured the attention of the world as many thousands of Egyptians take to the streets both in opposition to and favor of the current regime. We watch from a distance hoping that events do not spiral further into violence which will destroy lives and threaten the livelihoods of average Egyptians caught up in the political turmoil. I hope that Egyptians are able to work toward a more free and just society. Unfortunately, much of the blame for the unrest in Egypt and the resulting instability in the region rests with U.S. foreign policy over the past several decades. The U.S. government has sent more than $60 billion to the Egyptian regime since the Camp David accords in 1978 to purchase stability, including more security for the state of Israel. We see now the folly of our interventionist foreign policy. Not only has that stability fallen to pieces, with the current unrest, but the years of propping up the corrupt regime in Egypt has led the people to increase their resentment of both America and Israel. We are both worse off for the decades of the intervention in Egypt's internal affairs. I wish I could say that we have learned our lesson and will no longer attempt to purchase or rent friends in the Middle East, but I am afraid that is being too optimistic. Already we see evidence that while the U.S. historically propped up the Egyptian regime, we also provided assistance to groups opposed to the regime. So we have lost the credibility to claim today that we support the self-determination of the Egyptian people. Our double dealing has not endeared us to the Egyptians who now seek to reclaim their independence and national dignity. Diplomacy via foreign aid transfer payments only makes us less safe at home and less trusted overseas, but the overriding reality is that we simply cannot afford to continue a policy of buying friends. We face an ongoing and potentially deepening recession at home, so how can we justify to the underemployed and unemployed in the United States the incredible cost of maintaining a global empire? Moral arguments aside, we must stop sending hundreds of billions of dollars to foreign governments when our own economy is in shambles. American media and talking heads repeatedly pose the same loaded questions. Should the administration encourage the Egyptian president to remain or to resign? Should the U.S. ensure Mohamed ElBaradei or current Vice President Omar Suleiman succeed current president Mubarak? The best answer to these questions is that we should just do nothing, as Eisenhower did in 1956. We should leave Egypt for Egyptians to figure out. Some may claim that this is isolationism. Nothing could be further from the truth. We should enthusiastically engage in trade, allow travel between countries, but we should stay out of their internal affairs. We are in fact more isolated from Egypt now than ever because the regime we propped up appears to be falling. We have isolated ourselves from the Egyptian people by propping up their government as we isolate ourselves from the Tunisians, Israelis, and other recipients of foreign aid. Their resentment of our interventionist foreign policy makes us less safe because we lose our authority to conduct meaningful diplomacy when unpopular regimes fall overseas. We also radicalize those who resented our support for past regimes. Let us hope for a more prosperous and peaceful era for the Egyptians and let us learn the lessons of our 30 year Egyptian mistake.

In a world of ever-changing trends, knowing what to wear to flatter your shape can be a challenge. YouBeauty’s Style Expert, celebrity stylist Sam Saboura, gives you basic style tips to live by, so you know how to look your best no matter what’s in style.Fashion is a tool—like makeup or hairstyles—to create a look you love. “You can change your clothing to have a positive effect on your body,” Saboura says. “You want to contrast what your body is telling you. If your body is soft, add structure; if it’s angular, add softness. The whole idea is to create balance.”
Common pitfalls. “You have a slender upper body, so your instinct might be to show it off with slim-fitting shirts,” says Saboura. Resist the urge! Tiny tops throw off your body’s balance, making your bottom look bigger than it is.
Tops When you think about tops, think layers. Creating balance for your shape is all about filling out your upper half. “A cardigan is your best friend,” says Saboura, because it adds lightweight volume. For cooler weather, try cropped jackets that stop at the waist (channel Jackie O. for inspiration). Don’t be afraid to show a little skin, too. Three-quarter sleeves, wide scoop necks, and one-shoulder tops all look great on you.
Bottoms Boot-cut pants are best for your body. “The slight flare helps to balance out curves, especially if you wear them with a heel to give your legs a little length,” Saboura suggests. Go for dark, medium-rise jeans with simple stitching and pockets in the back. For skirts and dresses, try a classic A-line cut that falls softly over your curves and highlights your trim waist. Avoid high waists and pleated skirts—they’re made for filling out figureless femmes.
Fabrics and Flair Draw the eye up with bright colors and embellished tops. Saboura says, “Try a boatneck shirt with horizontal stripes,” or a cardigan with rosette detailing. Chunky jewelry can work well for you too, adding interest up top. Prints and patterns are fine for your lower body, but aim for darker colors.
Common pitfalls. “Circles often try to cover up their bodies,” says Saboura, “but that’s the opposite of what they should do.” Showing off your neckline, forearms and a little leg (just a little!) looks elegantly classy—not to mention younger, longer and leaner.
Tops Your body is soft and round, so your goal is to add structure, especially on top. Try a structured jacket (like a blazer). “Draw angles and lines across your body with wrap dresses or asymmetrical hemlines,” suggests Saboura. Draped fabrics, cowl necks and flutter sleeves look great on you, too, for a feminine flourish. If you feel like you need more support, layer with a dressy tank top that has a bit of lycra.
Bottoms You’ve got great legs, so show ’em off! A slim, straight leg or bootcut is perfect for you, and wearing a heel “takes off a little weight and shows off your legs,” says Saboura. Dresses with ruching or gathering hide the tummy, creating an hourglass effect.
Fabrics and Flair Prints and patterns look great on you, especially on your upper body. Go for large floral or geometric prints to flatter your figure—small prints won’t do the trick. Stick to weighty fabrics (like heavy cotton, wool or muslin) that have more natural structure.
Best features: Big breasts, a slim waist and curvy hips make your figure the crème de la crème of feminine beauty.
Common pitfalls. Your figure has natural allure, so you may be tempted to give too much away. “Everyone is trying to mimic the hourglass curve, but you’ve already got it,” Saboura says. “Show off a bit, but don’t give away all your curves.”
Tops Simplicity is key for you. Look for clean, simple tops with scoop necklines and three-quarter sleeves. Avoid layering, and look for waist belts that help define your tiny tummy. You look best in princess seams—long, shapely seams that gather in at the waist and flare out again at the hips—that have a smooth, snug look and show off your contours. Fitted jackets look great on you, but “they need to be really well tailored,” says Saboura. “Choose jackets that nip in at the waist and flair out, like a poplin jacket.”
Bottoms You look best in skirts that stop at or below the knee, not above it. Pencil skirts look great on you, as do bootleg pants and skinny jeans. Choose pants or skirts that follow your natural curve, and go for fitted options (but not too tight). “Embrace your silhouette,” says Saboura. “The sexiness is in seeing the curve, not giving it all away.”
Fabrics and Flair Keep it simple with solid colors. Prints can disguise your figure, rather than highlight it. The same goes for fabrics. Avoid extra fabric and draping, and opt for a bit of stretch. Color looks great on your body type, but monochromatic outfits look best (think: Mad Men’s Joan Holloway).
Common pitfalls. You have a naturally sporty look, so you may tend to choose simple, fitted cuts. “That can actually make you look boxy,” Saboura says. Instead, you want to use clothing to soften your body and create curves.
Tops When choosing a shirt, “avoid adding more square or straight lines,” Saboura advises. Instead, complement your natural lines with asymmetrical or rounded hemlines, and ruffle details. Halters look great on you, as do boatnecks and off-the-shoulder shirts. Since your body is naturally athletic, you’ll look more feminine in tank tops with a thin, delicate strap. The same goes for jackets and blazers: Look for soft shoulders and steer clear of boxy, cropped jackets.
Bottoms High-waist pants look fantastic on you, as do wide leg trousers. Both add curves and volume to your lower body. “If you want to embrace a more masculine shape with a boyfriend jean, go for it,” says Saboura. “But put some drape and movement on top.” For a ladylike look, wrap dresses look great on you, since they draw angles and lines across the body.
Fabrics and Flair Use fabric to add softness and femininity to your look. Opt for lace, silk or lightweight fabrics, especially ones with natural draping. Embellished shirts and ruffle details add softness and give your body a bit more, well, body.
Common pitfalls. Your legs are typically well-sculpted, so your instinct may be to show them off with fitted leggings. That works if you’re wearing a long top (below your booty), but in general, you want to add volume to your lower half.
Tops You look great in cowl necks and deep V-necks that help minimize a stronger upper body. Go for simple, fuss-free shirts (no ruffles!). For feminine flair, tops with gently draped fabric or flutter sleeves add movement and softness. Embrace your inner flapper, and rock a drop-waist dress—a look that few can pull off!
Bottoms You want to amplify your lower half to match the fullness of your upper body. Choose wide-leg pants or long skirts to create balance. As a general rule, look for flowy, full-bodied pants and skirts that make your lower body look bigger (yes, that’s a good thing).
Fabrics and Flair “Have fun with embellished, detailed shoes to call attention down,” suggests Saboura. (A reason to buy shoes? Umm, yes please!) The same goes for jewelry: Keep jewelry minimal on top, but get creative with bangles and rings to accessorize an outfit. Choose light colors and prints below the belt, and stick to darker colors on top for a more balanced look. Also, consider the size of your purse. “A small purse will amplify your torso,” Saboura explains. “Carry larger purses at your side or in the bend of your arm to avoid adding volume on top.”

Before we start today I have to thank Colleen, Tim and now Tom & Joe for the blog posts they sent and Deirdre posted. Your way to kind and if your not careful you are going to get me far to emotional to finish this ride. I love you all and see you in Boston.
Well the ‘Red Roof Inn’proved to be way to close to the railway and I 90 for me and I was sat in Denny’s at 4:50 am. The bonus was that it is a 24 hour Denny’s so I could go and get an early breakfast and a lot of coffee that early. When 7:00 am finally arrived and we headed out I took the front and put the pedal down a bit. It was cold and I don’t do cold very well so I thought if I pushed the pace a bit I would at least get warm. I did warm up but I also ended up riding alone again this time at the front, Oh well.
We followed the train lines and the Mohawk Valley which also (I think) has the Erie Canal running through it. This made for a relatively flat ride for most of the morning. Eventually we did turn a little north and climbed a bit but nothing to write home about. Again today was more about your head than your legs. It is funny but now I am not trying to think of the end as I don’t want to lose focus on a really big day tomorrow and a long day on Thursday. In the early days I wanted to think about the finish so it made it feel like a shorter journey. Tomorrow we climb around 5,400 ft over 75 miles with a 16.8% (steep) hill in there somewhere so its not over yet. Yet I do think that now I am a different cyclist that left from Florida in early May and worried about climbing up to Flagstaff. Tomorrow it will be slow but steady as I have learned to do before. Embrace the climb and the pain until it’s over and the satisfaction kicks in.
Tonight I met another WM’er at the hotel, Pete Skinner. It again gives me great hope to meet another WM’er looking so fit and healthy. Pete goes kayaking and is just getting fit for a new bike so WM is not holding him back either. As I have said before, knowing that there is a small WM community out there sharing, supporting and helping each other is comforting for me now being a relative newbie to this Lymphoma thing.
Well there will be a lot more to say about the ride over the next few days when hopefully I can say I rode across America EFI. I will keep the blog going a short spell after the ride as I am sure that on reflection I will realize a lot more about what I just did. Tonight however I have to rest as tomorrow is a big day and with at least one 6.5 mile climb I am going to need some energy to finish this thing off.
Thanks to everyone for all of the support, kind words and donations. I will be pulling on all those things tomorrow to get me over this last hurdle before we can start to think of coasting into Boston on Friday.

Instagram is an application for smartphones which was first released in 2010 and was later acquired by Facebook. The company was founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who both graduated from Stanford University. Users, who are at least 13 years of age are allowed to use the Instagram app.
The purpose of Instagram is to offer a social media service to its users through image and video sharing and, lately, also the possibility to share a „story“ with one’s followers. The story sharing idea was first invented by Snapchat, another social media app. Although the main purpose of Instagram is to post pictures for others to see, one original key feature is the possibility to edit pictures with filters and other effects. Furthermore, pictures can be tagged with hashtags, which can then be used to search the network for other content under the same hashtag.
Although it is possible to create dedicated Instagram profiles, one can also connect Instagram to an existing social media account, such as Facebook or Twitter. Through Instagram Direct, content can be shared with other users of Instagram or also a group of users. Also, a messaging function is included in the app, which allows basic chat activities. As mentioned above, Instagram introduced the feature of „Stories“, which allow a user to combine a series of posts into said story. This story will disappear from the news feed within 24 hours and works as its role model from Snapchat. The more users follow a certain profile, the larger the reach of the profile becomes. Through double-tapping a picture it is being „liked“ and will appear on the liking person’s friends‘ news feed for them to see. Hence, the social network is created and interests are being shared among friends and followers.
Influencers use opinion leaders with a high reach community for marketing and communication purposes. The aim is to increase the value and credibility of your brand message based on the confidence of the respective target group in the influencers.
Influencer Marketing is all about attracting brand or product advocates who are in demand as experts in specific areas. Influencers can thus exert influence on the evaluation and assessment of products, services, brands, companies or employers, for example.
As a result of this influence on consumer decisions, a large proportion of German companies already use influencers to spread their brand messages. Another reason for the interest of the companies is that the range of some Instagram stars is enormously high, as follower figures in the multi-digit million range show. However, the obvious influence of classical influencers with high followers is already evident in so-called micro influencers with up to 30,000 followers. The reasons for this are that some of them have higher campaign engagement rates and, above all, are more cost effective for companies.
Through the development of Instagram over the years and the constantly growing user base approaching the one billion mark, marketers have recognized the marketing potential that is coming with the success of single users on Instagram, who have millions of users following them. The commercialization concept behind social media marketing is called influencer marketing, because the persons posting to their broad follower base have a much higher degree of influence to their followers and, hence, the advertisement is much better targeted at the potential customer segment already. This makes marketing expenditures much more efficient since no resources are lost for marketing measures that target a broad audience, hence, also persons who are not potential customers. Following, the conversion rate for highly targeted marketing measures through influencer marketing is a lot higher, creating more revenue from the equal resource expenditures.
If you are new to Instagram, you will of course try to build organic reach first. So post something classic and then hope that the photo gets many likes and comments. The classic ways to reach more followers are as follows:
Content is king, in this case photos. When an impressive photo is uploaded, it is automatically clicked by followers. Minimalist images and unusual perspectives are just two of the many ways for successful Instagram photos.
Hashtags: in no other social network are hashtags as important as on Instagram. With the right words, one can automatically increase the reach.
The right time for a post: Early in the morning or late at night? During the week or on weekends? The right time to post content is often underestimated. Many instagramers swear by the late afternoon and evening.
Like and consequences: accounts that might be interested in your content and offers. Liking and commenting on the photos of other profiles also helps.
Influencer Marketing: as already mentioned, a few Instagram Influencers at the beginning. Influencer Marketing can also draw attention to your Instagram profile. High reach Instagram users then promote your product or refer to your account. However, it is questionable how many new followers this strategy will bring you in the long term.
However, all these methods have two major disadvantages: they are extremely time-consuming and one only gets new followers very slowly. It can take years to reach a significant number of subscribers to an account.
It’s always about perception. Many people look at the number of followers first when considering whether they should follow a particular account. This is a common measure of how brands measure the success of their instagram activities. Have you thought about buying Instagram followers yourself? Then maybe that’s because you want to quickly win 1,000 followers to get the ball rolling. And maybe you are considering that these fake followers will inspire real people to deal with your brand. It is all very well to officially bet on quality instead of quantity – but many people judge an Instagram account by its number of followers. It’s also easy and affordable to buy Instagram followers, as explained in the next part:
An alternative to the tedious collection of organic likes and followers are purchased followers. If one wants to quickly increase the number of followers in a short time in order to achieve more range, then one should think about buying Likes. And one doesn’t have to worry that the account will be blocked or deleted.
Followers for sale are usually registered in exchange networks and receive a consideration for their subscriptions. One can get 100 followers for a few Euros. If one has purchased followers, the order is normally processed with a few hours or days and the Instagram profile will receive the desired number of followers.
One will benefit from this decision in the long term. Because with purchased Followers one can increase the range of an Instagram account considerably in a short time. The more people follow the account or company, the more attractive the profile will be (provided, of course, that appealing content is posted regularly). Once one hasreached a certain number of followers, the number of fans continues to grow automatically. Posts will then also receive more likes. And thanks to the higher visibility, the conversion rate also improves. If one wants to increase the engagement rate of posts even further, then one should also buy likes in addition of followers.

As you can probably see, I didn't finish the page, and it’s kinda crappy. I've been bedridden for the past few days; some sort of future ultra flu that wants’ to claim my life. So sometime later Friday I'll complete the shading and lighting, but right now I think I'll stick my head in the toilet and let my brain juice drain out. Half an update is better then no update, right?
Ok and now for my comment I wanted to make..... I guess Loth doesn't understand friendship does she?
I hope you recover fast! and i hope's nothing serious enough to really claim your life... the show must go on!
@ Guest - No she does not have any pants. As you may not know pants have the tendency to turn into furocious, evil displacer beasts that enjoy devouring the flesh off living creatures when female Treori wear them.
And thus, the image is made better. Don't worry folks I'm already on the spring back, Captain Trips won't get me! A few of the other webcomics I read in the past have missed updates due to illness, I always wonder how sick you had to be to not to be able to update. Now I know.
@EFlint It's a testament to your strength of character and your commitment to your readers i appluaded your dedication sir
As to Loth either she's recounting when Ralidant cuddled up to her to warm her up or she was barely consious when he picked her up and carried her to their current location
come on, did you honestly think a fantasy webcomic staring a half human half lizard/dragon/epic creature of some sort WOULDN'T cater to the furries at least once? their question probably isn't why doesn't she own any pants apparently, it's why WOULD she own pants...hey, someone had to point out that furries exist...I REGRET NOTHING
@rebelion, honestly between the two of us. I'm the furry. If you've not heard I have a furaffinity account, and have had one for years, by the same name. It took considerable pressure to get Eric to draw loth. I'll be interested to see his take on minotaurs.
And on the subject of pants its not that she doesn't own/wear them its that this particular outfit doesn't have them. It was hard to tell in the first few chapters, prior to jail, but she was wearing pants. Volumes and layers is how loth dresses because she can't over heat being immune to fire and heat.
@Mirlinthloth I am proud to say I am a Furry as well somthing about an anthropomorphic body that scream cuddle with me!!
Her lack of pants is less of a problem due to her species, I guess. I have no idea how they are supposed to dress, but if she is upset due to her lack of pants, she doesn't show it.
"My friends, we gather here today to debate the issue of pants. This issue threatens to rock the very foundations of our way of life. Nay, our very existence." - Come on. let's have some oratory in here.
porn and debates about pants on mythical creatures, it's what the internet was made for, you know it, you love it, and you'd never change the randomness of it...at least i wouldn't ^_^
Ha Ha it would seem that my many months of work has com to furition my special brand of weridness has spread across the internet and manifested in others but i wonder if its not due to the power of Loth's pantlessness, I'm rather inclined to think the sexyness of her legs and the almost bum flash has driven us all quite insane
That, and maybe because I'm always kinda tired when i post comments, usually cause i look up all the web comics i read right before i go to bed...but hey, the power of hot pantless women is something to be feared and respected.
"Power". Yes, her power is inversely proportional the the amount of clothes she has on, especially the pants. XD
I personaly would like to see Loth in a nice pair of tight short shorts with a sports bar or a tight form fitting tank top the exposes her midrif or see her in her summer swim wear as both out fits leave alot to the imagination and thats all ways much more fun just getting to see the goods especialy on a sexy scalie like Loth I think it has somthing to do with the feel of soft yet rough sacles on ones skin * sqeee* I could just cuddle with Loth all day and night and be content in my life
Or you could always look at that bordering on softcore lesbian porn wallpaper that's in the downloads section...ya know, or that one wallpaper that has Loth in a bikini. Just saying... >.>
Well guys it seems that Comicfury, our host, is migrating servers. I can't currently upload the next page, but I'll keep trying. If you're seeing this message on Friday morning then the servers are still lost.
Edit: I've just posted the next page on my Deviantart. Eventually Comicfury will be up and running but till then, just check out the newest page there.
@rebllion777 why look at mere pictures when my imagination is soo much more vivd and enjoyable to use then to stare mindlessly and drool and fawn over pixels in an image
@EFlint awww lost servers are a bummer but Loth doesnt seem very happy to be going into town poor poor loth * hugs loth*
for all of her anti-elf talk, she sure is sweet on Ral...even if he is a half elf thieving mage d-bag that took her rose and doll and then lied to her about it (yes i am still ticked about that!). still her reaction isnt that hard to believe when you remember how she was brought up.
oh and like the new one. *flashback to the last time she was dressed like this in a new town* any explosions in the future?
@crzymnky666 Oh im quite sure the debate of pant over no pants shall go on long after we are all dead and dust
Man all this rising romantic tension sure will lead to some drama when she finds out he's been hiding her belongings in a twist, causing a rift in their relationship that will inevitably be healed by some ridiculously convenient conflict that brings them back together.

Causes of the Civil WarAlthough some historians feel that the Civil War was aresult of political blunders and that the issue of slaverydid not cause the conflict, they ignore the two main causes. The expansion of slavery, and its entrance into thepolitical scene.The North didn't care about slavery as long as itstayed in the South. South Carolina seceded, because AbrahamLincoln, a Republican, was voted into office. The Republicanparty threatened the South's expansion and so Southernersfelt that they had no other choice.The United States was divided into three groups by thetime the Civil War began: those who believed in the completeabolition of slavery, those who were against the expansionof slavery, and those who were pro slavery. The Republicanparty was formed in opposition to southern expansion. Theirviews were Free Soil, Free Men and Free Labor. TheRepublicans were anti-South but they were in notabolitionists. They believed that slavery was a flawedsystem that made the south ineffective and because theNorth's free labor system was superior it must be guarded
from southerners. When the Republican candidate, Abraham Lincoln waselected in 1860, the South felt threatened, and becauseexpansion was vital to the survival of slavery they alsofelt their way of life was being threatened. Because slaverywas such an important part of Southern society, the Southfelt that they could not survive without it. That's why theywere not willing to compromise with the north. To own slaveswas a sign of wealth and social prestige and poor farmerswho could not afford slaves had a goal to work for. In theelection of 1860 you can see that Lincoln only secured 4% ofthe popular vote in the South, only winning in the upper 5states, where in the north he received 54% of the popularvote. This shoes how united the South was in their dislikefor Lincoln. If the South had been more divided theymight have been more willing to compromise. The central cause of conflict between North and Southwas slavery, but it was only in it's expansion that itbecame a reason for war. The entrance of slavery intopolitics made it into a public issue, and once the issuebecame public the conflict had to be solved.

There is always a degree of chance when it comes to making one of these images with real liquid splashing...you can only control so much. If I'm not happy with the shot, the cleanup and re-setting up of the shot after each take requires a considerable amount of time and effort. So I was happy when I nailed this image on my first attempt. I love how the little alien and binocular characters on the ground seem to get it the worst - something I couldn't really control.

I love the not so subtle implications of this image. I already did the iconic image of Simba and Rafiki on top of Pride Rock (maybe I'll share that one later), but wanted to get at least one more image out of this toy. And that's when the idea for this image popped into my head (that's a Rancor from Star Wars, in case you were wondering). Heartwarming, right??

Before the Tournament of Power Super Saiyan Blue was thought to be the top transformation, if you don’t want to argue Super Saiyan 4. After being pushed to heights thought to be reachable by only the gods, Goku achieves power great enough to shake infinity. In DBS Super Episode 110 after being drained of all of his energy and blacking out during his fight with Jiren, Goku collapses into his own Spirit technique. The trauma from this event and need to be stronger in order to protect his universe Goku first unlocks the Ultra Instinct.
Ultra Instinct is actually based off of martial arts and the practice of “Mushin no Shin” which translates to “the mind without mind” or the state of no mindness. Mushin is actually a mental state that is said to be achievable by Zen and Daoist meditators. Its said that to obtain this state a person's mind must be free from thoughts of anger, fear, or ego during combat or everyday life There is an absence of discursive thought and judgment, so the person is totally free to act and react towards an opponent without hesitation and without disturbance from such thoughts. So with that being said Yes, Ultra instinct is based off of a real life technique so it is possible to develop certain aspects of it. Much like Bruce Lee
Goku radiates too much heat in this form. The sparkling aura around the user of Ultra instinct is actually heat that is generated from the form. This is also accompanied by an intense growth rate as Gokus strength evolved further and further the more he fought while in this form. Almost like an automatic zenkai boost. As it was stated that every time Goku blocked Jirens attacks, he hits him more sharply and heavily. His ki was also described to be not only hot but also frighteningly quiet as well, unlike the other forms that we’ve seen like Super Saiyan 2 and 3 which are accompanied by lightning which we’ve seen has the potential to be very noisy. For example when Cell regenerated himself into Super Perfect Cell his Ki was very noisy. At the same time however, this form is not a saiyan state as we all know. Ui goku
On 20 August 2008, a McDonnell Douglas MD82 being operated by Spanair on a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Madrid Barajas to Gran Canaria crashed on departure immediately after becoming airborne from runway 36L in day VMC and impacted terrain to the east of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed by the impact and subsequent fire and 154 of the 172 occupants were killed with the remainder being seriously injured.
An Investigation was carried out by the Spanish Accident Investigation Board, the CIAIAC. FDR and CVR data were available to aid reconstruction of the event, but some of the FDR data was corrupt due to a recorder fault.
It was noted that prior to the accident take off attempt, the aircraft had taxied out for departure but had returned for engineering attention to a faulty Ram Air Temperature (RAT) probe heating which had been functioning on the ground contrary to design intent. It was found that release to service based upon an incorrect application of the MEL had occurred, but that this could not be linked to the subsequent accident.
It was established that the takeoff, with the aircraft commander as PF had been unintentionally attempted without the flaps/slats being set to the required and intended position. Four seconds after becoming airborne over the runway, the stick shaker had activated and both pitch and roll control were lost as a stall occurred. The crew did not realise that the incorrect configuration was causing their problem and after 14 seconds airborne, the aircraft, having taken up a northeasterly track, impacted terrain at a position some 60 metres from the runway centerline. It continued for a further 1093 metres before coming to a final stop. It briefly became airborne again on reaching the edge of the elevated runway strip before further final impact led to break up and an intense fire. A maximum height of 40 ft was reached.
It was found that there had been no activation of the take off warning system (TOWS) during the take off roll and it proved impossible to establish reliably what caused the TOWS to malfunction. However, it was found that there had been many previous instances in the world fleet where inoperative TOWS had been linked to faults with RAT probe heating like the one which had led to the accident aircraft returning to the gate after its initial departure. This association was attributed to a ground sensing relay which was by design common to both the airborne-only RAT probe heating and the on-ground only TOWS. However, in the specific case of the accident aircraft, no such association could be proved.
Breach of SOPs during the taxi phases of the flight in respect of both the use of personal phones and in respect of the principle of a sterile flight deck had occurred. However, the key indiscipline was a failure by the crew to complete various Normal Checklists properly. Some items had been omitted and / or required items not actioned or checked. Conversations with a third person in the flight deck on topics that were irrelevant to the pilots’ duties were also noted and were considered to have contributed to a degree of crew distraction from their primary tasks.
The Investigation noted that the TOWS was required to be operational prior to dispatch of a flight but that whereas at Spanair, a check of the system was only specified for the first flight of the day, the corresponding recommendation in the Boeing FCOM was a check on the first flight of the day and on “through flights”, a term that was not clearly defined. The accident aircraft had no provision for the annunciation of TOWS failure to the crew and it was noted that the design criteria for TOWS like the one installed in MD 80 series aircraft were those of a back-up system rather than those of an essential system as required for certification of newer aircraft types based on more demanding reliability standards. This was allowable because ‘grandfather rights’ dating to the original DC9 family certification applied.
The Investigation found several factors potentially related to pilot knowledge and training deficiencies which it was considered were the basis for human errors at various stages of the operation. It was considered that although Spanair CRM training was in compliance with regulatory requirements, “the circumstances of the accident pointed to bad coordination and improper CRM that failed to mitigate the individual errors made by both pilots”.
The failure of training to include recognition and recovery from a take off stall was also noted, as were concerns in respect of use of the MEL, including generic concern that EASA guidance did not require that the source of a malfunction be identified as a precondition to the raising of an ADD - in the case of the accident aircraft the one for the faulty RAT probe heating activation - and other airworthiness issues. Inadequate regulatory oversight of both flight operations and continuing airworthiness at Spanair was also highlighted in the particular context of the pace of change in the Spanair operation and the case for enhanced regulatory oversight at such times.
Various issues relating to the effectiveness of the Madrid Airport RFFS function were also noted during the Investigation.
The Investigation considered the record of prior accidents and incidents involving inappropriate take off configuration and subsequent stall for which the TOWS did not provide a warning including an MD82 at Detroit (1987), a Boeing 737 at Medan, Indonesia (2005) and an MD83 at Lanzarote, Spain (2007).
Various Safety Action taken during the course of the Investigation, including by Boeing to improve the clarity of various documentation which was found to be open to mis-interpretation, was also noted.
“the crew lost control of the airplane as a consequence of entering a stall immediately after takeoff due to an improper airplane configuration involving the non-deployment of the slats/flaps following a series of mistakes and omissions, along with the absence of the improper takeoff configuration warning”.
“The crew did not identify the stall warnings and did not correct said situation after takeoff. They momentarily retarded the engine throttles, increased the pitch angle and did not correct the bank angle, leading to a deterioration of the stall condition. The crew did not detect the configuration error because they did not properly use the checklists, which contain items to select and verify the position of the flaps/slats, when preparing the flight”.
- did not carry out the action to select the flaps/slats with the associated control lever (in the ‘After Start’ checklist);
and that “the visual check done when executing the ‘Final Items’ on the ‘Takeoff imminent’ Checklist was not a real check of the position of the flaps and slats as displayed on the instruments in the cockpit”.
- The absence of an improper takeoff configuration warning resulting from the failure of the TOWS to operate, which thus did not warn the crew that the airplane’s takeoff configuration was not appropriate. The reason for the failure of the TOWS to function could not be reliably established.
- Improper crew resource management (CRM), which did not prevent the deviation from procedures in the presence of unscheduled interruptions to flight preparations.
The Final Report: A - 032/2008 of the Investigation was approved by the CIAIAC on 26 July 2011 and subsequently made available in English translation on 31 October 2011. During the course of the Investigation, the CIAIAC issued a ‘Preliminary Report’ on 6 October 2008, an ‘Interim Report’ on 17 August 2009 and a ‘Progress Note’ on 17 August 2010. The Final Report incorporates the content of the earlier ones.
A total of 33 Safety Recommendations were made by CIAIAC as a result of the Investigation. Eight of these were issued whilst the Investigaton was in progress as follows:

Students role play in pairs, describing the face of a “robber”. The policeman must re-create the face that the informant is describing, feature by feature.
Photocopy the sheets with the faces (ABCD) and cut along the dotted lines (Do not cut right across). Take two A4 size sheets of thick paper or cardboard to use as a front and back cover. Photocopy the vocabulary sheet (E) onto one of the sheets of cardboard. This will be the inside back cover and students can refer to it for vocabulary. Slip the four cut sheets between the cardboard cover sheets and staple along the left hand side to form a booklet. Make a class set of booklets.
Each student has a booklet. Students form pairs facing each other, and take turns at being the policeman or the informer discussing the face of the thief. The informer holds the booklet so the policeman cannot see it and chooses a combination of facial features. The policeman says:
The informer gives a full description of the thief, and the policeman tries to make up an identikit picture with his booklet that corresponds to the description. When the policeman’s identikit picture is complete, the students compare faces to confirm that the description was fully understood.

South and east of Nairobi, along the main highway to Mombassa, is the market town of Sultan Hamud. Going north and east from there on dirt roads, you come to Ngoto with a church, primary school and the high school featured here.
(Click on the photos for larger images. All images and comments pertain to my visits there during the 1984-86 period.)
The u-shaped building with the dark roof is the main classroom building. Using that as a center, we can identify the other buildings. Below it is a science building, under construction. To the left are teacher housing and to the north is a basketball court and beyond that student housing. To the right (more visible in the image above) are playing fields for soccer and other sports.
Education was important to Kenyans, a teacher a respected person. Education was the way out of poverty.
Going to school cost money and students were always dropping out because they could not pay the fees.
More photos of the students. (Also see the page on children, as most of those shots were taken around Ngoto.)
Driving to Ngoto could be a pleasant trip through beautiful countryside. But not in the rainy season. Here I've put the rear end of the car deep in the mud - six men couldn't push it out and we had to be pulled by the Land Rover.
Dave B. was the Peace Corps volunteer working there; we also got to know his (future) wife, Leslie and other friends.
This artist profile has been created for a number of reasons. Most prominent among them is the great amount of Balinese Gamelan recordings and compilations which do not contain the identity of the performers or ensembles. Instead of the plays being scrobbled onto the extremely generic Various Artists profile (and that's in a good case). Gamelan fans are advised to tag the recording artist with the lesser generic term Balinese Gamelan instead of VA in case the performer's name is absent. Read more on Last.fm

The Senator representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Senator Ben Murray-Bruce says plans by some APC senators to impeach Senate president Bukola Saraki illegally and elect Senator Godswill Obot Akpabio as Senate President will be resisted.
At the time of writing this report, most National Assembly members from the People Democratic Party (PDP) were denied access into the National Assembly by Security agents.
I am currently at the @nassnigeria where Sen. Akpabio and the gang are orchestrating to break the laws of Nigeria, with the backing of the security forces. I call on the @USEmbassyAbuja @ngBritish @CanHCNigeria to immediately revoke their visas & that of their family members. pic.twitter.com/Ok70xbOVW7

An Engineered Materials Arresting System uses a specially installed surface which quickly stops any aircraft that moves on it and is installed at the end of runways to reduce the extent, and associated risks, of any overrun off the end of a runway compared to the equivalent soft ground distance.
In the absence of any international standards, early attempts at installing arrester beds of gravel at the end of runways proved to create a fire hazard comparable to that of an extended overrun. This was because the hard material thrown up from the gravel bed tended to puncture wing fuel tanks and start a fire, which was then very difficult to extinguish because leaking fuel seeped into the gravel bed from where it continued to feed the fire from below.
It was an overrun by an SAS DC10-30 following a late touchdown on runway 04R at New York JFK in February 1984 which was the catalyst for the development of EMAS. The extent of the overrun led to both passenger injuries and substantial aircraft damage. The FAA and the United States Air Force (USAF) agreed to determine the feasibility of, and develop criteria for, the design of soft-ground arresting systems on 21 December 1984 and, in 1989, the FAA initiated an experimental program with the U.S. Naval Air Engineering Center to conduct experiments on soft-ground materials. The purpose of these experiments was to verify the theoretical calculations of stopping distances. Tests were conducted on phenolic foam and cellular cement with an FAA Boeing 727 in the summer of 1990. The FAA Technical Center then conducted two successful full-scale ‘arrestments’ using the same instrumented Boeing 727 in the summer of 1993 using a phenolic foam bed 207 metres long, 15 metres wide and 18 inches deep. The most significant early overall review of the subject was the 1993 FAA Report “Soft Ground Arresting Systems for Airports.”
Between 1994 and1996, the FAA and the Operator of New York JFK developed and installed a prototype arrestor bed built with pre-cast cellular cement blocks for runway 04R at KJFK. As early as 1998, the FAA issued the first generic specification for EMAS design, installation and maintenance. Since then it has encouraged the only current (US) manufacturer of a viable EMAS system, Zodiac Aerospace, in the development of its “EMASMAX” ® product for more widespread civil use.
An EMAS installed in accordance with the FAA specification is stated to provide a level of safety that is equivalent to an FAA 305m Runway Safety Area (RSA) - which corresponds to the ICAO Recommended Practice for RESA plus the required Runway Strip detailed in Annex 14. The total extent of the overrun ‘system’ which incorporates an EMAS bed can then be reduced subject to FAA approval to 180m - exactly the same distance as the ICAO RESA Standard provides for - but to considerably more effect .
The current FAA Circular on the subject is AC 150/5220-22A "Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS) for Aircraft Overruns" which was issued in September 2005 and includes requirements for:
- any bed elevated above the surrounding surface must have access to or egress from it by vehicles or persons facilitated by provision of ramped or stepped edges
The requirements in respect of both jet blast and undershoot are largely met by the requirement for a “setback” zone between the runway end and the EMAS bed. The limiting factor is usually the jet blast risk, but continued development of pavement surfaces which are resistant to jet blast has allowed the EMAS set back distances to be reduced, in some cases to as little as 7.5m.
A number of NAAs have recently introduced, or are actively preparing, generic guidance for the approval of EMAS based on the currently applicable FAA standards. These NAAs include those in Australia, the UK, Canada, France and Spain. The definition of the term ‘Engineered Materials’ adopted by the FAA - ‘high energy absorbing materials of selected strength which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft’- has been widely accepted outside the USA.
The core application of EMAS has been seen as locations where the ground profile at the end of a runway is such that the consequences of a landing overrun, or one following a rejected take off initiated from high speed, are serious damage to, or the complete destruction, of an aircraft. More recently, it has been promoted as an option to avoid an overrun trajectory conflicting with the extended centreline of another runway. It has also been argued that it is not only an alternative to a longer RESA, where the criteria for the profile of the latter cannot be met, but is also an alternative which will ensure that high speed overruns will be stopped even where the full recommended RESA length may not be sufficient for an aircraft to stop within it.
Since the first EMAS were installed on runways 04R and 22L at New York JFK in 1996, there has been a steady increase in installations so that by June 2011, systems had been installed at 52 runway ends at 36 airports in the USA including Boston 15R and 04L, Chicago O’Hare 04R/22L and all four runways at Chicago Midway. The first installations outside the US were carried out on 33L and 33R at Madrid Barajas (Spain), on both ends of 02/20 at Juizhai-Huanglong (China) and on 10 at Taipei Songshan (Taiwan).
The presence of an EMAS should be included in the AIP entry for the Airport concerned and the main commercial chart providers have now developed a standard depiction for an EMAS installation.
The design of the Zodiac Aerospace EMAS product is predicated on being able to cope with the overrun speeds that have occurred in the past and the aircraft sizes which may use particular runways. Each installation is adapted to the prevailing environmental circumstances and a maximum EMAS entry speed by aircraft type. It meets all the requirements of the applicable FAA guidance.
The Zodiac EMAS is a bed of cellular cement blocks encased in a protective cover positioned after a ‘setback distance’ which begins immediately after the end of the paved runway surface. The blocks crush reliably and predictably under the weight of an aircraft and thus facilitate a rapid but nevertheless gentle and consistent deceleration. Each lightweight block is secured to the EMAS base with hot asphalt and the seams between blocks are then taped at their upper surface to prevent water penetration. The depth of the EMAS bed gradually increases with increasing distance from the runway, typically from around 25cm up to 75cm.
An FAA-approved computer model of the wheel / compacted cellular cement interface is used to determine the required arrestor bed configuration according to aircraft weight and EMAS entry speed. The heaviest aircraft will usually be the ‘critical aircraft’ but, since landing gear configuration and tyre pressures are also relevant, this does not hold universally.
Each system is also designed to take account of runway length / width, elevation, and the length and slope of the available installation area. Performance usually takes account of aircraft types which have more than 500 movements per year and assumes that these aircraft will be operating at 100% of runway MTOM or 80% of runway MLW. Most installations to date have used a maximum 70 knots bed-entry speed.
- there is no aircraft braking or use of reverse thrust / reverse pitch once an aircraft enters the EMAS
An EMAS bed may have a surface slope downwards and may have changes in that slope within the bed so that the quantity of any landfill used to create an adequate base level for the bed can be minimised. It can also accommodate projecting frangible lighting which needs to be sited within the bed area.
To date, EMAS installations have been designed to arrest multi crew transport aircraft and these systems do not work as effectively for smaller ones - those under 5700kg MTOM
The standard design life of a Zodiac Aerospace EMAS is 20 years. Routine inspection and maintenance is important but requirements are minimal. Restoration of a bed after overrun use may take a few days and cannot be completed in sub zero temperatures.
The only pilot guidance for an imminent EMAS encounter is to maintain the extended runway centreline and, once stopped, make no attempt to taxi or otherwise move the aircraft. Once the upper surface of an EMAS bed has been breached, loose material from the blocks will crush underfoot, so that access on foot to and egress from an aircraft in the bed is not impeded.
A number of overruns in the USA have had less serious consequences than might have been the case due to the presence of an EMAS. Runway 04R at JFK has seen three EMAS-mitigated overruns in which the aircraft have been undamaged and the occupants uninjured including:

This invention concept would pertain to the analysis of time travel theories and stories, and compare them to mathematical algorithms to determine if it would theoretically be possible to travel through time, even if it isn’t technically possible, or at least at the current time. The mathematical formulas, and the insights into the transitions between timeframes, could help to develop new technologies – not necessarily time travel technologies, but rather technologies that can utilize the knowledge and formulas that can explain the theories.
These technologies could include new types of elements, including unstable particles, new types of compounds, new types of electronic technologies, and new types of nuclear technologies, including renewable energy sources, new forms of propulsion or transportation technologies, and new types of Information Technology (IT) systems.
Elle and Gwen were cowgirls this year. Their stick horses made galloping sounds when you pushed a little button on the horses' ears. The toy guns and holsters provided a full week's worth of entertainment. They had those things on all day, everyday and would chase after pretend rattlesnakes, coyotes and raccoons (I'm not just making this up) in our house. Gwen learned to yell, "yeeha!" and Elle's favorite line was "howdy partner!" They each filled their plastic pumpkins to the brim with candy. Jon and I woke up the next morning to both of them sitting on our bed with their pumpkin buckets in their laps chomping away (I have sticky marks all over our white quilt to prove it). If you're not having candy for breakfast on November 1st then I just don't know if we can be friends. It's a must. The end to a very fun Halloween.

Be realistic. Price is the number one factor that most home buyers use in determining which homes to view. Although the price is set by you, the seller, the value of the home is determined by the buyer. Don't allow your enthusiasm to warp your judgement and lead to overpricing - a mistake you can't afford to make.
Available Financing. Does your home come with an assumable loan that is below today's rate? What are the current home loan interest rates? What financing alternatives are available for your home and area?
Competitive Market Analysis. Do you know what similar homes in the area sold for within the last six months?
Investment in Improvements. Potential buyers will evaluate your home (i.e. wallpaper and carpet) and may include the costs to remove or replace in their offer.
Neighbour's Claims. Don't listen to what your neighbours tell you is the fair market value for your home. Other homes in your neighbourhood may not be as similar as you think. Also the terms accepted by both the buyer and seller greatly affect the sale price.
You'll Help Sell the Competition. The "correctly priced" homes look even better if yours is overpriced. Most buyers are competitive shoppers.
Your Home Will Stay on the Market a Long Time. Did you know that 80% of your potential buyers will see your house in the first four to six weeks? If you don't sell them then, it takes approximately three months to replace them with an equal number of newcomers.
You'll Lose Market Interest and Qualified Buyers. Serious buyers use the value, quality and price of similar properties as deciding factors.
A Negative Impression is Created. People will wonder why your house is still on the market - they'll believe something is wrong with your home.
You (The Seller) Would Lose Money. You may have to make extra mortgage payments as well as incur taxes, insurance and unplanned maintenance costs.
You (The Seller) May Have to Accept Less Money. Studies show that the longer a house is on the market, the greater the discount off the list price. Often a seller will accept less than fair market value in order to sell because of an approaching deadline.
There is the Potential for Appraisal Problems. The appraiser from your buyer's lending institution must agree that the home is worth the asking price. If the appraiser believes the price is inflated, the loan may not be approved.

Today, I lead with the music and then the message. If you’ve been reading my blogs for a while, then you know I have a format of message, affirmation, quotes, and ending with a song that fits in with the message. Researching songs for a prior blog, I came across this video that now lives inside of me. It’s a song from the Tony Award winning musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” and speaks to my heart and why I do what I do. To let people know they are seen, they are heard, that they matter, and that they are found.
Taking the smallest step forward in believing in yourself. Things worthwhile rarely happen overnight and you are so worthy of trying to live love.
Knowing you aren’t alone. In this very moment of feeling alone, there are others who feel that way too. There are also others who are grateful knowing you, even if they haven’t expressed it recently.
Being gentle with yourself. Do one nice thing for YOU daily. You get to decide how small or big it is but do it. Whether it’s taking a nap, enjoying a walk, eating ice cream, writing, dancing, or something else – if it brings you a moment of happiness, it is so worth the time.
Being the finder and reaching out to others. Even if it’s sharing a forced smile with a stranger, you will find that there is even connection in that. It may not create a long-lasting friendship, but in that moment, you were found and so was the person you shared the smile with.
Asking for help. There is such a spectrum of feeling lost to be a little lonely to despair. Check in your local community for resources and if you can’t find something, keep checking.
Mostly, my wish for you is that on your worst days, you know better days are ahead. There is no other like you and you deserve to live boldly, love deeply, laugh loudly, hug intently, and smile brightly.

Recently I had the great pleasure of spending the day sailing on Lake Michigan. Water feeds my soul and in particular sailing. I used to race for over 10 years and have volunteered for the last several years at the Judd Goldman Adaptive Sailing program. This day was special because I was getting the chance to bring together my love for sailing with the love of some of my favorite people, two of which I know from Judd Goldman. My other three friends were inexperienced and one had never sailed before, but I was confident he would love it too. And truly my favorite sailing is at night – stars and the sound of the water hitting the hull is, well I can’t think of a better sound to relax and fall in love deeper with life than that.
The trip had been planned for a few weeks. We were all excited, along with being a bit nervous on our schedules remaining open and would the weather cooperate. We set sail from Jackson Park Harbor to pick up our last friend at Burnham Harbor. It was also the Chicago Air & Water Show which meant heavy boat traffic.
The day turned out magical and it wasn’t until the next day that I realized our day on the lake was a perfect example of life, or at least how we can view life. The afternoon which went into evening, which went into night, which went into the wee hours of the morning was filled with gorgeous weather, a nice breeze, great conversations, lots of laughter, yummy food and beverage and the beautiful backdrop of Chicago to ooh and aah at. It also had the air show in the afternoon and fireworks at night. Along with the spectacular memories created that day, it also had moments of challenges. There were dark storm clouds lurking, the wind died for awhile, the heavier boat traffic required more attention to our surroundings and a couple of the new sailors experienced a little queasiness. We each had the opportunity to focus on what wasn’t going as planned or we could all focus on adjusting our sails as needed and having as much fun as possible. The storm blew past us and we didn’t feel a drop. When the winds died, many of us went swimming until the winds picked up, and our new sailors quickly turned it around to be able to enjoy the day full out.
So, as you go through your day, remember you get to choose what to focus on. You can continue to try and go the way you wanted to go and fight the obstacles in front of you. Or you can choose to see the obstacles as an opportunity to grow and adjust your sails to a new course that very well might get you to where you want to go happier than you thought possible.
Knowing you are on the right course for you. Regardless if the goal seems impossible, hold on to knowing you can accomplish anything by adjusting your course as needed.
Appreciating your current course by knowing whether it’s smooth seas or big waves, all experiences are part of your course. See the big waves (contrasting experiences) as simply adjustments towards your end goal of living the highest and happiest version of you.Loving your journey by getting excited about where you are, where you’ve been, and where you are going.
Mostly, my wish for you is to adjust your sails to journey through life with a calm breeze at your back leading you to the happiest possible life filled with your biggest dreams.
“Not to have control over the senses is like sailing in a rudderless ship, bound to break to pieces on coming in contact with the very first rock.”
“I can’t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.”

A practical programme from HACAN to curb the noise of aircraft from Heathrow and London City Airports
2. Retain Runway Alternation. Runway alternation, the practice whereby aircraft landing at Heathrow switch runways at 3pm to give people in the areas closer to Heathrow a half day’s break from the noise, is vital for those areas. It ensures that people do not have a plane flying over the heads, one every ninety seconds, all day long.
3. Curb night flights. The current night flight agreement with the airlines ends in Autumn 2012. 16 flights are permitted between 11.30pm and 6am overflying at least half a million people, more than any other city in Europe. There are around 65 flights between 6am and 7am. We are pressing for a ban on night flights between 11pm and 6am, and a reduction between 6am and 7am. While night flights remain, they should be rotated on a daily basis so any community is only overflown one night in four.
4. End the practice of Heathrow operating at 99% capacity. This results in many planes are being held in the skies over London, causing unnecessary extra noise, emissions and air pollution, and it makes no business sense to operate with virtually no margin for delays or emergencies. Mechanisms, such a slot auctioning, which could ensure BAA operates at Heathrow at no more than 90% capacity, need to be investigated. The 480,000 cap should be regarded as an absolute limit, not a target to be reached.
5. Encourage fewer, if bigger planes, to use Heathrow. Sensible use of the larger, quieter aircraft could be a win-win situation, allowing more passengers to use the airport but with fewer planes. (The Government’s proposed Plane Tax could be the vehicle to encourage this to happen). It could allow Heathrow to cater for more passengers while operating at no more than 90% capacity.
6. Encourage planes to join their final approach path as late as possible. Since the mid-1990s, aircraft have been directed onto their final approach path sometimes 20 miles from the airport, resulting in such a concentration of noise in places like Vauxhall that the overall noise climate can be worse than parts of West London. The industry should use the new technologies coming on-stream which allow aircraft to be guided down with much more precision to ensure that aircraft join their final approach path as late as possible. Before they join the final approach path, the noise burden should be shared as equitably as possible with guaranteed periods of quiet for each community. Aircraft taking off are already more dispersed. The problem tends to be when they deviate from their usual routes, bringing noise to areas which were not previously overflown by departing aircraft. People need certainty.
7. Introduce, when practicable, a steeper ‘glideslope’ for aircraft when landing. This would mean planes are higher for longer. We understand the industry is looking at this but is still concerned that a much steeper glideslope might increase safety concerns.
8. Put in place a fair deal on sound insulation. The area where residents get help with insulation should be extended. The noise level where residents qualify for help around Heathrow is higher than that for people living around many other airports.
9. Stop expansion at City Airport. For parts of East and South-East London the combination of noise from Heathrow and City Airport has become a real problem. It has been exacerbated by the growing use of jet aircraft rather than the quieter turbo-props at City. It will become even worse if City Airport is allowed to increase flight numbers by 50%. That plan should be rejected.
10. Review the recent changes in City airport flight paths. The new flight path introduced in 2009 to accommodate the increase used of jet aircraft needs to be urgently and publicly reviewed as it has resulted in disturbance to vast swathes of East and North East London which never expected to be under a flight path. At busy times aircraft can be taking off over people’s homes about every minute or two at heights of less than 2,000 feet.

Carpets have been used to cover floors for decades now, and it is a more affordable way to introduce softness, color, and texture in a room. It is a thick covering for the floor that is usually made of synthetic fibers or woven wool that is used to cover part or the entire surface of the floor, and they do come in different colors, shapes, patterns, and motifs which make them look beautiful. Carpets have been used for various purposes such as making a room feel cozy, keep the feet warm from the floor, you can sit on them and reduce noise while walking.
There are various types of carpets in the market that you can choose from and below are what you should consider before getting a new carpet for your space.
The room that you will be placing the carpet is important as it determines the style and grade of carpet that will work best for you. Ask yourself how the room is going to be used, is there light or heavy traffic in the room and is there direct access into the room from outside? For example, it would be best to get a stain resistant carpet for your dining room so that it is easy to remove any accidental spills.
Light colored carpets make the room appear larger and dark colored carpets make the room seem cozier. However, ask yourself, how much is the room being used are kids playing in the room, the lighting of the room and is it a large or small room? Choose a carpet that matches your existing décor and a color that will relate with your mood, for example, cool tones provide a sense of calmness while warm colors make one feel energized.
Carpets are now even made from various types of technology, and this makes the difference in pricing. Before buying check on the quality by bending the carpet sample slightly backward and if you see the backing, then it is of low quality as it has a low density. It should also have at least a face weight of about 24 to 40oz, a density rating of 2,000 or more, a tuft twist of 5 or higher and a texture retention warranty of about 10 years.
Carpets need to withstand the amount of pressure, absorb sound and also act as an insulation to control the temperature and this is through adequate padding. The right padding is determined by the density as it extends the carpets life. High traffic areas will require a carpet with a heavy padding of about 3/8 to ½ inch thick and a density weight of 6lbs and lesser traffic areas less padding with a lesser density of about 8lbs.
The size of the room, the style, and grade of the carpet, the fiber used to make the carpet, installation are some of the things that will determine the cost of the carpet. Don’t blow your budget, but get a carpet that matches your lifestyle and budget and also the location and use of the carpet.
Marcin's team did amazing job for our family. House we bought was in quiet bad shape, but after all work done together with new kitchen, bathrooms and general redecoration is lovely space to live! Thank you Johannes.
Marcin represent high end of building standards. Together with wife we where more than surprise on whole service that we received, it include help with design process, amazing care on protection in building (which cause always problems in our area) and such a detailed work on whole flat that I've never seen before. 5 star service and at the end of work we got from Kluk Construction bottle of good champagne to celebrate our new flat!!!!! Isn't that great? Recommended to everyone!!!!
Marcin and his team did an excellent job overall. He astutely anticipated many of the likely problems and took them into account in his quotation ( explaining the issues clearly) with the result that there were no significant financial surprises as the work progressed. He thought out the job very well indeed and gave excellent advice as to the work that should be done to achieve a really good result. He took a great deal of trouble to make sure I was satisfied with the job and overall he and his team produced work of a very high standard. At all times he kept me informed of the progress.
Marcin and his team were always on time, incredibly courteous and efficient. The work was done quickly and to a high standard. When my flat was flooded it was a nightmare and they did everything for me - thank you! I really recommend them to anyone and everyone!
Marcin and his team did a great job despite bath stores best efforts to send incorrect items and fittings - they were helpful and efficient. I would have no hesitation recommending Kluk Construction to anyone.
Who did not see this coming? A controversy on the fourth team qualifying for the final playoff spot was a talking point for college football fans when the Ohio State Buckeyes were the last team to complete a field of four-team College Football Playoff.
Everyone knew Ohio State would make the playoffs few weeks ago. They knew that football team was a brand name that the College Football Playoff selection committee wanted to pick to celebrate the inauguration of the playoffs.
There’s no question Ohio State being selected was based on dollars and cents rather than merit. They draw ratings and revenue, and that appealed to the NCAA. No one can say that about TCU and Baylor, which no one watches or cares. It was a no-brainer decision by the committee.
It was a stupid move. The Ohio State Buckeyes did not do anything to earn a playoff spot. They beat up on cupcakes from a horrible conference in the Big Ten. For them to be the best team in the conference, that’s like being the tallest midget of all midgets. That’s nothing to be proud of.
TCU beat good teams at least. They beat Kansas State, who was one of the best teams in the country. That should have been the difference maker for them to go. The committee knows that, too.
For anyone to say Ohio State beat Michigan State and Wisconsin, there’s a flaw in that argument. Despite Michigan State being 10-2, their 10 wins were inflated since they beat terrible Big 10 teams. It’s no fault of Michigan State’s, but that can’t be denied, either. They were exposed by playing two great teams in Oregon and Ohio State, which their defense was shredded by their opponent’s offense.
As for Wisconsin, they played in a weak conference. They beat no one good in the Big 10. They were overmatched against Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. To say they were a good team is ludicrous.
Sorry, but Kansas State is better than Michigan State and Wisconsin. Same can be said for TCU and Baylor.
The committee claimed Ohio State beat Wisconsin with a third-string quarterback as a way to justify their decision to pick the Buckeyes is nothing more than an excuse to pick them. It was an easy way out. It was nothing more than lying to the public.
College football fans are smarter than people think. They do research on what’s going on around the league to know what team is the smart choice to make the playoffs.
Most of them know Ohio State is a fraud team at best. They know the Big 10 has so many weak teams. They did not need to be lied to about how they had better strength of schedule. Whatever that means.
The committee should have admitted the Buckeyes made the playoffs because they were a better draw than TCU and Baylor. It may not appease the public, but at least, they would be honest. The truth sets everyone free.
For Ohio State to be in the playoffs, the message was sent by the committee that lesser known teams are not welcome to have a shot in the national championship. That’s what makes all of this discouraging.
It’s too bad. TCU and Baylor were good enough to win a national championship when one looks at their offense. There’s no one dominating out there. That’s why Ohio State has a chance to win it all just like Oregon, Alabama and Florida State.
It shouldn’t be surprising there was going to be controversy concerning the last playoff team. There were several 1-loss teams. The committee has no clue about anything, so they were going to make a mistake. It just seems some team was going to be left out.
Honestly, college football was better off with the BCS. The BCS always had it right with the two best teams competing for a national championship every year.
The BCS made regular season games count. It was the survival of the fittest. It should be about a team that answered all the challenges every week to be undefeated. That’s the way it should be, not rewarding a team that had one bad loss earlier in the year and be in the championship game.
It was fun watching games on Saturdays where everything was on the line every week. That’s the way it should be.
Now with the playoffs, it makes regular season games meaningless. Why should Ohio State get a chance to rebound after losing to a bad Virginia Tech team in September? If this was the BCS, they would be eliminated.
It won’t be long until there are eight teams in the playoffs. NCAA will make more money out of it, which is why there will be expansion.
With controversy concerning the fourth teamin the playoffs, it’s safe to say nothing has changed. There are complaints and debates about Ohio State being in. For the NCAA, controversy is good publicity.

According to a new poll, more Americans than ever are supporting the nationwide legalization of recreational cannabis.
The Center for American Progress, who compiled the data from the poll, announced that for the first time in U.S. history, majorities of Democrats, Republicans and Independent voters back legalization.
The poll, which was completed by 1,000 registered American voters, also revealed that nearly 3/4 of all respondents believe that the historical records of non-violent cannabis offenders should be waived.
58% of respondents would be more likely to vote for a congressional candidate who believed in recreational cannabis legalization
Earlier this week, neighbours to the North Canada, announced that nationwide recreational cannabis legalization will come into effect in October of this year.
The U.S. currently have 9 states where recreational cannabis is legal in some form. However, wholesale recreational changes are unlikely to occur under the Trump administration, who firmly believe that only medicinal cannabis should be accessible.
Because of the lack of participants, we held an informal meeting with a variety of subjects discussed: Continue reading →
Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued four "Customer Advisories" for bitcoin and related investments.[14] A July 2018 warning emphasized that trading in any cryptocurrency is often speculative, and there is a risk of theft from hacking, and fraud.[168] A February 2018 advisory warned against investing an IRA fund into virtual currencies.[169] A December 2017 advisory warned that virtual currencies are risky because:
Computing power is often bundled together or "pooled" to reduce variance in miner income. Individual mining rigs often have to wait for long periods to confirm a block of transactions and receive payment. In a pool, all participating miners get paid every time a participating server solves a block. This payment depends on the amount of work an individual miner contributed to help find that block.[82]
Bitcoin has become more widely traded as of 2017, and both short term traders and long-term investors are looking to participate in this exciting market. The price of bitcoin fluctuates on a daily basis, and can see some significant price volatility. Prices can be affected by numerous influences. Some of the possible drivers of price include: further acceptance, more exchanges opening, regulations, weakening paper currency values, inflation and more.

Bitcoin is a digital currency created in 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity has yet to be verified. Bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and is operated by a decentralized authority, unlike government-issued currencies.
Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has proven to be a profitable investment for those who owned it initially. Having bought it for only $50 back then, one can now earn high revenues, as now its price has grown hundreds of times larger. Observing the popularity of BTC to USD exchange operations, there are immense opportunities to gain benefits from the Bitcoin trade. After the coin was launched, it cost $0.003 on April 25, 2010, at BitcoinMarket.com, which was the first cryptocurrency exchange. Starting at that time, the Bitcoin to dollar exchange rate has increased dramatically, and some of the initial owners gained earnings of over thousand percent. Now, while some users may be simply attracted by the potential of growing prices, many buyers believe that the currency itself has a high level of volatility. According to some financial specialists, it is even more volatile than gold. And some individuals believe that Bitcoin has the potential to replace fiat money in the future.
After a certain amount of transactions have been verified by a miner, they will receive newly minted bitcoins for their work and thus new bitcoins will be added into circulation, while the number of bitcoins in circulations are now in the multi-millions range, the maximum amount of bitcoins that can ever be created is capped at 21 million. The creation rate is automatically halved every few years as more bitcoins are added into circulation, whilst this system is modeled after gold, mining difficulty is always increasing and makes finding new bitcoins more rare as the number of available bitcoins reaches the 21 million cap.
Though each bitcoin transaction is recorded in a public log, names of buyers and sellers are never revealed – only their wallet IDs. While that keeps bitcoin users’ transactions private, it also lets them buy or sell anything without easily tracing it back to them. That’s why it has become the currency of choice for people online buying drugs or other illicit activities.
In November 2013, the University of Nicosia announced that it would be accepting bitcoin as payment for tuition fees, with the university's chief financial officer calling it the "gold of tomorrow".[85] During November 2013, the China-based bitcoin exchange BTC China overtook the Japan-based Mt. Gox and the Europe-based Bitstamp to become the largest bitcoin trading exchange by trade volume.[86]
Bitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men – meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.
The very first major jump in Bitcoin price took place in July 2010. At this point, the value of Bitcoin went from about $0.0008 all the way up to $0.08, a truly dramatic increase in price. At this point and in the following year, very few exchanges supported trading of Bitcoin. There was also extremely limited liquidity at this time due to cryptocurrency still being relatively unknown. That meant that when the price started an increase in June 2011 from about $0.95, the approach was among the steepest recorded. Unfortunately, the drop also followed suit. By mid-June of that year, Bitcoin was up to $320, an all-time high. By November, it had declined 94 percent all the way to $20.
The other reason is safety. Looking at 2009 alone, 32,489 blocks were mined; at the then-reward rate of 50 BTC per block, the total payout in 2009 was 1,624,500 BTC, which at today’s prices is over $900 million. One may conclude that only Satoshi and perhaps a few other people were mining through 2009, and that they possess a majority of that $900 million worth of BTC. Someone in possession of that much BTC could become a target of criminals, especially since bitcoins are less like stocks and more like cash, where the private keys needed to authorize spending could be printed out and literally kept under a mattress. While it's likely the inventor of Bitcoin would take precautions to make any extortion-induced transfers traceable, remaining anonymous is a good way for Satoshi to limit exposure.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that enables users to be their own banks, store their assets securely thanks to advanced encryption and send money without any intermediaries to anyone anywhere in the World. Bitcoin is the oldest cryptocurrency with a very good market price. It has made many investors, especially the earliest ones, incredibly rich bringing even 1000x of returns. However, because of this it has become a very speculative asset. Many people are researching Bitcoin only for the sake of profits and not to use it as a fast peer-to-peer payment method
Bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges, including thefts from Coincheck in January 2018, Coinrail and Bithumb in June, and Bancor in July. For the first six months of 2018, $761 million worth of cryptocurrencies was reported stolen from exchanges.[60] Bitcoin's price was affected even though other cryptocurrencies were stolen at Coinrail and Bancor, as investors worried about the security of cryptocurrency exchanges.[61][62][63]
Bitcoin is an increasingly popular cryptocurrency that utilizes blockchain technology to facilitate transactions. Basically, a user obtains a Bitcoin wallet that can be used for storing bitcoins and both sending and receiving of payments. The blockchain technology used by Bitcoin is really just a shared public ledger that is used by the entire public network. The technology used is secured through cryptography, a branch of mathematics that provides a highly secure means of facilitating and recording transactions on the network.
In January 2014, Zynga[92] announced it was testing bitcoin for purchasing in-game assets in seven of its games. That same month, The D Las Vegas Casino Hotel and Golden Gate Hotel & Casino properties in downtown Las Vegas announced they would also begin accepting bitcoin, according to an article by USA Today. The article also stated the currency would be accepted in five locations, including the front desk and certain restaurants.[93] The network rate exceeded 10 petahash/sec.[94] TigerDirect[95] and Overstock.com[96] started accepting bitcoin.
News drives attention, and attention drives understanding. While many people have flocked to cryptocurrencies purely in search of financial gain, there are a ton of people that are simply curious. Some peoples are sticking around and trying to understand what cryptos are all about. While more users increases Bitcoin’s network effect, more people forming in-depth understandings of cryptos also strengthen the active Bitcoin community.
On 22 March 2011 WeUseCoins published the first viral video[46] which has had over 6.4 million views. In September 2011 Vitalik Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine. On 23 December 2011, Douglas Feigelson of BitBills filed a patent application for "Creating And Using Digital Currency" with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, an action which was contested based on prior art in June 2013.[47][48]
Researchers have pointed out at a "trend towards centralization". Although bitcoin can be sent directly to the bitcoin network, in practice intermediaries are widely used.[30]:220–222 Bitcoin miners join large mining pools to minimize the variance of their income.[30]:215, 219–222[107]:3[108] Because transactions on the network are confirmed by miners, decentralization of the network requires that no single miner or mining pool obtains 51% of the hashing power, which would allow them to double-spend coins, prevent certain transactions from being verified and prevent other miners from earning income.[109] As of 2013 just six mining pools controlled 75% of overall bitcoin hashing power.[109] In 2014 mining pool Ghash.io obtained 51% hashing power which raised significant controversies about the safety of the network. The pool has voluntarily capped their hashing power at 39.99% and requested other pools to act responsibly for the benefit of the whole network.[110]
Well I haven't forgotten or forgiven you Mr Major; for the ERM debacle. I suffered 2 years of unemployment because of that nonsence. I was 50 at the time; in those 2 years my savings, insurance and pension plans were all decimated. And because of my age I never ever got back to my previous earning or job status. I think your judgement is flawed. I voted to improve the future quality of life for my grandchildren, confident that the UK, in rejoining the whole world, is fully capable of giving them the benefits that (according to the Baby Boomer haters); we enjoyed, prior to our memebership of the ECM EEC EU etc!!
Though transaction fees are optional, miners can choose which transactions to process and prioritize those that pay higher fees.[67] Miners may choose transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size, not the absolute amount of money paid as a fee. These fees are generally measured in satoshis per byte (sat/b). The size of transactions is dependent on the number of inputs used to create the transaction, and the number of outputs.[3]:ch. 8
A fork referring to a blockchain is defined variously as a blockchain split into two paths forward, or as a change of protocol rules. Accidental forks on the bitcoin network regularly occur as part of the mining process. They happen when two miners find a block at a similar point in time. As a result, the network briefly forks. This fork is subsequently resolved by the software which automatically chooses the longest chain, thereby orphaning the extra blocks added to the shorter chain (that were dropped by the longer chain).[171]
In October 2013, the FBI seized roughly 26,000 BTC from website Silk Road during the arrest of alleged owner Ross William Ulbricht.[78][79][80] Two companies, Robocoin and Bitcoiniacs launched the world's first bitcoin ATM on 29 October 2013 in Vancouver, BC, Canada, allowing clients to sell or purchase bitcoin currency at a downtown coffee shop.[81][82][83] Chinese internet giant Baidu had allowed clients of website security services to pay with bitcoins.[84]
Another interesting way (literally) to earn bitcoins is by lending them out, and being repaid in the currency. Lending can take three forms – direct lending to someone you know; through a website which facilitates peer-to-peer transactions, pairing borrowers and lenders; or depositing bitcoins in a virtual bank that offers a certain interest rate for Bitcoin accounts. Some such sites are Bitbond, BitLendingClub and BTCjam. Obviously, you should do due diligence on any third-party site.
Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's 500-plus bitcoin forum posts; the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. Because this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time, and the hours of 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. GMT are midnight to 6 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (North American Eastern Standard Time). Other clues suggested that Nakamoto was British: A newspaper headline he had encoded in the genesis block came from the UK-published newspaper The Times, and both his forum posts and his comments in the bitcoin source code used British English spellings, such as "optimise" and "colour".[12]
In March 2013 the blockchain temporarily split into two independent chains with different rules. The two blockchains operated simultaneously for six hours, each with its own version of the transaction history. Normal operation was restored when the majority of the network downgraded to version 0.7 of the bitcoin software.[36] The Mt. Gox exchange briefly halted bitcoin deposits and the price dropped by 23% to $37[37][38] before recovering to previous level of approximately $48 in the following hours.[39] The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for "decentralized virtual currencies" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as Money Service Businesses (MSBs), that are subject to registration or other legal obligations.[40][41][42] In April, exchanges BitInstant and Mt. Gox experienced processing delays due to insufficient capacity[43] resulting in the bitcoin price dropping from $266 to $76 before returning to $160 within six hours.[44] The bitcoin price rose to $259 on 10 April, but then crashed by 83% to $45 over the next three days.[34] On 15 May 2013, US authorities seized accounts associated with Mt. Gox after discovering it had not registered as a money transmitter with FinCEN in the US.[45][46] On 23 June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) listed 11.02 bitcoins as a seized asset in a United States Department of Justice seizure notice pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 881.[47] This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoin.[48][49] The FBI seized about 26,000 bitcoins in October 2013 from the dark web website Silk Road during the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht.[50][51][52] Bitcoin's price rose to $755 on 19 November and crashed by 50% to $378 the same day. On 30 November 2013 the price reached $1,163 before starting a long-term crash, declining by 87% to $152 in January 2015.[34] On 5 December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoins.[53] After the announcement, the value of bitcoins dropped,[54] and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services.[55] Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009.[56]
Bitcoin mining operations take a lot of effort and power, and the sheer amount of competition makes it difficult for newcomers to enter the race and profit. A new miner would not only need to have adequate computing power and the knowledge to use it to outcompete the competition, but would also need the extensive amount of capital necessary to fund the operations.

On 12 March 2013, a bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version 0.7 (due to an undiscovered inconsistency between the two versions). This created a split or "fork" in the blockchain since computers with the recent version of the software accepted the invalid block and continued to build on the diverging chain, whereas older versions of the software rejected it and continued extending the blockchain without the offending block. This split resulted in two separate transaction logs being formed without clear consensus, which allowed for the same funds to be spent differently on each chain. In response, the Mt. Gox exchange temporarily halted bitcoin deposits.[172] The exchange rate fell 23% to $37 on the Mt. Gox exchange but rose most of the way back to its prior level of $48.[56][57]
If you are considering investing in cryptocurrencies, think of it like a trip to Vegas, self-made millionaire and best-selling author Tony Robbins suggests. In his own portfolio, Robbins directs a certain amount of money to risky ventures, but he doesn't rely on them to work out. For those investments, he said, "I know it is just for fun I'm investing, I know I could lose."
Bloomberg reported that the largest 17 crypto merchant-processing services handled $69 million in June 2018, down from $411 million in September 2017. Bitcoin is "not actually usable" for retail transactions because of high costs and the inability to process chargebacks, according to Nicholas Weaver, a researcher quoted by Bloomberg. High price volatility and transaction fees make paying for small retail purchases with bitcoin impractical, according to economist Kim Grauer. However, bitcoin continues to be used for large-item purchases on sites such as Overstock.com, and for cross-border payments to freelancers and other vendors.[136]
The receiver of the first bitcoin transaction was cypherpunk Hal Finney, who created the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPOW) in 2004.[21] Finney downloaded the bitcoin software on its release date, and on 12 January 2009 received ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.[22][23] Other early cypherpunk supporters were creators of bitcoin predecessors: Wei Dai, creator of b-money, and Nick Szabo, creator of bit gold.[24] In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin.[25]
According to The New York Times, libertarians and anarchists were attracted to the idea. Early bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: "At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state."[119] The Economist describes bitcoin as "a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks".[122]

IACN Symposium will be held on the campus of Palmer College of Chiropractic in Port Orange Florida on November 13-15, 2015. We are finalizing arrangements for the Friday Reception and Saturday Night Banquet location on the ocean at Daytona Beach Shores. We are looking for suggestions for topics and speakers for a slot or two that we have this year, and certainly for next year. So far, along with a strong electrodiagnosis program led by Dr. J. Don Dishman, our subjects include an interactive grand rounds panel discussion (audience participation devices supplied), "Brain & Peripheral Nervous System Dissection Lab" (attendance strictly limited), "Vaccines & the Nervous System"; "Functional Neurology Update 2015"; "Chiropractic Specialties and ObamaCare", "The Nervous System / Immune System Link", "Cervical Adjustment and Stroke: Update 2015", "Vestibular Disorders and Rehabilitation", "Laser Therapy and NMS Disease: A Literature Review", "Neurology of the Chiropractic Subluxation" and "Inflammation and Neuro-Degeneration".
Of course, I am more interested in the carved prime rib banquet dinner where we can heckle our host, Dr. Don Dishman!
Please log in and join the discussion as the education committee verifies the speakers and topics. The time to comment for Symposium 2015 is RIGHT NOW! Do you like the direction? Any last minute suggestions? Thoughts for next year?
I think this will be the biggest IACN event ever, because I talk to a lot of our docs and almost everyone says they plan to attend. Thanks again for your loyal IACN membership and participation, I don't think that you have missed one of our meetings in a long while and I am glad to hear you are planning to attend again in November.
Thanks Dr. Ferezy for putting together a very successful event. The speakers were great...even the weather cooperated!
For me, the event was a lot like a family reunion. Fills me with both pride and joy seeing everyone. Dr. Dishman and I have already spent about 3 hours planning next years event, and I promise you, everyone will be BLOWN AWAY by our aggressive symposium expansion, faculty selection and topics. More on that soon.
The symposium was a fantastic coalition of quality lectures and terrific meet and greet opportunities with my neurology buds including Dr. Ferezy and Kathy. It amazes my to see how both the CNS anatomy and function is so well absorbed and presented by our lecturers. Love the boost to my plasticity these meetings afford.
"I have no ambition in this world but one, and that is to be a fireman. The position may, in the eyes of some, appear to be a lowly one; but we who know the work which the fireman has to do believe that his is a noble calling. Our proudest moment is to save lives. Under the impulse of such thoughts, the nobility of the occupation thrills us and stimulates us to deeds of daring, even of supreme sacrifice."

The Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group, which manages the port complex of Ningbo and Zhoushan in China, decided to join the International Association of Ports and Harbors. That was confirmed following the Maritime Silk Road Port International Cooperation Forum, which took place in Ningbo mid-June.
IAPH President Santiago Garcia Milà gave a keynote address at the Forum and met on this occasion with Ni Chenggang, the Vice General Manager of Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group to conclude the membership arrangement (photo).
“We are delighted to welcome Ningbo Zhoushan Port Group as a member of our organisation”, said the IAPH President, “With the ever-growing impact of the Chinese Belt and Road strategy, we look forward to working together to boost trade and stimulate economic growth across Asia and beyond.” Ningbo and Zhoushan represent the largest port complex in the world. In 2017, the port group handled a total cargo throughput of one billion tons. The port complex is part of the Maritime Silk Road and has the largest deep-water facilities in China. The port’s maritime connections increased substantially after China’s Belt and Road initiative. In addition, the port launched sea-rail transport services with trains providing services to more than thirty cities in China as well as countries in central and northern Asia and eastern Europe. The container handling volume of its sea-rail transport is expected to surpass 400,000 TEU this year, a 60 percent increase compared to 2017. Ningbo-Zhoushan handled over 10 million TEU from countries along the Belt and Road in 2017, up 16 percent compared to 2016.
“With the Ningbo-Zhoushan Port Group joining IAPH we are considerably strengthening our membership base in China”, concluded Mr Garcia Milà. “This ties in very well with next year’s IAPH World Ports Conference, which we are organising in Guangzhou, at the historical origins of the Silk Road.”
Dipika Jain/Dinesha Samararatne, Mapping the Construction of the "Public" in Public Interest Litigation and the Public Trust Doctrine in Indian and Sri Lankan Public Law
Kalyani Ramnath, Terror/Tranquillity: Romesh Thapar and its Precedents Speak on the Subject of 'Public Safety'
Although the short history of public interest litigation (PIL) in India has been replete with questions about efficacy and scope, a lack of information and jurisprudential theory has meant that decisive critiques of PILs have remained rare. This paper offers such a critique via an examination of how PILs transform the relationship between the law and both citizens and the state. PIL claimants are not required to specify a personal harm; rather they identify perceived harms to society which may or may not affect them directly. Although the ability to do so seemingly empowers the public, in fact it broadens the scope of the law to an extent that is detrimental to citizens' interests. There are at least two reasons why PILs weaken citizens vis a vis the state. First, PILs extend the scope of the law so that non-legal methods of critique or resistance become increasingly obsolete. Second, PILs concentrate power in limited and non-elected officials (judges and lawyers) by redirecting disputes over governance to those who are not intended to govern. This paper will use case studies as well as recent social science scholarship to argue that despite the Supreme Court's reputation as a vanguard of liberal democracy in India, the augmentation of judicial powers that is an inevitable effect of public interest litigation is anything but liberal or democratic.
Public interest litigation ("PIL") began to be recognized in the High Courts and Supreme Court since the late seventies and early eighties and provided for various unorthodox remedies, such as continuing mandamus orders by the courts, and the courts� supervisory powers on enforcing interim orders. These remedies and enforcement measures were improved to some extent during the nineties. In the last decade however, the life of public interest petitions in the courts have taken a new avatar, with fewer instances of the courts� supervisory orders to ensure enforcement.
In the case of disability rights, these concerns assume greater importance. The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full participation) Act 2005 ("PWD Act") mainly addressed the rights to equal opportunities in employment and education to persons with disabilities. Along with the rights to equality and non-discrimination, the PWD Act also provides for several socio-economic rights such as provision of reasonable accommodation in education and employment, access to transport and the roads and provision of aids & appliances. While in individual instances of discrimination faced by persons with disabilities, the courts have been very progressive in enforcing the PWD Act, the experience of disability rights groups in public interest petitions has been very different. PILs filed by disability rights groups concerning implementation of the PWD Act with respect to access to transport and public buildings, access to employment by proper identification of jobs with reasonable accommodation and equal access to education for children with disabilities have not been very successful. In these petitions, the courts have failed to use the inventive remedies such as supervisory powers and continuing mandamus orders, to ensure effective implementation.
My paper analyses some of these cases in depth, and argues that there are several reasons for the failure of PILs in the field of disability rights. Disability rights such as provision of reasonable accommodation and access often make budgetary demands and call for state action. The issue of resources coupled with the larger issue that disability rights are still not taken seriously by the courts may be a reason for the failure of PIL for disability rights. My paper would look into these issues and attempt to suggest the way forward.
Mapping the Construction of the "Public" in Public Interest Litigation and the Public Trust Doctrine in Indian and Sri Lankan Public Law
This paper seeks to examine the anxieties around the criminal trial in the age of mass media by analyzing the debates around the emerging notion of 'Trial by Media' in India. It will focus on the discursive strategies that the appellate courts deploy in dealing with this phenomenon, moving between a direct access to the public whom they claim to speak on behalf of to a disavowal of publicity and its impact on the trial process. By claiming the rhetoric of immediacy and presence in emphasizing the value of an open trial based entirely on evidence and testimony before it, the court denies the already textualised and overdetermined nature of trials represented extensively in the media, and tries to maintain the fantasy of an unmediated trial. The paper will analyse the parallel and competing tropes of immediation that get deployed by mass media and the courts and foreground these as crucial to their strategies for legitimation, particularly examining them vis-à-vis ideas of formalism and criminal procedure in common law. The question of immediation is interesting also as a point of comparison between these two regimes of truth and publicity as both are over-determined by the police 'investigation' and swing from blind reliance to fetishized suspicion on the police story, while having to perform an ambivalence towards it through direct access to the parties' testimonies. In this, they undertake the ritual of masking and unmasking the public secret that police investigations in India are all about extracting confessions through torture. These practices will be placed in the context of ideas of publicity underpinning the theory of a modern public trial process.
The paper will take as a case study the legal challenge in 2005 to the release of a Hindi film called "Black Friday" based on a book on the police investigation of the serial bomb blasts in the city still called Bombay in March 1993. The emphasis will be on critically examining how the Bombay High Court judgment, which continues to be the clearest judicial pronouncement on this issue, deals with the question of publicity, its basis being "it is just and necessary that justice must not merely be done but must also appear to have been done." The film was to have an all-India release on January 28, 2005 but could not be released because one of the accused in the trial successfully filed a case asking for an injunction against it arguing that the film in re-enacting the police investigation would pre-judge the accused as guilty and would thus vitiate the trial that was still in process. It would therefore be a "contempt of court" as it would "interfere with course of justice" and also would defame the accused pronouncing them guilty before a public audience before the court has actually done it.
This paper aims to explore the origins of a language of rights in the context of a newly inaugurated Constitution in India. Case law in the first years of the Constitution, exhibit a preoccupation with "public safety" and "maintenance of public order" at the same time that they talk of the freedom of speech and movement that the newly made citizens of the republic are to enjoy. Several terms enter the constitutional schema here -- "public order", "public safety" and "public tranquillity" -- and are placed in a definite hierarchy as judges attempt to resolve challenges on grounds of violations of Fundamental Rights. This paper is an attempt to provide a context to this method of scaling violence that is employed by the court.
A lively discussion on what level of violence undermines the security of the state is evident in Romesh Thapar, a case filed by a newspaper involving a challenge to the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 on grounds of violation of Article 19 (i) (a) and decided by the Supreme Court in May 1950. The precedents that it refers to are an interesting illumination of legal-social developments in late colonial and early independent India -- including the Government of India Act, 1935, the institution of the Federal Court, the Public Safety Acts in the context of Partition and consequent communal riots in 1947- 1949 and finally, the coming into force of the Constitution -- and attempts to evolve, within a judicial decision, "citizen" from subject and separate "criminal" from cause lawyers. In what ways did the transition from colonial to popular government affect the understanding of rights in the judicial imagination, given that a majority of precedents in Romesh Thapar were pre-constitutional? Do legal precedents speak louder than the call to right historical wrongs? In what ways, to parody Foucault, might society be defended from the dangers of public disorder?

The speedometer failed to report the proper speed while driving. The speedometer needle was stuck at the 120 mph mark while travelling at a rate of 50 miles per hour.
2004 Chevy Impala. I go out to start the car and it will not start. I wait 15-20 minutes and it starts. The transmission also shifts hard. The speedometer says I am going 10 when I am going faster than that or it may say 100 when it is parked. Please, recall this.
Was driving along and all of a sudden my speedometer started "floating". it would be all over the place, some times it would go all the way around to 120 and other times it would be right on.
I bought a used 2004 Chevrolet Impala and October 19, 2007 and a few months after I had the vehicle the speedometer stopped working. My speed odometer said I was doing forty when I got pulled over for doing 55mph, and as I pulled off and looked at the speedometer it was stuck at 40mph. Also the lights go out at any given time on their own. I was driving home one night and my head lights shut off in the middle of a curve and I hit the brakes and slid off the road. This is a real safety hazard. After I fooled around with the highbeam switch for a while the lights started working again.
The headlights keep cutting out with increased frequency with all exterior lights including the dash lights. Also, the speedometer will stop working and just keep increasing until it points straight down. Both have happened several times.
While driving on the open highway, the speed odometer incorrectly records the speed. It will get stuck at a number higher than zero, eg. Speed odometer shows 60 yet rate of speed may only be 40, thus causing a safety hazard on the highway. This issue is well documented on the internet.
The speedometer started getting stuck about six months ago. For about eight months I have noticed that when I turn the steering wheel I hear a noise in the front of the car, like a knock or something. Also within the last couple of months I have also smelled gas when I first start the car, my husband could not see any leakage or anything until last week. It was leaking from the fuel regulator valve. Now the transmission is starting to shift hard sometimes. I haven't had the money to get it all checked out by the manufacturer but I was wondering if there have been any complaints on any of these things. Also I can hear a whistling sound when I press the accelerator. And my husband just informed me that he bought a regulator valve for it and some O rings because something is leaking antifreeze slightly. Can you help please!!!!!!!!
2004 Impala ls, speedodmeter erratic then just failed. In park I am going approx 160 mph. Contacted GM to try and get it covered, the said no. In time car has now gone over 70K miles. Will have to fix on my dime ( approx $700). Many other 2004 GM types all having the same issue. Service dept agrees and had 2 other 2004 Impala's in shop for the same failure.
We bought an Impala Chevrolet 2004 new in 2004. There were a few problems with it. Instrument panel cluster -and speedometer gauge did not work and noises came from the instrument panel. Steering gear popped/clanking noise heard and sensed from front end. Also, seemed like something was wrong with the transmission because it did not change gears correctly, and it kind of bumped when accelerating, appeared as if engine did not want to accelerate. There was a delayed start, may be necessary to hold key in start several seconds until starting or turning back and trying again. Sometimes key locked in and won't turn. Took to dealer, but it did not do it for them. On the steering gear the steering intermediate shaft was replaced on 11/19/05. Again the noise was back and on 07/17/07 the steering intermediate shaft was lubricated. On other issues repairs are to costly. Do not feel secure on vehicle these problems have been going on for the past two years.
: the contact stated the speedometer failed while traveling 70 mph. When the vehicle was stopped, the speedometer remained at the 70 mph mark. The service dealer and manufacturer were notified.
: the contact stated while driving various speeds, the speedometer intermittently provided an incorrect reading. The dealer and manufacturer were not alerted.
: the contact stated the vehicle speedometer locked at 60 mph, and did not keep an accurate speed above 60 mph. The vehicle was not taken to a dealer.
: the contact stated after starting the vehicle and shifting into reverse, the engine revved without warning and accelerated out of control hitting several obstacles. The vehicle was totaled. The dealer has been alerted.
On September 27, 2005 I rented a Chevrolet Impala from avis on w 76th St in New York city. While sitting stopped at a stop light later that day in hartford, ct, the car suddenly accelerated for about 2 seconds with what appeared to be full throttle into the car directly in front of it while full brake pressure was being applied. About one second went by and it happened once more, striking the car in front of us. Since there was such a small distance between the cars the car was not able to reach a high speed, but there was a strong jolt when striking the other car. After turning the car off and inspecting for damage none was found to either vehicle but in other circumstances this could have been much more dangerous. I called avis roadside assistance and requested that a car be brought to me because I was afraid to drive the car any more. I was told that if the car was drivable I had to bring it to an avis location myself. Later that night, I drove the vehicle to the avis location at the bradley airport in hartford and the car accelerated suddenly again. Thankfully there was no car in front of me. I returned the car and was given an exchange.
The speedometer failed to operate. The vehicle was at two different dealers', and they were unable to correct the problem. Consumer was concerned that he was unable to judge how fast the vehicle was traveling.

Here we are, bright eyed and bushy tailed on another lovely Monday morning. As I said to Lovey this morning, only about 260 more Mondays before the 5 year plan is in effect. In the meantime, we’ll just keep on trucking, one week at a time. And we’ve got a fun one ahead (and when I say we, I mostly mean me). Of course, there are the regular T-25 mornings and the Monday/Wednesday/Friday yoga and the Tuesday/Thursday stretching, but we’re adding on a Monday pole class, Tuesday Zumba, Wednesday shooting range, Thursday chiropractor, and a weekend in Crested Butte.
Crested, where my love of all things Colorado began. It’s where I first tried snowboarding…and got a concussion (although not my first one). It’s where I gained a little self-confidence. It’s where I met famous people. It’s where I felt at home and had a damn good time. So much good food and too many great drinks. And a great note for being late to work due to a pot pie explosion. Let the good times roll.
Back to the present, back to reality. Back to the realization that my body wants to work out daily or make me pay hardcore on Monday for not exercising over the weekend. Mind you, I wasn’t a total slug. I did do some pretty intense stretching on Sunday as we sat out in the sun. Nothing warms up your muscles (to the point that I was sweating) like some good old, natural sunlight. If you’ve been following soccer at all, you’ve maybe seen the sniper video. I have moments wherein that is exactly how I feel. There’s one spot in my left leg under my glutes that, at times, feels like someone shot me, or at least stung me really good with a large rubber band. Sniper! Yeah, I keep stretching it. Gently though. Most of the time.
One of my big realizations is that by the time the weekend rolls around, I’m so beat down from work and working out, that I never want to do anything productive. I have a list just under a mile long of things that I want/need to do – clean the house, at least write an outline, study SQL, stretch more, exercise – and pretty much none of it gets done. I’ve really gotta work out how to not just go into a weekend coma starting Friday at 6pm.
In other news, the waiting is down to about 2 days to see if I’ll be performing (not competing because, realistically, I’m not at the talent level of some others) in the Colorado Pole Championship. I still am wavering between ‘why in the world did I submit and put myself in this position, please don’t let me get in’ and ‘I really hope I get in’. In the case that it’s the latter and not the former, I’m still stretching like a maniac. I may need to up my strength training, but that can wait until next week when I know for sure. I don’t want to unnecessarily bulk up because that’s what happens. There’s no being tone and getting strong. My body only understands building more muscle to get strong and hulking out of my clothes. HULK SMASH!
Since I’ve just under a million things to take care of today, and yes, I exaggerate; I’m off to take care of business. Hasta la pasta folks!
"Roseanne" was canceled Tuesday following a racist tweet posted by star Roseanne Barr about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.
Barr tweeted that Jarrett, who is African-American and was born in Iran, is like the "muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby."
I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.
A short time later, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said in a statement that the network has decided to cancel the "Roseanne" reboot.
On "Outnumbered Overtime," Fox News contributor Jessica Tarlov said Barr's tweet was an example of "blatant racism."
"Roseanne Barr is a racist," Tarlov stated, pointing out that Barr has had a history of making anti-Semitic remarks on Twitter.
She noted that before the cancellation announcement, comedian and "Roseanne" consulting producer Wanda Sykes said she was leaving the show over Barr's racist remark.
"That's the importance of people standing up and saying, 'I will not participate in something that espouses those values and those views,'" Tarlov said.
U.S. Army Special Forces veteran Jim Hanson said Monday that French President Macron's apparent jab at President Trump's nationalistic views was "unnecessary."
In his "Swamp Watch" segment Sunday, Steve Hilton took a look at Rep. Maxine Waters and how she has apparently used her public office to protect her investments, benefit her friends and enrich her family.
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley joined Steve Doocy on "Fox & Friends" to weigh in on the "investigation onslaught" that Democrats plan to launch against the Trump White House now that they control the House.
'They'd Be a Gas Station Masquerading as a Country': Graham Urges Germany, France to Join Trump Against Russia | Fox News Insider
'They'd Be a Gas Station Masquerading as a Country': Graham Urges Germany, France to Join Trump Against Russia
Senate Armed Services Committee Member Lindsey Graham said President Trump is laying the groundwork for decimating Russia's remaining prowess on the world stage.
Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said on "The Story" that Trump's decision to expel diplomats after Russia allegedly poisoned other diplomats on British soil will "pay dividends over time."
Additionally, about two dozen other countries expelled Russian diplomats, and Trump demanded the closure of a Russian consulate in Washington State.
Martha MacCallum told Graham that Trump spoke Tuesday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.
Graham said that if Trump can convince the two European allies to side with him and fight strongly against Russian aggression internationally, it will expose the economic weakness of the Russian Federation.
Graham said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is remaining a key player due in part to his nuclear capabilities and alliances with or support for nations like Syria and North Korea.
He alluded to the fact that, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian economy otherwise has largely been based on oil production and exports.
"If [Trump] could rally the world to push back against Russian aggression, and hit them economically... then Putin is basically a gas station masquerading as a country," Graham said.
He said the meetings will be a diplomatic version of "flying the NATO-American flag in Putin's face."
At this point I think most open minded people believe that neither Kerry nor the Swift Vets recollections of Kerry’s brief period in Vietnam are entirely accurate. Time may reveal one or the other as having more veracity, but it seems unlikely either side will be able to completely discredit the other within the timeframe of this election. While this means it’s unlikely the Swift Vets will be able to turn Kerry’s military service into a negative, it does effectively neutralize the “crown jewel” issue for the Kerry Campaign. Without his Vietnam achievements, Kerry is little more than a uniquely unaccomplished 4 term Democratic Senator from a particularly Democrat friendly state who knows how to speak French and windsurf. This will force him to run on the issues and his legislative record which for a Senator who doesn’t seem to believe in anything other than John Forbes Kerry will make it difficult to counter a Bush campaign that seems to have regained its momentum. The completely foreseeable, preventable Dukakis-Snoopy/Dean-Scream moment for this campaign may have been during the Democratic convention when “Lieutenant Kerry report[ed] for Duty”. It was Kerry’s compulsion for self-aggrandizement that made it inevitable.
Neal Stephenson, author of several science fiction-ish opus's as quoted in Locus Magazine: “The analogy (which I've used a lot before) is to the electric guitar. Thomas Edison made electricity into a consumer product and developed the light bulb, probably anticipated washing machines and stuff, but he sure didn't anticipate the electric guitar! That was far too weird of an idea. No one could have predicted that the descendants of slaves could have adopted this and come up with what would become the dominant form of popular music in the whole world. That's the kind of thing real societies do with real technology. One of the things [William] Gibson has achieved is that he put some of that into his world. We've got information technology. How is it going to be used, not just by engineers who design products but by regular people who pick this stuff up and turn it to their own weird ends? Spam is another thing kind of like the electric guitar, though it's much darker, less palatable. Clearly the people who originated the technology never in their wildest dreams could have imagined that everyone on Earth who has e-mail would get 30 penis enlargement advertisements a day!”
Similarly we have the blogosphere (I find that term kinda goofy, but 'in the parlance of our times'...) as part of the internet, morphing from your average weblog/online diary sort of thing to a tool that seems to be taking on that somewhat antiquated/monolithic form of information distribution, in the "media". The Belmont Club makes an apt comparison: "Yet for good or ill, the genie is out of the bottle. Before the Gutenberg printing press men knew the contents of the Bible solely through the prism of the professional clergy, who could alone afford the expensively hand copied books and who exclusively interpreted it. But when technology made books widely available, men could read the sacred texts for themselves and form their own opinions. And the world was never the same again."
For most of us Bloggin' is pretty much a really fast and convient way to get ideas out of our heads so they can play with others. Now I'm talking to the contributers mostly, but this should go for everyone. If you've got a story, tell it. If you have a thought or point of view you want to vet, get it up here and see what happens. In the words of the immortal Lucas of "Lucas with the Lid off" fame: "Whatever bubbles, bubbles up". One way or another this blog should meet it's weird (bubbly) end.
Most of these changes seem to be physical. Like how Ben has been able to (gleefully) pull out gray hairs from my head that I was completely oblivious to. I was temporarily relieved when he hadn't found one in a while, but he just said that he had stopped because it seemed to freak me out. Right. Then I found my first cluster of spiderveins swirling and scattering bluely right by my knee. A small patch, but evidence of my deterioration nonetheless. Perhaps the most troubling sign is the regularity of my bowels. I remember when I gave little thought to them--they expelled themselves freely and whimsically, with not a pattern to be seen. (This was a positive, I assure you). Now, I have a Pattern. Every morning, approxiomately 10 minutes after starting on my coffee, I start to feel the familiar rumblings. I'm reminded of my dad, who makes his regular trip to the bathroom just after dinner, newspaper or tv guide in hand, to spend a good 20 minutes letting his colon do it's dirty business. Right now I am pretty speedy at my task, but I am sure it is only a matter of time before I need Assistance in the form of a trusted friend--a book, today's paper, etc...
And what's more, my actions and activities have taken on a particularly Old Person tone to them. This whole drinking coffee thing--that's Old. I have my schedule--I get my medium coffee (cream and one sugar) from the Dunkin Donuts down the street from work. Maybe I'll toss in a sesame bagel (toasted with plain cream cheese). A few years ago I wouldn't have imagined myself being a coffee slave. Now I find myself crashing in the afternoon without it, and engaging in the cliched coffee work banter. ("Oh, don't talk to me, I haven't had my coffee!" or "Looks like someone hasn't had their coffee yet!" HA!) Add to that that the most exciting event in my life has been joining a local knitting group (We even have a clever knitting related club name!), and I have pretty much set myself up for middle-agedness. So anyone that wants to talk about back pain and different types of insurance plans--Look me up.
I would really like Kerry's people to come out with something as persuasive as this or this (relates to most recent SwiftVet ad), instead of layering on equally annoying counter-offensives that advocate the numbing of first amendment rights.
But then there are quibbles with the factchecking so who knows? In the end it seems that this bit should be a campaign aside, yes Kerry is staking his relevancy as candidate on his war record, but so is Bush. Which of these wars should be more important now?
Here is a take on the whole Swiftboatvet's ad campaign. It seems reasonable to say that not all of the groups out there creating partisan ads are going about them the same way and the only spots that should carry weight are those that actually make it to TV, their intended destination. If that is the standard (I'm open to argument), Moveon.org doesn't share that much in common with the swifties aside from creating partisan ads. However a good portion of this mess could be solved by Kerry actually releasing his full records

Summary: The purpose of the study was to develop and apply an instrumentedprocedure for deciding the relative importance of a tentative set ofprofessional competencies proposed for middle school teachers of English,using the judgmental ratings by individuals in the general school communityas the decision-making base. The results of this rating procedurewere intended to demonstrate one way in which the broader educationalcommunity could be involved in expressing choices and in setting prioritiesfor programs of competency-based teacher education. A selected group of 50 senior high school students, 50 teachers of middle school English, 50 educational leaders, and 50 patrons of middleschools in the south central administrative area of the Broward County,Florida, public school system were asked to rate a set of 12 general competenciesand 60 subcompetencies according to their perceived importancefor training and/or certificating teachers of English who work with middleschool pupils of ages 10 through 14. The subjects used a forced-choicerank order rating system that resulted in a rank value for each of thegeneral competencies and subcompetencies in the study. Strategies, administrativesteps, and public relations materials for reaching each of thetargeted groups were incorporated in the details of the procedure. The procedure developed by the study proved feasible and useful for determining the relative order of importance assigned to the proposedteacher competencies for middle school English by the vestedinterest groups who served as raters. Applications of the procedureare recommended for use by collaborative bodies which seek systematicways to broaden the base of public involvement in decision-making forteacher education.viii

After my recent brain fart storm, I find myself scrambling round the MSS of ‘Darkness’ tidying up loose ends. In making one story / character change, I’ve unleashed a cascade effect. While this does not alter the planned ending, it has sent the intermediate story skittering off in a new direction. Whilst this is not a completely unfortunate happenstance, it’s a lot of hard work reading and re-reading to clean up the glitches. Massively time consuming.
All this, day job, and Angie wanting me to help with her Canadian History Teachers course. Just been reading the unit on accounts of first contact in British Columbia by the Simon Fraser expedition, and to be honest it’s so dry I can hardly keep my eyes open. Great cure for insomnia. Although I’d prefer a large whiskey.

AD Calvo (aka Alejandro Daniel) directed thought-provoking small-town gothic character study Doll in the Dark (aka The Melancholy Fantastic). After I reviewed the film in January 2017 (released, in its second incarnation, by Safecracker Pictures), Alejandro kindly agreed to a short email interview.
What was your original intention when you made The Melancholy Fantastic and how well do you think the film achieved that?
"I set out to make a micro-budget gothic Christmas tale (as my sophomore feature), a psychological horror film that featured a strong female lead. I wanted it to be a film that would be full of beautiful cinematography, rich production design, but whose real strength would come from its performances. I feel the film achieved that on some levels, but the first cut was a stillbirth, and was never really seen under its original title. There were elements that weren't working. It gave me time to contemplate the film and find moments that I felt weren't helping the narrative and goals of my original concept.
"Emotionally I was inspired by Kierkegaard's rather cryptic Sickness Unto Death in which he states how we can become romantically attached to our suffering. The story grew out of that melancholy fantastic passage; a girl, unwilling to let go of her painful past, who instead creates a romantic imaginary world of her own."
"I wrote the story for Amy Crowdis, she hadn't really made any films up until then. She was a stand-in on my first feature (The Other Side of the Tracks) and I immediately felt the camera strongly gravitating to her. She was natural and carefree in front of the camera, and became a muse of sorts for my writing. I wrote another script for her first, a very dark and trippy adaptation of Snow White (long before the wave of dark fairytales, e.g. Snow White and the Huntsman, Blancanieves). My Snow White script turned out to be a bit too weird and more difficult to produce at a micro budget.
"Robin Lord Taylor was very different from how I originally envisioned the character of Dukken - originally I saw him as a more stereotypical goth with dark hair and all (not unlike Penguin, I guess). Robin's audition was so unique and fresh and he made a bunch of different choices so he became the clear favorite for me and my casting director."
"As I said above, time gave me the ability to see it with fresh eyes, and the flaws that seeped into my first cut - I think this answered to me why the film struggled with festival programmers. I wanted to fix it. I felt there was something unique and special in the story and I wanted it to be seen. It was like a child of mine that had never left the house. I makes me really sad to think of that. I had lots of Gotham fans reaching out to me, wanting to see the movie. So in many ways, they gave me the energy to dust it off and finally get it out there. I feel lucky Safecracker believed in it as well."
"I made about 300 edits to the film, both in picture and sound. I'd say narratively, the biggest difference is in silencing much of the expositional (and philosophical) dialogue that was in the first cut. That and quieting down the doll, so that we only heard her whispers. In the first cut the doll spoke way too much and that was taking me out of the narrative and killing the sinister undertone. To be fair, we had little to no money when cutting the original version. I worked with an assistant editor who had never cut a feature on her own. Technically, she was very proficient but the film needed another set of fresh eyes and I didn't have them back then."
"There's a strong tendency towards spiritual magical realism in Latino culture, so I'd say mainly in that way."
"In many ways, Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl (website here) is the sister to this film. I revisited the idea of a sad and lonely girl in a great big house. I tried to amplify the gothic horror/romance frequencies that I'm finding resonate the most in my writing. But I'm only seeing those with the passage of time."

It’s Hallowe’en. I live on Saanich Peninsula, where the farms grow many pumpkins. Today I set out to buy a pumpkin to carve and as a by-product, eat:)
It was crazy. Everywhere I went, they were sold out of pumpkins. I was beginning to despair when I asked the produce manager at the Co-op if he had any pumpkins. He said he was sold out, but that he had obtained a large pile yesterday from Mars Farms, just down the road. I tootled off, and picked up this fine specimen.
I say I feel better at the moment. That I feel up. So why am I sitting in the middle of a graveyard at nearly one am? I like it here. I am away from the bustle. There is no-one else around, I feel no urge to prove myself. No urges at all. Just peace. The stars are out tonight. The street lamps should be turning off soon, the view of the stars then should be amazing. Last track on the CD. I will sit here and enjoy the silence when it is over. Moonlight glisters through the trees. The church bell has just struck a lonesome one. I can't believe that I am sat here barefoot in the middle of the night. It is so peaceful, I don't want to leave, but I am tired and it will take about 45 mins to walk home. A barefoot walk across the lawn and then home. G'nite.

The key to moving forward throughout my recovery has been adapting and figuring out new ways to do things that I used to do, which requires a lot of patience.
Due to a minor pre-existing condition in my eye, I had some complications after the stroke which caused loss of vision in my left eye. Combined with a left visual field cut due to the damage on the right side of my brain and no peripheral vision on the left, I always miss things that approach me from that side. I would always walk into people on my left side. Therefore, I always have to make a conscience effort to completely turn and look before I make a move or walk in that direction. It took a little while to adapt.
It is amazing what the body can do when it needs to heal, adjust and adapt. I have to plan, organize and execute to adapt smoothly. I give myself ample time to complete tasks that I would have been able to do in a fraction of the time. I believe with patience, anything is possible.
The true German knife collectors bible! This is the gold standard, the equivalent of "Goins' Encyclopedia" for German makers of knives, razors, and other forms of cutlery.
The first volume of Anthony Carter's "The Sword and Knife Makers of Germany 1850-2000", covering half the alphabet, was published in 2001. Unfortunately, Carter died the following year before he was able to finish the second volume. Carter was also the owner of the publishing house, so the whole project was in danger of never being finished. Thankfully, due to the foresight and dedication of Christian Cranmer, whose son Alexander was Anthony Carter's godson, this project is finally complete.
This volume has been assembled with the tremendous help and contributions of both John Walter and Henning Ritter and now represents the complete set of makers A to Z in one massive 656-page text with over 2300 illustrations.
This book is absolutely required for anyone with an interest in antique and vintage makers of German cutlery.

City Council votes an abeyance of ordinance to jail developers By Alexandra Cohen De Oro Media Group Las Vegas Tribune Exclusive Tuesday the Las Vegas City Council Recommending Committee voted for an abeyance on the controversial ordinance — Bill No. 2018-24 — sponsored by City Councilman Steve Seroka, a councilman who is being sued in Federal Court by developer Yohan Lowie for bias. This abeyance now moves the bill to the September 4, 2018 Recommending Committee, then to be heard by the full City Council on September 6. The proposed bill will severally penalize developers with excessive fines and jail time for not abiding by new standards. The bill is opposed by the Commercial Real Estate Development Association (NAIOP), The Latin Chamber of Commerce and Laborers Local 872, along with others in the building and trades community. The bill NO.2018-24, also known as the «Yohan Lowie bill,” is an ordinance to amend LVMC Title 19 (The Unified Development Code) to adopt additional standards and requirements regarding the repurposing of certain golf courses and open spaces. The ordinance was met with strong position from those speaking at today’s meeting. Tommy White, Secretary Treasurer of the Laborers Local 872 said “this City Council is sending the wrong message to not only the local building community, but to the entire nation. This is simply government overreach.” Mr. White vowed to bring 600 of his union members to the next meeting to protest the flawed ordinance. Peter Guzman, President of the Latin Chamber of Commerce, stated, “I have received numerous calls from my members opposed to this ordinance. This ordinance is contrary to our group’s philology and focus of promoting commerce and growth in our community.” Todd Davis, General Council, EHB Companies pointed out to the Recommending Committee that “the Agenda states ‘NO FISCAL IMPACT,’ when clearly there is a fiscal impact to taxpayers ranging from substantial legal fees to defend the ordinance, to hundreds of millions of dollars if the ordinance is found to be a taking.” Councilwoman Michele Fiore publically and vehemently objected to the ordinance in the July 18 council meeting and at times verbally sparred with the bill sponsor, Councilman Seroka, citing that the ordinance started as a 5-page ordinance and FAILED in the Las Vegas Planning Commission by a 5 to 1 vote. Now, behind the scenes, it has been expanded to a 13-page document and is being considered for approval. Developer Yohan Lowie, stated, “this is typical of the corruption and disingenuous acts of certain members of the city of Las Vegas who have demonstrated for the past three years, and one of the reasons why I am in litigation with Councilman Seroka and Bob Coffin for the animus they continue to display. They are enacting a law to create criminal penalties for the property no longer being a golf course and no longer being green. All property owners should be concerned.” This bill may be as far-reaching as to affect individual homeowners living in a golf course community. SECTION 7 in the bill states: Whenever in this ordinance any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful... the doing of such prohibited act or the failure to do any such required act shall constitute a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by imprisonment for a term of not more than six months. Mr. Lowie has hired famed criminal defense lawyer David Chesnoff to represent his interests in possible forthcoming criminal offenses that may arise from this bill. Additionally, along with attorney and Lt. Governor Mark Hutchison the City has been put on notice through a letter, which states the City will be in violation of the EX Post Facto Clause and Equal Protection Clause and a Taking by Eminent Domain. After the July 18 city council meeting, developer Yohan Lowie stated, “If they want to put me in jail, they can. I will fight to my last breath to prevent the City from EVER taking my property away. I will continue to fight this matter all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to get justice.”

For optimal performance, calibrate your newly installed battery: Drain battery below 10%, then charge uninterrupted to 100%.
Your phone's rear cover may have two #000 Phillips screws or Apple's 5-Point "Pentalobe" screws. Check which screws you have, and ensure you also have the correct screwdriver in order to remove them.
During reassembly, we recommend you replace the 5-point screws with equivalent Phillips screws. Our Liberation Kit provides the tools and screws needed to replace the Pentalobe screws with Phillips screws.
Pinch the rear panel with your fingers, and lift it away from the iPhone. Alternatively, use a Small Suction Cup .
Remove the single 1.5 mm Phillips screw securing the battery connector to the logic board (if present).
you do not need to take the battery out as chuck said so you dont run the risk of braking the battery connector socket from the logic board
Won't you need the battery removed to access the large-headed screws on the side which hold the front display?
In my situation, the #00 screwdriver had a hard time trying to get the screws off. Using a glasses screwdriver kit may be a better alternative if the screws are resistant to the #00 screwdriver.
Unfortunately the battery screw was already stripped probably from original assembly. We used a pair of nail clippers as pliers to grab a hold of the screw by the edges to turn it. If it hadn't have been for the stripped screw it would have taken us about 10 minutes, as it was it took us 30-40 minutes if you count searching for solutions for removing the stripped screw.
Use the edge of a plastic opening tool to gently pry the battery connector up from its socket on the logic board.
Be very careful to only pry up on the battery connector and not the socket on the logic board. If you pry up on the logic board socket, you may break it entirely.
I don't see the metal clip covering the antenna connector, in the photo or in my phone. Hope this isn't a deal breaker.
Pull up on the exposed clear plastic tab to peel the battery off the adhesive securing it to the iPhone.
If the tab breaks before the battery is freed, carefully slide a spudger under the battery tab to release the adhesive. Prying in other places may cause damage.
If your replacement battery came in a plastic sleeve, remove it before installation by pulling it away from the the ribbon cable.
Before reassembly, clean metal-to-metal contact points with a de-greaser such as windex. The oils from your fingers have the potential to cause wireless interference issues.
Perform a hard reset after reassembly. This can prevent several issues and simplify troubleshooting.
Note that the pull tab is not actually attached to the battery. It is attached to the iPhone chassis, and is only used to separate the battery from the adhesive. (Don't expect it to come out with the battery!)
Also, the adhesive is VERY strong. I had to use my plastic opening tool to assist in prying the battery loose. This is probably the most nerve-wracking part of the job.
It is much easier to slightly WARM the battery with a HAIRDRYER not a HEAT GUN to soften the adhesive. DO NOT GET BATTERY HOT AND DO NOT USE HEAT GUN
I just did this today. Everything was as scripted. Mine had lots of adhesive and had to use plastic spudger to go around battery to loosen up. Do not use plastic tab until you can see under battery a little bit. Great instructions. Took less than 10 minutes.
The adhesive is very strong and I was initially worried about damaging the phone by prying so much. There are a couple of places below the volume switch where you can pry between the metal of the case and the battery. If you lift the battery just a little, wiggle the pry bar further in and then start moving down the case. Don't worry about bending the battery, its dead anyway.
Do not pry on the left side (circuit board side) and do not use the pull tab until the adhesive is broken loose.
I tried this at first with a plastic pry tool, and the adhesive was so strong that I broke the tool. I then used a large screwdriver and applied pressure very slowly along various places on the outer side of the battery. That eventually did the trick.
To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order. For optimal performance, calibrate your newly installed battery: Drain battery below 10%, then charge uninterrupted to 100%.
The plastic opening tools were amazing flimsy- the tips broke off both of them while trying to get the battery out.
The adhesive attaching the battery was very strong and the pull tab actually ripped, though it did not come off.
When I replace my battery for a new one it says accesory not permited or something like that, and I tried with every single battery I found (iphone 4 GSM, Iphone 4s..) is there something I could do? is the battery of iphone 4 CDMA Verizon different from others?﻿
I have a Verizon iPhone 4. Got it the first day Verizon started selling them over 2 years ago. Followed the guide. Completed the task in 10 mins. The battery adhesive must have weakened some. Did not need to use pull tab at all. Just the pry tool along the outer side of battery as mentioned by other users. Thanks ifixit!! Saved me a contract slot. With a family of 4, that is a big savings.
Has anyone had trouble with the battery draining really really <i.e. 10% in 15 min> fast after removing the battery?
Directions posted above worked perfectly for me. The battery was glued in pretty tight (phone is a couple years old) but was able to pry it out with the tool, working my way around the edges. Total time about 10 minutes.
This was very easy. The plastic tab did breeak off, but it seemed brittle to begin with. I had to use the pry took to separate the bttery from the case, but it came out easily. Reassembly was a bit tricky getting the battery connection lined back into the logic board. Once it was properly aligned it went fast after that. I had ordered the "Liberation Kit" along with the battery and there was no extra cost for the "Kit". This was a great deal. THANK YOU iFixit for helping us peons to fix it ourselves!
The CDMA iPhone 4 battery replacement is quite easy especially if you get the ifixit tool kit with the battery. The tab did break quite easily a hair dryer (not a heat gun) on low helped soften the glue (warm up the battery to soften ) DO NOT BAKE! Took all of 10 Minutes.
Simple and straight forward replacement of battery. Right tools and step by step instructions took less than 10 minutes. IPhone 4 is up and running. $25 total with shipping versus $600 for a new phone and another BS contract with a wireless company where they screw you out of services and make you pay for things when you weren't paying for them before. Thank you Ifixit!
Read comments above before starting. Had no issues at all. Did not strip screw heads and battery was removed easily. Tools worked well and didn't break. Did not have to do a hard restart as well. Now, just need to drain the new battery to 10% so I can fully charge. Learn from others issues and avoid problems by reading the above.
I periodically have physicians come to me from all over the world to spend time learning my techniques and approach to the field of Hair Restoration. I just received a letter from a physician who recently visited with me. This physician has been a practicing Head and Neck Surgeon for 25 years and he is looking to expand his practice to include Hair Restoration. Below is the letter.
I would describe the week as full immersion . You taught the finest details regarding FUE and strip harvesting … And the transplanting itself is art!
Seeing you educate the patient (and me) with respect to the advantages and disadvantages of all options was invaluable.
You are confident, kind, empathetic, and engaging. You do not over promise. During the days there, previous patients consistently returned – thrilled with their results.
Your entire staff was outstanding, and patiently demonstrated and explained to me every step and question I had.
What I especially appreciated was the fact that each treatment was tailored to the patient’s specific needs, and not to the surgeon who might have only one single device or technique available.
Thank you for your very comprehensive training, for your friendship, and for your willingness to stay in touch. I would strongly recommend your training to any highly motivated individual.
Today I will discuss the usage of Rogaine and Propecia for hair loss. Rogaine is an over the counter medication that comes in a liquid form and a foam form and comes in 2% and 5% strengths. For male patients I typically recommend Rogaine foam 5% twice a day after showering and before bed. Rogaine typically works only in the crown region and is best at slowing down the rate of hair loss and in some cases taking the miniaturized hair (hair that is on it’s way out for good) and turning it back into healthy hair. The exact mechanism of Rogaine is unknown, but it is thought to promote increased blood flow to the scalp by relaxing the small blood vessels that supply the blood flow to the scalp. Rogaine 5% is approved for men, and only the 2% formulation is approved for use in women. The 5% formulation may have better efficacy in women, but it can cause hair growth on the face that is reversible when discontinued.
Propecia is an oral medication that is taken once a day. It works by blocking the conversion of testosterone into DHT which can cause hair loss. The effect of taking the medication is that it can regrow hair in some instances and can also convert miniaturized hair that is on the verge of falling out forever into healthy hair, that is cosmetically significant. Propecia is not indicated for use in women.
There have been many claims about Propecia recently, and various side effects it may cause. I typically have all my patients that are considering Propecia read a detailed explanation of all the benefits and possible side effects prior to beginning to take the propecia. I have seen excellent results with patients using propecia, and in my experience younger patients tend to respond the best to this medication.
There is also anecdotal evidence that propecia and rogaine together produce a more significant effect than either medication independent of the other. The exact cause is unknown, but there seems to be some sort of synergy between the two medications.

I just completed a private teaching course with a very skilled physician from Saudi Arabia, Dr. Wissam Adada. He works in a well known medical institution in Riyadh, and came to my clinic to learn my approach and techniques in Hair and Eyebrow Restoration. I always enjoy these teaching opportunities because it allows me to work with a physician one to one and share my knowledge in the field. We had a nice combination of cases including an eyebrow transplant and a number of hair transplants both via follicular unit extraction using the new SAFE scribe and strip harvesting. I look forward to keeping in touch with Dr. Adada as his practice grows and continuing to be a resource for him in the field of Hair and Eyebrow Restoration.

This is a great extension of the existing LinkedIn recommendations that will make finding contacts much easier. However, it seems to be set up to find the most active members of LinkedIn, rather than the best employees: won't someone who has moved between jobs a lot and who uses LinkedIn heavily rank higher? And since you can request recommendations from others, it seems that I'll be receiving yet more annoying "recommend me" emails from now on (I'll have to find the setting to disable them).
One positive outcome could be that more service-based workers could sign up: LinkedIn is good for finding a business partner or business professional, but useless for finding a gardener. In some ways, this could become like the eBay of services, with recommendations acting like a feedback score. The new section is currently focused on the US, but expansion is planned.
LinkedIn also released some new stats: they had 7.7 million members as of September, up from 5 million in March. Revenue is growing at twice the rate of signups, with money being made on premium accounts, job listings and ads. In short, they're doing just fine.

With over 50 million users, LinkedIn continues to be among the most popular social networking sites for business professionals, offering a variety of features for its users. One such feature, Groups, allows members the opportunity to create and manage groups focused on a wide range of business-related subjects, and some of the largest groups have hundreds of thousands of members and rival many niche social networks outside of LinkedIn in terms of size and activity.
Groups offer valuable networking opportunities for their participants, who gain access to resources and information that can be beneficial for their careers. If you are considering starting a LinkedIn group or want to increase the effectiveness or reach of your current group, the 8 tips below can help.
LinkedIn provides a wide range of tools that allow you to stay connected with your members in ways that feel personal. The Templates feature allows you to provide automatic responses to new members, and even to those requesting to join your group. It's an easy way to envelope new members into your community. But you don't have to limit yourself to early interactions.
Most members would be pleased to receive a note congratulating them on an accomplishment, or to read your comment on a discussion topic they started. As Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and CTO of HubSpot observes, "LinkedIn groups are all about community and bringing people with common interests together."
He should know: his group, OnStartups, is the fourth-largest on LinkedIn with a membership that exceeds 113,000.
Establishing posting guidelines and displaying them prominently (in a featured discussion) is an easy way to help new members get acquainted with your group. Such guidelines generally provide users with community contacts, encourage them to post information in appropriate sections, and specify conduct that can get them banned (spam or attacking other group members, for example).
Making everyone aware of the rules also gives you a reference point when you have to handle a difficult situation with a member.
Encourage member participation by praising and highlighting valuable contributions to the group. This incentivizes others to share their content and engage. If you encounter negative or counterproductive behavior from a member, it's important to be professional and civil. Should it become necessary to issue a warning, handle the matter privately. Apart from unusually egregious behavior or spam, it's also a good idea to give a member a warning or two before banning them from the group. Ultimately, it's up to you to use your best judgment.
One of the biggest complaints about LinkedIn Groups is the number of people who join simply to promote themselves or their business — and then hijack the group discussion boards to do so. They usually aren't interested in engaging with others and can have a negative impact on your community. One way to manage these bombarders is by designating a place, like a Subgroup, for group members to promote their service offerings.
Subgroups are automatically available to all of your group members and are easy to set up. Highlighting this promotional opportunity satisfies those who want to self-promote and keeps your discussion boards open for business. You can also feature members in other ways, such as in your occasional emails to the group membership or in a featured discussion that you update regularly.
To keep a steady stream of content available for members to discuss, use the "Manage news feeds" feature to add the RSS feeds for your blog or other blogs to the News section. The posts will then become automatically available to the members of your group for reading and discussion. Of course, you don't want to flood the boards with self-promotion, so if you aren't getting enough news inputs from your users, you may want to remove the feed and update the news section with a variety of content manually.
It's natural for members to seek to make non-LinkedIn connections after being active in your group for awhile. You can offer a range of options to help your members engage elsewhere on the Internet or offline.
Women 2.0, an organization for women entrepreneurs in technology, has a LinkedIn group founded by Angie Chang with over 18,000 members. This group provides numerous opportunities for members to connect apart from the group. Members can share their Twitter handles in a featured discussion, or participate in a Women 2.0 Startup Essentials Workshop for face-to-face interaction. Depending on the size of your group, you might consider starting a Meetup group for local interaction, hosting a webinar, or arranging a dinner or meeting at an industry conference or event.
Use LinkedIn's Polls application to get feedback from your members on group features and functionality. Create a free poll and then highlight it in your group, either by linking to it on the discussion boards or by submitting the poll's URL to your News section. Be careful; if you make the poll available in the general directory, your responses won't be limited to group members — anyone on LinkedIn can respond.
The sheer size of LinkedIn means that your group is likely to get some members without much effort on your part. But this shouldn't be an incentive to neglect promotional tools. Some of the strategies you can use to promote your group include low-hanging fruit like inviting others in your network to join, encouraging members to invite their colleagues, and by highlighting your group to other, non-competing groups (LinkedIn members can belong to up to 40 groups simultaneously).
Shah took his group to the next level by promoting it on his standalone OnStartups blog as a static link, as well as in specific articles. He issued this call to action to potential members: "Are you passionate about startups? Then, connect with other like minded people in the LinkedIn OnStartups group". He even created a custom URL (http://linkedin.onstartups.com) that was co-branded, catchy, easy to remember, and short enough to fit on Twitter.
Google has launched a new version of Google+ for Android, complete with a new look, a new UI and support for Ice Cream Sandwich.
Version 2.1 of the updated Android app provides a cleaner and more streamline version of the app that is consistent with the design changes implemented in Android 4.0. Notifications have been moved to the top right, the interface has been tightened and photos have been enhanced and enlarged. Even profile pictures have been enlarged to improve the user experience.
"We worked closely with the Android team as they developed Android 4.0 (aka Ice Cream Sandwich), so you'll see the same attention to beauty and simplicity in our new design," Google product manager Ben Eidelson explained in a Google+ post.
According to the release notes, Google+ for Android features improvements to battery life, navigation, performance and notifications. The app also includes a new UI for posting to Google+ and support for Google Apps.
Google+ for Android looks and feels sexier with the changes. We're hoping that the iPhone version gets the same facelift soon as well. Check out screenshots of the new app in the gallery above, and let us know what you think of it in the comments.
The hipKey, a new Bluetooth device designed to keep track of your personal items, is now available in the U.S. Apple Online store. We first saw hipKey at the 2013 International CES and, while it's not the only Bluetooth tracking device out there, we were impressed with its design and function.
The hipKey is shaped like a tiny crescent moon, made of smooth aluminum that attaches to your bag or keys. Or, as some have pointed out, you can attach it to a child who has a tendency to wander, or perhaps a pet. We like the design because the function keys are hidden inside the crescent, making them difficult to press by accident.
By using low-energy Bluetooth 4.0, it has a range of about 50 meters, or 164 feet, and battery life is purportedly between three and four weeks. The battery can be recharged via micro-USB.
The hipKey app offers a little more functionality than other Bluetooth trackers we've seen, like the SticknFind. Like the others, it has an Alarm mode which warns you if your iPad or iPhone leaves your side. However, it also has a Safe Zone feature that lets you control and personalize locations. So if you're engrossed in texting on your phone and your iPad slowly leaves your side, the alarm will sound. But if you're home and your partner or kid grabs the iPad to look something up, it won't sound because that's been designated a safe zone.
The Find Me mode is helpful for those of you who constantly forget where you put things. Pushing the button triggers an alarm that sends you the location of your bag or iPad. The Motion mode alerts you if someone moves the item attached to the hipKey, helpful if you're not in a position to keep an eye on things.
Lastly, the Child mode helps keep track of your kids in a crowded public place. Or if you want to cheat at Hide-and-Seek. You can set a perimeter that the kids are allowed to be in, but once they leave that area, the alarm sounds to warn you they're out of range. You can then use the Find Me feature to locate them.
I haven't used these tracking devices on kids but having seen enough toddlers walking around busy streets and malls with a real leash or tether tied around their waist that I think this might be a good option.
The hipKey first launched in European Apple Online Stores in December and quickly sold out. The U.S. version will cost $89.

In photography, a diptych is a pair of photographs placed side by side to form one single artistic statement or comparison. The images can be identical or similar in composition, they can show different angles of the same scene, or they can demonstrate polar opposites such as morning and night, old and new, or before and after.
Diptychs are great because they can deliver twice the storytelling impact of a single image. We want you to try this technique for this week's round of our Mashable Photo Challenge.
You can use Photoshop on your computer or any collage app on your smartphone to combine your images. Feel free to check out this Flickr group for some diptych inspiration.
Follow the directions below to submit your photos by Tuesday, Dec. 3, at 12 p.m. ET. We'll feature some of our favorite ones on Mashable, as well as on our Facebook album, Pinterest board and Google+ page.
While a solid, clean backdrop does draw attention to the main subject, sometimes objects look better when photographed in front of relevant backgrounds.
Flash will reflect off a glass window, so it's likely that your photo will look like one giant beam of light. Since that isn't what you want, get close to your window and shoot without flash, or open your window for an even clearer view without reflections.
Get creative with your diptychs -- if you want to add an old-school touch, you can combine two Polaroid or Fujifilm Instax Mini images.
The most ideal conditions for taking panoramic photos are scenes that have a single subject (preferably unmoving) and whose broad surroundings are rich in color and serve to enhance that subject.
First, clear the surrounding area of any harsh light to prevent glare. If this is not possible, move around and try photographing from different angles to reduce glare.
Next, try reducing the brightness of your screen. This will make taking a photo with both a well exposed screen and well exposed background easier.
Finally, if you have an external flash, point it toward your background rather than directly at your screen.
It can be hard to perfect symmetry in a photo -- often times you'll find that there is an uneven weight distribution in your shot. When this happens, look for a point of interest and make it the center of your photo -- then balancing both sides will become a lot easier.
When guest curator Andreas Wonisch shoots skyscape photos, he makes sure to include part of the landscape as well. "It works wonders to show something interesting in the foreground to lead into the rest of the image."
When guest curator Victor Bezrukov photographs shadows, he makes sure to wait for the perfect moment to click his shutter. "The bicycle was already tied when I found it, but the challenge was to wait to catch the strong light of the passing cars," he said.
When guest curator Marla Meridith photographs food for her food and lifestyle blog, she looks for the best ingredients and the most colorful settings. "Find the freshest, most vibrant ingredients," she says. "And don't be afraid to carefully color enhance!"
Guest curator Vivienne Gucwa uses Lightroom, the Nik Software Suite and VSCO to edit her non-mobile photographs. "Try to notice all of the editing functions that change for each preset," she says. "Then play around with each function to understand the effect it can have on your photography."
When editing his photos, guest curator Paul R. Giunta only tweaks the exposure, white balance, and contrast. "I never touch the sharpen slider or saturation," he says. "I want the photographs to represent exactly what it looked like during the show."
Guest curator Kim Landgraf uses Adobe Lightroom and Silver Efex Pro 2 to edit his photos after shooting in RAW. "The RAW format gives you much more freedom for editing afterwards," he says.
Guest curator David Gamboa takes amazing #jumpstagrams in unique settings. "Shooting from very low, at eye-level and high up can alter a photo in crazy ways," he says. "Try some of them out and see what I mean."
Guest curator Adam Senatori, who specializes in aerial photography, makes subtle adjustments to his photos before publishing them. "Adjusting color temperature and contrast are critical to any photo," he says. "But I use most adjustments sparingly, never overdo anything! Subtle is best." He also believes photos taken on an iPhone require different edits than photos taken on a DSLR. "For the iPhone I typically bump up the temp," he says. "I feel that native iPhone shots are on the cool side."
When photographing silhouettes, it can be easy to accidentally overexpose your scene. Guest curator Nicole S. Young uses specific techniques to make sure this doesn't happen. "If your metering mode is set to something such as 'spot metering,' then you'll end up exposing for the subject and overexposing your sky," she said. "So you will need to do one of two things: underexpose your photograph (this will make your subject black and your sky properly exposed), or pre-focus the camera and point it at the sky so it meters for the light in the sky, and not the light from your subject."
Guest curator Alex Koloskov specializes in splash photography. "To get a decent splash shot with only one light source, use clear water (or any other clear liquid) and highlight the background, not the splash itself," he says.
Guest curator Rose Sauquillo takes a lot of shots of walls head-on, but still manages to give them a sense of depth. "Depth can be achieved by adding a vignette, making a colorful subject the focal point, how you compose the shot, or through lighting," she says.
Our guest curator Zak Shelhamer says timing and composition are key elements in good photography. You can use wearable cameras such as the GoPro, the JVC ADIXXION, or the Sony Action Cam to take perfectly timed shots of yourself in action. "Your photos should be able to show viewers what you're seeing and what it feels like to be where you are," Shelhamer says.
Our guest curator Timmy McGurr takes hundreds of photos at a time, but is very selective when choosing his final few to publish. "Just because you shoot a bunch of images from a bunch of different angles doesn't mean you need to post it all," he says. "Learning how to edit and how to decipher what to publish and what not publish is just as important."
Dave Fung and Yena Kim, co-founders of Menswear Dog, use programs and apps like Photoshop, Camera+, Instagram and Hipstamatic regularly. "Effects can make a quirky photo even more whimsical by giving it a vintage feel," they say. "Any number of filters and effects in Camera+ and Photoshop can achieve this."
Guest curator Finn Beales does freelance photography often using just his iPhone. He uses Average Camera Pro and Slow Shutter Cam to take long exposure shots, and then VSCO Cam and AfterLight to add finishing touches to his photos. "Because of the long exposure time, you shouldn't hold your phone in your hands," he says. "Either use a tripod or lean it against something to get sharp results."
Guest curater Dylan Isbell makes sure to steer away from the obvious and capture the things that might be a bit hidden. "Look up, down… all around," he says. "Also look beyond the reflection of yourself to see what play in front and behind you."
Our guest curator Matt Lutton values consistency when he photographs. He uses the same programs each time he edits his photos in order to maintain similar colors and movement. "I try to be as consistent with editing and toning as possible," he says. "These two photos were taken months and hundreds of miles apart, but when next to each other they evoke the same feelings and emotions."
Our Mashable Photo Challenge guest curator Kevin Truong believes light is everything in photography. "Whether it's soft or harsh, from a window or a flash, when used effectively it can beautifully set the mood for the photograph," he says.
Our guest curator Liz Eswein uses two apps to apply filters and text to some of her Instagram photos. Liz says, "One of my favorite editing apps is AfterLight -- it provides such a great array of filters! Also, Over is one of my favorites -- great fonts and steedicons to use on your photos."
Guest curator Brian Difeo uses Snapseed to adjust contrast, sharpness and saturation on his photos before posting them to Instagram. Brian says, "I take photos in the iPhone native app, and I take a LOT of photos so I have many options. In the native app I'll tap the screen to adjust the focus and exposure, and take some photos in HDR too. This way I have variety of photos to choose from before I edit and share on Instagram."
Our Mashable Photo Challenge guest curator Murad Ossmann uses these smartphone photo editing apps to touch up his photos before posting them to Instagram.
Murad Ossmann has an Instagram following of almost 270,000, and his feed is full of stunning pictures based on the theme "Follow Me." These photos put a new spin on the traditional travel photo: instead of only photographing landmarks, he features his girlfriend leading him around the world by the hand.
One of our guest curators, Santiago PerezGrovas uses natural light to shoot his photos. What began as a limitation (he didn't know how to uses professional flashes) became his signature style.
"In a world of perfection, the production of the photos we see everyday is overwhelming, to the point that everything has to be flawless," says Santiago. "I limit myself to use a simple camera, a model and the available light at the moment."
Santiago has more than 80,000 followers on Instagram. He posts regular updates around a central theme (shots of models and his friends). His signature style is instantly recognizable.
The winner of the Photo Challenge Series Dan Evans, Jr., says to use Elements for basic adjustments like cropping, color, contrast and brightness. It is also sophisticated enough to creatively alter a photo without being too complicated.
"Jesus said, I tell you the truth, what you do for the least of these, you do for me." – Matthew 25:40

Sound has been utilised in various cultures for thousands of years as a tool for healing. Whether through the use of mantras, these various techniques all have the same intention: to move us from a place of imbalance to a place of balance.
Sound healing, or Vibrational therapy, works by using certain sound frequencies and waves to reduce stress and anxiety, and to create a meditative and relaxing state.
Sound helps to facilitate shifts in our brainwave state by using entrainment. Entrainment synchronises our fluctuating brainwaves by providing a stable frequency which the brainwave can attune to. By using rhythm and frequency, we can entrain our brainwaves and it then becomes possible to down-shift our normal beta state (normal waking consciousness) to alpha (relaxed consciousness), and even reach theta (meditative state) and delta (sleep; where internal healing can occur).
This same concept is utilised in meditation by regulating the breath, but with sound it's the frequency that is the agent which influences the shift.
Sound has helped many in the area of the North East and it is enjoyed by many and helped insomnia, vertigo, tinnitus, headaches and much much more.

Here’s April! I started things out (or ended March) with a norovirus that struck really suddenly and violently. I was SO sick. I threw up so badly that I broke all the blood vessels around my eyes. It was crazy. So bad. I’m not sure I’ve ever been that sick since I was a kid. 24 hours later I was … Continue Reading →
Doug and I met up with my oldest friend, Alicia (we’ve known each other since we were babies) for dinner in DC – we tried Ambar, which is a Balkan restaurant at Eastern Market. The food was amazing!

Identity Fusion offers a full range of professional services focused solely on identity management solutions. Our proven AIM2 Methodology has been tested across multiple industries (financial, health care, federal, education, telecommunications, and manufacturing) and our consultants have proven themselves time and time again.
Have you ever found yourself lost but making great time? This is one of the most common problems uncovered when Identity Fusion consultants first meet with a new customer. Customers may not always recognize it, but improper or unrealized expectations (i.e. projects headed down the wrong path) are one of the most common pitfalls in any identity management project.
Oftentimes, a customer will attempt to implement an identity management solution on their own or they will hire a partner that really doesn’t understand their requirements or how to best implement the vendor’s products to meet those requirements. Either way, the result is the same; an unhappy customer that has an implementation with one or more of the following problems:
There are a lot of great companies that can manage projects well, have excellent developers, and understand enterprise-wide projects. But identity management projects have their own unique challenges – both technical and political – and if the individuals performing the work have never implemented your chosen vendor’s product, then odds are that expectations will not be met.
Identity Fusion has decades of experience architecting and implementing identity management solutions from multiple vendors. But it is our ability to blend education and consulting into the same engagement that differentiates us from other companies and makes Identity Fusion such a valuable partner. This is reflected in our requirements sessions, architectural design workshops, project implementation, and during the transition to support. It can be seen in the way we perform whiteboard sessions and in every document that we produce. When you work with Identity Fusion consultants, you can be assured that not only have you made the right design choices, but that you fully understand the choices that you have made (and how they differ from the alternatives).

Happy Chinese New Year, everyone! I wish you all the best in the year of the Ox, with health and prosperity in abundance, for food on the table and clothes to wear, and a comfortable abode with family. I wish you the greatest of friendships, old or new, and the unsurpassed joy of peace and love to all.
I must also remember- during this period of time, not to overindulge in food and festivities…. which is a difficult thing to do with lots of family and friends around. And Chinese New Year is a time filled with lots of delicious food and company, kinda like Christmas for those who do celebrate… how can one diet at a time like this? With 11 days away from the office, the possibility that I would stray from proper dietary habits are immensely high.
To help protect you from the lethal effects of undiagnosed oral cancer, our practice has purchased a state-of-the art device called the VELscope Oral Cancer Screening System , manufactured by LED Medical Diagnostics, Inc. Along with our conventional oral screening exam, we can use the VELscope to literally see beneath the surface to detect potentially dangerous growths we might have otherwise missed.
The VELscope utilizes the natural phenomenon of tissue fluorescence, the emission of light by healthy tissue, to locate suspect tissue that would otherwise be invisible. The VELscope system consists of a light source, a light guide, and a viewing handpiece. It emits a safe, visible, blue light into the mouth, which excites healthy mucous tissue to fluoresce an apple-green color.
Since most pre-malignant cancerous changes start below the surface, they are often not apparent to the eye until they progress to the surface. However, as soon as these changes occur, they disrupt the fluorescent ability of the tissue, making their presence known early on. According to clinical studies, the VELscope system detects 98% of tumors and pre-tumors.
The VELscope exam takes about two minutes, involves no pain or inconvenience, is completely safe, and can be done as part of a regular hygiene check-up. There is an additional charge, but your insurance company might cover the cost of this preventive procedure.
The overall 5-year survival rate for Oral Cancer is 52%, but if it is diagnosed early, the survival rate increases to almost 90%. Early detection can also reduce the severity of oral cancer treatment which can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologically targeted therapy.
You can find more information on the specifications of the system at LED Medical Diagnostics' VELscope pages . In addition, the Oral Cancer Foundation provides detailed and comprehensive information about oral cancer, including methods of diagnosis used before, after, and in addition to the VELscope screening.
At the office of Laura L. Matin, D.D.S , in Portland, Oregon, we are committed to saving lives through creating awareness, discovery, and diagnosis of oral cancer. Contact us today to schedule your next examination and receive oral cancer screening.
Dr. Laura Matin and her staff are here to help you achieve your ideal smile. With today's advances in porcelain veneers, tooth whitening and implant dentistry, we can make a real and dramatic difference in the way you look and the way you feel about your smile.

Here’s the second chapter for my Exactly Where They’d Fall preview series! This one is more newly revised than most of the others, so hopefully I got all the typos out of it, lol! 😉
The dog died. Amelia had her mother’s dry-cleaning in hand, helped herself into the house to drop it off, and there was the animal’s body, lying still between the stove and a chewed up gnawing bone, dead on the cold ceramic floor. Amelia couldn’t tell at first, so she crouched down low to watch for its breathing. Nothing. She stood again, looked around her mother’s empty kitchen, watched for movement, tapped the animal with a gentle toe. Nothing.
She was an old dog, having joined the family when Amelia was fourteen. Amelia never liked animals much, and never cared much for this dog in particular, a chubby Labrador with a mottled beige coat. But death was still death, abrupt and unsettling. Her mother was alone now. Her father was fine; they’d spoken to him on the phone just days ago. But he was working thousands of miles away in Afghanistan. As a retired Air Force mechanic, they hoped he might be finished with the Middle East. They hoped he would be home to stay until the company he worked for started picking up government contracts. This time, it would be a year, he told them. He said he could come home for the holidays, though they both knew he couldn’t afford that much travel. Amelia could still remember all of his deployments when she was a girl. During Desert Storm, she had been twelve � her seventh grade class sent care packages with handmade cards, magazines, beef jerky, eye drops, and socks. Now she was a full grown woman and every day there were the news reports. You didn’t need to be in combat � didn’t even need to be a soldier at all � doctors, reporters, translators, travelers were killed all the time by children who looked ordinary but had bombs strapped to their chests, or in helicopter crashes, shot down, spinning out of the sky like pinwheels gleaming in the sun. She tried not to think about any of it, until death with its abrupt and unsettling persistence showed up right there at her feet. An old dog, dead.
Amelia started to cry. She set the dry-cleaning over a dining room chair and wiped at her eyes furiously with the back of her wrist. Her mother wasn’t home yet from The Lotus, so no one was even home when it happened. The poor thing had died alone. Suddenly Amelia felt guilty for not spending more time with her, for being too self-involved as a teenager, for not taking her on more walks, for not playing fetch. She never liked dogs, but still, she could have played fetch a time or two.
She didn’t know what to do, so she called Drew. “Can you come over to my mom’s?” She gasped and sniffled into her cell phone. “Lady is dead.”
Drew’s apartment wasn’t very far away. She’d heard him rustling into his jacket before even hanging up his phone, and minutes later he showed up, jacket undone, shoes untied and hair unbrushed. In fact, from the pillow creases on his face, it looked like he’d been napping. She wasn’t sure if he had the smallest clue about what to do with a dead dog, but his being there was a form of help in itself. “Oh, Melie,” he said near her ear as he slipped his arms around her, pressing their bodies close.
They sat down at the kitchen table, as far away from the dead dog as they could while still being in the same room. Drew sat beside her, held her hand, and she turned away from the dog to look at him instead. His gentle brown eyes were narrow and inquisitive as he stared at it, a fingernail between his teeth as he thought. Amelia figured he was probably composing a poem about the fragility of life, or the arresting poignancy of death. Or maybe he was just wondering what to do with the body.
They had a wedding to go to that evening. Her mother had planned on finishing up paperwork at the spa and leaving Mindy in charge for the day. Amelia still had to shower and do her own hair, and she wondered if they had the time to take care of the dog and still make it to the wedding. She tried her mother’s phone, but there was no answer, which likely meant she was already driving.
It wasn’t very long before Claire made it home. As she stepped into the house, Amelia broke the news. “Mom,” Amelia said. “Lady is dead.”
Claire went straight into the kitchen, heels clicking on the stone tile. She stood over the dog for approximately forty-five seconds, a blank expression on her face. “She was so old,” Claire finally said. They were all silent then for another moment, as if they were each wondering if they should say something. A prayer? Should Drew recite a poem? But Claire just pursed her lips into a slight frown, nodded her head once firmly, then turned to the coffee pot, pulling out a filter full of old, wet coffee grounds. “Will you call Corbin for me, sweetie? Only if he’s not busy. Tell him I’ll pay double his regular wage.”
That wasn’t the problem. Corbin worked for her parents, offering massage therapy at The Lotus, though in the years he’d worked for them, he’d become more of a family friend than an employee. Amelia couldn’t say she was angry with Corbin. He didn’t exactly do anything wrong. It had been a couple of years now. She never said she cared about him � she wasn’t even sure what she felt for him at all, except taken aback most of the time and overwhelmed. No one had ever presented it so openly before, and so earnestly � the way they’d gotten together, exactly two times, and then he casually went into some metaphysical discourse about how his life was his own and his feelings for her were separate and undefined. He’d said, “I’ll always be honest with you, Amelia, but I don’t want to possess you. And I don’t mind if you want to keep seeing your little friend.” They were at the spa, on his massage table, their second and last time together. Her panties were still around her ankles and she was so blindsided by it all, the only response she could offer was to come to Drew’s defense. First, she and Drew had not been seeing each other yet back then, and second, Drew was not little � he was perfectly average-sized for a man, and while he might not have a rock hard yoga body, he did keep himself healthy. He played golf.
Honesty, when presented with it in all its stark nakedness, only felt harsh and unpleasant. And the most outrageous thing about it was that her parents were right about him. Corbin was completely honest, to the core. He meant every single word of it, metaphysical bullshit and all.
Amelia hesitated, but finally did pick up her phone anyway and scrolled through the names. She could see Drew fidget in her peripheral vision. “You have his number stored in your phone?”
Drew never liked Corbin. Amelia had never even told him about the mistaken tryst, but she wondered if maybe he suspected it anyway. It was so slight a thing. She hadn’t even known his name the first time they were together. They were a disaster, and it was so long before she and Drew had gotten together that she just didn’t know how to bring it up. She shrugged. “He works for my parents.”
When Claire left the room, Drew said, �Your mother hates me. Why wouldn’t she just ask me to do it?�
�You need to get ready too.� Amelia reached out to his hand. �She just doesn’t want you to go to a wedding having just buried a dog.�
�No,� Drew said, standing up, sending a ripple across the surface of an oil candle on the table, his eyes alight with both complaint and purpose. �I can bury a dog.� He took off his jacket and hung it on the chair, taking stock of the room. In his striped polo shirt and jeans, he looked more like Clark Kent than Superman, but his assertion was impressive. Amelia didn’t know what to say. She set down her phone.
Amelia went to get Lady’s blanket, which happened to be one of Amelia’s old childhood blankets, a cotton weave in blue and white, worn ratty over the years.
Drew laid out the blanket on the floor and rolled Lady inside it. He picked up the eighty pound dog in both arms, and Amelia went to get the door for him.
Amelia picked the spot, in the back corner of the yard, underneath an apple tree. Drew got a shovel from the shed and started digging, stomping his heel down on top of the blade and ripping up the ground. The midday sun was strong, and even Amelia began to feel dewy in the heat. Drew swiped the back of his hand across his forehead. Amelia went to get him a glass of iced tea.
When Claire came downstairs, Amelia was still watching him work, the sharp drive of the shovel into the ground, the leverage to pop the dirt up, two capable arms tossing the earth away. The hole was about five feet long and two feet deep already.
Claire stared at the hole, taking slow, steady breaths. If she was upset, Amelia knew her mother wouldn’t show it. Claire walked off quickly, and returned with a Frisbee, a mangled one with tooth-marks in it. �Put this with her, will you? I need to curl my hair.� Claire turned to go back inside.
When he’d finished the hole and placed Lady’s body inside, Amelia knelt down with a small gardening trowel and helped him scoop some of the dirt inside. When they were finished, Amelia placed Lady’s Frisbee on top of the dirt mound, a headstone.
They stood together at the foot of the grave. She placed a hand on Drew’s back, his shirt moist with work, smelling of salty sweat and the earth. She leaned her head to his shoulder. �Let’s go get you cleaned up,� she said.
They all made it to the wedding on time. The three of them sat at their appointed places around a large round table, family of the bride. The hall was decorated in white lights and ivory. Stringed miniature Chinese lanterns were drawn across the room, crossing each other in a glowing web. Glass bowls sat in the center of each table with floating candles in them, ivory rose petals scattered around. Amelia wore a dress that Piper had made for her, just as strange as any of Piper’s creations, ocean blue, with material so airy it somehow managed to lift and float when she moved.
Somehow it turned out that Amelia was the last of all her cousins to remain unmarried. She and Drew sat with her mother, enduring her nostalgic engagement and wedding stories. Amelia’s parents were the perfect couple. Alan and Claire Bradshaw � they were so happy together, everyone said so. They’d known each other since they were fourteen years old, high school sweethearts, married for twenty-nine years. And here they were at yet another wedding, recounting the story of how her parents got engaged. “When your father proposed to me, we were at a bonfire…” Claire started the story with her head held high and her hands folded in her lap � there was no dreamy haze in her eyes. It was just history, and she delivered it not like a whimsical memory, but like a classic text that everyone knew. “It was four weeks before graduation. I wasn’t going to college, but he was going off for basic training in a few weeks, and after that, we had no idea where. I remember everything about it � the cinders in the fire pit. He said to me, ‘I can’t do this without you. Come with me � marry me, Claire.’ I remember exactly what we were wearing. I used to wear so much color in those days.� She glanced down at her dark navy dress. �Now it’s all dark, isn’t it?� She turned to Amelia then, laying her palm on Amelia hand. �I’m so glad you wear color, sweetie.”
Amelia knew this story by heart, the cinders in the fire pit, the very modest chip of a diamond he’d worked odd jobs for months to buy, her father down on one knee. It was the kind of story a woman could let live for generations.
Claire wasn’t drinking wine, just a glass of water clutched in both hands. Drew had brought Amelia one glass of wine already, and Amelia sipped it slowly, though she knew she was going to be far too sober for this. “Drew, honey, can we have another?”
At least her mother waited for Drew to leave the table before she started. “Don’t you think you two might like something like this?” She waved a hand at the room. The twinkling candles in water, the bad wedding music, nobody dancing except the very old and the children � it was too early, and the rest of them weren’t drunk enough yet. The tossed rose petals were already starting to wilt. Amelia could buy all of this at Pottery Barn if she wanted it. �He’s a nice enough boy, Amelia.�
Nice enough? Amelia raised her eyebrows. Sometimes Amelia wondered if there was anyone her mother would oppose her marrying as long as he agreed to provide grandchildren quickly. “Mom, we don’t even live together yet.”
“I know,” Claire said. “Believe it or not, there was a time people got married before they lived together. It’s just that you’re our only child.� Claire tilted her head. �And you’re nearly thirty now.”
“Not nearly,” Amelia said. Though close enough. To be honest, it was starting to sink in. Amelia had gray hairs. Two of them. They aged her before her time. One was near her part line, and any time she tried to tuck it underneath, it only rose up again to stand above the rest, pale and defiant.
Claire tapped her fingertips on her water glass, making ripples on the surface. “You know there’s a time limit on some things.”
“Out of all my siblings, all your father’s siblings, we’re the only ones without grandchildren now.”
Drew came back with Amelia’s wine, and placed a soft kiss on her cheek. He pointed at the bar. �We were just talking a bit � do you mind?�
Her cousins’ husbands, challenging each other’s manhood with shots of whiskey � she could smell it on him. �No, go ahead,� she said. She didn’t want to draw attention to the idea; her mother didn’t need another reason to dislike her boyfriend. Claire tapped her fingernails on her water glass, a perfectly polite smile spread across her lips as Drew left the table.
“I’m a big girl,” Amelia continued, before her mother could speak first. “I can take care of myself, and you’ll get your grandbaby someday.”
She shouldn’t have said it so blunt like that. Her mother flinched. Without the dog now, she was well and truly alone � and Amelia knew she didn’t like it. Her mother had been a military wife for the whole of her youth and Amelia knew she measured the time in months and years, units of deployment breaking up the forward momentum of her life. But Amelia couldn’t change any of that for her, and Amelia was happy now. Two times before she’d lived with a man, and neither time worked out very well. Now she had friends � she had a best friend who was also her boyfriend and who was plenty more than just nice enough. She glanced to Drew at the bar. “I’m not alone,” Amelia said.
Drew saw her looking, smiled, and started to walk back then. Amelia looked at her mother, an inhale, a whole conversation with her eyes. Enough. Amelia’s hand rested flat on the table and her mother reached over to pat it; it made her feel like a child.
“Okay,” Claire said, nodding to Drew as he took his place beside Amelia again, rising from her own seat with a sigh. “Well,� she said. �I’m going to turn in early, I think. You two have a good time then.”
Amelia felt bad � too many bad jokes about sperm banks? Was it the dead dog? Was it being on her own at a family wedding when everyone else had a sweetheart at their side? Amelia wished she could be the daughter her mother hoped for. Why couldn’t she just go and marry her sweet boyfriend whom she loved? Many worse things had been asked of women before. �You don’t have to go, Mom.�
�I do, sweetie.� She waved her hand at the room. �This is all making me tired.� She stood and leaned down to kiss Amelia’s head. �But you have a good time, okay?�
When her mother had gone, they both went to the bar. Amelia had seven cousins, and they were all girls. All of them married already apart from Amelia. They all had babysitters for the night, and Amelia caught up with them while Drew did a few more shots with their husbands. Amelia knew he wouldn’t remember being so drunk in the morning. He turned back to her occasionally, giving her another glass of red wine and a kiss. The guys all had their suit jackets off, ties undone, cheeks flushed with whiskey. Amelia’s cousins were eager to drink too after so many years of babies and breastfeeding. Amelia hadn’t intended to get drunk, but she had enough to relax.
Drew slid his hand around her waist and nuzzled his face into the curve of her neck, his other hand holding a shot glass in front of her, mixed tones of brown and beige. He spoke into her ear, �It’s called a screaming orgasm, you want one?�
Her head was already buzzing, and her pulse warmed at the thought of a screaming orgasm. She turned around to see him grinning. �Yes, thank you.� She didn’t mean the drink, but she took it anyway.
She giggled as his placed sloppy kisses over her collar bone, but her laugh was stunted as she caught sight of her cousin Bella doing shots with all of the guys. It didn’t surprise her that Bella could hold her whiskey with the men, but somehow, after all these years, Amelia still bristled with contempt at the sight of her. Especially in that curvy black gown, and standing so close to Drew. Bella had given Amelia’s high school boyfriend a blowjob in the back seat of his car after their senior prom. That hadn’t been the first time Lenny Hutchins cheated on Amelia, and it wouldn’t be the last either, but as far as she knew, that had been the only time Bella ever betrayed her. Even though it happened nearly ten years ago, Amelia wasn’t sure that was the kind of thing a person could ever really get over.
Bella came closer, looping her arm through her husband’s arm. They were all packed in closely near the bar, and Bella had taken a place right next to Drew. She raised her glass to them all, and Amelia couldn’t hear what she was saying to them over the noise. Bella had two children now, and for all Amelia knew, she seemed happily married. People grew up, people changed, people moved on. It had been a lifetime ago. They were all happy now, weren’t they? Amelia took a deep breath and exhaled it. Before turning back to talk to her other cousins, she slipped her fingers into Drew’s hand.
He was a good find, her cousins told her. Amelia already knew that. She’d never denied it. How many of these family weddings had he been to now, and they still weren’t engaged yet themselves? He knew almost everyone by name. He’d been invited to their bachelor parties and weddings, he’d met their children, been to their babies’ first birthday parties. The things Amelia’s mother wanted from her were no different than the things any of their mothers wanted. Parents did that � they imposed their wants on their children, like their children should want those things already themselves. Amelia’s cousins told her the truth � it wouldn’t appease her parents if she got engaged. Sure, maybe for a little while. But next, they’d want a wedding, they’d want a grandchild, and after they got one, they’d want another. And what comes next? After one grandchild, two, three? Her cousins hadn’t gotten that far themselves, but they were all scared to find out.
Amelia couldn’t remember when she’d lost hold of Drew’s hand. They’d been standing back to back most of the night, his hand on her shoulder from time to time, a whisper in her ear, or his laugh among the chorus of drunken laughter. Then another voice spoke from behind her, and when she turned, Drew was gone.
“Your man just threw up in the bathroom.” Amelia turned to find another husband of yet another cousin � she didn’t even remember his name.
�Oh, Lord.� Amelia sighed hard. She was tipsy herself, balancing on sharp heels and holding her floaty dress to her thighs as she stepped out the front doors of the reception hall. Across a large grassy lawn, speeding headlights flashed past on the highway. It wasn’t very late yet but the sky was dark already, the way fall starts to steal light from the evenings more and more each day. It was chilly, having dropped fifteen degrees since they left the house. September did that. But she hadn’t grabbed a jacket because she’d planned to steal Drew’s suit jacket later. She should have brought it out with her � and then it came to mind that she’d put her wallet and phone in her mother’s purse at dinner.
She stopped walking. �Crap,� she said, balling her fists up and groaning at the sky. A man smoking a cigarette against a stone pillar looked over at her. She tucked her arms around her body and continued.
Drew sat on a stone bench a few feet down the sidewalk, where cars pulled up to let guests out or pick them up. He leaned forward heavy on his hands and took deep inhales of the cool fall air. “You look spent,” she said.
Shots were shots, and he’d done too many of them. It probably wouldn’t matter what kind. Maybe he hadn’t eaten enough? Maybe he was trying too hard to impress them? That seemed more likely a reason.
Drew handed her the phone. She sorted through numbers in her head. She tapped the screen, and it brought up his call list. Pacing the sidewalk, she scrolled through names in his phone book, but she didn’t know any of them who weren’t at the wedding already. She didn’t want to ask for a ride and ruin anyone else’s night. She didn’t want to call her mother back out again, and she especially didn’t want her to see Drew in such a condition. Piper would be all the way out at Tom’s, and Jodie would give them the biggest stink about making her drive all the way out there.
It didn’t make sense that Jodie’s name stuck out from the list, but somehow it did. Amelia counted the calls from Jodie. There were dozens, listed several times a week, incoming and outgoing. And one missed call notice from just a couple hours ago. No message though.
Jodie. Her name on that call log set heavy in Amelia’s gut. She didn’t like it, for no real reason she could pinpoint. Maybe it was the time they spent together, without her. She just didn’t like it. The envy, the fear, it welled up through her body, to her fingertips, hovering over the “clear” button, and she pressed it.
Amelia had never done that before. Not even with Lenny. Amelia turned back to Drew, still sitting on the stone bench, except now the groom had come out to join him, with his tuxedo jacket off and his shirt untucked. All the undone tuxedos and women in bare feet, standing outside a function hall in the late hours of the night � it reminded Amelia that senior prom. That time, and all those other times. If she’d have checked up on him sooner, maybe he wouldn’t have fooled her for so long.
But Drew wasn’t Lenny. And this wasn’t her phone. And Jodie was their friend. So Amelia exhaled, her bare arms starting to shiver. There was one person she could try. It surprised her that she actually remembered Corbin’s number after all. He lived so close to them anyway, and if she didn’t call a cab, or bribe someone else to leave the wedding early, it was the only number she could think of.
Corbin, this time of night, would either be grading essays from his philosophy lectures, or out screwing. He didn’t do relationships, exactly, so you couldn’t call them �girlfriends.� But Amelia also knew that Corbin was the only person on the planet without a cell phone, so if he was out screwing, he wouldn’t answer.
He answered. “I’m so sorry to bother you,” she said. “My mom left, and I’m drunk, and Drew is trashed, and we kind of need a ride.”
When Corbin finally arrived, Amelia felt conflicted about where to sit. Drew didn’t like Corbin enough to want to sit up front, so he slid straight into the back seat, rolling his woozy head against the headrest. It would have been impolite to sit in the back with Drew, and leave Corbin up front alone like he was their chauffeur � that was not how she’d meant it at all � and yet it seemed just as impolite to leave Drew alone in the back, especially as sick as he was. She stood outside the car long enough that Corbin glanced over to her. She got in beside Drew, leaning forward between the seats to say, �I should probably make sure he doesn’t throw up.�
Drew crossed his arms and slumped. Corbin’s car was a rusty white Chevy Cavalier that must have been fifteen years old, stick shift which he drove roughly, and suspension that felt like being pulled over potholes in a kiddie wagon. Amelia reached over to squeeze Drew’s knee. “You’re not gonna throw up, are you?”
�Mine,� she said, then realized that her mother had her keys too. Drew had a set of her house keys though. �You have keys, right?�
Corbin pulled up at the street in front of Amelia’s townhouse. “Thanks for the ride,” Drew mumbled, quickly, and got out of the car.
Corbin turned himself in the front seat to glance back at her. “No problem,” he said. �It wasn’t that far.�
Why was he so generous? It wasn’t natural � people weren’t like that. It only made her feel like he wanted something. She pursed her lips. �Fine,� she said, breaking into an anxious laugh.
Drew was inside already, upstairs in the master bathroom. She came up to the closed door, not because she wanted to hear him puking, but to make sure he didn’t die. Was that possible? That in his drunkenness, he might stumble and knock himself out, end up choking on his own vomit? She shivered. “Are you okay?” she asked through the closed door.
He opened it a crack, and she let herself in. The faucet was running, and he splashed his face, looking up at himself with disappointment as drops of water hung from his nose and chin. He smelled like toothpaste.
“Well isn’t he a saint?” Drew slumped slowly to the tile floor, his back pressed against the wall, cornered between the sink and the toilet.
She sat next to him. The tile was cold on her bare legs. “They like you too,” she said. At least, she figured her dad did.
But had Amelia done anything stupid? Erasing Jodie’s call? She felt so petty for it. It was worrying how often Jodie’s name came up lately. Amelia worried about how love could be so changeable, that she could be so adored for a time and then just as easily forgotten.
She was sure he hadn’t started the night with two shirt buttons undone, though she remembered he hadn’t worn a tie. Now the collar of his shirt hung open, just a peek of chest hair showing. It made her want to touch him there. But he reached out to her face instead, running a thumb along her cheekbone. “I tuoi occhi sono dolci come il miele,” he said to her.
He rarely spoke Italian � only when he was drunk, or trying to woo her panties off, or both. But when he did, it reminded Amelia of a story his mother told her once after having had a little too much champagne, of the summer of 1978 and a mysterious Italian man with an accent that made every conversation feel like a song. Drew would never meet his real father, but it must have been genetic why he’d become a poet, or why he felt inclined to study three languages in college, or how he pulled off the charm without sounding too pompous or too false. Otherwise Amelia might have suspected that he only remembered the lines he could use to coax her into bed. “I bet that doesn’t sound as good in English.”
She didn’t trust charm. His smile melted her heart, and she wanted to believe. She really did. But they were all charming, weren’t they? And she fell for it, again and again and again.
But she shouldn’t have cleared that missed call. Her conscience felt the weight of a million lies, even though there was just this one. Amelia hated lies. “Jodie called for you,” she said, in one solid exhale.
It was a joke, but she tensed anyway. “She’d eat you alive, you know. You’re too sweet for her.” She took his hand and held it still in her lap.
She wasn’t ignorant. And she wasn’t oblivious. It wasn’t like she didn’t know that this was what he’d been after for as long as he’d known her. It felt different when he said it, like he was actually talking about marrying her, specifically, and not just picking an item off some generic checklist: Things To Do Before Forty. But did he really know what he’d be getting himself into? Once they believed in it, it would fade into something ordinary and taken for granted. He would lose interest and move on. They always did.
He smiled with his eyes closed. She knew she needed to get them to bed before he fell asleep on the tiled bathroom floor. She sighed. “Why don’t you say that again some time when you’re sober?”

I am interested in the stuff of life. I often work with discarded objects and materials that were, at one time, a part of everyday experiences. Through changing trends and a general desire to consume these things outlive their usefulness or become obsolete. At times, the materials I employ are ephemeral such as flowers and rose petals. Once they have passed their prime in the garden or at the florists they are transformed into large-scale installations. My recent work incorporates paper garbage in various forms including mail discards, personal notes, product boxes as well as material collected off the street. Garbage is largely the sources by which past civilizations have been studied. Consequently, this material serves as artifacts of our time. In altering or re-presenting it my intention is to set up underlying narratives and to encourage the viewer to reconsider the familiar. These materials serve as signifiers of relationships and connections we have with the world around us and to one another. It is perhaps, these relationships that ultimately lie at the center of my explorations.

Last time I was around here, I said that I brought seven project with me for my seven weeks summer vacation (plus socks, those does not count exactly like sock yarn does not count as stash.) How did it go?
On the flight to Italy I finished Mr. Pitt's Magic Socks, no photo taken before gifting them to my uncle.
I did not work a stitch on Sahara and I have actually decided it is going to the frog pound: I love the yarn and the color so much that I have decided it should be something that I would wear way more than a form fitting top. Like this one, for example.
I worked a little on my Karabella Cece, and I finished the Katia Jamaica Cardi: no photo of this either because my sister-in-law grabbed even before I could sew the buttons on. I requested pictures but nothing so far.
The Forest Canopy Shawl was finished and now it is no more: it came out quite small, so I decided to add an extra repeat since I had leftover yarn. Turns out, not enough, so I am altering the border a little.
I started Pretty Thing about 3 times and never got the count right, but I finished Icarus (see pile of unblocked shawls) and the Sweetheart Cardigan:
The niece this was intended to declared, while watching me knitting, that she likes yellow. Well, I have plenty of nieces, and plenty of yarn, so here it comes Helena in yellow:
And I started the Nutkin Socks in Sockin' Sox, that are now my on-the-go project: soccer season has just started, lots of knitting ahead of me!

CETA and pharmaceuticals : impact of the trade agreement between Europe and Canada on the costs of prescription drugs
Jessamine Beaudry Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:05. Many people are becoming aware of the importance of avoiding products that are created without the use of harmful toxins and other materials which are harmful to us and the environment, and since we spend so much of our time in bed, this has special importance to our babies. Therefore purchasing an mattress for your baby has many health benefits. While we will look at these, lets initially look at some possible problems with the crib mattresses that have been the standard for years. Traditional Mattresses - The Problem. Mattresses have been produced basically in an unchanged manner for years. To protect the outside of the mattress against the likely diaper spill event, these mattresses are encased with a impervious vinyl covering. The soft inner fiber used to stuff the mattress looks strangely similar to the insulation that is used to fill our home ceiling and wall cavities. Although this makes for a moisture-proof mattress and one that is comfortable, there are toxins used in the chemicals used to make the stuffing fire-proof.
Senapus Charlesbois Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:06. f you find you are not sleeping well it may be due to an old and uncomfortable bed. How much time we spend in bed can affect its durability. If the mattress is lumpy and the springs are too bouncy it might be time to go shopping. We also change as we age. A person who has once slept best on a soft mattress may be more suited to a harder mattress later in life, or, vice versa. Weight gain and weight loss can all effect how we react to our mattresses. A mattress might be perfect for one person but if two people start using it there could be difficulties. Studies have shown that beds can lose up to 70% of their original hardiness over 10 years. How Do I Select a Mattress?
Jessamine Beaudry Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:07. For those living in extremely humid climates, a natural mattress offers a higher level of comfort because the wool contently absorbs moisture. This reduces the chance of waking up on damp bed linens. Some organic mattresses are made with latex foam, similar to memory foam. These are the perfect choice for light sleepers who tend to wake up easily when their sleep partner moves. More and more organic mattress companies are manufacturing customizable mattresses. This allows consumers to specify such things as mattress firmness and the type of latex used to create their individual sleep system. Organic Crib Mattress - Benefits
Senapus Charlesbois Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:07. Firm mattresses. Firm mattresses fall in 3 categories: firm, extra-firm, ultra-firm. The firm mattresses include the Orbit, Neptune Cotton Only and the Single Foam futon mattresses. Usually, these firm mattresses have very little foam, and are cotton only, giving it the firm feeling. The ones with foam use a denser foam that makes the mattress less soft. These mattresses are great for people who like to sleep on something firm and who need the additional support. The extra-firm mattresses include the Simmons Monarch 2 and the Liberty Futon Mattress. Some of these mattresses are created with very dense layers of foam from top to bottom. Finally, the ultra-firm mattresses are for those that love to sleep on the ground. These mattresses are usually not recommended for a futon frame, but more for a platform bed. These are for people who want that firm feeling of a traditional Japanese futon mattress. The high density of the foam makes these mattresses very heavy and harder to move around.

The mattress support is usually made of wood slats that can be very flexible or tough and rigid. Wire mesh is another material used to make the support. The more rigid and cheap slats are further apart but the gap should not exceed 10cm. In addition, the wider the space between the slats, the more likely your mattress will be to wear out.

Eulalie Meaux Furniture, 2017-12-12 18:24:09. The mattress exterior is called ticking. Visually it is really not too important to select a "pretty" mattress as it will be covered most of the time. Instead you want to make sure the ticking is sturdy and well made and not prone to ripping. The higher quality ticking is made of material that is knitted or woven using cotton or viscose yarn. Cheaper mattresses are made of polypropylene or polyester. The cheapest mattresses are made of stitchbond or bonded cloth. Manufacturers now make external mattress covers with special features such as anti-allergy, anti-bacterial and anti-static. They may be resistant to staining, water and fire. Amazingly enough, there are even mattresses that give off different scents conducive to a good nights sleep. Spring Mattresses. There are three basic types of spring mattresses. A continuous spring mattress is made from a single piece of wire woven into many springs. The springs are linked in a vertical pattern. The wire is soft and the coils are small. This generates more reaction from the mattress. An open coil mattress is the most common form of mattress. The springs are arranged horizontally and connected at their tops and on the bottom by a twisting wire. The rods that run around the edge of the coils add strength. A pocket spring mattress has coils that are placed in fabric coverings. Instead of working as a unit, these springs function separately. As a result movement between partners on the same bed can not be felt by the other.

This paper discusses different questions of weblogs in context of higher education. It is focussing on three loosly coupled questions:
It seems obvious that these questions relate to each other and probably should be discussed in context of each other. The document grew out of a wild collection of speculative thoughts and notes. It is also based on some daily experience with weblogs in an educational setting.
It's been quite some time I didn't make LINE emoticons :p Among "Brown", "Cony"& "Moon" I prefer to make BROWN. What about you? Which character that you prefer the most? I marinated the chicken drummets overnight so that I can cook it next morning. All about "Brown" colour theme for my girl bento ^_^
A closer look of my Line Brown character. To make it brown, I add some sweet dark soy sauce into the rice and mix it. Next I use cling wrap to shape the head/body/ears. As for the white rice also press it until thinly to join with the brown head. Lastly, punch out some nori details and add-on. To avoid Brown body parts will loosen by the time reach school break, simply secure it with spaghetti.
As for smaller Brown is make of quail egg. After peel away the shell, rub against palm to make it round shape for Brown face. Slightly trim away the middle part to make it white circle. Just add-on the nori details and you got your smaller Brown as a plushy :D
Combitreat–ISBR is a sewage treatment technology developed by HNB Engineers Pvt. Ltd. Combitreat-ISBR seeks to break through the existing mediocrity in the field of sewage treatment and usher in a paradigm shift. Combitreat provides anaerobic treatment to sewage and reduces the organic load to be handled by further treatment. ISBR provides aerobic treatment and stands for Improved Sequential Batch reactor which means, that it has some improvements over the conventional SBR sewage treatment technology. Combitreat-ISBR requires very less electricity as compared prevalent technologies. Not only does it use less electricity to treat sewage, but it also utilizes its state-of-the-art design to generate electricity through two avenues – biogas and hydropower. Combitreat-ISBR requires minimal land area and can be easily fit into the most difficult and arduous urban locales.
HNB has commissioned a 30 MLD capacity STP based on Combitreat–ISBR technology, for Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation at Akurdi.
Outcome/Benefits: The plant is suitable for urban, semi urban and even rural areas. Another advantage of this technique is that Combitreat and ISBR can be detached, if required and only ISBR can be installed to produce hydropower. When only ISBR is installed, the pumping requirement for the STP reduces because it is a constant level process and thus large saving in power is achieved. Combitreat-ISBR consistently delivers BOD<10 mg/l, TSS<10 mg/l (Pollution Control Board requires BOD<20 mg/l, TSS<20 mg/l) and gives high nitrate and phosphorus removal. This level of treatment makes it ideal for countries like India where the future demands sewage reuse.
To really understand the Para-Yoga system, we need to underdstand the Vedic hymns and their symbolic nature. Here, we discuss various correlations of later Hinduism with the Vedas for such a purpose as to ascertain their origins.
The Rig Veda contains many levels of myths, which can hence be interpreted in many ways - even the esoteric nature of the hymns, for example, can have two, three or four or more actual meanings to them. Many are the levels of understanding!
1. Purana, Historic, which refers to the literal meaning of the texts, and also refers to some stories that are later reproduced in the popular Puranas of latter times we have today.
2. Scientific - this has a three fold interpretation as Astrology, Astronomy and Ayurveda (Medicine), which also includes mathematics, art and architecture etc.
3. Yogic or Vedantic, being Philosophical, or even pertaining to various practices in Yoga. This also includes mantra and mantra-yoga, bhakti-yoga and other such interpretations, depending on the interpreter of the text, and their philosophical bent.
4.Adhyatmic or esoteric, inner renderings, which refer to visions, inner yogic visions of the chakras, lokas, experiences of bliss, visions of deities etc.
The Vedic symbolism is generally Threefold, Fivefold, Sevenfold, Thousand fold (meaning numerous) in symbolism, which can be interpreted along such lines. The text themselves can be classed as basically Twofold, under which various headings come (noted above), as (a) Devic or Scientific and (b) Adhidaivic or Spiritual.
Here, we present that of the hymns relating to the Yogic-Vedantic senses, and pertaining to Shiva, the deity of Yoga, under which he shares a common heritage of attributes with the gods Indra, Agni and Soma, depending on his natures, or forms.
Indra is more the austere and wrathful form of Shiva, pertaining to Atmosphere and self-realisation, hence more the Mahakala and Bhairava forms. He is the Yogic forms.
Agni is more the youthful and sometimes Father and Universal forms of Shiva, hence more Skanda (as Kumar), and sometimes Rudra (Prana).
Soma expresses more the blissful and teaching or 'Guru' aspects of Shiva, as we see in Sundara or Dakshinamurthi, forms of Moon such as Somnatha, Chandreshwar etc.
Hence, the Rig Veda itself, opens up chapters of thousand-fold information, on History (Purana), Astrological and Astronomical (Jyotish), Medical (Ayurvedic), Yogic, Vedantic, Bhaktin, Mantric etc. information, which we could go on about endlessly!
When from strength arose the power that conquers, Indra showed the cosmic senses (indriyas) that he possessed.He drove the milky cows from the cave, and with the Light (jyoti), revealed the darkness (tamas). - Rig Veda.V.31.3
Indra displays his Senses, meaning that he has controlled them. Indra means 'He who is lord of indriyas (senses)', which are his powers, or shaktis. He hence displays his shaktis, or powers, being the positive form of senses, in their higher sense - hence them as being Cosmic or Universal Senses as Shaktis, not merely the lower indriyas or base senses.
From the Cave he drives away the cows, and with the light, shows the darkness. This mean, that Indra has purified the heart, and has hence seen that the world is darkness or Maya (illusion), through the power of the self (swa), seen here as Jyothi, or light.
Indra here, is hence the Yogin or Siddha, that has gone beyond Maya, and has opened up his higher-senses, the Cosmic Senses (vishwa-indriya), the Shaktis or Siddhis, mystic powers.
Free from all material influences, he is the dancer (Rig.II.22.4), of which we later know as Nataraja, the form of Shiva, who represents the destroyer or conquerer of the Universe and hence the Senses. The Body metaphorically represents the Universe. - These are all explained in the below coommentary.
He is hence Shiva-Yogeshwar, who is master of yoga, possessor of the siddhis and most of all, the deity who guides us to our inner-being, which he represents.
The conquerer of the Universe; conquerer of Self, winner of wealth, winner forever, conquerer of men and fields, Conquerer of the horses, of cattle, of waters - to Indra the holy bring the Soma! - Rig Veda.II.22.1
Indra here, is extolled as the winner or conquerer or lord of the Universe, Wealth, Cattle, Fields, Waters, Horses etc. - which all represent, metaphorically, the attainment of siddhas or shaktis, the mystic powers of Yoga, as has been noted in the above verse.
Most of all, Indra is lauded as Swarjit, meaning he who has conquered, or is lord of the Self, his own inner-being. By attaining this, Indra is Swaraj, the 'Self-Ruler', who has conquered the Self, and has become ONE with his true inner-being, and is now hence aware of the other powers of the universe - the Cows, (Go, also means Light), Horses, which represent Pranas or Senses, relating to practice of Pranayama (breath-control) etc.
Cows, Horses, waters etc. also represent the conquering of the Senses - how clearer can we make it, that Indra is Yogeshwar par se? Cows, Horses etc. are Pashus (beasts) - and also decsribed as senses or indriyas and pranas in Krishna Yajurveda.
In other words, this verse extols Indra, or the deity who has become aware of himself, and is hence the Yogin. Indra is thus, cognate with Shiva, as is well-known, and Indra is cognate with later term Ishwar.
The Moon (Chandrama) dwells within the waters, he who has fine wings in the shining region. O powers (vidyut), with your golden wheels, men don't find your step.
The Moon, Chandrama, represents the celestial or effulgent regions of Heaven, being the Sahasrarapadma Chakra, the 'Thousand-petal-Lotus'. It is often known as the moon-region and in Para-Yoga it is the sphere of the Parana-Karana or Transcendental-Causal.
Here, we have translated vidyut (lightening) as power or powers, referring to Shaktis, the powers in Yoga.
The Powers represent the siddhis (mystic powers), personified by Shaktis (powers, female goddesses, or Dakinis), which reside within the 'golden wheels', which represent the Chakras.
Mortals or men cannot find the step or foot-step (padam), of these powers or shaktis, meaning that most men lay in the ignorance of Maya, and their chakras remain closed, their powers (shaktis, or vidyut) is hence unknown.
Esoterically, this verses hence lauds the Sahasrarapadma Chakra, the highest Chakra and Supreme Abode, and also the lower powers hidden in the lower chakras, unknown to mortals, since they have not attained the state of the Supreme Sahasrara Chakra, hence cannot know all the powers or find the highest celestial shaktis or siddhis, that lie within these chakras.
Chakras are also energy-centres, which also refers to the shaktis, being as vidyut, or lightening, electrical current and so forth.
Other fires are merely your branches - all those who are immortal, take delight in you, O Agni. You are the centre of mortals, Cosmic Man, supporting people like a deep pillar.
Agni is the Cosmic Man or being (Vaishvanara), representing the Supreme Ishwar (Universal Ruler), or Godhead, later seen as Shiva. The other 'Agnis', or Fires mentioned, that are his forms or branches, represent the Jivas (individual souls), which are every-yearning to be reunited with their Creator.
The immortals who take delight in Agni, represent the Muktajivas, 'liberated jivas', the Rishis and Yogis, who have become ONE with Vaishvanara or Shiva, through the process of Yoga and renunciation etc. It also refers to them as in communion with the holy-spirit or Ishwar, in dhyana (meditation), the state of samadhi.
Agni as compared to a Sthuna (pillar), is the Linga, the Universal 'Symbol' of Agni or Shiva, representing the Absolute Reality. The Linga is said to be a pillar of fire (agni-sthuna) in later texts, which is said to uphold humans - and the universe - hence referring to Vaishvanara in Vedic terms.
Agni as the Pillar or Linga, actually is Shiva representing the Cosmic Being as Vaishvanara, or Ishwar. He is hence the centre of mortals, who are forms of him as jivas (as already noted), who worship him and seek oneness with him, like the immortals*.
Agni, like Indra, is the origin of much of the Shaiva myths. Agni is Shukra (Shining), later a name for the guru of demons, Asuramaya, like Shiva. Infact, Agni as Skanda was born from Fire (Agni) and Shukra (Semen) of Shiva. Agni is hence both father of the gods (as Rudra-Shiva) and also the Son of the Gods (As Agni-Skanda or Agni-Kumar) - these are testified to in the Rig Veda (ie.I.69.1), and also in the hymns themselves.

Network logins work a little differently than normal logins. There is a separate physical serial line for each terminal via which it is possible to log in. For each person logging in via the network, there is a separate virtual network connection, and there can be any number of these . It is therefore not possible to run a separate getty for each possible virtual connection. There are also several different ways to log in via network, telnet and rlogin being the major ones in TCP/IP networks.
Network logins have, instead of a herd of gettys, a single daemon (per way of logging in; telnet and rlogin have separate daemons) that listens for all incoming login attempts. When it notices one, it starts a new instance of itself to handle that single attempt; the original instance continues to listen for other attempts. The new instance works similarly to getty.

He started by finding an offer that resonated with and is relevant to his audience. In his case, his blog was dedicated to teaching people how to use a software called “Sublime Text.” He simply offered a license to the software for the giveaway. By doing this, not only did he increase the chances of success of his giveaway since his incentive was relevant, but he also ensured the quality of subscribers since they were actually people interested in his content. It’s easy to give people an iPad or an iPhone, but how relevant will they be to you at the end of the day?
In this course we go over the many different ways to generate traffic online. Online traffic generation is an important tool you need in your internet marketing tool belt, as it allows you to get people’s attention, get more sales, and increase reliability. Online traffic generation is probably the most important thing you could use to make money online.
Extra perks of SimilarWeb include their Top Websites Ranking: in this category, you select an industry rather than a domain – like fitness, fashion, or electronics – as well as a country. SimilarWeb will then show you the most traffic-rich websites for your industry and country. In the free version, however, you only see the five most successful websites. Also, concrete numbers are only available in the paid version. However, the function is still useful for broadly assessing your competitors.
Even though traffic is intrinsically tied to conversation rates, it seems that too many people have a lot of misunderstandings regarding the relationship between these two aspects. For one thing, the size of the traffic you get does not matter If it doesn’t lead to the kind of conversion rate you need. If you really want to earn money from the visitors coming to your site, they need to be of high quality.
The simplest explanation for a sudden and unexpected drop in website performance is often analytics tags failing to fire. Always check tracking first to make sure website visitors are being accounted for before making drastic changes. Reconciling tracking issues will help mitigate the long-term impact. Additionally, making friends with your IT department will help avoid issues before they arise. - Nina Hale, Nina Hale / Performance Digital
Buying website traffic shouldn't be a replacement for SEO and other conventional methods of online marketing, but it can certainly give you that edge you need in the highly competitive online market. You can improve your Alexa ranking, time on site and lower bounce rate, but most importantly - it will drive potential clients and bring your website in front of your target audience long before you will see the first results of your conventional marketing strategies.
I really agree with you on these methods to drive traffic without search engines. But one thing I had to mention that this kind of traffic will not be as targeted as organic traffic is. Thus,the conversion rate will be lower. Anyways great post. These methods are very helpful for new bloggers as driving organic traffic will be very difficult for them.
Whatever industry you’re in, chances are there are at least one or two major conventions and conferences that are relevant to your business. Attending these events is a good idea – speaking at them is even better. Even a halfway decent speaking engagement is an excellent way to establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry and gain significant exposure for your site.
Note: There are literally dozens of places you can use a keyphrase, from captions to comments, web addresses to “Alt” tags. Feel free to get tricky if you’d like. But generally, the less visible it is to readers, the less important it is to Google. So focus on those elements listed above. That’s what readers (and therefore Google) really care about.
Buy leads from a lead selling site. These are supposed to be email addresses of people that have signed up to receive offers. You just have to watch that they have good fresh "double opting" leads of people who requested more information about your particular field or you could be marked as a spammer. Some of these sites will email them for you with your own email or you can buy separate leads and use a separate email site for the mailing. There are email programs you can use but then you have a problem that Internet providers usually only allow up to 500 emails per day, and if you're doing it every day they might (rightfully) accuse you of spamming and shut down your connection.
Not only can you see accurate measures of a site’s monthly search traffic, but you can see detailed breakdowns of where that traffic is coming from and what kinds of keywords are bringing the traffic.

Wow Brian, You have solved my problem. A few days back I was looking for ways to increase traffic on my tech blog, I found this blog post by you while I was looking out for possible tricks to increase traffic. I must say that few of the tricks mentioned above really worked for me. For example, I updated a few old posts on my blog, I did try the broken link building technique and the last I did was to repost my content on Medium.

Monster-Traffic is another traffic exchange, though it’s initially a little off-putting due to the 1995-style website. It’s a free for all styled advertising list, where anyone signing up becomes part of the audience and an advertiser at the same time. You sign up and you can enter a link into their system, and that link is added to a roster that is send out to every member of the group. Additionally, registration allows a free solo ad; an ad that isn’t drowned out by other advertisers in that mailer.

As a website operator, the corresponding value also gives you an indication of how much traffic you need to generate to achieve similar success with other projects.

Organic traffic is the traffic you get when people follow links from a search engine results page and land on your site. Organic traffic contrasts with referral traffic which comes from links on other sites, and paid traffic, which is traffic resulting from ads. You can boost organic traffic by using content marketing, and by optimizing that content with SEO. Well-optimized content is more likely to get a high search ranking, and attract more clicks and traffic.
In a very crowded, noisy space – entrepreneurs and small business owners with a ton of “experts and influencers.” How do I get “above the noise?” I have built up a great brand and, I think, some great content based on a boatload of practical, real-life experience.

There are many option for a blog or website to drive traffic. You can buy paid traffic, you can use forums to promote your blog, and many more ways. Here I will share some of the working tips, which will help you to increase website traffic.. One point that you should always remember “Content is king”, and if you want to retain those one-time visitors, you need to have outstanding content.
Gone are the days when a product page or blog post or two could serve as your sole lead-generation assets for the month. Nowadays, with more and more content on more and more websites, the bar has been raised for both the quality of your content, and the frequency with which you update your site’s content. Quantity applies to generally keeping the interest of your readers, but more importantly, it keeps the search engines fed and happy, and keeps your business coming up in search results.
The largest search engines, Google, Bing and Yahoo, each have fairly simple programs to get started. You determine the key words or search phrase as well as the amount you are willing to spend (per click and/or per day). Most of them offer simple programs that require you to fill out a form and put a certain amount of money down as credit; you can also use a credit card to pay as you go. Like anything new, start small with paid SEM and add complexity (and budget) as you learn more and see results over time.

4. Add a blog to your website; blog can attract quality traffic courtesy to their huge content. Blogs have a dynamic content enriched with powerful keywords; use these keywords to attract your customers. Blogs give you the option of adding many multimedia features as well which can be eye catching. But keep posting in post at regular intervals on the blog. Add a forum to the blog and enable guest posting. Guest posting sometimes can attract huge traffic.
Creating content with a baked-in incentive for thought leaders to share it like thought leader “round up” posts (Richard Marriott from Clambr has a great free in-depth guide on the subject here: http://www.clambr.com/expert-roundups/), best of lists, lists of tips and resources where you’re linking to and citing other folks’ content (which gives them an incentive to share)

Not all web traffic is welcomed. Some companies offer advertising schemes that, in return for increased web traffic (visitors), pay for screen space on the site. There is also "fake traffic", which is bot traffic generated by a third party. This type of traffic can damage a website's reputation, its visibility on Google, and overall domain authority.[citation needed]
However, the tool is often criticized for only being able to deliver data on a limited number of websites. This is due to how Quantcast works: website operators first need to set up a data collection feed on their website so that Quantcast can collect data and estimate traffic from then on. If a page doesn’t work, the tool cannot display matching results. Because of this, Quantcast only really offers data on large, well-known websites.
This information hits the mark. “If you want your content to go viral, write content that influencers in your niche will want to share.” I love the information about share triggers too. I’m wondering, though, if you could share your insights on how influencers manage to build such vast followings. At some point, they had to start without the support of other influencers. It would seem that they found a way to take their passion directly to a “ready” world. Excellent insights. Thanks for sharing.
Many websites do not publish their traffic figures, so it can often be difficult to get accurate values. However, some commercial websites offer media data as PDF files or else on an extra advertising page: there you will find all relevant traffic figures and even demographic data on visitor groups. Because information about traffic and target groups is extremely important for companies that want to advertise on websites, website operators only publish their figures out of self-interest to woo potential advertising partners.
Great article as always. My wife is about to start a business about teaching (mainly) Mums how to film and edit little movies of their loved ones for posterity (www.lovethelittlethings.com launching soon). We have always struggled with thinking of and targeting relevant keywords because keywords like ‘videography’ and ‘family movies’ don’t really some up what she is about. Your article ties in with other learnings we have come across where we obviously need to reach out to right people and get them to share to get her product out there because purely focusing on keywords I don’t think will get us anywhere.
When you buy website traffic you can drive potential clients to your website and see the first results long before you see the results of your ‘traditional’ online marketing activities. What the most important results will be for your website is something that you have to decide for yourself. But one thing you can be certain of is that will you get a lot more visitors if you buy website traffic here at WebTrafficExperts.
There are several web traffic referral sources. Organic traffic comes from search engines. Referral traffic comes from other websites. Display traffic comes from ads for your business on other sites. Paid traffic comes from promotions via sites like AdWords. Social traffic comes from social media sites. Each type of traffic can be further divided into individual traffic sources. For example, organic traffic can come from Google, Bing, or other search engines. And social traffic can come from a variety of sites.
I find it interesting that you talked about nutrition supplements for athletes. I am very close to launching such a product for enhancing aerobic exercise performance in women (ie. improved times in a 3 mile run).. The product contains no stimulants or exotic herbs. In fact three of the five ingredients are well known minerals, but in forms not found in most multi-vitamin-mineral supplements. The research behind the product comes from me. The credibility behind the research is that I am a professor of human nutrition with over 100 research papers. Now, the trick will be to use my connections and credibility in a business savvy way.
Disclosure: CollectiveRay is funded personally out of pure passion for helping people working with websites. We do however generate some income through recommendations of products. This means if you click on a link and purchase an item we link to, we will receive a small sum out of that sale. We usually partner with vendors to make your purchase cheaper than buying direct.
Hi Brian! Very good and exactly what I was looking for. I have a problem though, we are creating the first video editing software that edits video WHILE FILMING. We are video geeks with a lot of experience, however we are trying to appeal to GoPro users and video tutorial makers but we have little knowledge in that field. Any suggestions on how we write about that if we have no idea about the space?
Tracking tools can provide website operators with a useful indication on how to adapt an online project to suit a target group. These tools focus on user profiles, which reveal how users find the website, and which content provokes interactions. This information is based on user data, which can be subject to stringent data protection guidelines in some countries within the European Union. Find out...

Slide presentation, though this seems traditional way, a presentation with attractive slides can bring more traffic and leads to your business. If you’re more concerned about leads than traffic, start creating a slide or hire a designer. I recommend Slideshare.net to share your slides, as this can bring more exposure to your slides. You can check out the Harsh’s profile on Slideshare, where he utilized his webpage to PDF technique, to create slides for SlideShare.
If you have the resources to hire a marketing company which will run a huge campaign for your website - go for it, but even then you can still profit from buying highly targeted website traffic. From the moment you place an order, to the first visitors showing up and knocking at your website’s virtual door it usually takes less than 24 hours. Do you know any faster way to get to potential clients? If yes - please let us know :)
Great article, learned a lot from it! But I still really get it with the share trigger and right content. For instance, the influencers now care a lot about the new Koenigsegg Agera RS >> https://koenigsegg.com/blog/ (Car). I thought about an article like “10 things you need to know about the Koenigsegg Agera RS”. The only problem is that I don’t know which keywords I should use and how i can put in share triggers.
I mean have you seen a recent downfall of EA Community Team and their post on Reddit who got 674k downvotes? It was a heavy blow to their whole company even their stocks and shareholders suffered consequences (of course not everything was related to that post but it still had an enormous impact on their sales and pre orders). My point is, ALWAYS try to find someone with whom you can consult about those things DON’T just do them on your own, it might bite you in the back.
“In conclusion, this research illuminates how content characteristics shape whether it becomes viral. When attempting to generate word of mouth, marketers often try targeting “influentials,” or opinion leaders (i.e., some small set of special people who, whether through having more social ties or being more persuasive, theoretically have more influence than others). Although this approach is pervasive,recent research has cast doubt on its value (Bakshy et al. 2011; Watts 2007) and suggests that it is far from cost effective. Rather than targeting “special” people, the current research suggests that it may be more beneficial to focus on crafting contagious content. By considering how psychological processes shape social transmission, it is possible to gain deeper insight into collective outcomes, such as what becomes viral.”
We all knew how importance is getting traffic to a blog or a business page. Most of us also knew how much it`s important to get targeted traffic to the blog than the untargeted one. Without targeted traffic, you can`t make a single dime out of your blog. Major traffic for many blogs comes from search engines, of course from Google. But from last 12 months we`ve seen a drastic change in Google`s nature which forced all the blog owners to bind them to Google`s rules. Anyway I don`t have hard feelings with Google. I agree they`re striving hard to give relevant and quality content to users.
I have to say I was a bit dubious about using the 'revisitors' tool as it concerned me it was just another way of extracting cash out of customers without knowing what sort of results one might get. I have to say I was impressed by the website although concerned when ordering that it said that I would be charged each month until cancelled. This worried me and I nearly did not signup. However after I had, I saw that it was easy to cancel.? May I sugges tthat you make that much clearer on the sales page. Other than that, I am most impressed that you bothered to write to me with comments and although I cam using a well jknown page set, I will consider using your services for some other things I am planning. Well done to all, very professional and refreshing service."
Display traffic is traffic to your site from ads or banners on other sites. For example, you might pay for placement of a banner on a related site, or run an affiliate program where the ads link back to your site. Display traffic contrasts with organic traffic, which comes from search engines, and paid traffic, which comes from programs like AdWords. If you want to attract display traffic, consider hiring a graphic design expert to create attractive, click-worthy banners.
Targeted visitors have a specific goal in mind while normal visitors are browsing the web without having a particular objective. Targeted visitors are looking for a solution to their problem and they are visiting your website because they believe they can find the answer to their question, the product or service they want. In other words targeted traffic are those people that visit a website with the intention of performing an action.
Web analytics is the measurement of the behavior of visitors to a website. In a commercial context, it especially refers to the measurement of which aspects of the website work towards the business objectives of Internet marketing initiatives; for example, which landing pages encourage people to make a purchase. Notable vendors of web analytics software and services include Google Analytics, IBM Digital Analytics (formerly Coremetrics) and Adobe Omniture.
Glen takes various examples of how simple ideas and websites have gone viral in the past. He made a Feedburner mini-site and emailed a mere six people about it and tweeted the link once. The site had made to the HackerNews homepage the very next day, garnered 500 or so back links in a single day and the domain is now a PR 4. The whole thing was made in less than a day, looks ugly and is not even properly optimized for mobile.
Finally, another important thing you would want to keep in mind is that on-page optimization also includes the design and functionality of your website. If your website sports a 90s design, or makes it a struggle for the users to find what they are looking for, it’s definitely going to hurt your chances of not only getting targeted traffic through SEO, but also converting the traffic into leads and sales.
Hey Brian I must say it’s a awesome content you are sharing .my question to you is how did you transform from a nutrition expert to a Seo master I mean both subjects are poles apart so how did you learn SEO can you share your story because I find my self in similar situation I am an engineer by profession and I am starting a ecommerce business niche is Apparel no experience of watspever in Blog writing and SEO if you can throw some resources where I can improve my skills that would be a huge help
Website operators pull out all the stops to try and guide visitors to their web presences, through advertisements, links, or simply high-quality content. To measure the impact of different measures, Google Analytics tracks the behavior of site visitors and sums it up in detailed statistics. But how does Google do this and how can this be useful for your site?
Ask a marketer or business owner what they’d like most in the world, and they’ll probably tell you “more customers.” What often comes after customers on a business’ wish list? More traffic to their site. There are many ways you can increase traffic on your website, and in today’s post, we’re going to look at 25 of them, including several ways to boost site traffic for FREE.
I’m considering a niche that I’m not sure I can find good influencers for – fundraising. School fundraising or charitable fundraising. I’m passionate about it but how would I get my articles shared by influencers? The non-profit sector is somewhat apprehensive about promoting commercial sites, unless it’s fundraising software. The name really says it all: “non”-profit.
Writing a list post on your blog, a life lesson, publishing a roundup, focusing on a money keyword and writing tons of posts around are some of the tactics that can double your traffic generation efforts. You will also find tips to convert one blog post idea into 10, the optimum length of the post to drive more clicks and links and much more in this Neil Patel and Sherice Jacob’s guide.
"We started to experiment buying website traffic a few months ago. We tried several different companies that were worthless and their traffic was untrackable or nonexistent. We then tried SEO WEBSITE TRAFFIC and immediately saw the difference. The traffic shows up perfectly in Google Analytics so we could see that the traffic they were sending was 100% genuine. Better still was the fact that the visitors we received loved our site and kept returning. We now purchase a traffic package every month from SEO WEBSITE TRAFFFIC to increase our visitor base."
Great content. Although I disagree with ‘the best times to post’ section. It is important to understand your audience. For example, if your brand/business is in high school, there will be low engagement until 2-5 when they are out of school. I highly suggest using instagram analytics (a subsidiary of facebook analytics) which gives you all of the details on when your followers are active. https://www.facebook.com/help/788388387972460
What will you do with the traffic you get through above suggested ways? Nothing? Then you`re wasting your time and money. Capture their email address when they visit your blog. I`d recommend Aweber, recently I too got it and I must say it`s very easy to use and manage your list. You can read our earlier guide on how to create a mailing list using Aweber, and use any of these email marketing WordPress plugin to supercharge your list.
There is no magic formula for content marketing success, despite what some would have you believe. For this reason, vary the length and format of your content to make it as appealing as possible to different kinds of readers. Intersperse shorter, news-based blog posts with long-form content as well as video, infographics and data-driven pieces for maximum impact.
Like you I am a scientist and like you did in the past, I am currently working on translating great scientific literature into tips. In my case it’s child development research into play tips for parents. I can already see that the outcome of my experiment is going to be the same as yours. Great content but who cares. I hadn’t even thought about my key influences. I know some important ones, but don’t see how they would share my content. I thought I was writing content for my potential customers. Is your SEO that works course the same as the content that gets results course? Sorry if I sound a bit dim asking that question.
When Larry wrote about the kick in the proverbial teeth that eBay took from Google’s Panda update, we managed to secure a link from Ars Technica in the Editor’s Pick section alongside links to The New York Times and National Geographic. Not too shabby – and neither was the resulting spike in referral traffic. Learn what types of links send lots of referral traffic, and how to get them, in this post.
For another thing, the Internet has somewhere in the neighborhood of two decades worth of traffic bot programs littering the digital ground. Some have gone through upwards of a dozen name changes and rebrands, moving from one site to another. They disappear, leaving existing users in the lurch, never to receive support or updates when the program stops working. Then identical software comes out under a new name, charging anywhere from $5 to $250, scamming people out of their cash with the same back-end software.
I am going to start by assuming you have identified who your target is. If you have done that homework (which most small businesses miss) then kudos to you. I will give you 4 pointers to help you drive targeted traffic. I will also forewarn you that these will cost you a lot of time and possibly a lot of money so I would also advise you to speak to someone who does these things professionally.

They are popping up at an ever-increasing rate. By socializing with others on the net through these sites, everything you join or participate in gives you more people to see your site. And, if you're selling stuff from your site, you'll want to go to the places (interest groups) on the social site where people are interested in what you're selling.

“Syndicate carefully: If you syndicate your content on other sites, Google will always show the version we think is most appropriate for users in each given search, which may or may not be the version you’d prefer. However, it is helpful to ensure that each site on which your content is syndicated includes a link back to your original article. You can also ask those who use your syndicated material to use the noindex meta tag to prevent search engines from indexing their version of the content.”
In my experience, a lot of people are more open about sharing traffic stats then you would think. You see this not just in interviews but if you peruse through the archived articles on a blog, there’s a good chance you’ll stumble upon a “blog in review” or “traffic report” post. With those stats, you can start to figure out how much traffic the site is getting today.
With our traffic network, more than 20 million unique visitors from across the internet with over 60 million daily impressions.

A good example of a basic but highly functional website would probably be Majestecsocal.com. However, the exact type of design you should be considering depends on your target audience and niche. In some niches (like the one the example website is based around), users would want to have everything in one place, and hence a basic but very functional design would hit the spot pretty well.
Loved this article. I was in stuck mode. Am relatively new to blogging. Started online business and website about 3 months ago. Am learning a lot, but had an ah ha moment about traffic – targeted traffic and found this article. Thanks for the great tips. I hope to implement all of them, and realize how much more there is to each one of the steps you outline. Great stuff!
Brian, I’ve drunk your Kool aid! Thank you for honesty and transparency – it really gives me hope. Quick question: I am beyond passionate about a niche (UFOs, extraterrestrials, free energy) and know in my bones that an authority site is a long term opportunity. The problem today is that not many products are attached to this niche and so it becomes a subscriber / info product play. However, after 25+ years as an entrepreneur with a financial background and marketing MBA, am I Internet naive to believe that my passion and creativity will win profitability in the end? The target audience is highly passionate too. Feedback?
You have also mentioned Quuu for article sharing and driving traffic. I have been using Quuu for quite sometime now and I don’t think they’re worth it. While the content does get shared a lot, there are hardly any clicks to the site. Even the clicks that are there, average time is like 0.02 seconds compared to more than 2 minutes for other sources of traffic on my website. I have heard a few guys having a similar experience with Quuu and so, I thought should let you know.
“After enough time in the trenches, I’m a bit tired of the whole ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine’ mentality. So my goal is to show you how to scratch YOUR OWN back and be self reliant in your success and results moving forward. Best part of this? You get to be your OWN person… and follow your own path to the riches that will follow.” –Mark Tandan
When we see a sharp decline in traffic, we first check the site’s code. During site changes and redesigns, SSL and 301 redirects are often overlooked, causing Google to de-index the site's pages and search rankings to drop. The drop in rankings can dramatically decrease visitors. So when building a new site or making changes to your current one, double-check your redirects before pushing live. - Michael Weinhouse, Logical Position
Hi Brian, i absolutely love your content.My competitors and influence rs are very strong-most of them government bodies or supported by government, or travel guides known worldwide.I constantly follow them,get onto them.like,share,comment etc.they share photos that are submitted to them,and i do photography myself which takes hours and still can’t reach out big audience…Any idea please what could i create that my influence rs would love to share (hard to find out what they care,they get 100’s photos submitted daily and collaborate with other big names…) Please help me.
Use Google. Google Adwords is the most popular method for traffic. Since they are the top search engine right now it make sense to advertise there if you can afford it. You bid on keywords to get your site at the top of the search when your keyword comes up. There is more involved but it's all laid out at Google. There are a lot of other sites that use this advertising strategy called pay per click or PPC.
The majority of website traffic is driven by the search engines. Millions of people use search engines every day to research various topics, buy products, and go about their daily surfing activities. Search engines use keywords to help users find relevant information, and each of the major search engines has developed a unique algorithm to determine where websites are placed within the search results. When a user clicks on one of the listings in the search results, they are directed to the corresponding website and data is transferred from the website's server, thus counting the visitors towards the overall flow of traffic to that website.
People love to learn, and webinars are an excellent way to impart your wisdom to your eagerly waiting audience. Combined with an effective social promotion campaign, webinars are a great way to increase traffic to your website. Send out an email a week or so ahead of time, as well as a “last chance to register” reminder the day before the webinar. Make sure to archive the presentation for later viewing, and promote your webinars widely through social media. If you're wondering how to do a webinar, click the link for some tips.
For a website to be successful it all starts with landing pages that convert well and have high conversion rates. This means that a high percentage of the people that visit your website also actually perform a desired action. A desired action could be the purchase of a product, a membership registration, newsletter subscriptions or clicking on an advertisement, but it can also be any action that you want your visitors to do that goes beyond simple web browsing.
A widespread tool for traffic analysis is SimilarWeb, owned by the Israeli SimilarGroup: upon entering the domain you will receive the most diverse data straight away. The tool reminds us a bit of Google Analytics with regard to the scope and data formatting. The way these analysis results are displayed is extremely helpful: for example, they show the temporal development of traffic and the various traffic channels, like social media, direct traffic, or e-mail. There is even a breakdown of the most relevant social media channels: you gain a lot of information about the online strategy of your competitors.
Hi Brian! Very good and exactly what I was looking for. I have a problem though, we are creating the first video editing software that edits video WHILE FILMING. We are video geeks with a lot of experience, however we are trying to appeal to GoPro users and video tutorial makers but we have little knowledge in that field. Any suggestions on how we write about that if we have no idea about the space?
I am new at this. I have been researching keywords and have found a few keyword phrases that nobody in the first page of Google results is even using in their Title Tag or H1 Tag. Some of the companies on the results page have a high pagerank and lots of backlinks. If I optimize for this exact keyword phrase with a new website, would I have much of a chance of getting on the first page eventually?
This particular site isn’t really an automatic traffic generator. Instead, it’s an old, long-running network for email lists. The idea is to build an email list independent of SEO or Google, which frees you from the rigors of content marketing. You still need to work to generate leads, and you still need a website to pull in opt-ins, but FFA gives you a wide range of tools you can use to succeed. For example, a heat map and Google Analytics integration ensures the system gives you all the information you need to succeed. You can split-test as many as 100 variants on a given page, to make sure you’re using the best one. And, of course, the network is old and long-running, meaning it has a positive reputation and a history of being effective. You can find plenty of support from the staff and other users.
Thanks Jure. That actually makes sense. Exactly: I’ve tested lowering the number of tips in a few posts and it’s helped CTR/organic traffic. One thing to keep in mind is that the number can also be: the year, time (like how long it will take to find what someone needs), % (like 25% off) etc. It doesn’t have to be the number of tips, classified ads, etc.
Hi, my name is Dimitrios and I am responsible for Crave Culinaire’s digital marketing. I would like to drive more traffic to Crave’s blog. Since Crave Culinaire is the only catering company who provides molecular cuisine, I thought about craving a blog post about that. The influencers in this niche have great success in utilizing recipes on their blogs. I will share some recipes of Brian Roland, owner and head chef of Crave Culinaire.
He is the co-founder of Neil Patel Digital. The Wall Street Journal calls him a top influencer on the web, Forbes says he is one of the top 10 marketers, and Entrepreneur Magazine says he created one of the 100 most brilliant companies. Neil is a New York Times bestselling author and was recognized as a top 100 entrepreneur under the age of 30 by President Obama and a top 100 entrepreneur under the age of 35 by the United Nations.
Many websites do not publish their traffic figures, so it can often be difficult to get accurate values. However, some commercial websites offer media data as PDF files or else on an extra advertising page: there you will find all relevant traffic figures and even demographic data on visitor groups. Because information about traffic and target groups is extremely important for companies that want to advertise on websites, website operators only publish their figures out of self-interest to woo potential advertising partners.
Often when people start working for traffic on their website, they get a negative response from search engine results. Getting targeted traffic from search engines is not an easy task. Yet traffic being the fuel of all online business you need to get it somehow. Search engines are not sole gateway to drive traffic to your site, there are plenty more methods by which you can get your targeted traffic.
PBP is sort of a cross between a traffic generator and a multi-level marketing scheme, only without the threats that MLM traditionally entails. You’re not absolutely required to sign up under someone, though the program does cost money on a monthly basis. You’re granted access to traffic generation tools, as well as other promotional information and training. The MLM comes in with their referral commissions, which many people use more than the marketing tools themselves. There’s a sizable commission for enrolling new members, as well as seeing them succeed.
Google is paying more attention to the meaning of search terms and less attention to the combinations of letters and words. It’s called “semantic search.” Scroll through the search results and see if other phrases, not just the phrase you entered, are bolded. If you see synonyms and related words in bold text, that means Google has created a semantic link between your words and these words. Write these down.
There are many option for a blog or website to drive traffic. You can buy paid traffic, you can use forums to promote your blog, and many more ways. Here I will share some of the working tips, which will make your blog traffic independent of search engines. One point that you should always remember “Content is king”, and if you want to retain those one-time visitors, you need to have outstanding content. A good idea is to offer premium content for free.
There were some great tips in this article. I notice that many people make the mistake of making too many distracting images in the header and the sidebar which can quickly turn people off content. I particularly dislike google ads anchored in the centre of a piece of text. I understand that people want to make a revenue for ads but there are right ways and wrong ways of going about this. The writing part of the content is the important part, why would you take a dump on it by pouring a load of conflicting media in the sides?
This was very interesting. I run a website that promotes sports entertainment amongst teenagers who are graphic designers or video editors. The foundation is in place (Over 60 contributors) so my only focus is how to blog consistently about what goes on in the sports world with appeal to teenagers. I am confident i took a huge step today after learning these 4 steps!
Thanks Brian. I’ve had a “a-ha” moment thanks to you! Great advice. I knew that backlinks would improve the organic SEO rankings to our client-targeted landing pages but I never knew it was through getting influencers to backlink blogs. I always just assumed it was great content that users wanted to share with others. It was driving me mad why people love my content but never share enough. Now I know!
I’ve always been one to create great content, but now I see it may not necessarily be the right content. Can Share Triggers work for all niches including things like plumbing companies, computer repair, maybe even handy men that have a website for their business? I would say I’m estimating half the views a month as I should. Hopefully some of these strategies will help.
LinkedIn has become much more than a means of finding another job. The world’s largest professional social network is now a valuable publishing platform in its own right, which means you should be posting content to LinkedIn on a regular basis. Doing so can boost traffic to your site, as well as increase your profile within your industry – especially if you have a moderate to large following.
Piggy back on the success of others. Create a presence on websites which are highly trafficked. This is beside the Facebooks, the Twitters, and the YouTubes. Figure out the relevant sites in your niche and get yourself linked in there. If you are a music producer, it’s Soundcloud. If you are a Joomla developer, it’s the JED. If you focus on WordPress, it’s the Plugins directory. Find the behemoth in your niche, and piggyback a ride on their success. It's also good to find a niche in your niche. Riding on somebody's success is a guaranteed way of increasing website traffic. Hence the reason people guest post. More on that later.
Guest blogging is a two-way street. In addition to posting content to other blogs, invite people in your niche to blog on your own site. They’re likely to share and link to their guest article, which could bring new readers to your site. Just be sure that you only post high-quality, original content without spammy links, because Google is cracking way down on low-quality guest blogging.
Social-If you have identified where your target spends their time online go there. One of my personal quotes is “Meet Your Clients on Their Terms, Where They Are”. Remember that you are in their space so act accordingly. If you jump on any social platform and sell, sell, sell you will not do well at all. Provide value, be personable and engage with others. It’s 80% give and 20% take on social.
Yep and sometimes it’s just being a little creative. I’ve started a little blog on seo/wordpress just for fun actually… no great content on it like here though… but because the competition is so tough in these niches I decided to take another approach. I created a few WordPress plugins that users can download for free from wordpress.org… and of course these link to my site so this gets me visitors each day.
Firstly, a disclaimer – don’t spam Reddit and other similar sites hoping to “hit the jackpot” of referral traffic, because it’s not going to happen. Members of communities like Reddit are extraordinarily savvy to spam disguised as legitimate links, but every now and again, it doesn’t hurt to submit links that these audiences will find genuinely useful. Choose a relevant subreddit, submit your content, then watch the traffic pour in.
Monster-Traffic is another traffic exchange, though it’s initially a little off-putting due to the 1995-style website. It’s a free for all styled advertising list, where anyone signing up becomes part of the audience and an advertiser at the same time. You sign up and you can enter a link into their system, and that link is added to a roster that is send out to every member of the group. Additionally, registration allows a free solo ad; an ad that isn’t drowned out by other advertisers in that mailer.
Hey andy thanks for sharing your knowledge with us,the factors you said are all helpful to get targeted web site traffic but the fresh and great piece of content always gives you the better position is SERP’s. So one should make content useful and new. As content is king but links are queens. So don’t forget to have some high quality links. By the way thanks
incredible post and just what i needed! i’m actually kinda new to blogging (my first year coming around) and so far my expertise has been in copy writing/seo copy writing. however link building has become tedious for me. your talk about influencing influencers makes perfect sense, but i find it difficult for my niche. my blog site is made as “gift ideas” and holiday shoppers complete with social networks. i get shares and such from my target audience, but i find that my “influencers” (i.e etsy, red box, vat19, etc.) don’t allow dofollow links and usually can’t find suitable sources. I guess my trouble is just prospecting in general.
Thanks Brian for your article. I am in the healthy living niche. I want to team up with bloggers in my own niche where we can share material it makes sense to me. But I have my own unique message and that is what I have been devoted to! Dah! I see now that my focus should be on what is popular among my peers and add to this. I think I’m finally getting the picture! I am specifically into FOOD MEDICINE perhaps I should start writting about the dangers of a Gluten free diet! Not for everyone!
I have been trying to produce more content because I believed the lack of traffic was to the small amount of content, but after reading your blog post, i’m beginning to doubt wether or not this is quality content. I will definitely do more research on influencers on my niche, now I have to figure out how to get their attention with my kind of content.
Website tracking is very important in online marketing to be able to see how users are interacting on your site. The first choice is normally the tracking tool offered by the search engine, Google. But for data protection reasons, more and more users are looking for alternatives to Google Analytics. There’s a great selection of web analytics tools – we will examine applications with similar...
The Internet is positively riddled with traffic generators. They range from low-quality autorefresh bots using proxies to appear as though they come from around the world, to sophisticated traffic exchange systems powered by real people and real advertising. Ideally, you’ll strike upon the most valuable of these networks when you’re searching, but there’s a few problems.
Thanks for sharing these great tips last August! I’ve recently adopted them and I have a question (that’s kind of connected to the last post): how important would promoting content be when using this strategy? For example, through Google Adwords. As I guess that would depend on the circumstances, but I am trying to discover if there’s a ‘formula’ here. Thanks in advance!
The truth is, dear reader, that content overrules everything. You cannot make a success of a site unless you have the valued content there to begin with, as a foundation for your work. If that content is not there, nothing will come of it. If it is there and it’s valuable, the rest will pretty much take care of itself (aside from the physical aspect of site performance).
Thanks for the very, very in-depth article. I am a real estate agent in Miami, Florida and have been blogging all-original content for the past 21 months on my website and watched traffic increase over time. I have been trying to grow my readership/leads/clients exponentially and have always heard about standard SEO backlink techniques and writing for my reader, not influencers. Recently, I have had a few of my articles picked up and backlinked by 2 of the largest real estate blogs in the country, which skyrocketed visits to my site. Realizing what I wrote about, that appealed to them, and now reading your article, I am going to continue writing in a way that will leverage those influencers to help me with quality backlinks.
Whenever advertisers look for direct display ads or sponsored post ads on any blog or website they usually look for the metrics as those are the only signs via which one can get idea about the quality of website before even contacting with the owner. Getting targeted visitors via traffic generation tool will improve the rank and the rank will help you to get more advertisers who will pay you.
2. Engage yourself in guest blogging to websites belonging to your niche. Blogs are a great source for traffic, guest post on quality blogs can bring back traffic from those blogs. Commenting on blogs can also deliver back links but remember do not blindly comment on every other blog, post the comments only when you have something important to deliver.
Peak Features: 1. You can specify unlimited number of page views. 2. Traffic from any geographic location (proxy support) 3. One click import of web page links from text file 4. You can specify unlimited number of pages to the list at a time. 5. Visiting interval starts from milli seconds. 6. Viewing the progress of running status. This is a portable and user friendly application that works on all kind of web sites. You can set time interval between visiting each pages. In case you need more number of page views, minimize the time interval as required. Nothing more to say, this free tool can perform more than you expected.
When someone visits a website, their computer or other web-connected device communicates with the website's server. Each page on the web is made up of dozens of distinct files. The site's server transmits each file to user browsers where they are assembled and formed into a cumulative piece with graphics and text. Every file sent represents a single “hit”, so a single page viewing can result in numerous hits.
Set up a blog. These are a very good method for getting traffic to your site and they are free. You can start one at one of many free blog sites. Then you set up a feed for content and then go to other blogs with the same topics or fields of interests and read and comment on their articles. As well a lot allow you to post your article which gives you more traffic.
Even though traffic is intrinsically tied to conversation rates, it seems that too many people have a lot of misunderstandings regarding the relationship between these two aspects. For one thing, the size of the traffic you get does not matter If it doesn’t lead to the kind of conversion rate you need. If you really want to earn money from the visitors coming to your site, they need to be of high quality.
Web traffic is the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a website. This necessarily does not include the traffic generated by bots. Since the mid-1990s, web traffic has been the largest portion of Internet traffic.[1] This is determined by the number of visitors and the number of pages they visit. Sites monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic to see which parts or pages of their site are popular and if there are any apparent trends, such as one specific page being viewed mostly by people in a particular country. There are many ways to monitor this traffic and the gathered data is used to help structure sites, highlight security problems or indicate a potential lack of bandwidth.

Under code orange conditions, the outdoor air is likely to be unhealthy for some people. Children, people who are sensitive to ozone and people with heart or lung disease should limit prolonged exposure during late afternoon or early evening hours when ozone concentrations are at their highest.
Motorists are advised to fill their tanks up early in the day, as later in the day, fill-ups can contribute to the additional ozone in the air. If you can at all avoid driving, you're advised to take mass transit to get to where you need to go, which will also lessen the smog in the air.

The EPD says the figure means Atlanta's air is unhealthy for sensitive groups, and it's issued an orange smog alert for the area.

I am an easy going bloke from the north coast, and I guess am pretty trusting but never considered myself a fool or an easy target. But then again I had never encountered operators like Money Catch.
I mean these guys are really polished and they are the type to look you straight in the eyes and lie to you with a warm smile. They did a real number on me, I’ll give them that. Got me trusting them to do the job they said they were going to do, they may account details, my ID cards and cleaned me out.
Of course, if you ask, they don’t know me and have nothing to do with the fraud that cleaned out my account. They really are something else.
You know something is wrong when so many come out and start voicing their opinions. Most companies have a few negative reviews. even the huge ones like apple, google etc have their fair share. Some are genuine, some are fake. Usually, the negatives for a legitimate company only amount to an only a small percentage of all reviews.
Fair enough some people want to have a bitch because they have nothing better to do but when the majority of reviews are angry customers as is the case with Money Catch and where people are showing that the positive reviews are fake or bought ( I even saw a screenshot proving it, so it is true) well, Buyers Beware and enter at own risk.
If you get into bed with these scammers and when you do get scammed and lose your dough as I did then you will too post a negative review, but it will be too late and good luck proving it! You cant…
They look really clean, use logos all over their website and emails, everything to bring you in and what your goose is cooked.
Money Catch style scams make full use of imagery to trick and mislead; very high quality images like like official logos, positive imagery and ‘ licencing and accredited membership’ often baiting the mark ‘ go and verify’ for themselves.
Money Catch reviews we bring the good, the bad and the ugly. What you can expect is reporting of scams as they occur with full break downs of how they are developed and successfully operated.
One Poll is a company that was founded in the United Kingdom, but it’s also open to consumers in the United States and beyond. It claims to be recognized by Money Saving Expert, one of the largest consumer websites in that country, which is a reassuring recommendation. What I recognized about it is that the surveys are short and easy to complete, so ideal if you’ve had a hard day and don’t want to do anything too taxing. New surveys are added on a daily basis, and some are amusingly quirky.
This site pays highly – at least $3 a survey and up to $6 for testing products. If you stay with them, the pay even increases by a few dollars, taking the wage far above the standard survey rate. Owned by the renowned New York market research company Nielson, Pinecone offers a variety of content and emails surveys to members as and when they are suited to you.
This site offers surveys for money, paying out cash rather than points and allowing immediate rewards. Crowdology is a pretty popular website with a decent reputation which works with big brands and television shows, so can have some interesting content to keep you interested while you’re filling in forms. You could be answering questions about everyday topics or issues, such as saving money or online shopping, as well as your opinions about various products.
First, thank you for providing this extensive list. I wanted to offer a quick follow up. After reading your post I decided to give Survey Junkie a try and I’ve already closed the account. Yes, I can tell it’s well organized and it is definitely a user-friendly platform. The problems I experienced were first that not one of the surveys they emailed me about were available. I did, however, complete several surveys from the site itself and I found them to be lengthy – in itself, not a problem but 3 out of 5 told me I didn’t qualify after I’d already invested 10 – 12 minutes filling out the forms. They got more than enough information from me to be useful which is an old and highly unethical trick in market research – which happens to be my background. All in all a LOT of wasted time.
If you are looking for highest paying surveys, then you must join Harris Poll Online survey panel. Harris Poll Online is a well known market research company and has been in business for more than 50 years. Once you join Harris Poll Online you will have opportunity to participate in paid online surveys, focus group studies and paid product testing opportunities.
Hello everyone. I just wanted to share my experience with surveys. I was looking to make extra money online and came across this website where I found some of the best paying surveys. It has been only 3 weeks and I have made over $ 143 doing surveys. This is one of the easiest way to make money while being a full time mom. Thank you https://www.makemoneytakingsurveys.com/ . Check it out gals !!!
Illegitimate companies and scammers have a simple objective. They're after your information in order to get your money. It's much more common for internet scammers to target hundreds of people for small sums rather than a single person for thousands. This is because demanding large sums for a product that is somewhat unclear is an obvious red flag to most.
After you sign up, you’ll receive surveys on various topics and products via email. Once you complete these surveys and build up a stash of “points,” you can redeem them for cash via PayPal, purchases made through Amazon.com, or gift cards to various retailers. As an alternate suggestion, you can even redeem your rewards as a donation to the Red Cross.
Of course, it’s not always easy to increase your income. Your employer might hate giving raises, for example, or maybe overtime at work has become scarce. If that’s the case, you might need to pick up a part-time job, start a side hustle from home, or look for unorthodox ways to earn money in your spare time. Check out our post on how to become an Uber driver, this is a great side hustle because you can make your own schedule and pick up extra cash when its convenient for you.
In the middle of all of this is a new breed of research corporation that relies on you – the survey taker – to determine this information. For your time? Many survey companies will pay you to take surveys for money or for other cash alternatives like gift cards or physical prizes and rewards. It depends upon the company as to whether they'll offer money or other offers and special deals.
The other type of paid surveys CashCrate features are targeted surveys, which are available only to you and people who meet your demographic profile. It's very important that you fill out your profile on CashCrate right when you sign-up. Not only will you earn $.50 instantly, you'll also be eligible to receive these special surveys. So why are they so great? First, they'll often pay more than Daily Surveys. That means when you see one available, you should jump on it right away.
Renowned for its short and sweet surveys, OnePoll is a great site for dipping in and out of, without having to dedicate loads of time to. As one of the earliest survey sites to be set up, OnePoll certainly has longevity. Founded in the UK, it is open to US users and those further afield and runs polls for the press and leading brands. This means the content is more engaging than it can be elsewhere and you can find yourself answering questions about celebrities or gossip. Many users praise their surveys for being quick, and even better – fun! Topics are not as dry as they can be on other websites, and by keeping the surveys brief, OnePoll is less likely to leave you bored or frustrated.
When companies want to better focus their marketing, advertising, and product development efforts, they will contract with a market research firm to target their ideal demographic (for example, men between the ages of 40-60 who play golf), and gather information about consumers’ opinions on their product or service. You can read this article, to learn more about market research.
They don’t give a reason for this, but I assume it has to do with taxes. You see, if you pay someone $600 in any given year, you are required by law to report that earning and send them a tax form at the end of the year. And since 60,000 equals to $600, I assume they have that rule in place so they don’t have to deal with all that paperwork come tax time.
Swagbucks remains popular as they are a reliable site, offering novel ways to earn rewards, including playing games and watching videos. Completing polls and surveys for money takes around 10 minutes each and can make up the bulk of your time on the site. You won’t always qualify, and getting to a late stage in a survey application process and then finding out you’re not qualified can be pretty galling. The slickly designed website is straightforward and pleasing to use and also allows you to make money on your shopping by offering a range of affiliate links. By simply clicking on the Swagbucks link and shopping at sites including Amazon, Walmart and Nike, you will earn points, as those companies are paying Swagbucks to link to them, and you get a share of their fee.
Toluna – Been a member for maybe 7 years. They probably send 5-10 emails every day! I usually pick and choose 1-2 only because of decent rewards. For them, 3000 points is $1 so you have to be smart about they surveys. Getting 1,500 points for 20 mins seems ok until you realize it’s only 67 cents! Payout is $20 checks that come 1-2 weeks after you request them. It also takes weeks to get credited for a survey.
They used to be cash-only, but in 2013 they switched over to a points system. Panelists can share their opinions in surveys and complete other various offers in exchange for points. 100 points is equal to $1, and most of their surveys pay up to $3. Survey topics are diverse and cover a variety of different topics. Pinecone Research is unique in that they emphasize consumption related surveys more than other panels.
While product testing is offered, you’ll only get sent items if you qualify, and then it will only be a couple over the space of several months, so think of this as a bonus, rather than a regular part of your work. Some users get frustrated at the length of time they have to wait for vouchers to arrive after they order them – especially when somewhere like Opinion Outpost will pay out straight away. However it is unfortunately quite standard to have to wait weeks for payment from survey sites. Surveys range in duration from about 15 to 30 minutes and there are mini polls on the website which can help you tot up small amounts of extra points. Points do sometimes take days or even weeks to appear in Toluna accounts, which is worth noting.
Product testing can be a fun way to make some extra money and also get a chance to try something new before the general public. This should be treated as a bonus though, as you have no control over whether you’ll be chosen, as it is down to whether the company thinks you are the correct audience. The firm also runs lucky draws throughout the year, where you can win between $500 and $5,000, and you are entered into them as a reward each time you fill out a survey.

One of the most popular sites, and rightfully so, Swagbucks offers traditional surveys as well as a range of additional ways to make cash. Filling out surveys for money will reward you with points called Swagbucks which can be cashed out through PayPal, or redeemed as gift cards for shops including Amazon.com. As a sweetener, they’ll even give you $5 just for signing up.
By filling out your user profile thoroughly, you’ll be able to make sure you get invites to surveys which are actually suitable for you. There are basic qualification questions at the start of each questionnaire too, to ensure you are suited to filling it out before you get going. And you can make the most of the huge Toluna community yourself too – if you want, you can create your own polls on the site to ask people about anything and everything! It’s a nice addition to be able to get involved and have in-depth conversations with fellow users.
Survey Club has been offering online paid surveys since 2005, and in the fast paced every changing world of the web that’s a reassuringly long amount of time. They are a bit of an acquired taste, in that they specialise in long, detailed surveys for high end clients rather than the quick and cheerful consumer surveys that you may be more familiar with. Whilst this does mean that you may have to commit a bit more time, it does mean that if you have the patience to persevere with them they pay more money than most survey and reward sites. They also offer local taste tests (see what I said about ‘an acquired taste’?), and secret shopper opportunities.
What I like about them is they also run focus groups in the San Diego area. I signed up to receive phone calls and get them. I have little ones at home so it doesn’t quite work out for me to attend right now, but they do pay well. They were looking for adult men once to attend a focus group about food, and I shared the info with a friend’s husband who was out of work and made $80 in 2 hours with them at the focus group.
Valued Opinions – Decent site with reasonable surveys ($2 for a 20 min survey). Everyone is annoyed by this site because they tacked on a $2 few to the Amazon $20 gift card and $5 to the $20 Visa gift card so it costs $22 to get the $20 Amazon and $25 to get the $20 Visa. They claim its because of extra fees they incur. I dunno. Also, it can take weeks to get credited for a survey which is frustrating.
Unlike many sites, Valued Opinions doesn’t offer you the chance to take cash rewards, at the moment limiting users to retail vouchers and gift cards. Electronic vouchers are usually with you within 24 hours but gift cards can take four to six weeks to arrive in the post. Once $10 has been earned, you can claim Amazon vouchers, Macy’s gift cards and Visa promo codes, among many other reward options dependant on your location. Surveys are said to be varied, but the gift card options less so, so check they are for stores you’ll want to shop in before you tot up lots of points.
When offered a grand promise for a seemingly small price, many more are likely to fall for it. Being human, the idea of paying very little for great return is incredibly enticing. This is the leading idea behind offers like “Earn $200 every day! Just $10 for access to our exclusive list of high paying surveys.” When entering the arena of paid online surveys, it's important to be wary of any offer like this that seems too good to be true.
They include sites that seem to be their competitors because they earn referral fees when you buy memberships. A couple mentioned in scam forums even try to dupe you into buying the same list at other membership sites they own under different names. Naturally, these sites also have an incentive to exaggerate how much you'll earn from online paid surveys.
Paid survey site companies invest billions of dollars into marketing research online. They always want to find out more intricate details of a consumer's relationship with their product. Whether it's a new television show or just an existing product line, companies like Disney, Samsung, and Sony go to great lengths to find out their ideal audiences.
One of the great things about Survey Savvy is that they really do offer a great variety of surveys to choose from, so you won’t simply be talking about the consumer goods that you buy on a day to day basis. They have surveys on topical issues and about politics in general, but don’t worry you don’t have to be a political animal to be able to complete the survey – you just need to have an opinion. Another thing I really appreciated about survey savvy is that their surveys are short and snappy, and you can complete them within ten minutes or even less. That means you can quickly earn the points that can then be exchanged into folding cash.
It’s easy to earn cash for surveys. How much you get paid completely depends on how many paid surveys you attempt and complete. Each online survey has a different payout, with some offering as much as $50. Most will pay less, but also take less time. Expect to earn about 40 to 200 SB points per survey (100 SB = $1), with occasional opportunities with much higher earning potential.
I am so grateful and loved to see your article as I was hunting for one like yours. It is well written and appreciated. Thank you. I Drive a taxi for a living, but sodium deficiency in my blood forced me to stop driving. I get nasty dizziness attacks while driving. Passengers go nuts when I stop the car and go take two glass of salt water to stop the dizziness. So, I stopped driving and am trying out online internet jobs for a living. Do pass on any good legitimate websites you may know out there for online form filing, content writing, or data entry to earn a square meal. Please help. Thanks.
Something unique that MyPoints offers that most other similar companies don't offer is the ability to earn cash back on some in-store purchases at select stores, along with their online paid surveys. Also, although their online store cashback rates aren't the highest in the industry (ironically, Swagbucks beats them on several offers), they do have special offers that other companies don't have, such as a bonus to sign up for Amazon Prime.
Privacy: 5.0/5.0 – As a sister company to Swagbucks, MyPoints is governed by the same privacy policy, which is detailed and very reasonable. In our experience, MyPoints has never sent us spam. As is typical, MyPoints does link to other sites that have different privacy policies, but to be fair, our 5 star rating is based on the MyPoints privacy policy. You can view the MyPoints privacy policy for yourself here.
Joining isn’t as straightforward as merely signing up, because you need an invite. However it’s not as tough as it sounds, as there are plenty of links doing the rounds online if you look hard enough, and Pinecone also advertises on websites, so you might get lucky by keeping an eye on banner adverts. Once you’ve signed up, you’ll be vetted to see if you qualify – based on whatever demographics their clients want at that point – and if so, the fun begins!
Summary: A real favourite, MySurvey is a popular panel allowing members to participate in market research surveys for money, covering topics like the media, tourism and products like electronics. It’s easy to set up an account on the site and begin earning points, which vary between 10 and 500 per survey, but are typically around the 100 mark for an average survey which would take 15 minutes to fill out.
Cashback shopping: Who doesn’t love getting cash back? It's a great incentive for shopping because it feels like you're being paid to do so. It's usually best to use the offers only when you were already intending to buy the product. If you love saving money at discount stores or at places that offer cash back, there are a lot of survey sites out there that will open a lot more offers to you. Survey sites can offer cash back because they're paid a portion of the profit for referring you.
Unlike some of the other sites, with Inbox Dollar, you essentially sign up to take advantage of whatever Inbox Dollar makes from their advertisers. They will send you emails which they get paid per receipt of you reading them or clicking a link. In turn, they give you a cut. Not to ruin your day but it's a rather small cut. The links that end up paying out the most usually have some stipulations attached – such as signing up for a service. This can end up being a lot more hassle than its worth and we recommend you pay VERY close attention to the stipulations.
Something very important to note before signing up at any site claiming to pay you cash to take surveys is that all legitimate sites offering online surveys that pay do not charge registration fees – they are free to join. Some sites may even offer you bonus as you sign in, to show you they are happy you have become a part of their team and helping them increase their revenue.
If you can't find any information on other sites or forums, there are some things about the website you can check for yourself. The first thing we recommend is to look for a privacy policy. Having one on the site that is easily accessible to users is a clear sign of credibility. It shows that the company is at least making some promises as to how your information will be used. Lacking a privacy policy is a clear red flag and often signifies a scam.
It requires patience, as it can take some time, but can often be a quick way of making some easy dollars whilst watching television or listening to music. Surveys are not a get rich scheme – hourly rates are never going to reach anything like a regular wage – but many people manage to turn idly filling in online forms into tidy sums to put towards holidays, home improvements or their new wardrobe!

Welcome to another installment of If My Book, the Monkeybicycle feature in which authors shed light on their recently released books by comparing them to weird things. This week Chaya Bhuvaneswar writes about White Dancing Elephants, her debut story collection just published by Dzanc Books.
If White Dancing Elephants were a ninja, she would be not only predictably fierce but full of surprises, including confident laughter.
If White Dancing Elephants were a Curious George book, it would be Curious George kicks bigots out of Washington, and the Man with the Yellow Hat would be VP.
If White Dancing Elephants were an article of clothing, it would be a sinuous boa, black and silky fur but fake of course, equally appealing to seductive comrades of every gender.
If White Dancing Elephants were a call to prayer, it would be a hybrid of the muezzin’s resonant call across deserts and minarets, crossed with the call and response of the Sunday morning service at the Church of John Coltrane, in California.
If White Dancing Elephants were a friend (which she is), she would be the one who sneers at you slightly, in unspoken contempt that helps you shame yourself to be better – but then listens in a compassionate silence to stories of what hurt you that day and days before, and makes you an incredibly-good-tasting cup of chai with cardamom in sympathy.
If White Dancing Elephants were some amount of money (which it hopefully will be, someday), it would be enough to live on, comfortably, where “comfort” is defined as “the freedom to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.”

At -7c (which it was when we left this morning), air at 20mph makes your face sting. Not a particularly surprising revelation, but a good excuse to mention how effing cold it was for the first hour
131 miles is a long way to ride on your own. Had we done the ride as scheduled last weekend there'd have been 79 starters; today there were 20ish, due I suppose to Easter commitments. And I didn't manage to hook up with any of them
Audaxes are always longer than the route sheet would have you believe. I rode 131 miles today instead of the advertised 129. Again, not the biggest disparity in the world, but a sly way of mentioning how far the ride was. A Long Way. Particularly when:
The wind's in your face, literally and metaphorically, for half the ride - i.e. 60-odd miles. It saps your will to live, but at least it gave me an excuse to consume a hot horsemeat pasty at the halfway point. Mmm
You shouldn't try to open and consume an energy gel at 18mph while wearing full-fingered gloves, as I did today. It didn't go well. I looked like I'd taken a shower in ectoplasm
The dodgy tummy I had after my last long ride was definitely the result of the vast quantities of sat fat ingested via 3 Chunky KitKats. Today - no KitKats, and digestive tranquillity
It's not necessarily to a good idea to do a ride of today's length when you've only done 1 other road ride in the last 6 weeks. I'm not sure whether it was the wind or my lack of bum-on-saddle time, but I was 24 minutes slower than the audax I did in Jan of the same distance
I can't think that there's much else to say. For a ride of over 8 hours it was surprisingly dull, in a good way. The sun shone, the wind blew, the Welsh snow looked dirty, and the Cheshire, Shropshire and Welsh countryside looked pretty, but not as pretty as it might have done if the temperature had been about 10 degrees higher. I've said it before and I'll say it again; when I start going on about the weather it's time to stop.
A: On a summer Saturday or Sunday morning, at about 6am, when the day is shaping up to be gloriously hot, and the early morning rays of sun are gently caressing your back; when the lapwings and sparrows are ducking and diving in front of you, and nature - rabbits, squirrels, voles and pheasants - disappears off the road as you ride down it, like a stage curtain revealing the actors in the first scene.
Sadly, yesterday morning had few of those things going for it - but it wasn't a bad second best time to ride around Cheshire; early on a bank holiday before the masses have hit the roads, with the sun in a cloudless sky, and at higher altitudes at least, banks of cleared snowdrifts at the side of the road making it feel like you were riding Alpe d'Huez early in the season. It was a short ride (35 miles), just as this will be a short post - I'm stuck on 111 blog entries, an unlucky number for the English as I've tweeted about in the past, and I don't fancy being on Nelson when tomorrow I'm riding the delayed Chirk 200 Audax (delayed from last weekend that is, thanks to the snow and ice that would have made last Sunday dangerous and unpleasant).
It's actually 207km from Poynton in Cheshire to Chirk in north Wales and back again. With the clocks changing tonight, it's going to feel like a cold and early start, but the forecast looks as good as you could reasonably hope for after the recent horrors. The Carradice saddlebag (suitcase) is fitted so that I can carry a change of gloves and a selection of hot cross buns, and I'm flirting with the racy new idea of isotonic sports drink coming in a dilutable gel rather than as a powder. Curry for the third night in a row tonight, and I'll be well-stoked for tomorrow.
As it's another bank holiday on Monday, may get round to recounting anything interesting that happens tomorrow. In the meantime, off to butter my buns.
It would, I thought to myself at breakfast this morning, be very easy to feel a bit miserable with life today. Not just me, anybody that is. Look at what's going on round us; regardless of your politics, it's pretty indisputable that the economy is not in a good way (and some of us think its long term prospects are even worse); the weather is shocking, and there isn't an end in sight to the current hideousness, including over the Easter break; and perhaps not quite in the same league, England's much-vaunted cricket and rugby teams have been/are being massive disappointments at the moment. (Though at least the rugby team were beaten by the Land of My Father's [my apostrophe], which lessens the pain just a little).
Things aren't necessarily better on a more personal level; most significantly a number of friends have got parents who are very seriously ill (and thoughts are regularly with them); less significantly I seem to spend more and more time being low level grumpy with the world, and being frustrated at the slow pace that future plans are taking to be executed.
But then I thought, maybe things aren't so bad. The weather may well be rubbish up to and including next weekend, but four days off work is, well, four days off work; me and Mrs Monmarduman had a lovely time last night hosting some good friends (and I made an a*s* of myself trying another eating challenge; downing a tablespoon of cinnamon in one mouthful - don't do it kids, it's not big or clever, and may leave you coughing, spluttering, retching, and gasping for air. Still, at least your friends will be amazed and impressed with your bravado and fearlessness - that's what laughing and pointing normally means I believe); and yes, I've done some exercise.
It's just over three months now till I and Mendip Rouleur arrive in the Pyrenees for a little Tour de France watching, and a lot of hill cycling, including a monster one-day ride called the Devil's Pitchfork, so named because the pitchfork shape represents the day's route profile. Accordingly, when it's too cold and/or dangerous to go road riding, as it has been round here this weekend with both the Cheshire Cat sportive (which I wasn't entered in), and the Chirk 200 Audax (which I was) being postponed, I ought to get in the garage, and do some planned, disciplined, targeted sessions on the indoor trainer.
Ought shmought. It's been way too interesting round here this weekend to not go out and take a look at what's been going on in the hills and forests. We haven't had a vast snowfall round here, but we have had 48 hours of ferocious wind which, when they've not been ripping ridge tiles of my roof (grrr, another job), have been creating fantastic snowdrifts any place which is even slightly exposed. Consequently, whilst the traffic has never stopped flowing outside our front door, within 500 yards of where I'm writing this there have been cars marooned for two days in drifts:
And further afield by a matter of only a mile or so, the drifts are so enormous - 8 to 10 feet in places - that with the current forecast it's hard to see how people are going to get out of their house other than on foot for the next week or so. The pic doesn't quite convey it, but here's one of those drifts:
Just beyond the trees is a pub, so they should be ok for a a day or two. Anyway, I took these pics when I was out running yesterday, as I have been again today. I was tethered to the house yesterday morning for domestic reasons, but got out for two hours yesterday afternoon, and another couple of hours earlier today. The aggregate stats are 23.5 miles run, with 3700 feet of ascent, but those don't even begin to tell the story. As soon as I got beyond a couple of miles from home, scenes like the one above occurred every couple of hundred yards. Quite often the drifts have still been building as the wind has continued to whip the snow across the hills and fields. There were stretches of 200 yards at a time where the banks of snow were hedge or wall height without any way round them, so you had a choice of trying to pick your way precariously along the top of a dry stone wall, or sink up to your hips in the drift trying to make forward progress.
In other words, it was a hoot. I'm not sure how much training value from a cycling point of view there is in running up hills and extricating yourself from six feet of snow, but having run a distance reasonably close to a marathon in under 24 hours over two expeditions (because that's what they felt like) separated only by a rather nice bottle of Shiraz and six hours of sleep I'm exhausted and exhilarated. Also stiff as a board and with hips that feel like they've been sandpapered.
However, the onset of the Great Depression of the aborted spring of 2013 can wait just a little longer.
I haven't blogged for a couple of weeks, so time to break the seal, as it were. Though mentioning seals reminds me of one of my favourite jokes. It goes a little something like this:
An eskimo is out for a drive one day when his car breaks down and he is forced to call out the Alaskan AA. The eskimo stands in the howling wind waiting for the mechanic to arrive. When the mechanic reaches the broken car, he: sets to work, looking under the bonnet until he appears to have located the problem. He looks up at the eskimo and says, "You've blown a seal, mate", to which the eskimo hastily replies, "No, I haven't, that's just frost on my moustache".
A lot of my favourite jokes seem to involve northern Europeans; my absolute favourite is this one from Not The Nine O'Clock News (you've got to watch it; it doesn't work written down - it's only 23 seconds):
Though it doesn't beat my standard reply to anyone enquiring as to the state of our stock of eggs: "I think we've got an oeuf".
As you can see, the dark winter nights just fly by for Mrs Monmarduman. There's no evening that can't be improved by rolling out one of these classics. She too however has her book of standard lines, which if they were cars at a showroom would be labelled "pre-owned". There's too many to remember, but Morecambe & Wise's gag about them "not selling many ice creams going at that speed" whenever a vehicle with a siren goes past does spring to mind.
I mention all this to give an idea of what it's like when me and the better half (as we used to say in nostalgically-misogynistic times) spend a week in a car together, as we did last week in France. For the first time since we bought our modest Breton abode we ventured further south, and enjoyed, I'm delighted and not a little smug to mention, fantastic weather. Fantastic for March in France anyway - sunny and 21c much of the time. The Dordogne, the Gironde and the Charente all saw us trundling around in our epically under-powered hire car; 75 horsepowers it had, which sounds more than adequate for 2 people in a small car, but the measurement must have been based on the Shetland Pony scale of horses. The thing wasn't even that efficient as it's little engine struggled to propel us up any hill, 47 mpg, I do better than that in my barge of an estate car.
Although to be fair, there could have been a little more weight in than usual, as we seemed to stay in places that served only French breakfasts - croissants, butter, coffee, and in a nod to healthiness, homemade jam of many varieties, made to an ancient recipe of one part fruit to ten parts sugar. We should have taken some picky kids with us - by the end of the week they'd have been begging for some vegetables, as indeed I was. Mmmm, salad, said I on Saturday when I got one with my pizza, and I don't say that very often.
I don't seem to have said very much so far about running, cycling and the like. Well, that's because last week there wasn't any, and this week has been dominated by the turbo trainer, which means that all there is to report is my view of me in the mirror in front of me in the garage, and even that picture was blurred because I took my glasses off each time I was on the damn thing, in an attempt to make the experience less horribly real. Though I have been listening to some banging choons, which does help the boredom a bit. Oh yes, rewinding a bit, I do have a mirror in the garage so I can see myself on the trainer. It's to, erm, well, ensure that I can see my pedalling technique is up to scratch. Yes, definitely. And if you believe that, you'll believe other cyclists who tell you they shave their legs "so the skin heals better" if/when they fall off; bilge, it's because it enhances our muscle definition, we all know that's the real reason. Though for those of us who do shave it does mean we can comply with another of the Velominati's rules.
Enough ramble and waffle for this week; who knows there may be something about bicycle riding next time.
I'm not normally keen on quoting Labour politicians, even ones as venerable as Clement Attlee, but it's he who has le mot juste on this occasion. For, dear reader, I'm going on holiday. Just a week, but from this weekend until next weekend, so there'll be no blogging about anything cycling or running related, as I'm having a week off all that too. I've had a good couple of months when it comes to training, and sometimes a week of rest enables the body to convert all that hard work into tangible gains.
You may well be having a little private cheer at the thought of not reading the usual drivel, but I can't promise that there won't be blogging on subjects other than cycling; me and the good lady Mrs M are off to various bits of south-west France, and I may not be able to resist posting photographs and comments. We're actually flying to Limoges on Sunday, which has happy memories for me, as it was the Ville de Depart of the Etape du Tour in 2004, which I did. Heavens that was a long day, 152 miles of Massif Central, starting at 7am and finishing at 5.25pm. I wasn't as fit in those days as I am now, and I was about 5 kg heavier. I don't think I've ever been as tired as I was that night.
This time though we'll be staying in a nice hotel rather than the university accommodation block which it was the night before the Etape - that meant I suffered a night-long chorus of snoring, farting and belching from my room-mates (following an evening of carb-loading), which in turn made for about 3 hours proper sleep. This time it'll be much the same I would imagine, though Mrs M's snoring has reduced by a few decibels recently. (Hope she doesn't read this).
In 2011 I did a variety of events, excerpts of the titles of which formed the word 'Monmarduman'. Four years on I ride my bike less and run more than those days, and this blog ranges more widely than merely being a diary of training and competing; couldn't really tell you what else it covers though.

Before the era of the witchcraft trials, there was a period of rumors. They started quietly, half-formulated whispers and slander, impossible to defend. The rumors continued until even the most respected High Stone was accused.
An old woman in the village was clever, a little too clever. One day a young man tried to cheat her, but she outsmarted him. Embarrassed, he started the rumor that the old woman was a witch. The people of the town got together, carrying their torches, ready to burn the woman as soon as they found her. She tried to defend herself, but the other villagers remembered when the old woman had outfoxed them, as well. She could not outwit them again.
As evening drew near, the villagers burned the woman from the highest rock. As the moon rose, they went home in triumph, leaving the pyre smoldering. The next morning, a black cat was found hanging from the highest rock. The rumors were confirmed. She was a witch!
The High Stone was very unhappy, saying, “Now, I am complicit to murder. I cannot approve of this. If a chapter is convened to discuss the madness of men today, I will testify to this folly.”
Next, the Stones near the Donon were accused of having received the mark of the Devil. The accusers pointed to indentations in the Stones vaguely resembling footprints.
Things continuing spiraling downward until they reached the point where the Elder Stone decided to hold a meeting. Not that she really feared the Stones would be burned, how could they? But she was compassionate and open-minded. She saw beyond the Salm to the pyres that burned, one after another. Because the stones were slow to move, she was still considering her options when the Thirty Years War came along and soon there was no one left to burn.
Before the land of Salm was called the Salm, there was a prince named Hellequin. From the time he learned to walk, he loved to chase. He chased his siblings, then his nurse, the footman, and the valet. At Mass, he chased the altar boys, and even other members of the congregation. The King never corrected the spoiled prince and no one dared to say anything. Soon the prince’s love of the chase became an obsession.
The prince grew into a handsome young man with dark flowing hair and amber eyes that glinted with mischief. One day at Mass, a rabbit wandered onto the altar and Prince Hellequin could not contain himself. He jumped after the rabbit, chasing it all over the altar, knocking over the chalice and ciborium, and spilling their consecrated contents. The priest raised his eyes to heaven and asked God for help. God heard the priest.
Suddenly the floor of the altar disappeared and Prince Hellequin fell into the pit. Frantically, he grabbed hold of the altar to keep from falling. Three hounds leaped from the pit, grabbed the prince, and ripped his body with ferocity. Blood spurted all over the horrified priest who backed into the corner of the altar.
The hounds stepped back and the prince stood and smiled. Blood dripped from gaping holes in his body and his amber eyes glowed as fire. He pointed toward the congregation and immediately the dogs jumped toward the crowd. As quickly as victims fell, they rose and joined the pack of wild dogs, attacking other members of the household.
The king finally came to his senses and shouted at his son to stop the carnage. Instead of minding his father, the prince attacked him. Soon the entire household of Hellequin had joined the hunt. They rushed toward the stable, mounted the royal horses, and charged into the countryside, so fast that the horses’ feet left the ground. The whirl of the hooves, blowing horns of doom, and screams of the damned, filled the air, accompanied by furious winds, lightning, and thunder, and with a terrifying whirl, and the specter disappeared into the clouds.
Especially on Halloween or between Yule and Twelfth Night, whilst the dead still walk among the living, as they usually do during these thinly veiled times; beware the deep of the night. Be sure to leave the final sheaf of wheat in the field and do not remove the feast from the table to allow the ancestral spirits to come and collect their portion, else, the household of Hellequin will collect their share of souls.
Pity the traveler who dares to wander by himself as he may hear the sound of whispering leaves. The whispering may be the wind, but assuredly, it maybe the Hellequin, roaming the skies, scanning the countryside with his band of demons. As fire flashes from the eyes of the prince, his black hellhounds and from the hooves of black horses, the wild souls of the damned sweep down and grab their prey that have no choice but join in the hunt.
In the novel, THE DESTINY OF THE DROP OF HEAVEN, Martin played his violin in the shadow of the chapel at Lake de la Maix. Furious that a celebration commemorated the memory of a witch, Bishop Michel started a legend that it was, in fact, the devil playing the violin at the lake.
High up in the mountains and pine forests of the Vosges, there was a break in the trees where the sun shone brightly on a peaceful meadow. Tall grass and wildflowers covered the area. Soft breezes wafted their perfume in the air. A single oak tree towered above the meadow. Its sturdy boughs arched toward the heavens and spread a cover of dappled shade through its branches. Its age-old roots weaved as tentacles deep into the earth.
At the edge of the meadow, a little chapel housed a beautiful statue of the Virgin where a hermit monk lived. Peasants brought bouquets of flowers in spring and asked the Virgin for the blessing of rain if the summer was too dry.
Each year on Trinity Sunday, pilgrims from Salm and all the surrounding hamlets and villages of the Vosges, gathered before dawn to commemorate the chapel and give thanks for the abundant blessings the Virgin had bestowed upon them. They began by processing to the chapel where the monk celebrated Mass, after which the pilgrims held an all-day celebration in the shade of the oak tree. At Vespers, another ceremony ended the celebration and everyone returned home in the twilight.
One year, the Mass seemed very long to the pilgrims, and it was midday before they were able to gather in the clearing for the festivities. After their meal, and maybe a little too much wine, the musicians pulled out their lutes and the young people began dancing. The monk, realizing his homily may have been a little too long, merely watched from his step.
After a while, a new musician appeared. Dressed simply, he carried himself with an air of confidence. His smile glistened brightly and his eyes sparkled as if a fire burned within him. He played a melody that the simple folk of the Vosges had never heard. The sound came from a violin. Even the other musicians quieted their instruments to listen.
Attentive to the captivated audience, the newcomer smiled charmingly and bowed. He brought the bow to the string, and began to play. As if mesmerized, young and old clapped with delight. The violinist’s eyes began to blaze as he played faster and faster. The peasants danced, whirling for hours without becoming fatigued.
When the evening drew near, the monk rang the bells of the chapel for the concluding service at Vespers. The pilgrims hesitated, knowing it was time to end the celebration, but the violinist played an even more beautiful melody and the pilgrims could not pull away from the trance. Surprised that the peasants ignored their tolls, the monk rang the bells again, but the pilgrims were so intoxicated by the melody, they could not stop dancing.
The sound of the tolling bells of the chapel, the swell of laughter and shouts of joy of the pilgrims, and the melody of the violin filled the air with a deafening roar, so loud that nobody noticed the black clouds gathering above them or the earth begin to quake.
Suddenly the great oak split in two, as if struck by lightning. Water began to bubble up, and before they realized it, the earth began to sink. The joyous tumult became ear-shattering screaming and wailing as a pit opened. The beautiful meadow collapsed bringing the great oak with it. The monk watched in horror as the black void grew, completely swallowing the revelers. Waves burst forth from the chasm, and within minutes, the entire meadow was gone.
The groans and wails of the pilgrims quieted. The sky cleared and the sun shone brightly on the newly formed Lake de la Maix. The monk fell to his knees, praying for the salvation of the lost souls, when he heard the sound.
At first, he thought it was just the wind rustling through the pines surrounding the lake. Then the echo became louder and louder. The sunshine blazed off the water, boring into his eyes, into his brain. In the brilliance, he could see the blazing eyes of the stranger. From those eyes came the sound of the violin, and the cries of the pilgrims, now prisoners in the depths of the lake, damned to dance until the end of time. As the sound grew louder, the melody changed into the rising of laughter, mocking laughter.
This story, as told by Monique Marie François, was relayed to me by my cousin, Françoise Cordier, and is woven into the backbone of the novel, FROM THE DROP OF HEAVEN.
“When the land of Salm was not yet called Salm, Good Stones of Bethlehem gave a wonderful gift to a virgin named Mary. She could not find a room and was about to give birth. The Good Stones opened as only they could and formed a cave where the child was born.
The Savage King of the county heard the news and feared this child of God wished to become king in his place. He called all his soldiers and ordered them to kill all the little boys in the country. Poor Mary thought only to save her baby. She was lost and came round Vipucelle, which was not yet called Vipucelle. The beautiful forests of the Vosges frightened her and at the same time reassured her. What soldier would come looking for her here in the dense forest? During this period, the great empire did not even know this country existed. Thanking the Good Stones, she decided to live there.
Then she heard music in the distance. The music was nice, but she knew it often announced a lord on the move, soldiers threatening all sorts of things that frightened her. The music of the horns redoubled in intensity, getting closer and closer, accompanied by barking dogs. It was the hunting party of the Savage King, and she knew very well what he hunted. Her baby, Jesus.
The poor woman ran as fast as she could, despite the hills and brush, but was not as fast as men on horses and dogs who constantly gained on her. The chase led her to the edge of Grandfontaine. The Cornerstones still speak of it today, especially the one called Marie Roche Bois, or the Rock of Mary of the Woods.
‘Sit down a moment,’ said the Good Stone of the Lake as it transformed itself into a small stone seat.
After she had rested, Mary escaped her pursuers, but the soldiers killed all the other baby boys in the area, some without having received Baptism.
The abbot, meaner than the soldiers of the Wild King, decided these babies could not go to Heaven. No Baptism, No Salvation! He did not care that innocent children would be punished, never to be in the presence of God. No exception of the law was possible as only Baptized children could go to heaven.
Of course, the High Stones would not tolerate such injustice and met to deliberate the issue at the Lake de la Maix. The Elder of the Stones decided to allow the innocent children to lie on top of them at night so they could receive the Baptism of the Angels, and the stones of the Lake de la Maix became a place of respite.
In the deep of the night, the Virgin Mother casts her gaze on the Lake de la Maix, and if she sees a child lying there in its deathly slumber, she kisses it on the forehead. The baby immediately opens its eyes and smiles at the lovely lady, and then the angels baptize it with water from the lake and carry its soul to heaven.”
In the late 16th century, the small country of Salm appeared peaceful, but the bordering Holy Roman Empire, Germanic, embroiled in the Protestant Reformation and the neighboring countries of Lorraine and France as they sought to retain their Catholic heritage, had the small county surrounded.
Unlike their neighbors, two Counts equally shared Salm’s rule. Count Jean IX de Salm was Catholic and Count Frédéric Sauvage du Rhin et de Salm, called Rhingrave, was Protestant. This unusual situation gave Salm relative peace during the Wars of Religion which raged all around them.
Count Jean IX had no children and left his estate to his niece, Chrestienne, daughter of his brother Paul. Chrestienne married the son of the Duke of Lorraine, François de Vaudémont.
Chrestienne inherited only Jean IX’s half of Salm, which was annexed by Lorraine. The other half remained Salm and was ruled by Frédéric Sauvage, called Rhingrave.

1 Timothy 15:12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, 13 even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief; 14 and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus. 15 It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all. 16 Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

Colossians 3:12-17 (NASB): 12So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;
13bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you. 14Beyond all these things put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. 15Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body; and be thankful. 16Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you, with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 17Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.
Luke 10:27 “So he answered and said, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,’ and ‘your neighbor as yourself’.”
(Hebrews 12:1-3) Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged (faint) in your souls.
I am looking forward to meeting again. I miss you! There is so much Kingdom business at hand. And I am all about my Father’s business. Praise HIM! Thank You Lord!
When I think of meals I think of Revelation 3:20 “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.” Jesus, I want to dine & dance with YOU… forever! YOU name the place.
Robin… I LOVE YOU! You are such a God-send to me. Your blog [http://mychristiancoffeeshop.wordpress.com/] serves as great inspiration to so many, including me. I love the unity we share for HIM [even at ‘the bridge’]! Be blessed, as you are a blessing!!!
Merry Christmas to you and many, many blessings to you and your family!!! Hello my beautiful friend. I wanted to inform you I have nominated you for the Liebster Blog Award. Your site is a wonderful, heartfelt, compassionate site. I am honored to call myself a member. Please click below on the link for further instructions.
Hi Julie, I enjoy the variety you share with the videos and your messages, I’m always amazed that God has gifted His Children so uniquely.
I can relate very much to the woman caught in Adultery with being a sinner who was judged by others unlovingly, Jesus does not condemn and yet He has every right to, He never sinned, but He did say to this woman, go and sin no more and He would not of said this if it was impossible and we know that it isn’t, in Christ Jesus no temptation will be greater then we can bear so we can choose not to sin and Jesus empowers us so we don’t, the Devil flees when we come close to God.
What if we see others sinning in the Body of Christ, God tells us to warn them and we will if we Love them, they are in danger but we do so in Love and for Love and also remembering that we were forgiven of great sin so who are we to point the finger critically at them.
1 John 3:9 No one who is Born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been Born of God.
1 John 5:18-20 We know that no one who is Born of God sins; but He who was Born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
God sure is G_R_E_A_T! I was just thinking about the Wonderful new friends the Lord has brought into my life to Bless me. You, Anne, are one such blessing. Thank you for praying for me [I know you do].
I often see a parallel between the woman caught in adultery and the woman at the well. [Maybe because I identify with both.] I, having now left my life of crime to sit at the Lord’s feet, is still reminded of the woman who left her first love, and wondered around until she found Him [Mr. Right is Jesus].
As for the Well… I just commented the other day that “I am the woman at the well & I can prove it.” I think when people read about her in John 4, they think “how awful, promiscuous, and how much a failure she must have been in life; possibly failing themselves, to consider how she got there or that we all are just one stone’s throw away.
Was she raised in abuse and neglect and in having been so, found herself to be of no value… except for that? “This must be the way to a man’s heart”… so off she went to seek love in all the wrong places, with men often presenting too many faces. Could she have been a widow or at least felt like one because when he left her it really did feel like death? Or, was it considered among the people that a man [or two] sent her off with a certificate of divorce, with grounds only to seek the arms of another woman [or in this day & age… whatever]? And at the end, could the one she is with now really not be her husband, even though he stood before witnesses and said “I do”? In any case once she [we] encountered Jesus, whether at the Well or caught up in adultery [or whatever]… all things worked together for good. “And Jesus said, “ I do not condemn you, either. Go. From now on sin no more.” John 8:11
I have often pondered to the point of revelation that God has me living out life scenarios [starting with abuse in childhood] to aid and rescue [or at least identify with] those He places in front of me now. And so I have lived long enough to know that there are always two sides to every story and I am right here waiting for my happily ever after with Jesus… HE PROMISED!
Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children; 2 and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.
3 But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints; 4 and there must be no filthiness and silly talk, or coarse jesting, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks. 5 For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. 7 Therefore do not be partakers with them; 8 for you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light 9 (for the fruit of the Light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 10 trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. 11 Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them; 12 for it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 13 But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light. 14 For this reason it says,
15 Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as wise, 16 making the most of your time, because the days are evil. 17 So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, 19 speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord; 20 always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father; 21 and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
It seems that we have walked the same road dear one, I will leave you a link, it has others links that also speak of my early years , to sum up though, like yours my life has been a hard one but it was never God’s will that I suffer like I did because of others sin, nor was it His will that I suffered because of my own sin.
We are both forgiven Julie in Christ Jesus of the great sin that we did, sin that hurt God, others and ourselves and because of our heart repentance they are remembered no more, we now shine our light as it reflects Jesus’ Light within us.
Speaking of the sister connection, I am reminded of a recent conversation with the pastor’s wife at my home church. She was amazed by a women’s conference that she attended in June, where numerous women began to tell of their past horrors of abuse, several for the first time. And it all started with one disclosure. I believe it only takes ONE to open the flood gates and from here… His Healing begins.
Anne… I pray doors open and arms swing wide for you, for such a time as this. I believe some of the Lord’s greatest work in and for you, is yet to come! 🙂
Hi Julie, I just want to thank you for the Blessing that your Blogging friendship has been to me and I look forward to sharing with you more in the future, thank you for your flowers of Love.
Anne you truly know how to brighten one’s day. Thank you! And you do it so beautifully with flowers… [His flowers sure do make ‘perfect sense’.]
“But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and manifests through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place.” [2 Corinthians 2:14]
Philippians 4:17 Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek for the profit which increases to your account. 18 But I have received everything in full and have an abundance; I am amply supplied, having received … what you have sent, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. 19 And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. 20 Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
Hello, just found your blog. Looking forward to following your posts. You are a kindred sister in Christ…..Donna
Hi Donna! I so enjoyed your blog. You have such a freshness & beauty in your writing style that it clearly illustrates that… you’ve got heart! I think it is a fair assumption that where like-minds think alike… like-hearts feel alike. 🙂 God Bless you!
Thanks so much for your encouragement! I am a work in progress and so is the blog. As I find other bloggers like you, I am able to learn from different parts of the Body of Christ, world wide. Wow! I am loving other views that glorify God! I believe the Lord is going to use blogging even more than any other aspect of internet communication. I have discovered that to be a blogger you have to write what you are passionate about. So, as I write I have to examine myself before the Lord. Oswald Chambers has a quote I really appreciate.” Never testify with your lips what you don’t live out in your life.” I would add to that… never write a post that I don’t sincerely believe, that the Holy Spirit isn’t enpowering, and that I don’t strive to live out.So, it is good accountability for me and a great release of the River of Life He pours over me. I love finding other Rivers of His Life like you….love you already….Donna
Donna… I love the salt & light you bring to the family table. Thank you! I so appreciate your kind words & encouragement. And I look forward to seeing how the Lord will use your beautiful voice throughout the world-wide-web. May the LORD BLESS YOU INDEED!
“Thank you Andy!” I love how the Lord uses RJ Dawson, and many others (like yourself) who focus on Him, to speak to His people. And then, how God causes these good works to stir the people who love Him, that they also- may speak with His purpose. God is so good and awe-inspiring! 😎
Hi Julie, I found your link on one of my Posts and was wondering how you are going, seems so long since we shared.
Hi Anne! It is well with me as I hope the same for you. I find the 23rd Psalm to be a daily affirmation of how wonderful it is to live with Jesus. God Bless you my friend! ❤

“Every doctor and nurse I met in Haiti was a hurricane survivor” – An interview with Dr. Lynda Redwood Campbell
Staying dry from the rain: Red Cross improves living conditions for families affected by Hurricane Matthew
Hurricane Matthew: the IFRC regional director for the Americas takes a lead to strengthen partnership and cooperation
As of yesterday, Haiti was already feeling the effects of Tropical Storm - now Hurricane, according to the US National Hurricane Centre - Sandy. Haiti has been on orange alert since Tuesday morning and authorities are asking people to stay vigilant and follow the guidelines to ensure their safety while Haiti experiences the wind and the rain brought on by the storm’s passage through the Caribbean.
This morning, a red alert was issued for the South and Southeast departments, Nippes, the Western Department, and Grand–Anse. The rest of the country remains on orange alert. Sandy is approaching Jamaica and could increase in strength overnight.
At the first sign of bad weather the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in Haiti, in partnership with the Haiti Red Cross Society, has already taken measures to ensure a rapid response to all parts of the country affected by this weather. As early as Tuesday morning the IFRC started sending out SMS messages on the Voila mobile phone network urging people to beware of strong wind and rain, flooding, and landslides. Messages warned people to stay vigilant, listen to the radio and call 733, which is the IFRC integrated voice response system. This system allows people to access information on what precautions they can take during and after a storm.
Radyo KwaWouj (the Haiti Red Cross Society radio show) will also broadcast safety and prevention messages on the air during the show today to be certain the message reaches as many people as possible.
The Red Cross sound truck will also be dispatched to different areas of the capital to spread messages to people still in camps and neighborhoods.
In terms of response mechanisms, two emergency response teams have been prepared and are ready to be deployed for rapid camp assessments and 11,000 emergency kits are also ready to be handed out to the most vulnerable and those badly affected by the severe weather brought on by the storm.
It has been only two months since Tropical Storm Isaac struck Haiti, and though Sandy will not hit the country directly, its effects will most likely affect the thousands of people still in camps in and around Port-au-Prince.
Florent Del Pinto, Deputy Country Representative and Head of Technical Movement Coordination, said: “Together with our partners at the Haiti Red Cross Society, we are ready and will remain on the alert in view of the precarious situation in the country, particularly within Port-au-Prince. Our rapid assessment teams are ready to travel to the affected area if needed.”
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is the world's largest humanitarian organization, with 190 member National Societies . As part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, our work is guided by seven fundamental principles; humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality.

THE NUJ is marking the first anniversary of the murder of member Martin O'Hagan - by asking questions. It's what he would have wanted. Why has there been so little progress in the police investigation? Is it in fact the case that when he was killed on the evening of 28 September 2001 Martin was investigating links between paramilitaries and the police or security services?
Martin was the first journalist to be killed in Northern Ireland because of his work as a journalist. Yet the British media have made more of the killing of Veronica Guerin in Dublin in 1996 than they have of his death. Immediate coverage in Berlin, Delhi and Paris was more incisive than that in London.
More questions. Are British editors afraid of Northern Ireland stories, or just careless? Are any of the suspects in his murder currently or formerly police or security force informers or intelligence agents? Was anyone aware of threats against Martin before his murder and if so who, and was he told?
The NUJ is also asking questions about the disappearance of Georgy Gongadze in the Ukraine on 16 September 2002 and the discovery of his headless body. At the Ukrainian Embassy in London on 16 September members protested about the lack of investigation.
Do the tapes of Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma berating Gongadze prove a plot? LFB Co-Vice-Chair Simon Pirani may go to Strasbourg to press the Council of Europe for a fully independent international inquiry. The Ukrainska Pravda , the website that Georgy founded, is marking the anniversary with an English edition.

The acorn finial atop the mighty tombstone in Albia's Oakview cemetery shared by Wareham G. and Jane Clark gives it distinction, something that the lives of those resting near it had in generous proportion, too. That's Wareham at left in a portrait published in the 1875 Andreas Atlas of Iowa. (Credit for the Find a Grave photo used here goes to "Zoey.")
Those who read Lucas County's footnotes will recognize Wareham as one of the three men named as commissioners by the Iowa Legislature to locate Lucas County's seat, Chariton, during September of 1849. Pardon M. Dodge of "Dodge's Point," Appanoose County, and Richard Fisher of Wapello County were the others.
Widely known in his day but largely forgotten now, Clark's granddaughter, Flora Alice (Clark) Gardner, did her part to burnish his image by writing an account of his life for the Iowa history journal Palimpsest, published during October of 1944. The text of that article follows.
Although the account is romanticized and bridged with occasional flights of editorial fancy, there's no reason to doubt the general accuracy of the narrative, which I found fascinating enough to transcribe and plant here.
In it, you'll find an account of Chariton's birth that differs slightly from the James G. Robinson version I posted yesterday. In Robinson's version, the commissioners drove the stake at what now is the southwest corner of the square to mark the spot. In the Gardner account, Wareham G. Dodge climbs atop a mighty stake already in place to announce, "this is the place."
Lucas County's first settlers, both transitory and permanent, arrived during 1846. At the time the Wareham G. Clark settlement at Clark's Point, just northwest of Albia, was the nearest trading point and so the Ballards, the McDermotts and other early Lucas County families would have known the Clarks well.
Some of Chariton's earliest settlers actually lived near Clark's Point before moving on to Lucas County after it opened for settlement. The Nelson "Westcoatt" whose young bride, Mary, died three months after their marriage at was buried by the Clarks at Clark's Point in a coffin hand-crafted from a walnut log was the same Nelson Wescott, who, during 1849, opened Chariton's first mercantile establishment in a log cabin on the northwest corner of the square.
Wareham G. Clark was a wholesale and dry goods merchant in New York City for 10 years prior to 1840 when he decided to leave the noise and confusion of the great metropolis and seek his fortune in the West. Having sold most of his stock of dry goods, he purchased a light wagon and two of New York's finest dock-tailed Morgan horses and, in company with his nephew, John Clark, planned to start for new adventures in the Territory of Iowa.
Loading the wagon with the remaining stock of dry goods, the young men drove their spirited team across the flat lands of New Jersey and into the foothills of the Alleghenies. Thence they went up over the crest and along the winding rocky mountain trails, out into the new Middle West. Exchanging dry goods en route for room and board, and for furs for eastern markets, the young men made their way westward. At length they crossed the Mississippi River at Burlington and passed into the new Territory of Iowa. Between the years of 1840 and 1842, young Wareham Clark, in this manner, made three overland journeys between his old home in New York and the prairies of Iowa where he planned to establish his permanent residence.
During this period he spent some time in the new Territory between the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers surveying the public lands, helping to establish township and county lines, and platting new towns. Now and again he ventured into the Indian territory west of the Des Moines River. The country was beautiful, new and promising. Surely it was good land, a land in which a pioneer of courage and intelligence might wish to dwell.
Wareham Grant Clark was born of study pioneer stock at Middle Haddam, Connecticut, on January 16th, 1813, and was named for a famous Colonial minister, Rev. John Wareham. His father's people were clarks (clerks) of the old English courts, from which the name was derived. They could trace their lineage directly to King Alfred, and so Wareham Clark had royal blood in his veins. In America his immigrant progenitor was Major John Clark who came to New England in 1634 to become one of the founders of New Haven, Connecticut. His maternal ancestors (Strong) were likewise distinguished Colonial settlers.
While he was in Davis County, Iowa, in the early forties, Clark made frequent visits to the home of Judge William Walter Rankin, an Ohio man who had recently moved with his family from Lafayette, Indiana, where the eldest daughter had attended an academy for girls. Charming Jane Rankin was quick-witted and attractive and before long the New Englander found himself much in love with the pioneer magistrate's daughter. He not only asked the strict Scotch Presbyterian father for his daughter's hand but he also persuaded the judge to accompany him on a trip to select a site for a new home for himself and his bride.
On a lovely late spring morning in 1842, the two men, Mrs. Rankin and daughter Jane set out in Clark's light wagon drawn by his lively Morgan bob-tailed bays. Huge lunch baskets were filled with delicacies for the all day outing. The sight of the rolling prairies covered with verdant waving prairie grass and fragrant blooming shrubs greeted them on every side as they drove over the neighboring acres and into the Indian territory.
Night overtook them just as they came in sight of a deserted log cabin. Wishing to explore the country more thoroughly, they decided to spend the night there and return home the next day.
In the middle of the night, Clark, who was sleeping in the open near his horses, was aroused by their restlessness. Suddenly he heard them dash away and gallop off over the prairie. Thinking they had loosened their halter straps, he hastened after them before they would have time to run out of sight and hearing. Again and again he came within close range of the horses, but on and on they went. Presently he became aware that the night had passed. The sun was rising above the horizon in the east. He had left the Rankins asleep not knowing whither he had gone, and even worse than that, he had become so confused by the zig zag trail he had followed that he was completely lost.
Not knowing how far he had traveled in his anxious search, the city bred man started to find his way back, but the hot sun had dried the dew on the grass and erased his path. the wet grass that had soaked his shoes and clothing was now dry and harsh and cut like knife blades through clothing and into his flesh. He called to his friends but no answer came back to him. He tried to retrace his steps and walked on and on seeking some familiar landmark.
Three wretched days passed. He wandered on through a heavy thunderstorm. Three sleepless nights he spent on the open prairie. Howling wolves and hooting owls continually reminded him of the dangers of the wilderness. The loss of his team was almost forgotten in his anxiety. Weakened by the lack of food and sleep, he at last found his beloved Rankins, who of course were in search of him during his absence. They had had time to observe small pony tracks near the hoof prints of the Morgan horses and had concluded at once that someone had stolen the team. The thief was eventually caught, convicted and sentenced to be whipped.
On May 1, 1843, the first day that homesteads could be made in the newly acquired Indian territory, Wareham G. Clark took some 640 acres of raw prairie land in what is now the central part of Monroe County. There he established the first settlement in that area. He built a substantial log house on a well chosen site and arranged the place so that it served as a central meeting place for the earliest pioneers. There he brought his bride, Jane Rankin Clark, after they married on August 24, 1843, and together they contributed much to the development of that neighborhood.
Their home served as the first post office in the community for a number of years. It also served as the general store in the settlement. Labor, cash and furs were traded by the earliest pioneers to the Clarks for dry goods and other merchandise brought from the New York store or obtained in Iowa Territory. The Clarks took occasional trips to the nearest trading post, then in Eddyville on the Des Moines River, to supplement their stock of goods.
The Clark home served likewise in the capacity of a local library, for when Wareham Clark decided to settle in the "far" west he brought along his private collection of books, a "large library of the choicest works in philosophy, history, science and general literature, which thereafter on the wild western frontier became his constant solace and companion." Besides these books, the New York Sun and the Hartford Times found their way into the Clark home at regular intervals and were shared with the neighbors. This pioneer home was also used as a town hall, and the citizens in the Kish-Ke-Kosh (now Monroe) County precinct cast their votes in the large combination living room, dining room and fireplace room, where Mrs. Clark arranged dry goods boxes for tables and covered them with gay calico direct from New York City. The ballot box was a paper box in which stockings were originally packed.W.G. Clark was elected Justice of the Peace.
The first marriage in Kish-Ke-Kosh county united charming Mary Searcey and young Nelson Westcoatt. Three months later she died of a fever, the first death in the community. There was no lumber at hand with which to make a casket and a large walnut tree was cut, puncheons were hewn and from these a coffin ws fitted together with wooden pegs. Mrs. Clark used some of the velveteen from her husband's stock of dry goods to line and cover the coffin.
Wareham Clark introduced many new grains and fruits in his part of the state. He brought the first wheat into Kish-Ke-Kosh County, for example, and in 1844 harvested 30 acres of this grain. He gave seed to several of his neighbors, providing the means for their start in cultivating new and improved varieties of agricultural products.
By the spring of 1845 the settlement in which Clark had become a leading figure had progressed so far that the people decided to sever political dependency upon Wapello County, to which they had been attached, and organized the government of Kish-Ke-Kosh County as an independent unit. At the election of the first county officers in August, 1845, at Clark's Point, about two miles north of the present city of Albia, Wareham G. Clark was elected probate judge. A town called Clarksville was laid out and there the first district court was held, Charles Mason presiding. When court time arrived in 1846, Mr. Clark was building a new and larger house for himself and family. When the lawyers came on horseback with their libraries in their saddle bags, ready to begin court, the new home was walled up and roofed, but not finished. Nevertheless, it was used as a court room while the grand jury retired to a nearby slough for deliberation on the first cases to come before the court. Mr. Clark placed a chair at one end of the unfinished room for the judge's bench, and the jury sat around on blocks of wood and such other makeshift seats as they were able to find. When night came, a heavy rain set in and the horses of the lawyers and jurymen needed shelter. To meet this emergency the loose floor boards were shifted to one and of the courtroom and covered with hay for a soft bed for the lawyers while their horses were sheltered in the other end of the same building. During the night some of the horses got loose and it is reported that they began eating the beds on which the lawyers were sleeping.
In August, 1845, the voters of the Territory refused for the second time to join the Union under the Constitution of 1844. Plans were made, however, for a second Constitutional Convention to which Kish-Ke-Kosh County, renamed Monroe County in January, 1846, was entitled to send a delegate. In May, 1846, Wareham G. Clark "a Democrat but abolitionist in his views," went to the Capital at Iowa City as a delegate representing both Monroe and Appanoose Counties in this important convention.
The second Iowa Constitutional Convention met on May 4, 1846, and Wareham G. Clark rode on horseback from his home to the Capital. One of the thirty-two members present, he was named on two of the six standing committees. As a member of the revision committee whose duties it was to "collect, compare and digest various reports of a Constitution preparatory to their third reading," his broad knowledge of parliamentary law was used advantageously. As a member of the engrossment committee whose duty it was to "make clear and legible documents for final action," his fine and speedy penmanship was a great help when typewriters were unknown.
The tasks of the committees were multifold. By day they were among the busiest of the convention and by night they burned the candle-lights well into the next day, comparing, digesting documents, condensing some and enlarging others preparatory to the next day's action by the delegates. Wareham G. Clark's clear thinking and logical reasoning were of great importance here. Much of the work of the Second Constitutional Convention was handled by its six standing committees. The members of the Second Constitutional Convention were proud that they were so well organized and industrious that only 15 days were required to frame the new organizing law which was adopted by the people on August 3, 1846. Wareham G. Clark was one of the members who did not ask for pay or receive any pay for time and efforts.
On the way home, when Clark was nearing the end of his journey, he stopped at the stagecoach station at Eddyville, planning to remain there for the night. Much to his surprise he heard his father's voice inquiring the way to Clark's Point. Oliver Clark was on his way from Connecticut to visit his son in the west.
But Wareham Clark's public service was not at an end. The settlers in Lucas County to the west wanted someone with a "fair-minded attitude, logical reasoning and well informed mind" to settle the question of just where their permanent county seat should be located. Clark served as one of the commissioners for this purpose. It was a warm August (actually September) day when a group of men followed the commissioners to a stake, some four foot high, which proved to be a Government landmark at the corner of sections 19, 20, 29 and 30, Twp. 72, Range 21 west. Presently Commissioner clark asked someone to help him upon this stake, which was done. After surveying the country about him for a moment he promptly and emphatically said, "Gentlemen, this is the county seat of Lucas County!" The others at once agreed.
Ever interested in progress and the welfare of his community, Wareham Clark spent much effort to obtain mainline railroad facilities for southern Iowa. Even when a few of his neighbors charged that "the fangled idea of having an iron horse racing across the prairie would come to no good," Clark pressed on, anticipating the time, perhaps, when this railroad were operate as a portion of a coast to coast system.
In his young manhood, Clark studied history, science and literature. Coming to the new West he was interested in the schools of this community. He served four years as treasurer of the neighborhood school. In 1873, he helped organize a new school adjoining his large farm and served as a member of this school board for many years. The site chosen overlooked a large buffalo wallow for which the school was named. As president of the local school board it was not only his duty to hire the teacher, but to find a place for the teacher to live, and this usually ended by the teacher taking up board and room in the spacious Clark home.
In later life, one of Warham Clark's chief interests was in the field of horticulture. Accordingly, in 1856, he purchased a large farmstead in Monroe Township (southwest of Albia) and established the Clark Orchards, covering over fifty acres of land. It was there that he practiced many new methods and conducted his experiments. New specimens were developed by grafting various kinds of fruit trees. Clark's Prolific Apple was one of the delicious varieties brought into bearing during these years. At one time his exhibit of fruits at the Iowa State Horticultural Convention contained 180 varieties and "took the prize," according to the newspaper. After visiting the Clark homestead, one news editor wrote, "Mr. Clark was the first settler of that region, and looked up to as the father of Monroe County. His farm contains many hundreds of acres, had more fruit, better fruit and a greater number of varieties than anyone else in southern Iowa. No one in that region has done as much for the improvement and cultivation of fruit as Mr. Clark."
Wareham Grant Clark lived until June, 1890. He found time to read much of the world's best literature. He traveled widely, visiting much of the Middle West, besides taking two trips entirely across the continent (San Diego and the redwoods of California). He lived abundantly, making valuable contributions to his community, his country and to the Commonwealth of Iowa. He used his knowledge of history to gain a clear perspective of the future and, being a man of much individual enterprise and stability, he helped explore, survey and develop the raw prairie prairie into farmsteads and growing towns and cities. He lived a full life. It seems fitting that the old homestead of Wareham Grant Clark is now being used by the State Agricultural College as a field laboratory and experimental farm. (Note: The ISU Albia Experimental Farm no longer exists.)
Finally, here's a little story about Jane (Rankin) Clark that Frank Hickenlooper included in his 1896 history of Monroe County that gives some idea of conditions faced by southern Iowa's first settlers:
In about the year 1850, Wareham G. Clark and James Tracy started to Burlington with a load of wheat to have it ground into flour. While en route, a heavy snow fell and buried the grass upon which the farmers were dependent for feed for their oxen. They were compelled to feed their oxen wheat along the road, and as they were five weeks making the trip, it took most of the wheat to feed the team. In their absence, their wives ran short of breadstuffs. The ladies were near neighbors, so they concluded to butcher a hog. They called it up out of the woods. One seized it by the hind legs and the other knocked it in the head with an ax. They then scalded and dressed it, and on hog and hominy they lived until the return of their men.

LatLonPointSpatialField is the ideal field type for the most common use-cases for lat-lon point data. It replaces LatLonType which still exists for backwards compatibility. RPT offers some more features for more advanced/custom use cases and options like polygons and heatmaps.
RptWithGeometrySpatialField is for indexing and searching non-point data though it can do points too. It can’t do sorting/boosting.
BBoxField is for indexing bounding boxes, querying by a box, specifying a search predicate (Intersects,Within,Contains,Disjoint,Equals), and a relevancy sort/boost like overlapRatio or simply the area.
Some esoteric details that are not in this guide can be found at http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SpatialSearch.
There are two spatial Solr "query parsers" for geospatial search: geofilt and bbox. They take the following parameters:
The radial distance, usually in kilometers. RPT & BBoxField can set other units via the setting distanceUnits.
distance: distance between the field value and the specified center point in the distanceUnits configured for this field
Don’t use this for indexed non-point shapes (e.g., polygons). The results will be erroneous. And with RPT, it’s only recommended for multi-valued point data, as the implementation doesn’t scale very well and for single-valued fields, you should instead use a separate non-RPT field purely for distance sorting.
area: haversine based area of the overlapping shapes expressed in terms of the distanceUnits configured for this field
area2D: cartesian coordinates based area of the overlapping shapes expressed in terms of the distanceUnits configured for this field
The geofilt filter allows you to retrieve results based on the geospatial distance (AKA the "great circle distance") from a given point. Another way of looking at it is that it creates a circular shape filter. For example, to find all documents within five kilometers of a given lat/lon point, you could enter &q=:&fq={!geofilt sfield=store}&pt=45.15,-93.85&d=5. This filter returns all results within a circle of the given radius around the initial point:
The bbox filter is very similar to geofilt except it uses the bounding box of the calculated circle. See the blue box in the diagram below. It takes the same parameters as geofilt.
The rectangular shape is faster to compute and so it’s sometimes used as an alternative to geofilt when it’s acceptable to return points outside of the radius. However, if the ideal goal is a circle but you want it to run faster, then instead consider using the RPT field and try a large distErrPct value like 0.1 (10% radius). This will return results outside the radius but it will do so somewhat uniformly around the shape.
When a bounding box includes a pole, the bounding box ends up being a "bounding bowl" (a spherical cap) that includes all values north of the lowest latitude of the circle if it touches the north pole (or south of the highest latitude if it touches the south pole).
Sometimes the spatial search requirement calls for finding everything in a rectangular area, such as the area covered by a map the user is looking at. For this case, geofilt and bbox won’t cut it. This is somewhat of a trick, but you can use Solr’s range query syntax for this by supplying the lower-left corner as the start of the range and the upper-right corner as the end of the range.
If you know the filter query (be it spatial or not) is fairly unique and not likely to get a cache hit then specify cache="false" as a local-param as seen in the following example. The only spatial types which stand to benefit from this technique are LatLonPointSpatialField and LatLonType (deprecated). Enable docValues on the field (if it isn’t already). LatLonType (deprecated) additionally requires a cost="100" (or more) local-param.
RPT refers to either SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType (aka simply RPT) and an extended version: RptWithGeometrySpatialField (aka RPT with Geometry). RPT offers several functional improvements over LatLonPointSpatialField:
Ability to index non-point shapes (e.g., polygons) as well as points – see RptWithGeometrySpatialField
Important: Although RPT supports distance sorting/boosting, it is so inefficient at doing this that it might be removed in the future. Fortunately, you can use LatLonPointSpatialField as well as RPT. Use LLPSF for the distance sorting/boosting; it only needs to have docValues for this; the index attribute can be disabled as it won’t be used.
To use RPT, the field type must be registered and configured in schema.xml. There are many options for this field type.
This should be solr.SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType. But be aware that the Lucene spatial module includes some other so-called "spatial strategies" other than RPT, notably TermQueryPT*, BBox, PointVector*, and SerializedDV. Solr requires a field type to parallel these in order to use them. The asterisked ones have them.
Defines the shape syntax/format to be used. Defaults to WKT but GeoJSON is another popular format. Spatial4j governs this feature and supports other formats. If a given shape is parseable as "lat,lon" or "x y" then that is always supported.
a| This is used to specify the units for distance measurements used throughout the use of this field. This can be degrees, kilometers or miles. It is applied to nearly all distance measurements involving the field: maxDistErr, distErr, d, geodist and the score when score is distance, area, or area2d. However, it doesn’t affect distances embedded in WKT strings, (e.g., BUFFER(POINT(200 10),0.2)), which are still in degrees.
distanceUnits replaces the units attribute; which is now deprecated and mutually exclusive with this attribute.
Defines the default precision of non-point shapes (both index & query), as a fraction between 0.0 (fully precise) to 0.5. The closer this number is to zero, the more accurate the shape will be. However, more precise indexed shapes use more disk space and take longer to index.
Bigger distErrPct values will make queries faster but less accurate. At query time this can be overridden in the query syntax, such as to 0.0 so as to not approximate the search shape. The default for the RPT field is 0.025.
For RPTWithGeometrySpatialField (see below), there’s always complete accuracy with the serialized geometry and so this doesn’t control accuracy so much as it controls the trade-off of how big the index should be. distErrPct defaults to 0.15 for that field.
Defines the spatial grid implementation. Since a PrefixTree (such as RecursivePrefixTree) maps the world as a grid, each grid cell is decomposed to another set of grid cells at the next level.
A third choice is packedQuad, which is generally more efficient than quad, provided there are many levels — perhaps 20 or more.
The RPT field types support a set of standard shapes: points, circles (aka buffered points), envelopes (aka rectangles or bounding boxes), line strings, polygons, and "multi" variants of these. The envelopes and line strings are Euclidean/cartesian (flat 2D) shapes. Underlying Solr is the Spatial4j library which implements them. To support other shapes, you can configure the spatialContextFactory attribute on the field type to reference other options. Two are available: JTS and Geo3D.
The JTS Topology Suite is a popular computational geometry library with a Euclidean/cartesian (flat 2D) model. It supports a variety of shapes including polygons, buffering shapes, and some invalid polygon repair fall-backs. With the help of Spatial4j, included with Solr, the polygons support dateline (anti-meridian) crossing. Unfortunately Solr cannot include JTS due to its LGPL license. You must download it (a JAR file) and put that in a special location internal to Solr: SOLR_INSTALL/server/solr-webapp/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/. You can readily download it here: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/vividsolutions/jts-core/. It will not work if placed in other more typical Solr lib directories, unfortunately. JTS’s license is expected to be transitioned to BSD by the end of 2017.
When activated, there are additional configuration attributes available; see org.locationtech.spatial4j.context.jts.JtsSpatialContextFactory for the Javadocs, and remember to look at the superclass’s options as well. One option in particular you should most likely enable is autoIndex (i.e., use JTS’s PreparedGeometry) as it’s been shown to be a major performance boost for non-trivial polygons.
Inside the parenthesis following the search predicate is the shape definition. The format of that shape is governed by the format attribute on the field type, defaulting to WKT. If you prefer GeoJSON, you can specify that instead.
Geo3D is the colloquial name of the Lucene spatial-3d module, included with Solr. It’s a computational geometry library implementing a variety of shapes (including polygons) on a sphere or WGS84 ellipsoid. Geo3D is particularly suited for spatial applications where the geometries cover large distances across the globe. Geo3D is named as-such due to its internal implementation that uses geocentric coordinates (X,Y,Z), not for 3-dimensional geometry, which it does not support. Despite these internal details, you still supply latitude and longitude as you would normally in Solr.
The RptWithGeometrySpatialField field type is a derivative of SpatialRecursivePrefixTreeFieldType that also stores the original geometry internally in Lucene DocValues, which it uses to achieve accurate search. It can also be used for indexed point fields. The Intersects predicate (the default) is particularly fast, since many search results can be returned as an accurate hit without requiring a geometry check. This field type is configured just like RPT except that the default distErrPct is 0.15 (higher than 0.025) because the grid squares are purely for performance and not to fundamentally represent the shape.
The RPT field supports generating a 2D grid of facet counts for documents having spatial data in each grid cell. For high-detail grids, this can be used to plot points, and for lesser detail it can be used for heatmap generation. The grid cells are determined at index-time based on RPT’s configuration. At facet counting time, the indexed cells in the region of interest are traversed and a grid of counters corresponding to each cell are incremented. Solr can return the data in a straight-forward 2D array of integers or in a PNG which compresses better for larger data sets but must be decoded.
The heatmap feature is accessed from Solr’s faceting feature. As a part of faceting, it supports the key local parameter as well as excluding tagged filter queries, just like other types of faceting do. This allows multiple heatmaps to be returned on the same field with different filters.
A specific grid level, which determines how big each grid cell is. Defaults to being computed via distErrPct (or distErr).
You’ll experiment with different distErrPct values (probably 0.10 - 0.20) with various input geometries till the default size is what you’re looking for. The specific details of how it’s computed isn’t important. For high-detail grids used in point-plotting (loosely one cell per pixel), set distErr to be the number of decimal-degrees of several pixels or so of the map being displayed. Also, you probably don’t want to use a geohash-based grid because the cell orientation between grid levels flip-flops between being square and rectangle. Quad is consistent and has more levels, albeit at the expense of a larger index.
The output shows the gridLevel which is interesting since it’s often computed from other parameters. If an interface being developed allows an explicit resolution increase/decrease feature then subsequent requests can specify the gridLevel explicitly.
The minX, maxX, minY, maxY reports the region where the counts are. This is the minimally enclosing bounding rectangle of the input geom at the target grid level. This may wrap the dateline. The columns and rows values are how many columns and rows that the output rectangle is to be divided by evenly. Note: Don’t divide an on-screen projected map rectangle evenly to plot these rectangles/points since the cell data is in the coordinate space of decimal degrees if geo=true or whatever units were given if geo=false. This could be arranged to be the same as an on-screen map but won’t necessarily be.
The counts_ints2D key has a 2D array of integers. The initial outer level is in row order (top-down), then the inner arrays are the columns (left-right). If any array would be all zeros, a null is returned instead for efficiency reasons. The entire value is null if there is no matching spatial data.
If format=png then the output key is counts_png. It’s a base-64 encoded string of a 4-byte PNG. The PNG logically holds exactly the same data that the ints2D format does. Note that the alpha channel byte is flipped to make it easier to view the PNG for diagnostic purposes, since otherwise counts would have to exceed 2^24 before it becomes non-opague. Thus counts greater than this value will become opaque.
The BBoxField field type indexes a single rectangle (bounding box) per document field and supports searching via a bounding box. It supports most spatial search predicates, it has enhanced relevancy modes based on the overlap or area between the search rectangle and the indexed rectangle. It’s particularly useful for its relevancy modes. To configure it in the schema, use a configuration like this:
BBoxField is actually based off of 4 instances of another field type referred to by numberType. It also uses a boolean to flag a dateline cross. Assuming you want to use the relevancy feature, docValues is required. Some of the attributes are in common with the RPT field like geo, units, worldBounds, and spatialContextFactory because they share some of the same spatial infrastructure.
The score local parameter can be one of overlapRatio, area, and area2D. area scores by the document area using surface-of-a-sphere (assuming geo=true) math, while area2D uses simple width * height. overlapRatio computes a [0-1] ranged score based on how much overlap exists relative to the document’s area and the query area. The javadocs of BBoxOverlapRatioValueSource have more info on the formula. There is an additional parameter queryTargetProportion that allows you to weight the query side of the formula to the index (target) side of the formula. You can also use &debug=results to see useful score computation info.

COEUR d’ALENE — After working for a quarter-century as an employee of Alert Muffler and Automotive, Dale Banks is taking over ownership of the shop.
The building sits on a prime corner at the intersection of Fourth Street and Wallace Avenue. Evidence of Banks’ continuing education in automotive technology is on display in the front office. The nine certificates on the wall are just a small part of the larger stack of certifications Banks has obtained over his years at Alert.
“He’s the perfect man for the job,” said current owner Joe Parker. “We have worked well together for 25 years, so it’s just the natural progression.”
The shop was lively Tuesday as Banks and an employee worked on multiple vehicles. A slight smell of oil hung in the air as music echoed off the metal and auto parts.
Banks said he is looking forward to making some small changes, but will continue to offer the great service Alert Automotive is known for.
Because he has worked at the shop for such a long time, the transition will come easier, he said. He already knows what’s needed to keep things running smoothly.
Banks was raised in Sandpoint and moved to the Lake City while attending North Idaho College for automotive technology. He is a family man who said he spends time away from work with his wife, Deana, children and grandchildren.
“Last year for Christmas gifts we made these fairy doors,” he said. “We carved them out and put little doorknobs on them, and you place them against a tree so it looks like a fairy lives in your tree.”
Banks said Deana not only helps with woodworking but also is a huge factor in his decision to take on ownership of Alert Automotive.
“We just want everyone to know that we are just going to run a no-nonsense, honest auto repair facility,” he said.

Plymouth Archaeological Rediscovery director Craig Chartier lifts part of a headstone out of the ground next to the grave shaft he was hired to excavate last weekend, while second-year Rhode Island College anthropology student Shelby Munnelly looks on. (Breeze photo by Nicole Dotzenrod)
LINCOLN – Pieces of a coffin and two grave markers have been discovered by archaeologists excavating a grave shaft at the corner of a site slated for residential development, confirming that the boundaries of the historic Lincoln Cemetery No. 24 once extended well beyond its present borders.
Craig Chartier, director of Plymouth Archaeological Rediscovery, said the discovery that effectively halted the construction of a single-family home was, in fact, a grave shaft, albeit an empty one. The body buried there had been meticulously moved sometime in the past, leaving behind a singular clue to the person’s identity: a footstone engraved with the initials “L.S.W.”
“This burial was definitely opened up and moved,” Chartier told The Breeze. “When people move bodies, they always seem to leave things behind. In this case they took everything but the last inch or so of coffin wood, so they did a very thorough and efficient job.”
Historical records for Lincoln Cemetery No. 24 indicate that a number of gravestones had gone “missing” from the lot over the years, particularly the Keene and Whipple family markers. Last month, a number of the missing burials were discovered at Moshassuck Cemetery in Central Falls, where cemetery records indicate 20 bodies were disinterred from Lincoln Cemetery No. 24 in 1928. No person with the initials “L.S.W.” is listed on those records, making their identity the latest in a string of mysteries related to the cemetery.
The story began in March, when Charles Belshe purchased the property at the corner of Sprague Avenue and River Road from James Walker, with hopes of building a single-family home. At the time, neighbors and local historic groups expressed concerns, noting that the area slated for development was once part of the cemetery property that had at some point been plowed over.
Construction was halted in April after the base of a headstone was unearthed. State laws governing historic cemeteries forbid excavating within 25 feet of a historic burial. In accordance with the law, the Rhode Island Historical Preservation & Heritage Commission advised that Belshe undertake an archeological investigation to confirm the cemetery’s true borders.
An archeological scrape of the site was conducted in May by Alan Strauss, director of Cultural Resource Specialists, with Walker operating the backhoe to dig through his former property. Strauss was searching for dark discolorations in the subsoil that would reveal ground disturbance, determining the presence of a grave shaft within the proposed foundation trenches. He found one such spot next to where the headstone base had originally been found.
Strauss reported his findings to the state, which responded that the grave shaft would need to be excavated to confirm whether or not human remains were present. If Belshe chose not to excavate, the feature would be considered a burial shaft and treated as a historic cemetery under state law.
Belshe hired a new team to excavate the grave shaft, tapping Plymouth for the dig conducted on June 7. In a span of a few hours, the dark rectangular stain in the soil gave way to a copper coffin clasp and nails, the bottom half of a large unmarked headstone and engraved footstone, plus the decayed outline of a wooden casket – but no skeletal remains.
“As far as this former grave goes, it’s all clear,” Chartier said. “We will advise the state that as far as we are concerned, (Belshe) is fine to continue construction.”
Chartier said he would advise Belshe to have an archaeological monitor on the site during future work to be sure nothing else is uncovered.
“There is always a possibility of unmarked burials in the lot,” he added, noting that his company’s permit limited his investigation to one grave shaft. “I don’t know how far the cemetery extends outside of its current borders.”
The possibility of additional burials was echoed by state officials, including Jeffrey Emidy, Acting Executive Director of the RIHPHC and deputy state historic preservation officer, who said there are areas of the parcel that “have not been excavated to examine them for unmarked burials. It remains possible that unmarked burials may be present in the unexcavated areas.”
Blackstone Valley Historical Society’s Cemetery Coordinator Ken Postle said BVHS strongly suspects the presence of other burials.
“Those who own a lot nearby a historic cemetery should keep in mind that historic cemeteries have ill-defined borders. Just because there’s a fence doesn’t mean the border is the same that it once was.”
The state is expected to recommend that construction of the house be allowed to proceed. With state approval, the project will be back on as planned.
Been feeling bad for months for the new owner who was just trying to make a living and being more than cooperative with the things being asked of him along the way, and still being villainized nonetheless. Happy to hear he hasn’t been bullied out of doing what he planned to do.
I just want to repeat here for the Public Record that reps of BVHS and the Town of Lincoln and the State of RI have been nothing but gracious with Mr Belshe, being under the assumption that we were dealing with an individual that simply bought a lot in good faith and wanted to make a profit building a house...In subsequent conversations where we instructed him and the former owner as to what we assumed were mistakes they made in Cemetery Law interpretation, we were gracious and suggested possible scenarios that involved maintaining the dignity of the dead and building a house free from restrictions for future backyard digging...
The present situation we find ourselves in has been brought about by a stubborn insistence that there is an inherent right to develop a lot where no relatives have cared for or "positively" known about the existence of possible human remains for a century...Imagine if a Native American settlement had been disturbed and that logic was applied...Since these are simply colonials and possible servants and former field hands we are conjecturing about, they don't have the same weight of care or protection due them...
As it stands now, no one will ever be sure that the concrete slab going in covers removed or occupied burial plots, but be sure that there are burial spots there...
Who wins here? Certainly not the family members looking for relatives and certainly not the new owners to be. They can't ever dig a pool or do any kind of excavating beyond basic gardening and who knows what may happen to the foundation slab-You know what Jesus said about building on shifting sand versus on solid rock...Sad...Learn a lesson folks..Legal isn't always right-Lots of stuff is legal, but not moral or right..This is why we are always on the hunt for where the lost yards are that are in the colonial records-We try to stay a step ahead of the loss of history..I have been threatened with a lawsuit for speaking out, but I know that there is an ultimate judge beyond this life whose idea of right and wrong I support,so bullies don't bother me..Please don't give up-There may yet be a surprise here, especially when utilities show up, but regardless get behind BVHS and the other Historical Societies and support efforts to protect our cemeteries...
I feel bad for developer, he was duped. Sold a piece of land that the seller knew about burials and in the past covered them up.
So why is he not halting and pursuing action against seller? Cause he wasn't duped and knew about the history? It is too costly to hire a lawyer to sue former owner regarding duping him in the same?
This is the developers livelyhood? He should know better when dealing with land near historical cemeteries.
Why is the developer who has money on the line allowed to pick the company to investigate? Seems like a conflict of interest. State should have approved companies for this.
It is unfortunate that the developer has to go through all of this when the previous owner was very aware.
It is also unfortunate that the next owner will likely have issues as well and the next owner after that, as long as someone is reminding the town and neighbors that there are possible graves located under and around this soon to be house.
Based on how long humans have walked this earth we are essentially all living on someones grave but for there to be documented proof that this lot was a cemetery, it seems ignorant to not do more.

A decision to close school for the day for emergencies related to weather and road conditions will be made before 6 a.m. and reported to the following stations:
Transportation to all private and parochial schools, both in and out of district, will be canceled on such days.
If it appears that road or weather conditions will be hazardous at the normal opening time of the school day, but are expected to improve, a delayed opening will be announced before 6 a.m. Delayed openings will postpone the opening of school by one (1) or two (2) hours; i.e., schools will open one (1) or two (2) hours after their normal starting times at the discretion of the Superintendent. A delayed school opening means bus schedules will be delayed by one (1) or two (2) hours. For example, if a child’s bus is scheduled to arrive at 8 a.m., the one (1) or two (2) hour delay will change the bus arrival time to 9 a.m. or 10 a.m.
• All buses to private and parochial schools in the district will be delayed by one (1) or two (2) hours.
A delayed opening is subject to change to an emergency school closing if the weather or road conditions remain hazardous.
If the district uses more than two days for snow emergencies during the 2017-2018 school year, the make-up days will be: (1) Friday, April 6, 2018; and (2) Thursday, April 5, 2018.

Yesterday I found out that in May of this year, the Wikipedia entry for Green Book (CD standard) was updated with a link to the Green Book Version May 1994, Release 2. The page states:
Wikipedia wrote: However, the 1994 version of the standard was eventually made available for free by Philips.
The provided link points to the https://www.lscdweb.com site which is linked from the Philips Licensing programs - CD Disc (Joint) page (the link is under the "Partner Area" in the "Licensing" menu). Some further investigation leads to this CD Products page, which seems to confirm that it is all perfectly legit.
This is good news for CD-i application and CD-i emulator writers (especially those wanting to do a "high-level" emulation like CD-ice): every specification needed is now publicly available.
For hardware emulation like CD-i Emulator and the MESS CD-i driver there still remains a lot of undocumented hardware, of course...
Now, one would think that something like this was publicised somewhere, but I have been unable to find anything (it could be my Google-fu is weak today).
The link was added to Wikipedia by "Sega381" on May 25, 2013... at the bottom of the CD Products page, it says:
Note: With the introduction of this new website on April 16, 2010, the conditions to obtain specification books has been changed.
Some books, previously available only in combination with a License, Registration or Information agreement (or Subscription), are now separately priced ( Non Disclosure Agreement required)

Indeed, and it was downloadable since last year : when I was surfing on these forums I found this thread : viewtopic.php?f=17&t=2868#p13954
Too good to be true ? Then I retried to google green book again and after a visit of the Philips's Services and ordering page, got the link to magic page with all the colored books you mentioned (8th september 2012 for me). I bet it was on this page that Pete found earlier the copy he was looking for
With Philips permission, Adminius made this page with a download available to registered visitors available August 2011.
Adminius is an independent back-office for licensing companies, providing administration and registration services for licensing companies.
Does this mean that the Green Book is not really intended to be "downloadable" to all people, only to registered visitors of the site?
It's now also on ICDIA in the new CD-i Full Functional Specification (Green Book) section under CD-i DOCUMENTATION.

I'm just a simple girl armed with a camera, ready to take pictures of whatever comes my way. I love living life, not being taken seriously, and just living for today. I have a wonderful hubby who attempts to keep grounded and a son who is like the wind, ready for all sorts of adventures.
The National Day of Prayer comes this Thursday, May 1st. Officially designated as a national holiday by President Truman in 1952, the National Day of Prayer actually goes back to 1775 when our Continental Congress asked our citizens to pray for the nation as she was suffering from the stormy events leading up to revolution and a fight for freedom.
Both Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush held special celebrations at the White House, celebrating more than 200 years of freedom and prosperity. Bill Clinton stopped the practice during his administration but it was revived again by George W. Bush during his terms of office. The White House celebrations stopped again in 2009 when Barack Hussein Obama took office.
Regardless, the National Day of Prayer is widely recognized throughout the nation. More than 300 hundred religions participate and thousands of prayer events are held throughout the country. For many folks this day is a highly personal experience and they will simply drop to their knees at their church or their home and send up prayers for peace, or healing, or strength to deal with personal problems...or simply to offer thanks for personal blessings.
Sadly, it is the organized prayer events that have drawn the most fire from atheists and agnostics. In 2008 the Freedom From Religion Foundation sued the Federal government in an effort to end the National Day of Prayer. They were initially successful in winning an injunction by a liberal Federal district judge, Judge Barbara Crabbe, who ruled that atheist and agnostic Americans were suffering "concrete injury" by being forced to tolerate public events associated with the National Day of Prayer. The battle in the courts continued into 2011 when the 7th District Court of Appeals overturned Crabbe's ruling and allowed the National Day of Prayer to continue.
So this Thursday millions of prayers will be sent skyward; from Navahos, Cherokees, Christians, Catholics, Muslims, Southern Baptists, Methodists and hundreds of other religions. To my way of thinking that's a good thing; when folks are on their knees, and their hands are clasped, they aren't throwing stones or stepping on others...so that's a fine thing indeed.
A single nationally recognized day of prayer is not going to solve any of our problems. There are hundreds of court fights going on right now, with public school injunctions to stop little school kids from bowing their heads before their school lunch. The Freedom from Religion Foundation is winning case after case to remove overt demonstrations of religion in our armed forces. Religion being such a big deal in a fox hole these injunctions are gaining traction in destroying the morale of our military folks.
But a single day of prayer is better than no day at all. So, if your heart's in it...feel free to speak freely with your own personal version of God....we may never even have that before long.
If you love animals you couldn't do much better than to google "Juno's Place". The site was developed by a working class lady up in Massachusetts. But her heavily followed Face Book page is just a reflection of the life's work of a lady who does more to rescue and comfort and heal animals than anyone I've ever known.
Her "icon" and the face of Juno's Place just happens to be a little Chihuahua dog that she rescued as a very sick little puppy, nursed it back to health, and it's been "Kismet" ever since. Juno is a quite remarkable little dog. If you don't think so just look at the hundreds of pictures of this little media darling. The lady poses her in dozens of wonderful poses and how she gets this little dog to pose is beyond me....I have two Chi's myself and they do nothing they don't want to do, much less sit or stand calmly so that the camera can catch the magic of ultimate cuteness. Nearly every picture is accompanied by Juno's running monologue about the nature of her latest predicament and they are heartfelt and funny and heart tugging.
Juno is known as "The Little Dog Who Does Big Things"...she is the "front girl", the "spokes-dog" for announcing the latest parade or dog walk or some manner of fundraiser whose proceeds go toward rescuing, providing vet care, housing, or just making an animal's life more comfortable.
Standing always in the shadows, this dear lady is the wind beneath Juno's wings. No animal is too sick, or their fates too dismal for this saintly lady to offer her heart and all of her love and compassion. She steels herself to face the loss of those she can't save and that is probably what will win her a first class ticket to heaven. She'll cry over a pet that she was unable to save, wipe away the tears, straighten her back and go out and forage for lost, sick or abused animals, knowing some of them will eventually break her heart. She's raised thousands of dollars and saved countless lives and I can't think of anything so satisfying or more commending to a caring God.
Juno's "pack leader" does not confine her heart's compassion to animals alone. She raises funds for underprivileged school kids; backpacks, toys that they might know joy, and health care products so that they become strong in both body as well as mind.
Should you choose to venture over Juno's way, be forewarned; she'll touch your heart and before you know it you'll be sending a few bucks to feed, neuter, medicate or save an abused animal from death by euthanasia.
But, if you never send in a dime, you'll find yourself tuning into Juno's Place to see what next predicament this little darling has gotten herself into, whether it be ordering pizza, throwing a tantrum for missing her favorite TV show, "Criminal Minds", or the chilling Bates Motel, or of recent note, getting busted for trading in forbidden "pig ears" as she is drawn into a Craig's List scam.
You'll smile, you'll cry, you'll laugh out loud at Juno's latest antics, as she tugs at your heart...and makes you a better person for knowing this little dog who does big things....and the lady who makes it all happen.
Alfred Hitchcock sold several hundred million movie tickets by giving into his fetish for blondes. Whether it was Grace Kelly or Kim Novak or Tippi Hedrin or Doris Day, it didn't hurt a bit that the protagonist in Hitchcock films were beautiful blondes.
Equally rotund, but brilliant Roger Ailes, head of programming at Fox News, seems to have latched on to Hitchcock's penchant for blondes and they bloom in glorious splendor on Fox News. And no dumb blonde jokes please...I ran the bio's on these women. They own more law degrees, journalism degrees and joint business/law degrees than any news staffs ever.
Now call me a male chauvinist pig if you must but it doesn't hurt a damn bit to have your news brought to you by attractive women. And the "attractiveness" doesn't just come from the physical; these are strong women, tough interviewers, and not a whine heard about gender inequality or the suffering from baking a batch of cookies. And they seem more than capable of "bringing home the bacon...and cooking it up in the pan".
Contrast that with MSNBC. See if you can tolerate 15 minutes of 'sigh-heavy' Mika on Morning Joe. Or Andrea Mitchell, Alan Greenspan's main squeeze....I can take about five minutes of her cynical monotones before I have to flip the channel. Or Melissa XX Harris, who poked fun at Mitt's Romney's adopted Black baby and never met a Black thug she didn't love. And, frankly, who wants to have their ass kicked by Mr. Rachel Maddow who seems perfectly capable of doing so.
Nope...give me Megan Kelly for every day of the week. She's beautiful, sassy, and smart as hell...and she's bringing home $20 million dollars worth of bacon..and she must be heating it up at home cause she's been generating a baby a year lately.
And, lest you think I value only physical beauty, let me declare my admiration for Greta Van Sustern....she is the best at poking holes in liberal logic and skewering government officials for all their silliness.
And, have you ever watched "The Five?". Take a look at the girl at the far left, front. That's "the leg chair", occupied alternately by either Kimberly Guilfoyle or Andrea Tantaros, owners of the some of the greatest legs in the business. And again, these women are smart as hell! Andrea Tantaros holds a degree in journalism, did her undergraduate study at The Sorbonne in Paris and speaks three languages fluently.
Anybody want to join my crusade to gut the IRS and implement a 10% national sales tax to replace your 1040's now? Apparently it wasn't enough that the IRS was used as Obama's political arm to harass and stone wall legitimate conservative organizations last year. And the fact that the IRS fails to collect over $350 billion annually in unpaid taxes. Or that each year since 2009 the IRS has issued $11 billion in Child Tax Credit checks to illegal aliens...many of them even who had already been deported to Mexico! Many more are not bothered that tens of thousands of federal prisoners received stimulus checks!
No, there are still millions of you who blindly send the IRS a nice fat tax check every April 15th...then go on your merry way and never question where that money goes!
Well, we learned this week that a few million of those taxpayer dollars go to disgruntled and poor performing IRS workers who are given bonuses to brighten their mood...and if that doesn't do it the IRS wonks grant them a month or two of paid time off!
The above graph shows where the heaviest incidence of Identification Theft is taking place. Do I need to go into my illegal immigration rant for you to make the connection? Well guess what; it's getting far worse than stolen social security cards and stolen credit cards. The feds just reported this week that fully 43% of all Identity Theft is coming from the theft of your health records.
Yep...it seems that illegal Mexicans have found a way to get around Obama's Obamacare program. It wasn't enough that Obama allocated $500 million dollars to establish medical clinics to treat illegal immigrants who don't qualify for Obamacare...no, the illegals want a "Cadillac plan"; YOURS! You see, now that illegals feel safe from deportation they have become rather tired of using the Emergency Rooms of America for their routine care. And Obama is not building those illegal clinics fast enough. So Jose is now stealing your medical identification and using it to get costly surgeries and other hospital and specialist care.
How are they doing this? Well the FBI says the big criminal cartels are simply hacking into hospital and medical center records and taking all they need. They then mass manufacture social security, medicare and private insurer health cards and sell them to anyone who needs a heart transplant or gall bladder surgery or other health treatments. The rogue Mexicans are simply paying off a health care clerk in your local doctor's office or clinic and she provides him all the documentation needed to run down to a shop in Maryvale, or Escondido, or West Sacramento, or Fresno or El Paso, or San Antonio who can issue you a phony state driver's license, social security card and the medical card you need to get treatment in any hospital in America!
But wait...it gets worse. Medical care providers have been finding that the medical care provided to the medical ID thief has been entered into your medical records. Health Care providers are now frightened to death that they are going to be sued for giving you two pints of A positive blood for that little operation you have scheduled...when YOUR blood type just happens to be O negative! Or the Doc may just decide to remove that perfectly good kidney because the thief sharing your record is having trouble passing piss! Or you go in for a heart stint and end up with a heart transplant cause Pedro's been eating too damn many enchilada combos!
I had just finished reading this ominous news when I turned on the TV and they were conducting Senate hearings on the Obamacare's Healthcare.gov site design. One of the Senators pulled up a slide that came directly from the Healthcare.gov's own site. In tiny, tiny script, Obama's healthcare site says this: "Users Must Note that they can expect no reasonable assurances that confidential information provided will remain confidential".
Obama's HHS rep stood open mouthed and speechless when asked if she knew that Healthcare.gov does not conform to federal HIPA confidentiality laws. She said she was aware that the cautionary clause was included in the site but had no answers as to how they would protect confidential patient information.....she did say "well, we're working on that."
Forgive me for "droning" on you, dear reader, by mentioning Mr. Bundy two days in a row, but I can't help marveling at the grand liberal "Clive Bundy" victory dance that has sent our liberal friends into an orgasmic frenzy these last few days. Colbert, Jon Stewart, Nasty Pellosi, former "negro"-uttering Harry Reid are all having a field day laughing at an inarticulate old man who wears cowboy boots and walks through cow shit.
The libs are having the time of their lives making fun. But I couldn't help wondering what would happen if they were to direct all of that hateful and cynical scorn on the very Blacks that old Clive talked about. Allow me a bit of speculation here:
Jon Stewart, on the daily show yesterday, was hilarious as he poked fun of illiterate Blacks who dropped out of high school, can't read at the high school level and speak in Ebonics because they've never been taught the Queen's English. Stewart was hysterical as he aped the speaking mannerisms of Blacks in South Central Los Angeles...and he brought down the house when he "aks" what his homey be doing...what fun!
The only thing funnier on TV yesterday was Stephen Colbert's "man on the street" schtick where he hid in an alley behind an abortion clinic and his cameraman filmed bloody fetuses tumbling into a dumpster...oh was that funny, especially when he equated those little Black fetuses to economy sized licorice flavored gummy bears being set out for pick up.
Even MSNBC got into the act as Ed (Erectile Disfunction) Shultz nearly fell out of his seat on the ED Show as he put up a slide that showed that Blacks, some 12% of the population, consume 50% of every welfare dollar. Old Ed was laughing so hard he popped the three middle buttons of his Ralph Lauren shirt so that viewers could see a real "belly laugh".
And on Jimmy Kimmel last night, old Jimmy got his 'man on the street' to query folks in downtown Detroit to see if they would vote for Obama if they got free Obama phones...and damned if everyone of those urban Detroiters didn't cave to the graft! They even offered to vote twice if they could get free text and talk!
The day of gleeful comedy was topped off as Letterman dressed up a bunch of stooges as Swat cops and invaded the plush North Side of Chicago and began confiscating citizen's guns. You should have seen the look on those Honky faces when the cops walked off with their Smith and Wessons and shotguns! It was a riot! Then since 47 people, including children in the playgrounds, were gunned downed on Easter Weekend on the South Side, Letterman's faux Swatters drove down to the South Side and dumped their bounty of guns right in the middle of the street!..you should have seen those Black thugs rushing to score some serious iron! Hilarious!
And I wonder if all that poking fun at the Black community shamed even one to give up the green check, or think twice before trading their food stamp card for cash and Coors, or if a Black mother ever actually looked at that fetus torn and mangled from the womb..and reconsidered receiving a train of breeders into her bedroom or were shamed at the street killings of six year old children.
Cliven Bundy is not a politician, he's a rancher. Mr. Bundy can't say the pretty words like Barack Hussein Obama does...words that are false, meant to confuse, divide, demonize, obscure...but most of all make you forget life's realities.
So Mr. Bundy used words like negroes and coloreds to describe Blacks. And he talked about Blacks hanging out in ghettos with nothing to do but wait for the welfare check. And heavens!...Bundy even talked about the 75% Black divorce rate! And though he didn't mention the percentages, he talked about the fact that more than 80% of all abortions occur within the Black community. Instead, Mr. Bundy talked of a time fifty years ago when Black families stayed together...before they became enslaved by a welfare check.
Mr. Bundy made a big mistake in speaking out about the massive fail of the African-American community. And, because he's not an orator, because he's not a smooth politician who measures every word for political correctness before he utters it, he didn't put it in the context that any of we flighty Americans can accept.
So Mr. Bundy's "cause celebre" against a bullying big government is now over. The Nevada and Arizona conservative legislators have come back home and, just as Judas did, they have denied ever knowing, or siding with Cliven Bundy. They are joined by $20 million dollar per year media darlings like Sean Hannity and Glenn Beck who say they are appalled by Bundy's words.
But make no mistake people, Clive Bundy died for your sins this past week. He said things that you think...and won't say yourself. He says things our politicians know...but won't say themselves. These are the same politicians who blow with the wind on illegal immigration, just as Speaker Boehner did this week when he castigated his fellow Republicans who won't pass immigration laws knowing Obama won't enforce any of them. But the politicians are so desperate to save their Congressional seats they'd sell out their own mother if that's what the polls tell them they should do.
And, oh, how the Democrats love Clive Bundy...secretly of course. They can now brand conservatives as racists because, after all, didn't they trumpet the cause of Clive Bundy last week?
Lost in all this was an open letter, written by a young Black Marine, a friend of Mr. Bundy's, who said Clive Bundy is not a racist and that, indeed, Mr. Bundy speaks the truth, not only about Blacks, but all Americans laboring beneath an oppressive and intrusive government. Here's the text from Bundy's African American friend:
The media distorts information to the point of social division. This is a photo of myself and the resilient, often charismatic, and maybe not so tactful Cliven Bundy. He’s a cowboy and a helluva family man, not an orator.
One thing he definitely isn’t – a racist. I found his comments to not only be NOT racist, but his own view of his experiences. Who the heck are we to determine another man’s perspective on the world around him?! Just because Picasso’s view of the world was abstract, does it negate the fact that his art was genuine?
Furthermore, if you take the time to do your own research, you’ll find that his statements about some black Americans actually hold weight. He posed a hypothetical question. He said, “I wonder IF” … Hell, I’m black and I often wonder about the same about the decline of the black family.
Bottom line is that we are all slaves in this waning republic, no matter our skin color. Mr. Bundy could have used any racial demographic as an example: Native Americans on reservations, whites in trailer parks, etc. He noticed the crippling effects of receiving government “assistance” and the long term result of accepting handouts.
It’s not progress at all. I challenge Sean Hannity, Rand Paul, and others to read my comment and reconsider their position in this matter. Individual liberties are at stake here, yours and mine. THAT is the issue.
Don’t let the liberal media and ignoramuses like Glenn Beck and that weasel Harry Reid make you lose sight of the real issue here: The federal government is a burgeoning behemoth and a bully on a once constitutional playground.I sincerely hope you real patriots out there who can see through the smoke.
Readers, you will not see that letter spoken about in the main stream media. And even as a thousand political "Judas" turn away from Clive Bundy, make no mistake; he died for your sins this week. And Mr. Bundy is not Jesus; he'll get no second chance and there will be no resurrection for him...and he died for saying what millions of us are thinking....but dare not say.
There's a same sex female couple down in Alabama who want to change the state law on same sex marriage....so they can legally get a divorce in that state. Seems they went up to Vermont a few years ago, got hitched, then found marriage ain't what it's cracked up to be. Now they don't want to travel back to the state that recognized their marriage and want Alabama to change their laws so they can divorce. (Alabama said "since we don't recognize your marriage, just go your own ways and everything is hunky dory with us since we didn't recognize it to begin with")
Well, it has always been my contention that gays have lusted after marriage because it's something they can't have. Now that they can, in 17 states, they're finding out marriage is not all what it's cracked up to be. No more cruising the gay bars, no more lollapaloozas, no more fun. Okay, I know that's a bit harsh but single straights have their own mating rituals as well so let's have equality in all things, huh?
Well, in the interest of good will, I've got the perfect solution for halting this gay marriage thing in its tracks: no more taxpayer millions expended on defending the Defense of Marriage Act, no more federal judges sifting through mounds of evidence and weeks of testimony. Just have Congress enact a law that bans all marriages, gay or straight.
Now you may think this is a bit much, but consider the current state of our society. Over 50% of all marriages today end in divorce. According to several studies the breakdown is as follows: 41% of all first marriages end in divorce, it rises to 60% for second marriages, and a dismal 73% for third marriages.
Clearly Americans these days hold little value for the sacred vows of marriage. Further, millions of people just choose to shack up, form domestic partnerships and avail themselves of a steady piece of ass without the dreary commitments that marriages demand. And hell, the tax codes and welfare bennies all favor those who tell daddy to hit the road, or, more telling, women just breed kids from various fathers and rely on the taxpayer to pay for the upkeep.
So why bother with all this? Let's just all shack up, keep our dating options open, manage our own personal finances and split the cost of the rent or mortgage! Those who need the formality of a legal document can always just establish a civil union, recognized by nearly every state in the nation.
So let's quit sweating this gay marriage thing. And you folks that are offering the "reproduction of children" argument, give it up.....very few of you are producing babies, with the exception of Blacks who do it to up their welfare and WIC and food stamp booty, and illegal Mexicans who believe there is strength in numbers and every anchor baby gives them a toe hold on America's extremely generous social welfare programs. Whites are either shooting blanks or tired of sex cause we're actually seeing a decline in the White birth rate.
I guarantee you if we start banning marriage altogether, if we look at the tax advantages of "single, head of household", when all women tell hubby to hit the road and cash in on Uncle Sugar's generous support to single mothers, we'll have the gays flocking to Divorce Court in droves.
I just received a forwarded email from an old marine who was mourning the death of one of his old comrades from the Army of The Republic of Vietnam. I too mourned the death because I know of the heartbreak of millions of ARVN troops who lived lives of quiet desperation after the North Vietnamese Communists took over that country in 1975.
My Vietnamese brother-in-law fought for his country, right along side we Americans. When the war was declared over, and we all came home, the war for our Vietnamese allies would continue. My brother-in-law was stripped of his South Vietnamese uniform and shipped off to a Vietnamese "re-education camp". There he was tortured, fed slop that a hog wouldn't eat, beaten repeatedly, and when they had defeated his spirit completely, they sent him home to die. And this he did...he died painfully and at a painfully young age. His crime; fighting for his country.
I had read a book about this sad story several years ago. The book left me in tears and prompted me to write a Letter to the Editor of my local newspaper. I just felt this story needed to be told. The letter got little response because Americans want to forget wars, especially losing wars, as quickly as possible.
But it has always been hard for me to forget this story....the story of millions of Vietnamese vets who were tortured, then if they survived, were sent home to die. And so many did. These young men were barred from employment by the government, and much of the private sector, branded as traitors to the Communist cause, and were forced to live in tin can shacks or on the streets. Some, lucky enough to have lost arms and legs could go to begging in the streets, but for those scarred from the inside, or ailing from a broken heart, were forced to survive any way they could.
Now, if I this is even a little bit hard to understand, try to imagine that you had served in America's armed forces. Imagine you have risked your life, sacrificed years away from family, have chosen to fight for a bigger cause than yourself, and then are punished for that service. And yes indeed, we have millions right here in this country who suffer from the after effects of war, to include the ten percent who are homeless today. But even these poor wretches have it better than those ARVN guys who are desperately trying to survive in a country where the government despises them.
Thanks to the email I received this morning I've found a more tangible way to help. A group of retired Vietnam vets have formed a 501 charity to provide financial help to these Vietnamese heroes. It's called the Vietnam Healing Foundation. This foundation was started when some American Vietnam vets returned to Vietnam and were appalled at how their old comrades were living...and dying. Because the Communist Vietnamese bars assistance to these vets, the foundation is forced to work in the shadows, finding Vietnamese vets, validating financial need, then sending money for food, or medical treatment, or support for their children. The fund is so tiny, their cause so little known, the foundation has only been able to aid 80 Vietnam vets directly and another 80 or so indirectly. Their web site is so neglected I get more hits on this blog in a day than they get in a month. I sent them a small check this morning and my heart is a bit lighter for it.
Should anyone want to send them a couple of bucks, the address is Vietnam Healing Foundation, P.O. Box 641, Willow Springs, North Carolina, 27592. They also accept Pay Pal. Here's the link to their website: http://www.thevhf.org/www/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56&Itemid=72
Never let it be said that pity is not profitable. No where is this more evident than with the ultra-liberal Gannett Company. For those of you whom the name Gannett doesn't ring a bell, this is the media giant that produced America's first "cartoon newspaper", USA TODAY.
Last year Gannett made $2.2 billion dollars. They own some 600 newspapers and print publications across the nation as well as dozens of TV stations. And they have done more for liberal socialism than any politician could ever hope to do.
You see, Gannett deals in pity. They use the monstrous power of their media foot print to publish a very narrow swath of news coverage that champions big government power and the great crusading for "victimhood". And when the facts get in the way, they just print the myth, as long as it complies with their editorial position.
What is their editorial position? Well, at the moment it is open borders/amnesty for 30 million illegal invaders. And they employ the massive strength of their hundreds of newspapers that serve as their propaganda arm of their liberal media empire. For example, the once independent Arizona Republic newspaper here once dared to report the news in a fair and objective manner. However, once Gannett bought them out they set about trying to convert a conservative state into liberal zombies who will swallow their gruel. Sadly, for Gannett, they are sailing against strong head winds as more than 70% of the state is conservative. Readership of The Republic has plunged as Arizona readers have gagged on liberal editorials, an army of left wing columnists, with two token conservative writers who most often are given one little two inch block to offer a conservative thought or two.
So we Arizonans are hammered with sob story after sob story about illegal deportations, the tragedy of illegal arrests for ID theft, a decade long campaign against Sheriff Joe Arpaio...and a little news censorship when the 80% Hispanic crime reports are printed...while other news sites will print the victim's name, if its a Hispanic they try to suppress that little tidbit of info. I once published a comment on their site, showing several identical crime reports, one from an objective news source, and one from the Republic, and the evidence was stark; the Republic clearly suppressed criminal information, even if doing so presented a threat to the community.
And Gannett does this same type of stuff in their other major newspapers across the country...these local papers get their marching orders from McClean, Virginia and that's that.
However, not satisfied that the local paper was doing enough to advance their socialist agenda, Gannett has dramatically transformed the Arizona Republic's format just weeks ago....they meld sections of USA Today into the local paper, and boy is it loaded with sob stories.
Just this morning I was reading a Gannett piece about starvation in American. Gannett claims that 44 million Americans are "food insecure"...that these folks are not getting enough to eat. Well, Gannett must have a lot of faith in the zombie KOOL-AID because they profiled two families to make their point; one White, one Black....and guess what? The pics clearly show four of the five in that White family are clearly obese, the one exception a little girl who hadn't learned to pack away a Big Mac combo with relative ease. The Black family was no different; the mother was morbidly obese, was being embraced by two roly poly daughters. But don't take my word for it...look for yourself...or stand outside any public school in the nation and tell me our children are starving. ...or walk into your local Walmart and tell me how many folks you see who are malnourished.
But really, who can blame Gannett? If money is always the prime motivator, and if you were making $2.2 billion a year selling pity, wouldn't you do it too?
Keep an eye on me, folks...I may be turning a little "communist" on you. You see, I was just reading an article written by Nobel Winner for Economics Robert Shillers on the growing income gap in America. Shiller proposes that we might want to consider indexing taxes in a direct ratio to the current income gap between rich and poor in America. And god help me if at least part of it didn't make sense to me.
Now, settle down, and let me explain. First of all, I still believe in free markets and free enterprise. And I do know that a lot of that "income gap" is caused by an ever increasing swath of Americans who just don't want to work...and are being rewarded by our government for not working. Secondly, the income gap has grown because of the huge increase in internet billionaires up there in Silicon Valley. And thirdly, given a choice between having a billionaire keep more of his own money, or giving it to a government bureaucrat to grow another costly bureaucracy, I would be on the side of the billionaire. Finally, if I were ever to embrace higher taxes on billionaires, it would certainly not include millionaires who've earned their net worth by the sweat of their brow or through family owned businesses.
No, the only ones I would hit on would be those Wall Street rabbits who sit at a trading desk, take advantage of minute little computer spreads, multiplied by a a million trades, and come out earning $100 million a year off the backs of the small investor. And I would hit on bankers who borrow money from the Fed at 0 percent, then give you a credit card and charge you 15 or 20% for the privilege of using it. Finally, I would nail those company CEO's that are making 50 to 100 million a year, even as their company's top line declined, along with the small investor's meager share price.
Now let me offer a huge caveat....I would take that additional tax revenue from these non-productive fat cats and I would insist that it go to paying down our national debt and to rebuild our national infrastructure, highways, bridges and obsolete airports...and for no other purpose!
Just last week we learned that some dude that Yahoo hired from Google didn't work out with the new company...so they gave him something like $58 million dollars to go away! And this is not an isolated incident..I've read hundreds of these horror stories where massive failure is rewarded! How the hell is this "free enterprise?" And how many of those bankers and fat cat Wall Street types walked away with hundreds of millions after causing our entire economy to collapse? How many went to jail for violating securities laws? Zip.
So call me a "commie" if you will...but keep in mind that CEO's today are making thousands of times more than the average joe working in their factory or office place. I read somewhere that the ratio in the prosperous fifties and sixties were about 50 to 1....now it is obscene thousands to one, and they are simply not worth that kinda dough. Besides, these are the dudes that are exporting your jobs to China and India...F**k em!
Wasn't it just last year when we were all fearful of government drones hovering over our back yard? It seems to me we were fearful of being caught playing a little "slap and tickle" with the wife or girl friend out on the chaise lounge? Or being caught sunbathing nude next to the pool? Or mowing the lawn in that holy sweatshirt that you told your wife you had thrown away?
Well folks, it looks far worse than those petty fears. I was just sitting here at the table this morning, enjoying a leisurely read of the Sunday paper, when I came across a story that had me spewing coffee all over the front page.
It seems we indeed do have an emerging liberal contingent up in Coconino County, up around Flagstaff, who are monstrously hungry for more of your property tax dollar.....so much so that they are considering implementing the use of drones to fly up and down the county and doing aerial imaging of county properties, residential and commercial.
The reason? More property tax moolah! They want to see if you've put in a pool, thus raising the value of your property, something an occasional appraisal will not reveal. They want to see if you've erected a gazebo or a garden shed, or a children's playground, or a grove of fruit-bearing trees, and if you have, they want to assess you higher property taxes.
You see, government knows that citizen taxpayers will go to any lengths to keep from paying higher taxes (even liberals; they just want the OTHER guy to pay more) so the bureaucrats desperately need a means to bust you! And what better way to do that than keeping you honest by sending drones to hover your house!
I can see where these government drones may be the wave of the future. If these "pioneering" county bureaucrats succeed in hiking the tax bounty on your properties I can see the IRS getting into the act. The revenuers can fly over your driveway, check out the kind of ride you have and, if it's a Cadillac or a BMW or a Lexus they might want to run an audit to see if you're reporting all your income. Or, better yet, outfit that drone with thermal imaging capability to see how many big screen televisions and other high tech gear you own. The possibilities are endless!
So don't sweat the "slap and tickle", don't fret about the feds seeing your tan lines....they've got bigger things in mind!
The Philosopher Plato, in his Theory of Norms, argues the existence of God because of the human capacity for recognizing perfection. He asserts that, while man is still a work under construction, most of our natural world clearly evidences the results of God's perfection. We see six petals on a flower, each identical in shape and spacing and form, and we, without thought, recognize that flower to be of perfect form. Plato says that we would never have that sense of cognition if, deep within our being, we were not instilled with the sense of what perfection is, and pays tribute to our creator for it.
Descartes would make the same argument more than a millennium later in Discourse on the Method, and I believe I've embraced Descartes philosophies because he champions a God-embracing version of religion that says it's perfectly okay to to question everything because that's what God built you to do. He disdain's the blind following of organized religion and argues that the rigid confines of the church actually hinders the refining of our souls.
The central theme in the philosophies of both Plato and Descartes is that we humans, though far from perfect, possess something divine within us, and that our inner divinity allows us to accomplish divine things; to produce well above our natural capabilities because we are blessed with "the touch of our creator".
Though the preceding is a roundabout and simplistic way of explaining our capacity for achieving perfection, it is the only way I know to offer my own argument that we humans sometimes achieve miraculous things....and the most tangible results of those miracles are found in our art, and the results of those miracles can only be achieved through the blessings of a generous God.
Think about this. How many inanimate things do you know that have such a profound effect on us if not the penultimate art we are so blessed to experience. Look at the Van Gogh painting above. Though my little illustration doesn't do justice to Van Gogh's "Starry, Starry Night" how can one look at that painting, wonder at the richness of color, depth of mood and not be moved by it. If Van Gogh is not your bag, I dare you to go down and visit an art gallery and see if something there doesn't stir your soul, captivate you, and cause you to linger and stare and not even know why.
Consider music. I dare you to tell me that you've never had your soul set afire by some mode of music that transforms you into someone else, transplants you to somewhere else, and makes you, if even for a few moments, a better human being than you usually give yourself credit for. For me I think about the Beethoven symphonies and am amazed at the thunderous glory of his music, including his 5th Symphony, written after he was nearly totally deaf! Do you really believe there wasn't just a little "God" working there?
When I listen to George Gershwin's "An American In Paris" symphony I am in total awe! I try to imagine how George sat down and figured out how to marry those notes so splendidly, how he thought up the idea that he could vary the rhythms that would carry the listener along like a ship roiling in an angry sea...then gentling you down so that you are gliding on a magic carpet ride over the skies of Paris.
And it doesn't have to be what some of you may call "blue hair" music. Have you ever cried over a rendition of America The Beautiful? Have you ever longed to be in New York after hearing "I'll Take Manhattan?" Does your throat constrict a bit, and you get a little misty when you hear the wedding song that you danced to with your bride....or thrilled to hearing again the song that was playing when you first danced with a girl?
Art, whether it is a painting, or a sculpture, or the wonder of a symphony, or the perfectly crafted scene in a movie (for me the Bogart-Bergman farewell on that foggy night in Casa Blanca) are all touched with a perfection that defies logic, that creates a perfection so far above the mediocre world we usually occupy, that stirs our souls beyond all reason. It is the magnificence of art that proves our creator dwells deep within in us, that we can sometimes draw on that minute DNA God molecule that proves once again that He exists.
Now, go out and play my children. Go gather flowers. Google U Tube and listen to Gershwin. Go out and rent Casa Blanca. Go down and visit an art gallery. Attend your local symphony orchestra concert. Go line dancing in a beer hall. Invite your sweetie to a ballroom dance. Go to a baseball game and stand up in the 7th inning stretch and listen to America The Beautiful. Let your hearts soar and be grateful for our creator's grand munificence.
There isn't one regular reader here who doesn't know that I'm adamantly opposed to granting citizenship to illegal aliens. I am even sufficiently hard ass to demand even the so-called "dreamers" earn their citizenship by serving four years in the military or with a nationally recognized community service organization.
So yesterday I'm scrolling through my Facebook posts and find a post sponsored by an organization called Stop Amnesty that dares to criticize Republicans who are proposing granting citizenship to illegal aliens willing to serve four years in our military. As a retired Vet myself I felt qualified to comment on this post. I reiterated my belief that anyone who's willing to serve and sacrifice and offer your life up for your country is the just the kind of folks we need in our citizenry.
Well, you would not believe the degree of vitriol I received for advocating for citizenship for those willing to serve. One female chicken hawk asked if I was willing to share a bunk space with an illegal Mexican. Well, the term "racist" seems to be thrown around rather loosely these days but I would have no problem calling this woman a racist. I've served with Mexicans and Asians and Blacks, and so many of them were some of the finest people I ever met. Go look at that Vietnam wall and take a look how many Hispanic names are on that wall. So yes...knowing how difficult and challenging it is to serve in the military, I would embrace anyone who's willing to endure four years of it, all the while writing a blank check up to and including your life.
I guess if I had to choose between an illegal Mexican and a gutless chicken hawk, I'll opt for Pedro. Since less than 1% of Americans choose to serve in our military today, and even during the Vietnam era only 5% or so did so, there are damn few out there who deserve to weigh in on who serves and who doesn't.
At a time when Americans are weighing in on immigration reform, at a time when our entire culture is wrestling with our demons....desperate to find some human redemption, I have now found a significant swath of folks who are pure haters, pure racists who go far beyond answering the question of illegal amnesty and choose to carry that issue into the nightmare racism prevalent in the south in the first half of this century.
Stick to your guns, folks. Maintain your morals and your standards; feel free to speak out about amnesty for illegal immigrants....but be careful who you ally yourself with...there are hating White Supremacists out there for whom no measure of human redemption is possible if your skin is brown or black.
The other day I was driving home from some errands and thought of another topic for my blog. The ache in my recurring back problem reminded me that I'm getting old, which then set me off once again upon contemplation about why I keep stirring up trouble with my social and political crusading.
At that moment I thought about what my family and friends might say about me once I'm gone. Will the summary judgment of my life be a "toss off" "oh, that was Dearel, that was Dad, that was my husband; a hard ass to the very end!" That saddened me beyond all reason. But, when I asked myself if I could or would think or live my life any different I find it nearly impossible to imagine.
If I could just "mellow out", go with the flow, allow social and political events to just, right or wrong, unfold as they will, my life would be so much more comfortable and my psyche far more at rest. Well, I can't.
My problem is I think too much. There are those readers who have accused me of being "reactionary", responding to some event as if it offended me personally. While the former is false, the latter is certainly true. I don't believe I'm a reactionary because the term itself indicates one who reacts without thought, with an emotion not appropriate to the science of logic. That's just not true; I spend far too much time thinking on something before I write or speak about it. I think those closest to me will tell you that I'm a huge "contemplate your navel" kind of fella; I can be my own worst critic because I'm always undergoing these nearly epidemic sized bouts of self assessment.
So, today I've reached the grand old age of 66, heart and soul in constant turmoil, still swinging the ever present rusty sword at windmills near and far. I can recall a time when I considered the sum of 66 years to be one of decrepit uselessness, a time for sitting in rocking chairs, making sure I eat my fiber, rinse my dentures out each night before depositing them in the bedside water glass and waiting for the grim reaper to come.
And here I am; still have the vast majority of my teeth, the bowels working as well as a fella half my age, alert and leaning forward in my office chair, and as hungry for knowledge as when I was a freshman in college. If the grim reaper comes I'll give the bastard the fight of his life before I'll let him take me before I'm ready.
If there are any uncertainties they are those whom everyone chooses to chew on occasionally; the question of my mortality....why am I here, why am I STILL here when someone seemingly far more deserving has passed. Has my creator tasked me to accomplish some still unrealized goal He has set before me? That question becomes more relevant when I consider the miraculous cure from lung cancer.
Or perhaps there is some simpler lesson I am to learn....is He giving me more time to reform my soul? Am I to suddenly transform myself and march down and unselfishly serve chicken soup each night in a homeless shelter? Shall I join the Peace Corp and teach a remote African tribe the perils of drinking dirty water? Is there one more person I need to meet?
I have no answers to any of those questions. And if God wants me to change my ways he's going to have to be far more direct because he instilled in me the ambition to write, assigned me a modest ability to do so....and so I write about the things that matter most to me. If he wants me to write about something else he's going to have to give me a hint...cause I'm quickly running out of time.
So, here I am, 66 years old today...and without a damn good excuse to sit in a rocker and do nothing. I'm still a gladiator, ready to step out into the arena and face the lions. I might need a leg brace..or later a cane, but the will to fight still lives within me....and I guess I'll be no different until the grim reaper comes and I'm finally too damn weak to fight him off.
Let these thoughts be a celebration of my birthday....or serve as my own eulogy....they are as honest an assessment I can offer of myself so either one is perfectly okay with me.
A few weeks ago I wrote about my growing yen to once again hit the open roads and do a little more exploring of our beautiful country. I've been scouring Craig's List and RV Trader for a used RV that fit my price range; something that was relatively small, easily drivable and reasonable on gas. I'm still mourning my sale of my last one; a 96 Winnebago Rialta that would get us where we wanted to go, give us a place to cook a meal and a place to lay our head at night in some Walmart overnight parking lot, and do so with something like 15 miles per gallon. My wife and I have been planning a trip to the East coast to go see our two daughters and we travel with our dogs so the RV is the best solution for us.
With gas prices being what they are, and because their production was limited to ten years, those little Rialtas are hard to come by, and when they are available they are selling for more than my budget allows.
So I've been pursuing lesser choices. Took a look at the Toyota truck based campers, renown for their room coach space, but also for their tendency to easily be overloaded. So I joined a Yahoo Group to learn more about these little RV's, did a lot of research, then focused my attention on trying to find one.
So last week I come across an ad for a 91 unit in Los Angeles. The pics looked terrific and seemed to be just what I was looking for. I called the gentleman who owned it and asked all the right questions and was moving toward making an offer, when I asked if he owned clear title to the vehicle. He said he had the title that had been signed over by the last owner but had not registered the vehicle in California because of registration fees. That was the first red flag, the second being the long, long essay he wrote about how great the unit was...except he had only "owned" the unit for a few days. When I pressed him he was unwilling to get the title registered in his name so I wrote this one off.
The next Toy Camper I found sounded too good to be true. The owner crowed in his Craig's list ad that the unit was in pristine "like new" condition, asserted that the unit was a 95 model, and that they were the original owners. Since the vehicle was over in Mesa I called and made an appointment to see the unit on Saturday morning. So I show up promptly, drive up behind the camper and can immediately see the exterior paint is oxidized, the decals are worn, and wear is evident on the exterior seams. Cracked and broken lens caps and a badly applied job of calking the front overhang window added further concern. When the owner comes out we fire up the camper and do a test drive. Not too bad but I notice the gas tank is nearly empty. When we return I ask to hear the generator run. After several efforts to start it (bad coach starting battery), I finally tell him to start the vehicle and use the vehicle power to start the generator...it finally kicks in and runs weakly. I then go into the camper and try to turn on the roof top coach AC and there is none. The furnace grill is lying in the middle of the floor, the fridge door won't close and the appliances seem old and worn.
When I ask to check the coach battery he doesn't have the keys to the compartment and is unwilling to go into the house to get them. When I ask for the VIN number and ask if he has a problem with me running a car fax to confirm original ownership and mileage he says okay...and that his wife just ran one last night. I ask for it and he goes into the house for about one minute, says he can't find it, and doesn't want to awaken his wife at 10AM to find out where she put it.
By this time he has stopped spewing his unending declarations about how pristine the vehicle is and begins physically withdrawing from me. So I leave and when I get home I run a car fax and find out that the vehicle is a 94 model (not 95...they didn't even make a 95 model) and that the vehicle was not "original owner" but the playtoy of four owners, in Arizona and Missouri.
So this guy was trying to sell a 1994 toy camper for $15,500 (I thought I could negotiate down to $12k or so) that was not "pristine", was not even serviceable as is, and was outright lying about ownership history.
Not easily discouraged, I have now endured four different buying experiences nearly as bad as this one; questionable and temporary ownership, misrepresenting the condition of the vehicle, or way overpriced. I even ran a car fax by license plate number on a Toyota camper and found the tags belonged to a Hyundai sedan!
So these days I'm longing to place a call and find an elderly gentleman on the other end of the line. I'm longing to hear him say they've owned the vehicle for a decent interval, that they enjoyed their years of RVing and are now hanging it up and are willing to part with "Old reliable Bessie" for a reasonable price. Instead I get mush mouth "ho-hums" and vehicle bragadaccio that rings untrue.
So I'm still looking for a Class B or a small Class C RV that fits my price, is reasonably reliable and will get me from point A to point B without leaving me stranded in the middle of the Texas panhandle.
Sadly I'm finding far more pot holes on the "buying trail" than any I ever ran into in all my years of travel. If any of you folks know of an "honest John Doe" that has an RV for sale, drop me a line!
Try to imagine the government, whether local, state, or federal, having to come in and close your business because you refused to honor your commitment and offer the specific services that you proposed to carry out when you opened your business.
Well, that seems to be what American educators are offering our kids, even as we pour hundreds of billions into the school system and they are turning out illiterates whose only employment option is to flip burgers, bag groceries and sweep floors...and demand a $15 dollar per hour "living wage" to do so.
Why, America, are you not upset about a massive failure of the school system to deliver on their main business?
I was just reading this morning that the University of Nevada, Los Vegas has had their football program placed on sanctions for the failure of their football players to meet minimum academic standards. Folks, do you know what those standards are?....A 2.0 (C) average! And keep in mind, these big galoots traditionally major in physical education with a boat load of basket weaving and pottery class electives! And they can't score a "C" average!
Oh, it's not all dark for UNLV...they can still play all the games on their football schedule...they just can't play for a championship or a bowl game next year. And, sadly, it took the NCAA to impose these sanctions cause UNLV thought everything was hunky dory even if their quarterback can't read basic road signs or the little talk balloons in the daily comics!
As you know I read a lot on the internet, especially political sites, always mining for blog fodder to feed you readers. One thing I've noted in the last few years is the dearth of cohesive writing on posts from site commenters. I'm starting to believe that soon, very soon, we're going to have abbreviated texting code cause so few seem able to compose the written word...and when they do, they can't spell worth a damn.
I don't know about other states, but Arizona does tend to close a few schools that fail to educate our kids. Each and every time they do so there are scores of teachers and Obamanites who march in the streets and cry foul. We need to close far more.
Folks, if I told you that we are spending $602 billion dollars a year in state and federal dollars just for k-12 education wouldn't you consider that a fair amount to expect a quality education for our kids? If I told you that we spend over $13, 500 a year, the largest per student expenditure in the world, wouldn't you expect something back for that kind of dough? http://www.edreform.com/2012/04/k-12-facts/. Well we're clearly not getting it.
Post Script: The Chicago Tribune is reporting that three Black school districts are crying foul that the City has chosen to close three city schools that have been on probation for as long as fourteen years with no improvement in student performance...of course they cried "racism" in spite of the fact that the city school superintendent is Black...a cry of "racism" seems to be their biggest defense mechanism. Oh! Not a word said about 75% Black families without a daddy at home, about parental failure to enforce homework, etc. And the teachers unions are bravely defending even their worst teachers.
Good morning dear readers. Well, we awake this morning, here in the the world's declining superpower, and learn that the world's strongest leader, Vladimir Putin has threatened to shut the gas off to Europe's 18 national Gasprom customers!
It goes like this: The Ukraine, in something of a national turmoil these days (something about a Russian invasion on the eastern state of Crimea), seems unable to pay their gas bills. So Vladimir Putin, chief customer support officer for Gasprom (and a big shareholder) has sent a letter to the 18 European nations, who rely on Gasprom to heat their steamed snails and weinerschnitzel, telling them that if they don't fork over money to pay the Ukraine's past due gas bills, he'll spin the spigot clockwise and cut off European gas supplies.
This "dunning letter" left European leaders stunned; after all their bills are paid up, so what does Ukraine's deadbeat ways have to do with them? Well, Vladimir, being the cunning fella he is, knows damn well someone from the West will spring for the Ukraine's gas bill because, in the entire G-7 there's not a complete set of testicles among them...and they know better than to look to Washington cause the fella occupying the White House never experienced the masculine joy of having his testicles descend and become a man.
Oh, the "man-child" at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will surely trot out to the Rose Garden and rattle some tin sabers; he'll announce that he just got off the phone with American Express and they've agreed to cancel Putin's "Black Card"...that'll surely teach him a thing or two. And let's not forget that Barack has been on the phone to Peking Bank of China to borrow $4.5 billion dollars for emergency foreign aid to the Ukraine and that should cover their Gasprom's bill for a few months. After all, we just learned a few weeks ago that the Ukraine has a direct deposit account with Gasprom and Mr. Putin gets a big cut of that as the "collection agency".
The peril of course is that China may tell Barack that he's over extended his account. We currently owe China $2.3 trillion dollars so Peking might tell Barack to look elsewhere. Should that happen both the Ukraine and those 18 European states could be in for a world of pain. Frenchman would be forced to eat their snails raw, Germans would be forced to eat their weiners cold and the United Kingdom would be gagging on cold kidney pie.
Thanks to American oil companies and pioneering oil fracking we do not face that same fate here, though god knows Obama and his Secretary of Energy have tried their best to achieve $7 dollar gasoline and destroy the American coal industry. But you can bet our European partners will not be too happy with Barack if they have to eat cold vittles for long. They might even repossess his Nobel Peace Prize!
Though I'm not much of an Obama fan I will, for the sake of those poor snail eaters, throw him one bone: Hey Barack, since you seem impotent in the face of strong leadership, no matter who wields it, why don't you try this on the Russians....round up a couple of dozen of those hip-hop and rap artists that you adore so much, then get their permission to broadcast that stuff on the Voice of America streaming into Russia 24-7....Putin just might open the gas pumps and let if flow again!
I'm having a hell of a time trying to puzzle out this week's Bureau of Land Management-Militia skirmish up in Nevada. There seem to be no good guys in this. Rancher Cliven Bundy had not paid his cattle grazing fees on public land since 1993, as some 16,000 other ranchers comply with. I've pored through news reports from both the left and right and found that the BLM had tried to affect a settlement with Bundy before finally taking him to court and winning the decision. So it seemed the feds were in the right to take some course of action to bring this problem to resolution.
The story becomes a little more complicated as another report suggested Dirty Harry Reid, reaper of millions accrued by using his legislative authority to enact federal law favorable to his pals, had another pal ready to enrich both he and his son for evicting Bundy's cattle on at least part of that BLM land so that it could be used for commercial purposes. I have not seen enough information to confirm that but, knowing Dirty Harry's past ways, it is certainly in keeping with his modus operandi (google how Harry became a multi-millionaire by accepting real estate in return for favored legislation).
The BLM, using gestapo tactics certainly didn't help the situation up in Nevada. Reports of the initial skirmishes indicate government feds were violent, threatening and intimidating, contributing mightily to the escalation of tempers.
I guess what I don't understand is why the militia types chose this particular incident to draw a line in the sand against government bullying. Just days before Americans will write some $2.5 trillion in IRS tax payments why the hell aren't Americans assembling by the tens of thousands to protest massive government waste, fraud and abuse? Why aren't thousands of Americans lining up and driving a wedge right through those illegal Mexican street marchers demanding citizenship? Why aren't Americans by the thousands standing outside their local hospital and burning their Obamacare premiums in protest of the massive government intervention into our personal lives?
Most folks don't know that the Boston Massacre was really brought about by a crowd of rock-throwing youths who forced the Redcoats to fire on the crowd in a desperate effort to defend themselves. Will this Bundy incident prove to be similar in its disassociating from what is really bugging Americans about their government? Is this the first skirmish in the 2nd Civil War which I predicted two years ago? Will tempers flare even higher when a force of Homeland Security goons gun down a mob of unruly Americans?
Obama's mainstream "Pravda", his own propaganda arm, will surely group this little government "beef" with the Tea Party...simply another group of wild eyed radicals that refuse to accept Obamacare, illegal Mexicans and rising taxes. Perhaps they'll succeed in branding these militia types as random clowns that the great Obama has to deal with. It remains to be seen if this little skirmish was simply a chance to blow off a little steam at an oppressive government or if it is the first sign of fever for an America that has grown tired of government bullying.
I was just reading this morning's Republic Food Section and realized belatedly that my mom was a health food cook long before it was cool. The articles this morning talked about the importance of fiber and the need to avoid pre-packaged and processed foods.
Well my mom offered plenty of fiber, and if she ever cooked something out of a box I can't remember what it was. Even her cakes and pies were made from scratch...that was easy because we couldn't afford processed foods or cake mixes or ready made pies.
Fiber? Here's a frequent menu at our house. Oatmeal or Cream of Wheat for breakfast. A big pot of pinto or navy beans for dinner, and if we were lucky, a hambone she lied about at the butcher, supposedly meant for "the dog" but more frequently in a pot of beans. Pan fried, baked, or boiled potatoes, fresh cole slaw and a big golden pan of whole grain cornbread. All made from scratch with nary a box in sight. Hell, we ate enough fiber around our place to put a real "run" on toilet time each morning and, keep in mind, this was before Beano was invented so we could all stink up the place pretty good on bean gases.
We did not eat much meat, because we couldn't afford much meat, so we were certainly in keeping with nutritional guidelines prevalent today. Meat, as with the ham bone, was meant just to add some flavor to the meal, not served as the main course.
Mom made her own sauerkraut in big jars out in the garage and let them ferment nicely; then they would be served up with hot dogs or sausages. We did have the occasional spaghetti dinner, and when we were flush, we would have meat loaf.
Mom was also good at buying the cheapest grades of beef and slow cooking it until it was tender, then adding lot of fresh vegetables; onions, potatoes, carrots, celery and peas...and it was delicious.
Oh, I'm sure the food lords would frown on a platter of fried spam, or a crispy plate of salt pork, but, again, they were just enough to heap extra flavor on the fresh veggies and legumes we were raised on.
For dessert we got our fruit in various forms of cobblers. Whatever was cheap and in season was made into golden delicious cobblers, hot out of the oven..and, in lieu of whipped cream, we topped it off with condensed milk. Apple, peach, or berry, I still salivate at one of mom's wonderful fruit cobblers.
So..who knew? My mom was a pioneer in health food cooking! We all thought her meals were wonderful and I don't think it went unappreciated by mom either. She used to relate stories of what they ate during the great depression and we would all get a bit squeamish at the idea of rabbit, squirrel and even deep fried sparrow on their depression era dinner table!
I'll forego the wild game but my all time favorite meal consists of pinto beans, fried potatoes, cole slaw, a couple of strips of crispy salt pork, a hunk of cornbread, and washed down by a tall glass of iced tea. Ahh, health food!
I've reported on many occasions the massive fail of the VA Hospital. I've recounted the government's abandonment of caring for millions of veterans when they began means testing to qualify for care in the mid 1990's, I reported on the scores of deaths attributed to negligence at the Pittsburgh VA Hospital. A couple of years ago we learned of patient negligence and abuse of veterans here in Arizona. Then, just this week we learned that the VA is probably responsible for the deaths of at least 40 veterans because of VA delays in treating them. A retired VA doctor reported a long history of abuse and falsified records to an Inspector General Investigative Panel last year...yet no one was fired, and the deaths continue. Seems the VA was keeping two sets of books falsifying medical care that was never provided.
Most Americans will never hear of these ills. Instead we heard Obama and McCain laud the example of the VA Health Program as clear evidence of how effective government provided health care can be. Pure fiction.
Both state and government officials are scrambling to mitigate citizen criticism. The Congressional Panel on VA oversight was in Phoenix to investigate. The governor is planning to hold a press conference and voice her shock at this tragedy. And yet, all over this nation, veterans are getting the short end of the stick, even as millions of welfare folks, who never served a day, enjoy good medical and dental care, with lots of political oversight.
A veteran was found laying face down on a cement patio, having fallen out of his wheel chair while left unattended. When someone finally came around to check he was experiencing a high fever and second degree burns on his face and arms.
A VA patient was given meals that he couldn't chew because he had no dentures. The hospital ignored requests for meals that the patient could eat.
Brian Houston, whose wife, Deborah, called the Tucson veterans facility her home from the summer of 2013 until February, questions the state's ability to adequately operate another home.
He claimed, among other things, that staff banged his wife's head and knee into a wall while moving her on Christmas Day, left feces in the shower for days, were slow to respond to requests for oxygen, and provided care that resulted in bedsores.
He said his wife was discharged after his repeated complaints to staff, administrators and public officials.
"Thank You For Your Service...Now Please Die"...because the government just doesn't have the time or money to care for you.

Finland A consortium formed by YIT and Are and Länsimetro Oy have signed an agreement on the construction of the Kaitaa station on the West Metro line in Espoo. The value of the contract is approximately EUR 47 million, whereof YIT’s share is approximately EUR 33 million.
The contract includes constructing the Kaitaa metro station, a service tunnel with connecting tunnels, an underground air-raid shelter as well as the Kaitaantie entrance, the Iivisniemi technical shaft and a reservation for the Iivisniemenkallio entrance, where a technical shaft will be built first. The construction will begin in September 2018 and is scheduled for completion in May 2022. The project is booked in YIT’s order backlog in the third quarter of 2018.
YIT is the biggest single constructor of the West Metro. For Phase 1 of the West Metro, YIT has built the Aalto University, Tapiola, Niittykumpu and Matinkylä stations as well as done excavation work for tunnels and stations in Ruoholahti, Lauttasaari, Koivusaari, Keilaniemi, Otaniemi, Urheilupuisto, Niittykumpu and Matinkylä. For Phase 2, YIT has done excavation and enforcement work for the Finnoo metro station and is currently constructing the Soukka metro station, scheduled for completion in February 2022.
”Our professional personnel, strong experience in rock construction and good co-operation with Are have contributed to the result we were hoping for in the competitive tendering for the West Metro. We are extremely happy for that in the second phase of the West Metro, we will be able to construct the Kaitaa station as a project management contract, in addition to the Soukka station. The collaborative way of working and close co-operation with the client form an excellent basis for a successful project,” comments Anne Piiparinen, Senior Vice President of Industrial and structural engineering of YIT’s Infrastructure projects segment.

Water features are an essential part of your landscaping. Whether you have a fish pond or a stunning, cascading waterfall feature enhancing your curb appeal, it’s important to preserve this feature when the weather gets a little cooler during the fall and winter seasons.
Small water features often include structures such as a fountain or bird bath. While you may assume that these features only require minimal care, you’re partially right. Small water features may take up less space, but you still need to drain the water and cover the fountains and bird baths. It’s recommended that you clean the feature thoroughly to remove any mold or water spots. Water features with pumps, though, do require more careful planning. If the Georgia weather is expected to dip below freezing, make sure your pumps are submerged in water. Store a lightweight, small water feature in a dry area, such as a garage, shed, or indoor basement.
While you may love to admire the fish or plants occupying your large water features, when fall and winter roll around, it’s necessary to winterize the features. Begin the process by weeding and cleaning plants within the large water feature. As the weather cools and the temperature drops below 55 degrees, stop feeding any fish within the water feature. Tropical plants should be stored in watertight buckets to avoid damage.
If you have fish living in your water features, invest in a bubbler so the water maintains proper oxygenation. When the Georgia weather gets colder, you may also want to add a floating de-icer to the large water feather to further protect the fish.
Maintain the beauty and prime condition of your water features with the help of the experts at North Georgia Lawn Care. Contact us today at 678-508-0050.
Cumbrian baker to judge at inaugural Tiptree World Bread Awards USA - North West Food and Drink Means Business
Multi-award winning baker Aidan Monks, of Lovingly Artisan, who operates from Kendal and Manchester, travelled to New York at the weekend, to judge in the inaugural US edition of the Tiptree World Bread Awards.
Monks joined a panel of over 30 esteemed judges, gathering at the Dumbo Loft, Brooklyn, on 23rd October, for the awards in association with Food is GREAT, supported by the American Bakers Association. The judging panel includes the likes of Lauren Dickerson, the British Vice-Consul, for Food and Drink based in New York and acclaimed award American bakers Zachary Golper and Peiwen Lee.
Once the judges make their decisions the US category winners of the Tiptree World Bread Awards with Food is GREAT, will be announced and each winner, chosen from hundreds of entries in the 13 awards categories, will receive a bespoke trophy and will then be invited to attend a lavish gala evening being held in New York.
Monks owner of Lovingly Artisan commented: ‘’Having been inspired to become a baker when studying in Boston I know how creative the American artisan baking industry is, especially as they have been at the forefront of baking innovation for years.
“In my time since my US studies I’ve won numerous awards, including a raft of World Bread Awards, so I can really appreciate what these bakers are putting themselves through in crafting their very best breads for the judging process.
“So it’s no surprise that I’m really looking forward to seeing what my American counterparts are capable of crafting and as a result, I will be digging a little deeper than most into their understanding of the processes involved in creating nourishing, tasty breads, full of flavour and character.’’
Monks added: ‘’I firmly hope that the inaugural US edition of the Tiptree World Bread Awards with Food is GREAT becomes a focal point for the whole baking industry and provides the opportunity to celebrate both the individuals and the businesses who are at the cutting edge of the USA’s artisan bakery scene.’’
The judges will meet again to announce the overall winner at a gala evening at the Landmark on the Park, Manhattan, on Wednesday 14th November, with industry experts, members of the press and leading figures from the world of food and drink amongst the guests.

Valentine’s Day is such a weird and contrived holiday. Even though I feel like a cop-out acknowledging and celebrating such a day I still do it. Valentine’s Day, along with Mother’s Day, Father’s day, Thanksgiving, Christmas and birthdays, are all holidays that have become socially acceptable. Even if we don’t subscribe to the meaning behind the holiday, they have become a part of our culture. Growing up, I never celebrated Christmas because I was raised in a Jewish household. Every year, even though I was with my loved ones, I felt left out. I think part of the reason why I celebrate all these other holidays, aside from societal pressure, is that it makes me feel included.
Holidays have good intentions (for the most part) but we have become such a varied society that it is impossible to include everyone in every holiday.
TURBOTVILLE — to claim desires were complicated to return by using within the Loyalsock-Warrior Run ladies soccer rivraly is an underestimation.
“There have been no desires apart from penalty kicks scored in over 380 minutes of play between these two groups in the closing two years.” Loyalsock train Ben comfort referred to earlier than the begin of the Heartland Athletic conference Division III matchup between his Agen bola Lancers and Warrior Run on Tuesday afternoon in Turbotville.
That streak ultimately came to an end as Loyalsock netted two desires within the 2nd half to down the Defenders 2-0.
“We observed it final nighttime and at halftime.” consolation talked about. “We didn’t come to play for a tie or a loss.”
Lancers’ sophomore, Juliana Cruz, took a superbly placed circulate from teammate, Jenna Gardner and shot upper-corner a ways put up just over the palms of Warrior Run intention keeper —Madi Welliver — to buy the lead in the 2d half.
5 minutes into the video game, Loyalsock’s Gardner shot element blank at the Defenders’ purpose but Welliver made a tough save appear convenient. just a few minutes later, Warrior Run junior Emma Burrows bought a pair of respectable appears but missed just vast left and over the atrocious bar.
Defenders’ junior Megan Zimmerman then took a flow interior the field along with her again to the goal and in heavy site visitors. Zimmerman grew to become appropriate, pulled the ball lower back to her right foot and launched a rocket only to be stopped via Lancers’ keeper, Grace Schreckengast.
“Grace Schreckengast and Madi Welliver are both highest quality feminine keepers in this enviornment.” comfort stated after which paused. “they are the two superior keepers, boys or girls in the area.”
now not most effective did comfort and Warrior Run teach Jen Allen get amazing performances from their intention tenders, but they directed the defenses that restricted the number of pictures taken.
With 6:28 remaining in the online game, Lancers’ junior Rhiallie Jessell put the online game out of attain when senior Georgia Solley fed her the ball and Jessell beat Welliver to the some distance publish.
“It put the icing on the cake.” Jessell spoke of. “I appeared up and there have been two girls at the near put up. I called for the ball and put it some distance post.”
“each groups had their chances in the first half.” comfort noted. “We just didn’t purchase talents of them. We came out in the second half in a unique formation. It became to are attempting to get Gaby Heiss to come back out of the again a bit more and it labored. We played that means for one other five to six minutes then dropped lower back into a greater defensive formation. When Rhiallie scored the 2nd intention, that closes down the online game.”

Well, the Mandarin intensive at UVA started yesterday. Small class (6 students). That’s good. For me though, the setting is a little weird.
This is my third summer language intensive. I took my second year of Hindi in an intensive summer program at Madison, WI. I took my 4th year of Sanskrit in an intensive summer program in Pune, India. Now I’m taking my first year of Mandarin in an intensive summer program at UVA. For the first two programs, I had to temporarily live away. In Madison, I shared a room with a student from Korea (who was studying something else than Hindi… I don’t remember what). In Pune I shared a flat with an American student who was also in the Sanskrit program. But UVA is where I’m doing my Ph.D. So for the length of the program, I’m just using the same old efficiency I was using during the past academic year. My lodging is the same. The university is the same. In the other programs, I was away from my wife for the whole duration of the program but during this program the isolation will be broken by weekend visits. Somehow, without having to live in a different city, it does not feel like a summer intensive. It’s not like I’m not doing all the work. I’m practicing my pinyin and my Chinese characters to death. There’s just some other intangible element missing.
Then there’s something more tangible missing: my friend Llerena. We took our first year of Hindi together and then went into the summer program together. After that, life took us into different directions. One day during the Hindi intensive, our entire class was walking together. I don’t quite remember what we were doing but what I remember however was that I was mumbling to Llerena that our path was not optimized. Of course, I meant optimized for speed towards our final destination. Instead of taking a direct but more boring route, we took the scenic route which meandered by the lake shore. Llerena just laughed at me and asked, grosso modo: What about how pleasant the walk is? Doesn’t that count? She insightfully pointed out how my obsession with optimizing for speed was flawed: optimizing for speed would have meant sacrificing other, more pleasant, aspects of our walk.
I’ve gotten word from Karen Lang that she and Paul Groner rated my Buddhism comprehensive exam with an “enthusiastic pass”. (Those exams are not graded with letters: either you pass or you fail.) Yay!

Cavalier Computers sells it for $1349. Sony sells the same thing for ($1399-$100 = ) $1299. Why should I buy from Cavalier Computers? Every time I compare their prices with other stores, I find that they sell higher. The upshot of all this is that far from being a student-friendly shop, Cavalier Computers is taking advantage of its position to extract a premium from the students’ pockets.
The Rolling Stones came to C’ville last Thursday to perform at UVA’s Scott stadium. The parking spaces normally available to faculty, staff and students were taken up by people coming from out of town for the show. Departments closed earlier than normal. Classes were cancelled due to the disruption.
Funny thing. When I applied to UVA, I thought I was applying to an institution dedicated to education, not entertainment. Now, the bright minds that organized the Rolling Stones show would probably claim that the fees charged by UVA to hold the event bring more money to the school, etc. Whether the event made money remains to be determined. Moreover, I would think there are some guidelines that determine what kind of fund raising is acceptable. Otherwise, why not sell “study drugs” to students? Or beer? Anyway, I would suggest that one rule be added (which evidently is currently missing) prohibiting events that are in any way disruptive to the normal daily pursuit of the academic mission of the school.
With the way the Rolling Stones show was handled and the recent calendrical flop, I must say I’m not impressed with UVA’s upper management.
I must say the UVA campus is the most pleasant one I’ve seen so far. Penn was nice but it suffers from being crushed by the weight of the city. UVA is open, wide and feels much more relaxed than Penn. UW-Madison’s campus didn’t have the charm of older campuses. The Université de Montréal’s campus (where the École Polytechnique de Montréal was located when I was studying there) is unremarkable. (Ditto for UQAM.)
It seems to me Cavalier Computers is taking advantage of its position within the UVA community. Look at the BEFW11S4 (the Linksys wireless router) here. They sell it for $89. At MWave, the same device sells for $50.96. That’s a $40 dollar difference (yes, I’m rounding up). Also, at the time I’m composing this post (Aug 21st 2005), Linksys has a mail in rebate offer of $30, which MWave announces very clearly. On Cavalier Computers’ site, there is no indication of such rebate. So a student going to Cavalier Computers would pay $89 dollars, whereas one going to MWave would, after rebate, pay about $20. Yes, there is a shipping cost involved with buying at MWave but that would be in the $5-10 range. (I’m assuming the student lives near UVA and thus does not need shipping when buying from Cavalier Computers.)
Looking quickly at other wireless devices, I see the same pattern: Cavalier Computers’ prices are almost twice that of MWave. (Heck, Cavalier Computers is even pricier than Staples and Amazon, places *not* recognized for offering the best prices.) I will mention that when I looked at the price of Windows XP Home Edition, Cavalier Computers’ price was about the same as the others. (MWave was not carrying it at the time I checked.)

I’m back from Hawai’i (not pronounced “How-are-ya”), after six days of blissful, rainless paradise. Well, the blissful part is true, anyway, or just about… it rained most of the time there, but we had plenty to do despite mother nature.
I think I am going to have to break down and get a flickr account and start posting pictures there because we took way too many and I am also not so sure about the pictures script I wrote and have been using on another system lately… I have some concerns about it.
Thursday: Arrived in Honolulu, hopped in the taxi to The Hilton Hawaiian Village. Checked in, got upgraded to an ocean view room on the top floor of the Rainbow Tower. Relaxed a few, and then made our way down Kalia Road to walk into downtown Waikiki. Lots of uppity shops down there. Prada, Gucci, etc. Earlier in the day, the guy at the concierge desk headed us towards the International Market Place — an obvious tourist trap for tchotchke, it didn’t excite me too much… a lot of those booths are the same things over and over again.
Anyway, while as we made our way there, the sky opened up and it completely poured down in spurts. During relatively dry moments, we made our way back down the street… ate a quick spot of noodle at one of the many Japanese noodle shacks along the way. We ate at Ichiban Ramen [S-something]” near the intersection of Kalakaua and Saratoga. We figured that eight bucks for a big bowl of noodles plus dumplings wasn’t too bad, considering the cost of most restaurants in Honolulu.
As we left the noodle place, the sky opened up again, which meant we waited around for it to settle before hurrying back to the hotel. Got back, had a drink or two at the Shell Bar on the resort, a sorta indoor/outdoor joint, when the sky once again tore open and unleashed quite heavy rains and wind. We decided, at that point, to go back to the room. An interesting note — there was lots of thunder and lightning that night. Apparently such is a rarity in Honolulu, even during heavy rains.
Friday: Was an amazingly terrific day. Rented an umbrella and lounge chairs for a spot on the beach — kinda got suckered into that, as I didn’t realise it was something one paid extra for — and stayed there most of the afternoon to make sure we got our money’s ($50!!) worth. Planned parts of the rest of our stay. Ate Hawaiian buffet at the Rainbow Lanai downstairs… wasn’t really worth it, but I had a 2-for-1 coupon for it, amongst the others, so we went. We had the same sort of food later at a quasi-luau (read on), and it was better there.
They featured an end of week hawaiian celebration/show downstairs by the pool, and they charged $12 for premium seating, i.e., poolside seating. Not figuring it was worth it — as we could see clearly from the path, and look down upon it from our balcony, we kind of just poked around… before the rain started — again.
I am running out of expressions to describe how hard and quickly the rains fell. I have seen some serious raingusts in my time, but this was textbook tropical rain. It was literally coming down sideways. We thought the rain meant no fireworks to end the show — and indeed, the show ended pretty abruptly — but half an hour later we heard loud explosions and went out to the balcony to see a short, but very fierce, fireworks display right out our window.
Saturday: Hiked up Diamond Head, which made for a nice, although quite slick, excursion. The previous night’s rain made the trail quite slippery. It was kind of overcast that day too, which made the scenery okay, but not breathtaking. Afterwards, we (accidentally) went to the Sea Life Park which was kind of campy but had impressive sea life displays. We meant to go to the Aquarium, but figured this would be a reasonably good substitute. Plus, we got a scenic tour of the south-eastern coastline. Pretty tired, we headed back to the hotel. Stopped into the on-site noodle shop for a quick bite, and later on had dinner at Golden Dragon downstairs, another 2-fer. It wasn’t too bad at all. No Sichuan, but not bad for Hong Kong style Chinese food.
Sunday: Got up quite early in the morning to head over for the requisite Pearl Harbor trip. Rainy again, of course. We were in group #2 to go through, which means 150 people were ahead of us in line at around 7:00 AM. Came back, stopped into the pizza joint on-site, and pretty much lounged around for the rest of the day before having dinner at the other, more formal Japanese restaurant on the resort.
Monday: Practically all of Monday was spent out at, or getting to/from, the Polynesian Cultural Center. This was expensive, but well-worth the money. We got the basic Luau package which was more than adequate with regards to food. If you go there, here’s a hint or two:
* Be sure to catch the Samoan village exhibit, the guy who works that one — at least, the one who was there when we watched — is hilarious, yet the whole bit is quite educational.
* The Latter-Day Saints influence on the place is negligible, but certainly perceptible. Between the multiple references to “90% of the staff being Brigham Young Hawaii” students, and the lack of caffeinated soda during the luau, it becomes pretty obvious. I mean, come on, I can understand no beer or mai tais, but no regular coffee or Diet Coke?
In any case, it was a fantastic day, it’s a great excursion. The food was good — although not what I would call a real Luau in the sense of what one might expect from Hawai’i — and the exhibits are hardly as cheesy as one might expect. Finally, the requisite dancing/hula/fire show at the end of the night was terrific.
Somehow, even though the forecast for Honolulu, at least, said a 100% chance of rain, there was none on the northern tip of the island, where we were. Amazing, it was a beautiful day.
Tuesday: What can I say — rain again! We went downtown to see the Iolani Palace, and came back to take the Atlantis Submarine tour. The rain put a… ahem, damper, on both a little bit, but they were still good… the underwater tour was pretty cool although, in my opinion, you spend as much time seeing not a lot on your side of the ship while the other side gets to see the main attraction for each stop. Maybe it was just the conditions of the water that day.
We ate dinner at the Kobe Japanese steakhouse around the corner, opting for it over the Benihana due to our coupon. It tasted pretty good, but seemed to be an awfully uninspired show. Or maybe i’ve just been to too many Japanese steakhouses.
Wednesday: Not much here. Checked out, went to the International Market Place to get some souvenir shopping done, stopped into the Ichiban Ramen place one more time for a quick bite to eat, and then headed over to the Hilton Grand Vacations place to do their 90 minute tour. It’s kind of like a timesharing thing, but you can use your time anywhere versus just one location, even though you might be deeded at one place. I wasn’t really too interested, but couldn’t resist 30,000 HHonors points as a gift for listening to their spiel. Actually, after seeing the thing, it doesn’t sound like too bad of a programme, but we were in a hurry to catch our taxi, so that was our excuse to get outta there before they tried to sell us on the package any more than they already had.
The rest of the day, and night, and most of the next day when you take into account the timezones, was spent flying back, with a three hour layover at CVG (yuk). Overall, the trip was great, despite all the rain, and we were wishing it wasn’t time to come back home. We mixed enough touristy stuff with out-of-the way stuff that I didn’t feel like a full-on moron. I didn’t get my Hawai’ian shirt because I couldn’t find one that I liked — or at least, not the pattern I liked in my size. If I had to choose a regret, that would be it, but even that’s only a tiny little thing, and most of that is due to my own pickiness.
I should note, at the risk of sounding like a sales pitch, the coupon book we bought at Entertainment.com saved us a metric buttload of money on stuff we probably would’ve used and places we probably would’ve visited anyway. A lot of two-fers at restaurants, $36 off at the PCC and 25% off on the Atlantis sub… made those expensive Hawai’ian dinners a little more reasonable and other activities a bit less pocket intensive. Highly recommended. I got this tip from someone’s posting over at Tripadvisor, and I have to agree, it made a lot of sense, even having not used 98% of the coupons.
Stupidity is writing a letter to credit bureau(s), disputing issues with certain accounts found on your credit record, presumably because your information got leaked out somewhere…
…only to leave a copy of this letter, with the account numbers partially XXXX’ed out, but containing your full name and SSN in the hotel computer’s recycling bin.
I fly from Raleigh to Detroit every week. The only direct flight is NWA. I recently received a letter in the mail, addressed to “Silver Elite” members. As I just got my SE, I was assuming it was my new FF card or something… and then I read it. It was advance warning about the possible strikes.
I am kind of torn on the whole union thing, and I probably don’t fall along the lines that many on the left. I totally empathise with those looking for better treatment in their respective industries… but I dunno. Working in Detroit, I can’t help but feel that, between my air travel, and the auto industry there, labour unions and industries have a serious disconnect, and I can’t blame it all on the industry giants themselves…
Sometimes I wonder if labour unions have outlived their usefulness, and I am sure that is bordering on heresy to some on the left. I can understand the purposes of unionisation, back in the day. We are all familiar with The Jungle, and we all know about child labour that occurred early on, etc. Unions, then, were useful and perhaps more legitimate.
However, today… I honestly have a hard time being as sympathetic, although if someone can convince me, I am open to it.
Is there someone who can tell me what baggage handlers make? This article says that some start at $8.75/h, and some were, until recently, as high as $20.
Overall, I am estimating $15/h. 15*40*52 is 31k a year, which isn’t mad coin, but hell, inflation hasn’t been that bad in recent years, and this isn’t far from where I was six years ago getting into IT.
…and despite the sometimes long hours I have worked in the past, and am working right now, I have no desire to see IT labour unionisation.
I have an open mind to these things, and am more than willing to listen to union defenders, but I need some tried and true facts, not just the propaganda I see — and it is, what with the bumper stickers and cheesy slogans — on the union billboard on-site.
Just based on my observations, I am currently struggling with having a lot of sympathy with unions much of the time. Maybe someone can change my mind.
Did a bit of biking today. I have really been enjoying my bike outings lately. I have been riding the Wake County portion of the American Tobacco Trail as of late, but since Chatham County is being lazy in getting their section complete… (in)convenienthly smack in the middle between Wake and Durham counties, it is getting boring riding the same stretch over and over again.
Thus, today, I got on the road, went about 2 miles down to the Log Pond portion of the Carolina Connection trail, which is also encompassed by US Bike Route 1. Rode that for a while and then looped back onto the ATT and rode home from there… probably did between 15 and 20 miles today, so I’m pretty pleased.
It’s always the first 2 miles or so of hills that get me, then I am fine. I would like to eventually be able to bike the Cape Fear Run, which heads into Wilmington. 140 miles or so… I’ll get there eventually.
Anyway, a large portion of my trip encompassed pieces of New Hill, NC, which is currently embroiled in a battle with schoolyard bully Cary, over the latter’s desires to build a waste treatment plant within the town limits. I lost count of how many Stop Cary signs I saw, and saw many other more amusing ones. Two notables:
A toilet sitting out near the road with a stuffed bulldog on top of it, accompanying a sign which read something to the effect of, “If you won’t take ours, we won’t take yours”
A sign sitting outside an old, vacant gas station (when was the last time you saw gas for $1.37/1.47?) that read, “Save New Hill, don’t “Waste” It!”
In any case, it was a good ride, and even kind of thought provoking. Next time I may try riding down the ATT, connect onto Log Pond and ride into Moncure, NC. I am sure there will be some interesting stories to learn there, too.
Most of us know this. In fact, it never crossed my mind that people might not know how to pronounce “placard”. However, nearly every time I get on my NWA flight, and hear the spiel about it being “federal regulations to obey all posted signs and placards” it’s like fingernails on a chalkboard to me.
It’s always “Plah-CARDS” or “Plah…CARDS”. They always put the emphasis on “cards”, and half the time, the flight attendant has this quarter-second pause between the two syllables.
It’s such a little thing to be concerned about, but when you hear it twice a week for twenty weeks, it gets to be a bit annoying.
Because it is so often mispronounced, I am guessing that’s how it’s pronounced in NWA’s training videos.
The four biggest U.S. airlines — American, United, Delta and Northwest — raised most airfares Wednesday, citing record-high fuel prices. United raised fares 3% across the board, Northwest raised domestic fares 3%, and American and Delta raised fares $5 each way.
I’m already well-aware of the costs of my plane tickets, and now I’m sure I’ll know even more about it.

Here are a few of the better, or more interesting, pictures we took while in Curaçao. As always, you can click on the images for larger versions.
Actually these two were taken en route from Miami. I am not actually sure what island it is, although I am guessing it is Haiti/Dominican Republic, unless we somehow flew over Cuba.
I won a t-shirt during a karaoke session on our trip to Curaçao. I won “best act”, but it’s a bit diluted when you consider that only six acts performed, and every person or group got a prize — even if there was a tie for “worst performance”, no kidding.
Anyway, I started the night off with the only Dylan song on the list, “Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door”, and I sang it true to form. Reflecting upon this, however, I don’t think the DJ dude had heard the real version, because he kept ad-libbing the GnR-esque “yeah yeah yeah” parts in. Meanwhile, I finished the song, and got off stage, not taking that reflection into much consideration.
Well, I decided I wanted to get up there again, but there wasn’t really much in there that interested me. I decided on doing Bob Marley’s “No Woman, No Cry”. I gave someone the book, who took it over to enter the CD code, but came back a few minutes later.
Anyway, I sat there and flipped through the book several times before finally deciding on “Back in the USSR“. Rest assured it wasn’t performed as Dylan would’ve done it.
Good thing they weren’t having any technical difficulties with that disc, though. My next choice was going to be “Baby Got Back”.
Good Luck, Independence Air… glad to see everything seemed to go without a hitch today! You’re gonna face a lot of challenges in coming months — mostly from large, troubled airlines who would rather squeeze you out of business than change their business model from an age-old, consistently failing, government bailout model. Regardless, I’ve got high hopes, and wish you the best.
Returned from Toronto last night, barely escaping, it seems, the 10cm of snow/ice they were expecting to start yesterday afternoon. All in all, it was nice up there – probably about 50-55ºF until the day I left, where it dipped to freezing.
We saw two movies… Cold Mountain, which was pretty good, and Love, Actually which wasn’t bad.. er… actually. The former film was quite nice, but I don’t want to talk a lot about it, should people decide they want to catch it. I did not at all realise that Natalie Portman was the one who played “Sara”, however, didn’t even notice that at all until I read it in an article after getting home.
The latter movie was pretty good for about two-thirds of the film, until it boiled down into the expected sappy mess, but the overall british-ness about it was terrific. The guy who plays “Tim” in The Office is in this film, and just about every scene containing him is quite funny, albeit for a very pointed reason. I wish we could’ve seen more of him in the film. Finally, while most of this movie’s plot took place in Britain, the target of the film was very obviously an American one, based on the numerous references to a “Merry”, rather than a “Happy” Christmas.
Food was terrific.. we did Chinese Hot Pot over New Years at the house of some of her family, and I always love that. We also went out to a fancy, shmancy Chinese restaurant near Richmond Hill or something, which came out to about $300 CDN for a few dishes that fed the entire family of 13 people or so. It wasn’t bad — and who am I to judge, considering it’s a fave of a bunch of my future Chinese relatives — but with the exception of a few of the dishes, I feel I’ve had better.
We took the mandatory trip or two to Harvey’s, which is probably one of my favourite fast food places anymore… wish we had them down here. We also went to what is quickly becoming my favourite eatery in Toronto, The Korean Grill House. Been there twice now, the first time being shortly after it opened sometime mid-2003. Tell you what, I like Malibu Grill and all, down here, when I want my meat fix, but for $12.95 CDN for all-you-can-eat, Korean Grill knocks the pants off of Malibu… and tastes a lot better, too.
Finally, we also ate a a little Mexican place whose name escapes me, but which was quite tasty, and quite conveniently located — right near my fiance’s apartment. She may complain about her “shabby little home”, but I think she’s in a prime location, if you ask me. Right across the street from a little strip of restaurants and shops which kind of have that (Virginia) Richmond-esque, “Strawberry Street” feel to them, albeit quite a bit more ethnically diverse.
I didn’t post it here because I was too lazy to make special “friends” groups, and thus couldn’t post it in any way shape or form, without giving away the secret…
Friday morning, I left from Reagan National Airport to Toronto. Why’d I head up there? Because it was chinchin‘s birthday today (Sunday), and I wanted to give her the best birthday gift and weekend ever.
In any case, I arrived in Toronto pretty darn early — I got to the airport very much ahead of schedule, and thus got to leave two flights early. Arrived, navigated my way west-to-east across the city on an amalgam of transportation modes: bus, train, foot, to my hotel room.
From there, I got my stuff ready — but here it was, around 1.30, and she wouldn’t be off work till much later! So I hoofed it around the city… it’s amazing how clear all the sites were in my memory, and how easy it was to find my way from my hotel on Ryerson and Queen, to the intersection of College and Yonge, based solely on visual cues that correlated with mental notes.
Roamed around. Stopped into a cigar shop, a few drug stores, and into a Pizza Pizza and had… a stuffed burger (ha ha, fooled you!).
Had a few coffees throughout the day, each time correlating with different Second Cup stops, and each involving a phone call with her, taling about the boring “meetings” etc., which were my excuse as to why I wasn’t online on a work day ;).
Rain poured down Friday afternoon, so I dodged heavy pockets of rain, using carefully timed hops across the streets when traffic lights permitted. Made it to her apt., the same apt. where her cousin lives. The same apt. where they were going to get together for a “girls’ night out”. However, she was the only one in the family that didn’t know I was arriving.
Needless to say, the rest of the weekend was fun. Saturday involved a trip with the family out to a sichuan hot pot restaurant, which, after the beijing trip, is by far one of my favourite Chinese dishes these days. Headed back to DC today, after dealing with some intense security checkpoints in Toronto.
I have a lot of stuff to post about the Beijing Experience, but I’m not sure how to arrange it exactly. I guess I should transfer the journal stuff here, and then make a photo journal on my website, with captions, etc. I dunno. I am too tired to think about the details.
I really should learn how to mount my cam as a USB device on the linux box. That would sufficiently motivate me to fix all the pictures.
I need some western food. Loved every bit of the food in China — well, almost every bit — but I have a sweet pork hangover, now. I do know, however, that there’s a new pizza place nearby, that’s open till 4.00 AM on the weekends…

February 21, 2018 Financial Markets, Housing Market, Market Manipulation, U.S. Economyexisting home sales, home prices, Housing bubble, market crash, mortgage ratesadmin
A colleague of mine pointed out that Trump has not been tweeting his flatulence about the economy recently. This thankful hiatus is after he just passed a tax cuts and a spending budget that is supposed to be stimulative. As it turns out, the economy is hitting the headwinds of marginally higher interest rates and a consumer that is bulging from the eyeballs with debt. Windfall tax rebates to large corporations will not fix this nor will rampant Government deficit spending.
This leads us to the housing market. Mortgage originations were down 5.6% in Q4 from Q3. This is not a result of seasonal bias. Q4 mortgage originations in 2017 were down 26.7% from Q4 2016. One caveat is that the Fed does not breakout the numbers between purchase mortgages and refinancing. But higher rates are starting to affect all mortgage applications. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage purchase applications dropped 6% two weeks in the row. Declines in purchase apps should not happen moving from January to February, as February is statistically a seasonally stronger month for home sales than January.
Moreover, existing home sales for January were released this morning. To the extent that we can trust the National Association or Realtor’s Seasonally Adjusted Annualized Rate statistical Cuisinart, existing home sales plunged 3.2% in January from December and nearly 5% from January 2018. Decembers headline report was revised lower. I’m sure the King of Spin, Larry Yun, will blame it on “low inventory.” But this is simply not true:
If Yun’s thesis were true, the chart above would be inverted. Instead, going back to j1998, there is a definitive inverse correlation between inventory and home sales. Curiously, when attempted to run the numbers to the present, I discovered that the Fed removed the data series I had used to create the chart in in 2015. Mere coincidence, I’m sure…
The mortgage rate for a 30-yr fixed rate conventional mortgage at Wells Fargo, the country’s second largest mortgage originator, is now 4.5% with an APR of 4.58%. As recently as September, the rate for a 30yr mortgage was 3.87%. At current rates, the monthly payment for a home purchase with a $400,000 mortgage has increased $187. It may not sound like much, but for many first-time buyers that small jump in monthly payment can mean the difference between buying and not buying.
Since the Fed began printing money and the Government knocked the down payment requirement to 3% on a Government-backed mortgage, homebuyers have based the amount they are willing to pay for a home on determining the highest possible monthly payment the mortgage underwriter will allow. In the example above, the monthly payment on a $400k mortgage at 3.78% is $1,857. At 4.58%, the same payment only “buys” a $363,000 mortgage. This is nearly a 10% decline.
The same math applies to flippers/investment buyers, who pay an even higher rate for an investment purchase. One of the SSJ subscribers is a real estate professional here in Denver. She emailed to tell me that, “it doesn’t take much for interest rates to change Investors ideas.” She has a client who wants to buy an investment home for around $350000. Since investor rate loans are at least a quarter of a point higher than an owner-occupied mortgage, the client’s purchase with 20% down goes up $161 a month from the from the recent jump in mortgage rates. This means he now needs the rent to go up by that much to work on the purchase-decision formula he is using.” I believe that a lot of flippers are going to be stuck with homes they can’t re-sell at the price they paid.
The average price the average-income homebuyer can afford has declined nearly 10% as a result of just a 75 basis point rise in mortgage rates. What happens when rates go up another 50-75 basis points? This fact has not been reflected in the home price data that is released every month from Case-Shiller and from the Government. This is because those surveys have a 3-6 month lag built into the methodology of calculating their respective home price indices.
As it becomes obvious that the price the average potential homebuyer can pay has been reduced from $400k to $363k, it will trigger a price decline cycle similar to 2007-2009. Flippers will be the first to fold just like during the mid-2000’s housing bubble. That housing market crash was triggered by the collapse of subprime lenders, which removed a key source of funding used by flipper and for end-user home purchases from flippers. This time around it will be triggered by a lack of buyers who are able to pay the same price now that they could have paid in September when rates were 80 basis points lower. Soon rates will be 180 basis points higher than in September and home values will be crushed.
Let’s not forget that the new tax law has provisions where there is less tax incentive to buy, eg, only so much property and income tax is deducible and anyway, the std deduction is now 24k for a couple.
Good point, naturally that little factoid gets conveniently left out of the narrative – why bother with facts?
“The Dallas Fed expects that U.S. GDP will grow at approximately 2.5 to ‎2.75 percent in 2018. We believe that consumer spending will be strong, owing to a healthy jobs market and the multiyear improvement in household balance sheets.”
“Since the Great Recession, the household sector in the U.S. has substantially deleveraged. The financial health of the household sector is crucial because the consumer comprises approximately 70 percent of GDP.”
“Broken down, consumer credit rose by $11.2 billion in revolving credit, or credit card debt, which pushed it a record $1.023 trillion, the highest credit card amount outstanding on record. This was also the second highest monthly increase in credit card debt on record.”
It’s well known that the US consumer savings rate is back down to 2008 levels and debt is being used for “getting by”. Household deleveraging? Is this guy serious? Of course not. Colorado is a microcosm of the overall U.S. economy, where Fed-inflated housing is crippling the economy (again). This doesn’t even address high inflation in healthcare, higher ed., etc. The consumer is tapped out for this cycle. Debt is not wealth creation.
“Lack of affordable housing is a top concern for Coloradans. A household must make $21.97 to afford rent and utilities in Colorado, but the average renter wage is only $17.13. Nearly half of all Colorado renters are cost burdened, with an additional 24 percent severely cost burdened….”
“No wonder that “when we talked to people in different parts of the state, housing tended to be at the top of their list,”
The U.S. is experiencing huge asset inflation in most every asset class, but esp. housing and stock and bond markets. The Fed has created “The Everything Bubble”. This will not end well. There’s no escape from the economic effects of even slightly higher interest rates in a highly leveraged economy. Even small interest rate increases are amplified by high debt levels and have a proportionately large impact on the economy. The Fed knows this, but is trying to prepare for the next downturn which they know is coming withing a year or less. They’re so behind the curve (again). Let someone else clean up their mess (read taxpayer).
The Fed inflated housing bubble 2.0 using mostly the same methods as in 1.0. Now prices have reached a limit for traditional buyers just as the unconventional buyers are disappearing (read speculators, foreign buyers, flippers, etc.) because they know the game is over and prices have plateaued, or even started moving lower. Add to this rising rates, which effectively reduce price (people buy the monthly payment, not the house). Market meet air pocket.
People know they can get away with just saying something in social media or on the internet and it becomes the gospel.

Besides the Colosseum, the one thing I was looking forward to the most on our trip to Rome was getting to explore inside the Vatican Museums. The Vatican Museums, along with the Louvre in Paris, have been on my to-see list for almost two decades now. Due to an unfortunate stroke of bad luck, we missed getting to go inside the Louvre on our trip to Paris, so I wasn’t about to let the same happen in Rome. The first morning after we arrived in the city, we woke up bright and early and were standing in the queue to enter the museums over half an hour before the doors even opened. And I’m certainly glad we were because I’ve never seen crowds in a museum like those inside the Vatican Museums!
Displaying over 20,000 works of art collected by several popes over the past few centuries, the Vatican Museums are made up of several different museums, galleries, and rooms, each featuring vast collections of world-renowned paintings and sculptures. There’s so much to see, it’s easy to get overwhelmed, but don’t let that deter you from visiting. Even though you won’t be able to see everything on a single visit, if you plan it right and give yourself enough time, you’ll still be able to see quite a bit. The key is to determine ahead of time the things you absolutely must see inside the Vatican Museums, and then make sure to work those particular pieces or places into the path you take through the museums. (Don’t worry, there are free maps at the entrance to help you navigate the maze of galleries!)
So, what are the must-sees at the Vatican Museums? Naturally, the answer to that question will vary depending on who you ask – what I consider to be the top things to see inside the Vatican Museums may be different than yours. I’m more of a sculpture girl, myself, but you might think the only things worth seeing are paintings by the masters of the Renaissance. (In which case, you’ll appreciate the Raphael Rooms far more than I did!) That being said, I believe there are several highlights within the Vatican Museums that no one should miss (ahem, Sistine Chapel) and you’ll find these below, along with a few of my personal favorites!
The Gallery of Maps is one of the most visually stunning rooms within the Vatican Museums. Stretching down a long hallway, it’ll be a contest to see what grabs your attention first – the highly decorative ceiling or the 40 geographical frescoes depicting Italy and its provinces lining the walls. Take your time as you walk through here to check out the detail in these maps painted from drawings by Ignazio Danti, a famous geographer in the 16th century.
The Museo Chiaramonti is named after Pope Pius VII who founded the gallery in the early 19th century. Containing over 1,000 ancient sculptures, the Museo Chiaramonti is important not only because of the striking portrait busts and statues you’ll find here, but also because this gallery represents many of these sculptures’ return home. Having been seized by Napoleon and taken to France in the late 1700’s, it wasn’t until several decades later that these pieces were recovered and brought back to be displayed in this gallery. Be sure to check out the New Wing (Braccio Nuovo) before leaving this area, too.
Also known as the Pinecone Courtyard, the Cortile della Pigna gets its name from the gigantic bronze pinecone that sits at one end of the square. The thing I find most interesting about the Pinecone Courtyard, however, is not the pinecone so much as the unusual gold sphere found opposite it known as Sfera con Sfera, or Sphere within a Sphere. Looking slightly out of place surrounded by its much older counterparts, Sfera con Sfera is actually just one piece of a series by Arnaldo Pomodoro found in many locations around the world. (We were lucky enough to find another at Trinity College in Dublin!) Representing the fragility and complexity of the world, you won’t want to miss this one!
Located in the Museo Pio-Clementino, the Octagonal Courtyard is a beautiful open-air space featuring several of the museum’s most famous sculptures. One of my favorites here is Laocoön, a sculpture dating all the way back to 40 BC depicting Laocoön and his sons being killed by sea serpents during the Trojan War, an event which ultimately led to the founding of Rome. Another, the Apollo Belvedere, is famous for representing what the Romans once considered to be the perfect male form. While not quite as notable as the others, the elegant statue of the River God, once part of a fountain dating back to the times of Emperor Hadrian, is also worth a look.
Also located in the Museo Pio-Clementino is the Sala Rotonda, or Round Hall. Designed with the Pantheon in mind, the Sala Rotonda makes quite an impression from top to bottom. While certainly smaller in size, you won’t be able to miss the similarities in the ceiling of the Sala Rotunda and the Pantheon (e.g., the round oculus in the center and the square notches surrounding it), but there are differences, too, like the addition of the small rosettes that give the Sala Rotonda’s ceiling a much more delicate look. The floor in this room is made up of colorful ancient mosaics originally laid in the town of Otricoli back in the 3rd century. (How things like this survive so long amazes me!)
Another highlight of the Vatican Museums modeled after something else, the museum’s legendary spiral staircase is actually designed after another staircase inside the museum that is no longer open to the public, the Bramante Staircase. You’ll find the newer spiral staircase, designed by Giuseppe Momo, near the main exit. This staircase, like the original, is a double spiral staircase made up of two staircases shaped like a double helix allowing people to ascend without meeting people descending. If you’re visiting the Vatican Museums on your own, you’ll likely exit this way, but if you’re part of a tour, you might have to make a side trip to check it out!
The Hall of the Chariot is a gallery that probably interests me more than it will the average museum visitor, but if you’re in the Museo Pio-Clementino anyway, you might as well drop by and check it out. Featuring statues and other sculptures depicting scenes from athletic games and competitions, this room of the museum is a fun departure from the usual busts and statues you’ll find throughout the Vatican Museums. The two-horse chariot in the center of the room is the most noteworthy piece in here, but you’ll also find a copy of the famous Discobolus out on display.
So named because the popes once used this area as private residences, today the Papal Apartments are where you’ll find a large collection of rooms featuring some of the most famous frescoes in the Vatican Museums. The most well-known of these rooms are the Raphael Rooms, four separate rooms collectively known as Stanze di Raffaello and painted by Raphael and his school in the early 1500’s. The most famous piece here is the School of Athens, found in the Room of Segnatura. While I thought the frescoes in the Raphael Rooms were incredible, my favorite room in the Papal Apartments was actually the Room of the Immaculate Conception (pictured above) painted by Francis Podesti, which probably proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that I know nothing about art.
Isn’t it funny how the places we build to hold our works of art, often end up becoming one themselves? Walking through the Vatican Museums is a lot like walking through one gigantic 460,000 square foot masterpiece. As you’re making your way through the many rooms and galleries, don’t forget to look past the pieces displayed and see everything that surrounds them. You never know when you might be walking on a floor that was once a part of an ancient villa in central Italy! And definitely don’t forget to look up. The ceilings throughout the Vatican Museums are magnificent, which leads nicely into the absolute most important thing to see inside the Vatican Museums…
The Sistine Chapel hardly needs an introduction, but just in case you’re not aware, the Sistine Chapel is where you’ll find one of the most famous works of art in the entire world – nine scenes from the book of Genesis painted onto the ceiling by none other than Michelangelo himself. The most iconic of these scenes is the Creation of Adam, but they all work together to create a pièce de résistance that you’re probably going to need some time to completely appreciate. The walls also contain some pretty impressive paintings, including The Last Judgement by Michelangelo, so make use of the benches along the chapel walls and take your time. This room stays busy, but there’s no limit on how long you can stay.
Speaking of that, besides buying your tickets online and being in the queue to enter before opening time, my only other piece of advice for visiting the Vatican Museums is simply not to rush. A visit to the Vatican Museums will be infinitely more enjoyable if you aren’t racing through to reach the Sistine Chapel so you can head to the next stop on your Rome itinerary. Guided tours are available, and while I personally didn’t feel it was necessary to take one, there are some that start before the museum opens to regular visitors, so it might be worth it simply to avoid the crowds! Entrance tickets can be purchased directly from the museum here. For more information about guided tours, please visit the website below.
From the point of view of modern production methods, the Milk Production Line is usually divided into three steps: milk collection (completed on the farm), milk delivery (on the way), and milk processing (at the processing plant).
The collection process includes milking equipment (manual or automatic, small hand-cranked milking machines, whether the pipeline is a milking system or a more advanced robotic milking machine), a milking parlour (fishbone shape, large turntable, etc.). ), milking temporary tank, need cooling system, filtration is necessary, milking when milking, preparation before milking, washing after milking.
The emulsion tank is a triaxial stirrer for stable homogeneous emulsification and produces very small particles. The quality of the emulsification depends on how the particles are dispersed during the preparation stage. The smaller the particles, the weaker the tendency of surface aggregation and therefore less likely to be destroyed by emulsification. By means of reversed blade mixing, high quality emulsion mixing results are obtained under uniform turbine and vacuum conditions.
The milk sterilization tank is made of stainless steel, the tank thickness is 3 mm, the pasteurization milk sterilization time can be controlled; the sterilization temperature also has an automatic temperature control device. The milk can has three layers, the innermost is the milk layer, the middle is the germicidal layer, and the outermost is the insulation layer. The water is heated and the sterilization effect is better. The stirring device above the milk tank can evenly heat the milk. Made from authentic milk, it tastes good and has high nutritional value.
Milk processing equipment is widely used to determine the original formula of fresh milk, yogurt, goat milk, camel milk, juice, milk drinks and condiments. The small pasteurizer completely simulates the production state of an industrial pasteurizer, integrating heating, sterilization, emulsification and cooling. The equipment can be equipped with small aseptic fillers, glass bottles and compound bag filling machines as needed. This series of equipment is more suitable for use in Mini Dairy Plant.

Although the title makes it seem otherwise, the Nurses Overtime & Patient Safety Act (“the Act”) has nothing to do with overtime wages and everything to do with the safety and quality care of patients as well as the health and general well-being of hospital health care workers. The requirements of the Act restrict covered hospitals from requiring nurses involved in direct patient care to work more than sixteen hours within a twenty-four hour period and to provide at least eight full hours of time off after a nurse completes a shift of twelve or more hours. The provisions of the Act do not apply when a nurse volunteers to work the additional hours, when such decision is not a result of coercion from the hospital, or during an unforeseen emergency situation. Hospitals are also prohibited from taking action against any nurse that refuses to work more hours than are permitted. Those hospitals in which the nurses are covered by a collective bargaining agreement addressing these same issues as well as those hospitals operated by a state or federal agency are not covered. The Act also specifically exempts nurse anesthetists, even when such work is performed in a covered hospital. Nurses providing direct patient care in a patient’s residence, in an assisted living residence or a nursing home are also not covered.
I’m back from my annual trip to Puerto Vallarta. We rented the same condo we’ve had for the past several years, and this time, we tended to stay in our immediate neighborhood and chill, rather than do a lot of trekking around. That’s not to say we didn’t get out to explore some new places, they just happened to be mostly within walking distance.
On our first night, though, we visited an old favorite, Restaurante Rio Grande. With plans to return later in the week for their world class Pescado Sarandeado, we opted for some lighter fare. The Chow Poodle ordered fish tacos and, based on my previous good experience with their Sopa de Mariscos, I ordered a seafood casserole.
Nice fresh fish - expertly fried . The Chow Poodle enjoyed them very much. Not earth shattering, but decent, and probably not the reason you’re dining at Rio Grande in any event.
This casserole, ordered Ajillo style (guajillo pepper, mushrooms and garlic) was fantastic. Fresh as a daisy octopus, shrimp, mussels and clams in a nice garlic butter sauce with rice and veg to mix in. This would be a good dish to order alongside a large Pescado Sarandeado for sharing.
We never made it back for that fish I was talking about. Instead, we came across Jorge’s Hideaway Shrimp Shack on a dead end street a couple of blocks from our condo.
Jorge’s has been open for a little over a year and the extended family that runs the place couldn’t be nicer. Jorge’s Camarones a la Diabla was the single best bite of the entire trip. So good, in fact, that instead of returning to Rio Grande for that fish I talked about earlier, we returned to Jorge’s for a second helping.
These shrimp are stir fried with slivered almonds in oil that includes a healthy dose of salsa mulata, which is the Chinese Chile Oil-style salsa which is somewhat common in the area. For reference, it’s served in Chicago at Los Gallos #2 for use with their Carne en su Jugo; but I digress. This dish is 100% Mexican, yet it seems to almost be an Asian/Mexican fusion dish. Served with slightly spicy green rice, this is one fine plate of food. This should not be missed by any heat-loving visitor to Puerto Vallarta. If you’re like me, you’ll ask for some extra salsa mulata on the side (both here as well as at Rio Grande, where an excellent version is on offer).
Another winning dish, though much more straight forward in its complexity, was a special of coconut shrimp. The shrimp were breaded (and green-coconutted) to order. They were tasty, but even the Chow Poodle preferred the shrimp diabla. The rest of the menu at Jorge’s is a mixed bag of grilled seafood and some dishes with sweet sauces, cheese and other accouterments. Order carefully. There’s some great stuff to be had at Jorge’s, but it looks to me like there may be some land mines on the menu to watch out for.
* I apologize for the pictures of the food at Jorge’s. The restaurant is literally a shack and the lighting, what there is of it, is provided by bare CFL light bulbs; each one a different color (yellow, green, red, etc.).
Sergio Mucino hails from Huixquilucan near Mexico City. According to Sergio, thanks to urban sprawl Huixquilucan “used to be a small town, now it’s more or less a suburb.” He hails from an area not as famous for its moles as Oaxaca, nonetheless, he opened his restaurant in order to honor his Mother, Jovita (and her mother and those that came before), by sharing his family’s mole recipes with the world.
Both The Chow Poodle and I chose dishes made with the original family recipe mole, which closely resembles a traditional Mole Negro. I had seafood chile rellenos and the Poodle had enchiladas de pollo. Both were very good and were a nice change of pace.
While I wouldn’t call this destination dining, especially since we have such excellent examples of mole here in Chicago, it’s Sergio’s dedication to detail and his sincere "in It for the love of the game" attitude that won me over. There aren't very many places in PV serving good mole, and if the mood strikes, it’s well worth a visit. I just can’t help but want to see him succeed, so I hope a few people who follow this thread will pay him a visit.
For Thanksgiving dinner this year, we returned to Coco’s Kitchen, located just steps from our condo.
We had been to Coco’s for Thanksgiving a couple years ago and really liked it. This time, they stepped up their game in the kitchen even more. I felt like I was attending Thanksgiving Dinner at Aunt Bertha’s house in rural Iowa. At one point, I even asked our waiter if he had a Gringo Abuela in the kitchen cooking up the dinner.
My request for all dark meat was accommodated with no problem. This meal was prepared masterfully. I couldn’t have done any better myself. My hat’s off to the staff at Coco’s, cooking a cuisine that is not in their normal repertoire. A special shout out for the green beans, which were cooked with white onion and celery in a preparation that has once again made a Thanksgiving green bean eater out of me.
So, one morning I was walking down the street over by the cathedral and I saw this unsavory character beckoning to me from a doorway.
She wanted me to enter what could only be described as a hole in the wall of a place called Sandy’s for breakfast. Sandy’s is an establishment that is slightly smaller than my family room. One side of the room is curtained off as a service area with the back corner acting as the “kitchen”.
Juice and breakfast is their game, and they move a lot of it, mostly as to go orders. Probably 97% of their business comes from locals. The restaurant itself has only three or four tables, and we were lucky enough to snag the one next to the stove. I ordered chilaquiles and the Chow Poodle ordered chorizo & eggs.
Both dishes were good solid renditions, as would be expected from a place such as Sandy’s. Dirt cheap, too.
Besides restaurants, we also did some shopping at local markets, though I didn’t really cook very much. If I were there on a longer stay, I certainly would do some serious cooking, but with only a week to spend (and Thanksgiving a part of it), there just wasn’t time to stock a kitchen and go for it. Here are a few random shots, though.
And these from the great U.S./Canadian Ex-pat market held every Saturday at the Paradise Community Center.
Fantastic post, stevez. Jorge's is find, and if we're ever back in PV, we'll seek it. Pix also superb (except for Jorge's, and I'm glad you explained why they weren't up to your usual standards; they were actually a little scary on first blush). Fine stuff, amigo.
Love the sign behind the menorah in the shot of the Jewish stall--"samples and guilt free". That whole market looked like a lot of fun!
"Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit; wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad." Miles Kington
I always look forward to your annual PV report Steve and this one is just as terrific as usual. Always great to see some new finds, delicious looking food and great pics and write-up. Thanks for sharing!

Yes. That market is pretty cool. There's much more than what I showed. There's also a 2nd market on Saturdays that's much more traditional and more of what you would expect from a Mexican farmers market.
Excellent post steve. I think you single handedly inspired our routine trips down to PV. Though.. I have to ask, where's your report back on the Tacon de marlin? Don't tell me you didn't do your LTH research, or worse yet, you ate it but it wasn't worth posting on?
Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.

Never made it to Tacon de Marlin. We spent the whole trip on the south side of town. The farthest north we went was Rio Grande. Next time for sure!
On a cold, wintery day, this just brought a little warmth to my morning. I always look forward to your finds so that I can put them on my list. We are regulars at the market and the liver pate from Mama's is a must since I don't bother to make it myself down in PV. This is my last year that we will only be able to spend February in PV. Next year, Feb. and March since I will be retired. Yeah!! Hopefully, sometime you guys will come during one of those months and we can share a meal or two together. From what you've written, you stay right down the beach from us. I'll try to post pictures if I ever figure out how to do that!
After taking a year off we felt the need to head back to Puerto Vallarta for another holiday week. Although there was rain the 1st few days, which is unheard of this time of year, the town was beautiful and the eating good. The fireworks on New Years Eve were the best ever.
Old favorites that were still on top of their game were La Leche, for their eclectic modern Mexican cuisine, Rio Grande, El Arrayan, and Tacon de Marlin. You can see my earlier posts on these places. New places we tried were an enjoyable breakfast at Coco’s Kitchen, a good lunch at Coco Tropical, the delicious takeout chicken at El Pechugon, and Jorge’s, which had a fabulous poblano soup but other dishes were bland. We also did a day trip to Sayulita, which was very crowded, and had a decent lunch on the beach at Don Pedro’s. The setting was better than the food.
"I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day." Frank Sinatra
After a 3 year layoff from Cafe Des Artiste because of some weak cooking, we tried it again and had a spectacular meal. Starting with the special passion fruit martini topped with coconut foam, continuing with a puff pastry and tamale duo of escargots poblano garlic, herb butter, and creamy bean sauce, confit of suckling pig and broiled bay scallop taco, duck duo in tamarind sauce with guava and arbol chili, and marinated broiled octopus with spinach and mushroom gratin, bean cream, and creamy huitlacoche. This was very sophiticated cooking and all good. Service was polished and professional. Chef Thierry is on top of his game and it's the place to go for a big city, expensive dinner. Bonus-we finally were able to eat in the garden, which is awesome.
Rio Grande is our go to place for great seafood at moderate prices and they are still solid. They have the best snapper sarandeado, but don't miss the crab enchiladas and seafood casserole. We always try to find something new every year and after being on my short list we finally made it to Red Cabbage and loved it. It's traditional Mexican cuisine serving things like chicken with mole negro, huitlacoche quesadillas, peanut soup, chili relleno, carnitas in salsa verde, cochinita pibil, and pork shank with salsa chili ancho. It was all good and this will be another yearly go to restaurant.
I highly recommend taking a Vallarta Food Tour. They offer 3 tours-a downtown tour, a Pitillal food tour, and an evening taco crawl. We did the downtown tour which lasted about 3 hours and included 8 stops with something to eat or drink at each one, including several tacos, ceviche, tortilla soup, enchiladas with mole verdi and mole negro, etc. Alex was our wonderful guide and was very knowledgable, spoke great English, and provided much fascinating history and background of PV and it's cooking and food preparation. Plan a late dinner that night as you will be stuffed after the tour.
As mentioned in my previous post Vallarta Food Tours offers different options including a Pitillal food tour. A list of the tour stops is mentioned on the website and we decided to cab it over and try to replicate it one afternoon. Pittallal was probably a former town but became encompassed by Puerto Vallarta. It's east of Costco but a world away, like stopping into a small town anywhere in Mexico. There are very few gringos. Several of the places on the tour are only open at night but exclusively to the tour during the day. Others we just couldn't find as they were nameless. We didn't starve. We found a little hole in the wall place just off the town square called Carnitas El Pitillal serving great birria tacos, gorditas queso, and hibiscus tea. Marisco's Tinos was the original Tino's and we had great sarandeado-much better than Tino's on the Malecon. My guess is the original Tino's left this a number of years ago.
A stop on our original food tour that we returned to and will now be a go to place for lunch was Mariscos El Guero just south of the Rio Caule. It's a small family owned joint and has the best ceviche I've had in PV. They also had great smoked marlin which you can have in a taco or burrito. Tacon de Marlin was good but this is better. We also enjoyed their seafood cocktails and fried shrimp tacos.
Los Muertos is the 1st brewpub in PV, located a block from El Guero, and has some pretty good craft beers. Didn't eat anything as the menu is Americanized pub food(which doesn't mean it's bad).
Vista Grill is unusual in that it has a spectacular view but also good contemporary Mexican food. We enjoyed things like Guajillo Octopus, Pork Tenderloin with requeson, pine nuts, almonds, eggplant cake, and red mole and hibiscus sauce, and a smoked duck magret with heirlook tomato puree, pumpkin seeds, almonds, sauteed salicornia, and tomatoes with herbs and tomato and arugula. Our last dinner was El Arryan, as extraordinary as ever.
Just returned from our 19th annual 2-week stint in PV... and another year of excellent eating. We go down with various family, family friends, cousins, etc. so our overall group is about 30+ coming and going at various times, and dinners are sometimes large groups of 12-15 or more ranging in age from 1 to 70:
River Cafe - first time back in a decade after a couple bad experiences (mostly on service side). Food was good -- I had a tamarind duck dish-- and our waiter was excellent handling a group of 17, and even entertained the 2 year old quite well. Probably has worked its way back into rotation.
Las Adelitas - Very casual place walking distance from our timeshare, known for ribs and Tex-Mex fare. Formerly owned by former owner of No Name Cafe, it has slipped a little in terms of food quality and service since it was apparently sold within last year.
Red Cabbage - Still one of our very favorites year after year because of their excellent chile en nogada, moles and tortilla soup.
Si Senor - Every year, it seems like we have one bad meal... this was it. Service was HORRIFIC, as in waiter spilled/broke entire glass of red wine on my dad and then didn't even bother to help clean it up! We had to use everybody at the table's napkins and the table cloth from one of the tables pushed together for our group to clean up. Only when somebody got up and specifically asked another waiter for help did they bring anything to help clean up. Also, then they at first protested replacing his margarita that had visible hunks of glass sticking out of it, took 20 min. to bring replacement drink for him and the red wine drinker, and another 10 more to bring the remaining drinks for those of us who hadn't yet received ours. Food was OK, but nothing special and a couple had to send food back because it was room temp when served. Did they bother to take anything off the bill, or offer pay for cleaning clothes, etc? NOPE!
New Year's Eve - we always have a couple of the maids from our timeshare complex cook a Mexican feast. Low keep and fun, but to be honest my tastes in Mexican food have grown and the menu/quality has not. But they make a big spread of guac/salsa, mahi mahi in garlic, chicken in a red tomato-based sauce, beef in a mole, chile relleno, cheese enchiladas, Mexican rice, refried beans.
Barcelona Tapas - another annual stop, but this year it was just my wife and me so we couldn't dig as deep into the menu as when we've gone with groups. Bacon wrapped dates, grilled calamari, garlic shrimp, baked goat cheese, beef skewers same as they always are.
El Arrayan - after two incredible meals here with just my wife the past couple years, we finally convinced my parents to return after a disappointing meal 7-8 years ago. They loved it! The pozole and cevices are all excellent, as are their braised meat dishes -- went with the cocinita pibil this year after enjoying the lamb barbacoa last time. Also, my wife and dad raved about a shrimp with peanut mole dish.
Maia - We're good friends with the chef, who stayed with my parents when he staged at Carlos a decade or more ago. At the time, he was a meat chef at Cafe des Artistes and worked his way up to executive chef. Opened his own place about a year ago, focusing on locally sourced ingredients and more rustic recipes. Food was good, but in both visits (this year and last) I expected even better things given his work at Cafe. I had a cream of shrimp soup that was quite good, but the lamb "molognese" was just OK. My wife had a surf and turf special that was good, but she got the last one (this also seems to be a recurring theme here, where they run out even earlish)
Sunday brunch at Hacienda San Angel - Amazing bruch spread with made to order omelets and crepes (thought no fresh figs this year!), carved prime rib, sushi, typical breakfast buffet fare... pro tip: get the crepe chef to make some sauteed fruit to top the cheesecake on the dessert table. Beautiful setting in what was once a hacienda ball room, with ceiling frescoes and wood carvings in niches around the room, plus an unreal view over the cathedral.
Senora al Sur (Neuvo Vallarta) - A butcher shop turned restaurant that will grill your meat to order. You get in line, select the cut and size you want that is cut to order, weighed, and handed to you raw in a styrafoam container. You take it to register where it's rung up along with sides ordered and they mark the cooking instructions on the box. A runner then takes them to the grill and they arrive cooked a little while later. I got a 1/2 kilo ribeye that was amazing and perfectly cooked. Surpassed expectations for a place that sounded more like a gimmick.
Cafe des Artistes - Another restaurant where we're friends with the chef. We've gone every year, and it had declined a bit for a couple years. Last year, it was much better and that level of food was the same this year. The menu wasn't as unique/interesting as in the past, though.
Vallarta Food Tours Evening Taco Tour - Thoroughly enjoyed the tour which included visits to a variety of taco stands and restaurants to sample fish tacos, beef cheek, pastor, smoked marlin tacos; pozole, mezcal, churros, etc.
Hacienda San Angel - Perhaps the most beautiful setting for dining in all of PV (at least equal to the garden at Cafe des Artistes). Food and service are always excellent
Tacos Robles - went into town to shoot some photos and hit up this birria taco street stand we visited first on last year's Vallarta Food Tours' downtown tour.
Trio - Another restaurant where we're friends with the chefs, who also own Vitea. As I do most years, went with the calamari with tomato, ginger & cilantro and the rack of lamb served with lamb ravioli. My parents also went with the lamb, and my wife enjoyed her sea bass.
El Barracuda - casual seafood place known for their shrimp. Also, OK sashimi & ceviche. We've learned to stay away from their meat options on the combo plates.
I have not been able to get this single dish out of my head for the entirety of my son's life (we were expecting him at the time) - six years and counting. The sea in a garden in a garden in the sea. Puerto Vallarta.
It's been a while since I've reported on My Puerto Vallarta visits. We continue to go, but we've fallen into a pattern of hanging out at our condo and eating at old favorite places in our neighborhood. It's been a couple of years since I've broken any new ground. This time around, I did find a couple of new places worth mentioning as well as a couple of updates.
Let me start with a disclaimer. I didn't bring my camera with me on this trip, so all pictures were taken with a cell phone, often in substandard lighting conditions. Please forgive the quality of the pictures this time around.
First off, a place I posted about after one of my first visits, Vista Grill, has closed. The property owner is redeveloping the property and the former owner of the restaurant is searching for a new location closer to the Malecon. I'm sure he will eventually open a new spot.
Second, we continue to love Pancho's Takos for al pastor tacos, shaved from a charcoal grilled trompo. Although the original guy, who was poetry in motion when it came to making the tacos, is no longer there, the new guy is still turning out the same delicious tacos, just not as quickly and smoothly as the original trompo man.
A new place we tried for the first time this trip is Casa Fantasia. Casa Fantasia is a small B&B located around the corner from our condo. They have a beautiful open air courtyard where they serve three meals a day. The ambiance is great...very much in the school of Cafe des Artistes, but the food is much more down home "cantina style". On Friday nights, they feature a special of Paellea, but we didn't try it. The waiter pointed us toward the more Mexican choices as being better.
As you can see, prices are quite reasonable. Translated into dollars, the Paella was a little over $7.50, and the rack of lamb, the most expensive item on the menu, was only $18. Both included soup or salad (as did everything else on the menu). Besides the blackboard specials, they have a full menu of Mexican items. I opted for the waiter recommended shrimp chile rellenos, and the Chow Poodle ordered a combo plate with an enchilada, a taco, a chile relleno and a good sized piece of skirt steak.
Our total tab, including dinner, two cervezas and a spicy mojito...$20. This place is a great option, if you're looking for cantina type food in a beautiful setting.
Lastly, another new spot we were introduced to by some local friends is the poorly named Martini en Fuego Grill. NO...it's not a cigar chompin', martini swillin' River North type place as you may surmise from the name. You can probably get a martini there, if you were so inclined (they have a full bar), but they also have an excellent wine list of (mostly) Mexican and South American wines and BYOB is OK, with a small corkage charge.
It's a family run local seafood spot that has yet to be discovered by the crowds. Chef Roberto is a trained chef who has put in his time at the Four Seasons and other resorts and restaurants. He went off on his own and, for a while, he had a place in Mismaloya, but now he's moved into the "City". His cooking is well balanced and nuanced and well worth a visit if you find yourself in PV.
Martini en Fuego Grill is located in a nondescript storefront on a side street, just a few blocks up from the Malecon.
I had Roberto's special pescado vallarta, which is a nice filet of snapper, served with shrimp, clams & mussels.
The chow Poodle had some garlic shrimp (sorry, no picture). And one of my dining companions had a tuna steak, cooked perfectly to a rare center with a balsamic glaze.
For dessert, the chef sent out a poached pear with homemade strawberry ice cream, which was stupendous, and then poured us shots of some homemade pear tequila that included a full sized pear in the bottle.
Can't thank everyone enough for all the detailed reports, information, and recommendations. I've learned a lot of new vocabulary, new styles of latin food, and culture about the area. I'm happy to have a solid list of places to check out.
Want to put in a quick but strong word in for Pancho's Tacos, which is making some stunningly good tacos al pastor. Hit with some lime and avocado crema, these three-bite beauties hit all of your fatty, salty, acidic dopamine receptacles. My gf and I had four each and would have kept going were it not for our, you know, feeble mortality.
Be prepared to wait--took us about 30 minutes. But there's something about being surrounded by other people who also think of the trompo guy as an artiste that makes you, well, hopeful. (Of what, who knows?)

In this investigation, we will look at parametric curves. A parametric curve in the plane is a pair of functions
where the two continuous functions define ordered pairs. The curve will depend on the range of t . We are able to graph this type of equation on Graphing Calculator easily.
We will start our investigation looking at the graph of two parametric equations: x=cos(t) and y=sin(t). We will have the range of t be from 0 to 2pi.
Because the two functions define ordered pairs, we should have expected the curve to be a circle. For example sin(0)=1 and c0s(0)=0, therefore the ordered pair is (1,0), which we can see on the graph above.
If we change the coefficient of t, how do you think the graph will change? (I will not change the range of t however -at least not yet!)
For example, let's look at x=cos(at) and y=sin(bt). If we leave the a and b equal to 1, we will have the same graph as above. What will happen if we set a = 2 and b=2? Any ideas? Let's try it.
It is exactly the same as the graph above. What if the coefficients are different? In the next graph I will let a =1 and b=2. Let's see what happens.
This graph looks the same as when a=1 and b=2. Since a is half the value of b, the curve crosses one time creating 2 areas.
Let's look at a=2 and b=6. Since a is now 1/3 of b, I will conject that the curve will cross two times, creating three areas. What do you think? Take a look!
I was right! So, now we have determined how to predict what happens when a is less than b. What do you think will occur if b is less than a? Let's start with something small, for example let a = 3 and b= 2.
When a is greater than b, the curve seems to graph on the y-axis. When b is greater than a, the curve seems to graph along the x-axis.
If we set a and b equal to 1, then we will have the same graph as our very first one. What do you think is going to happen when we let a and b equal 2? Take a look:
So, as long as a and b are equal, (in all of the cases above) the two equations will create a circle.
When a is greater than b, an ellipse is formed. When a is less than b, an ellipse will also be created, but on the y-axis. In the following graph, a=3 and b=4

Global Mammography Market Nears $4 Billion - Medical Dealer - Buy and Sell New and Used Medical Equipment
The breast imaging and mammography markets continue to grow amid a more educated global population, increased awareness and advanced technology.
Grand View Research predicts the global mammography market will approach $4 billion within a decade.
“The global mammography market is expected to reach a value of $3.8 billion by 2025,” according to a report by Grand View Research Inc. “The market growth can be attributed to the rising initiatives by various governments and NGOs to raise awareness about early diagnosis of microcalcifications in breast tissue. Some significant organizations such as the National Breast Cancer Foundation, CDC, and Breast Cancer Organization are promoting the early diagnosis of mammary gland calcification, which is one of the crucial factors expected to drive the demand over the forecast period.”
“Based on a report published by the National Cancer Institute in 2015, it was stated that the proportion of women aged 45 to 65 years had increased to 81.1 percent in breast cancer screening,” according to Grand View Research. “Major mammography manufacturers are introducing new products and increasing the number of approved products, which is further expected to impel the demand in the coming years.”
“In January 2016, FDA approved a new manual for digital mammography quality control by the American College of Radiology. The growing number of awareness campaigns to promote womens’ health services is also anticipated to propel growth,” Grand View Research added.
“The market is expected to reach $4.14 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 8.5 percent from 2016 to 2021,” according to MarketsandMarkets.
“Growth in the breast imaging market is driven by factors such as the rising incidence of breast cancer globally; growing government investments and funding for breast cancer treatment and related research; increasing awareness about early detection of breast cancer; rising geriatric population; technological advancements in breast imaging modalities; and launch of advanced breast imaging systems capable of detecting cancer in women with dense breast tissues,” according to MarketsandMarkets.
“In addition, the growing demand for breast imaging in emerging Asian countries, and technological advancements in breast cancer detection are expected to offer high growth opportunities for market players. However, factors such as high installation cost of breast imaging systems, side-effects of radiation exposure, and errors in breast cancer screening and diagnosis are restricting the growth of the global breast imaging market.”
“North America is estimated to be the largest regional segment in the global breast imaging market in 2016, followed by Europe,” MarketsandMarkets reports.
Some of the key industry players are Fujifilm, Hologic, Philips Healthcare, Siemens Healthineers, Toshiba Medical Systems Corp. and GE Healthcare.

We aim for a holistic, ongoing approach to help you understand and look after your skin for life. Your skin is your confidence, you only get one.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia our doctors and nurse speciliasts are highly trained and skilled at performing anti wrinkle injections.
These treatments are performed to help reduce the signs of ageing, reduce the appearance of fine line or wrinkles, to change the shape of the face or to improve facial features.
Dermal blading is an exciting new technique that removals the dead cell build up on the top layers of your skin with no downtime and instant results in a quick and painfree way.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia we are finding it addictive, as the benefits are felt straight away and leaves the skin feeling soft, clean and refreshed.
Injectible fillers or dermal fillers are products that are injected under to skin for a number of different reasons.
They come in a variety of thickenesses and are most commonly used to change the facial profile to a more youthful one. The injection of fillers under the skin can fill in most deep folds or wrinkles, create fuller lips or pad out hollowing cheeks or eyes.
Skin needling is a new revolutionary cosmetic technique that promotes your skin’s natural production of elastin and collagen, reducing wrinkles, treating imperfections or scars and smoothing your skin with your body’s own energy.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia we use a Dermapen for skin needling. This can be used on any part of the body and is a great procedure for a number of different problems with minimal down time.
It is now possible to alter facial features without the need for extensive surgery. All procedures can be done on the day, in the office with minimal or no discomfort or downtime. Methods are available to rejuvenate, volumise, lift and reshape the face without the need for surgery.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia we offer complimentary no obligation consultations to allow you to express your individual concerns and ask questions, so you fully understand the treatments, its results and its maintenance.
The best starting point is why you have the hair in the first place. At the clinic we ensure you have a medical assessment to understand why you may have some problematic hair growth as this will ensure you respond to the correct treatment. Treatment options also depend on the hair location and its colour plus the colour of your skin
Hand are often a forgotten entity, yet their skin is just as exposed as our faces and they can often be an ageing sign.
Great hands are a sign of youth, so at Medical Skin Clinic Australia we like to ensure your hands are included in your skin regieme.
Laser and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) are therapies that use specific wave lengths of light to target specific skin conditions or structures without damage to surrounding structures.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia our highly trained medical proffesionals are able to identify the cause of your concern and tailor a treatment that uses the correct wavelength of light to target your concern without any unwanted complications.
LED light treatment is a very popular treatment as it is painless, has no downtime and has great results.

Medical Facials are a great introduction into cosmetics. Medical Facials provide a thorough, customised cleansing that is sure to relax and stimulate.
Medical facials are different to normal facials. We aim to use them as a treatment for a skin concern or to improve the skin for an upcoming event.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia we offer a range of medical skin peels. Skin peeling is a method use to treat a number of skin concerns. It involves applying a chemical to the skin that is specifically chosen to act against your skins problem.
Skin rejuvenation is a way of combating the signs of ageing, using the latest innovative, non invasive treatments, that aim to improve the quality of your skin, treat problematic areas or remove imperfections with the aim to give you younger, radiant looking skin.
Skin Resurfacing and Skin Rejuvenation can often appear the same thing and lead to confusion. Skin rejuventation involves improvement of ANY of your skin concerns, but is most often applied to the aim of anti ageing or improving the signs of ageing..
Veins, vascular spots or small red or blue blood vessels can appear anywhere on the body. However they are more commonly seen on the face and legs. They can be large or small and are due to a number of different reasons.
Treatment of the problem involves a medical assessment to identify the underlying cause of the vessels. If the underlying cause is not identified treatment can cause further damage or the problem can recur.
A lot of people worry when they hear the word skin peel as they instantly invisage layers of the skin peeling from the face. However this is rarely the case. Peels can be blended in a array of strengths so you get great results, but leave the clinic looking from normal with no peeling in the future, to having some instant mild reddness and mild peeling a few days later or deeper redness followed by significant peeling over the next 7 days.
Before any peel you will always have a through assessment of your individual skin concerns. The different peel options will always be fully discussed with you so you understand the procedure, how many treatments may be required, and what the down time (peeling) may be, if any.
Medical skin peeling may be performed in conjunction with other cosmetic treatments or as a stand-alone procedure.
Skin Peels can be used to successfully treat a number of skin concerns. They are great as part of an ongoing maintenance programe or can be used as a one off treatment to help improve your skin or give it a glow for an up coming event. They can be used over the entire face or used as spot treatments just on areas of concern eg on a scar.
What is a medical peel? Medical peels involve applying a chemical solution to the skin to remove its upper layers. Two aspects of a peel treatment are considered in providing your individual treatment and results: 1. The chemical used. 2. Depth of the peel.
At Medical Skin Clinic Australia we use a variety of different peeling agents and compound our own so that we can individualise a regime to suit you skin concerns. Some examples of skin chemicals you may come across are: Alpha Hydroxy Acid Peels (AHA): eg Glycolylic acid, lactic acids AHA peels are often more superficial peels with less down time, and are used to reduce the effects of aging and sun damage, including fine wrinkling and brown spots. Beta Hydroxy Acid Peels (BHA): eg Salicyclic acid BHA are different to AHAs in that they are lipid (oil) soluble. This means they can penetrate into a pore that contains oils / sebum and exfoliate the dead skin cells that have built up in the pore. For this reason they are best suited to oily skin and are great for acne, blackheads and whiteheads. Trichloracetic Acid Peel: (TCA): TCA is a stronger acid. It penetrates deeper into the skin. It can be used to treat loose skin, fine lines and wrinkles, acne scars, large pores and hyperpigmentation Jessner’s Peel A Jessners Peel contains three peeling agents – Salicylic acid, lactic acid and resveratrol. The combination of acids means it can be used as a broad peeling agents for a number of different reasons. It can also be layered for a stronger affect or combined with other medical peels or procedures. Fruit acid / Enzyme Peels: Commonly used fruit enzymes come from fruits such as papaya, pineapple, pumpkin and cranberry. They are antibacterial, promote cell renewal and can digest oil from spots and dead skin. They can be used to treat acne, rosacea, and dehydrated skin, hyper-reactive and sensitive skin.
The down time and results of the peel depends its it depth ie how many layers of skin it causes to be removed.
Generally the deeper the peels, the more layers of skin are removed, causing more redness and skin peeling (ie more down time). An advantage of a deeper peel however is you may get better skin results and need less treatments. More superficial peels have less downtime but you may require more of them to get the desired result.
The depth of the peel is controlled by understanding the chemical used, its pH, its concentration and how long it is left on the skin. It is therefore essential that peels are done by proffessionals such as at Medical Skin Clinic Australia who understand how to use the chemical.
Prior to a skin peel the skin is usually prepared with active ingredients for 2 weeks before the treatment. This is to ensure the peel is taken up evenly by the skin, leading to better outcomes and recovery. This will be discussed with you at your initial consultation and will depend on your current home maintenance regieme and the skin condition being treated.
The following is a rough guide to skin changes with a peel but it will vary depending on the peel depth used and your own skin type. Very superficial or superficial peels often produce no skin changes or flaking.
These peels are your lunchtime peels or perfect for a quick skin glow for an event. They can be done quickly, with minimal discomfort and with no or minimal visible flaking or peeling. They are great if you do not have the lifestyle for any down time, or wish to look good for an event or want to maintain your current skin condition. They can also help treat and maintain conditions such as acne, photoageing and enlarged pores. These are best performed in a series of 3-6 sessions 2-4 weeks apart.
These peels may produce mild visible flaking or peeling that occurs 3-7 days after the procedure. The procedure can be a little more uncomfortable, with some stinging or burning, but is easily tolerated. They have very little down time and most of the peeling can be covered with a mineral make up, being similar to sunburn peeling. Again the peel chosen is dependent on your individual skin concern, so they can be tailored to your needs. These peels are usually recommended to be done monthly until the desired result is achieved. A maintenance program is then advised with either the same peel or another skin rejunventation modality every 3-4 months.
Deep peels require some scheduling as they do have some down time. Deep peels should only be done by a professional such as those as Medical Skin Clinic Australia. The procedure can cause a strong burning sensation which is minimised by the clinics cooling techniques. On the day of the procedure your skin may be very red and as the next 24-48 hours progress you may get increased redness and swelling. With a deep peel the skin undergoes considerable peeling some 3-4 days post procedure as the skin darkens and peels in large segments as opposed to flaking. This usually lasts 7-10 days. Deep peels do provide fantastic results especially for aged photo damaged skin with deeper lines and an uneven skin texture.
This is totally individualised to you, and depends on the peel chosen and the problem being treated. Before a peel is undertaken you will have a thorough consultation with a clinican to provide a comprehensive treatment plan.
Complications are very rare with skin peels if done by a professional such as the clinicians at Medical Skin Clinic Australia. Before undertaking a skin peel its risks, benefits, side effects and outcomes will be discussed with you. Each individual has their own risks.
Any insult to the skin may cause a temporary or permanent colour change in the skin. This is increased if you or taking birth control pills, pregnancy, or a family history of brownish discoloration on the face.
There is a low risk of scarring in certain areas of the face. Some people may be more likely to scar. If scarring does happen, it can usually be treated with good results.
For people with a history of herpes outbreaks, there is a small risk of reactivating cold sores. Please inform us of any concerns you may have.
After the peel, avoid the use of any skin products with active ingredients in them for about 1 weeks (eg: retinol, glycolyic acid, perfumes and colours). After one week and if redness and sensitivity has resolved active products can then be recommenced.
Use the moisturiser provided to you for the first 3-7 days. You may apply a mineral make up from day 2 and sunscreen daily.
Try and avoid sun exposure for the first 1-2 weeks as the skin will be extra sensitive to burning. Then follow normal sun protection advice. Sun exposure can cause your initial problems to return.
Let me run some quick math. If you’re paying .90 cents per click for a decent solo ad that gives you 70% top 5 english-speaking countries you’re really paying a $ 1.17 per click, when you add in the 30% non-responsive traffic that you’re paying for. Let’s say your landing page converts at 33% (which is very high) you are paying on average $3.51 per lead.
If you’re a blogger, I recommend signing up under another blogger because they help you sell and market online rather than having in person parties or bugging your friends. If you want to join our team, contact me through my contact form or ping me on Facebook. There is no monthly minimum order required so you’re not paying while you’re learning, so this is the only MLM that interests me at all. Plus I’ve been a happy customer for many years.
To prove that we give you more in value, than you could ever give us in money, we provide you with MLM Training and Lead Management Systems at no extra cost. In fact, anyone can get a Free Lead Management System, which also includes a Free Phase 2 Customizable Marketing Site, and any package that has email leads gets a Free Autoresponder with Professionally written emails included. (You can even modify the autoresponder emails at any time.)
In general, mlm leads are generated on the Internet when advertisements direct interested people (prospects) to a lead capture page. The lead capture page gives enough information to let the prospect know whether or not they want more information or not. If interested, the prospect completes the lead capture web form. An mlm lead is then generated.
Rather than focusing solely on the technical aspects of how the best MLM leads are generated , we are able to dramatically improve overall conversion rates and quality of network marketing leads by adjusting the entire opt-in process through the eyes of your prospects. Our job is to understand what your prospects want and to help them get it. We believe technology and design should follow people, not the other way around.
When it comes to lead services, most businesses do not have as much to offer you as we do. In fact, most of our competitors do not even offer true qualified leads. Instead, they pull as much information as they can from public records, especially from secondhand public records databases that may not be accurate in the first place. After all, when was the last time you saw one of those “data aggregator” websites that was actually legitimate?
When a person buys a car, he or she realizes he will need to buy fuel for that car. Same for a business. Anyone who starts or builds a business needs fuel for that business, and that fuel is traffic that converts to customers. Our system is a 100% online business, and doesn’t conflict with your current MLM. As a matter of fact, bring your existing down-line into our system, and then you will find that true reproduction is possible. Many of your down line are not sponsoring because they don’t know how to find good leads. With our system, the Traffic and lead pages, the sales videos, the way to collect money for your sales, all that is done for you. So you are basically counting on experts to do these tasks for you. It would take you years to gain the expertise and testing experience that these leaders have.
The kinds of leads that you are likely to get for free are ones that have been gathered in a scatterspray way – they could be poorly targeted, or in some cases even people who have not opted in at all. If you contact leads like this, then you will be putting your brand at risk, because you could end up in trouble with your web hosting provider, or the law, for unsolicited marketing. Alternatively, you could end up contacting people who might otherwise have converted, but who come to view your brand as a spammer because of the way the initial contact was made.
You already know that MLM has the potential to be one of the most valuable business opportunities that you can possibly get involved with. However, if you are getting started with a new MLM venture, you are engaged in an uphill battle. There are plenty of other MLM pros and entrepreneurs out there who would like to use your prospects to build their list!
What Should Youth Players Expect | American Pride Youth Football League - Football and Cheerleading serving Dale City, Manassas, and Woodbridge.
Provide the premier youth tackle and flag football and cheerleader programs in the Manassas, Woodbridge, Dale City, Dumfries, Triangle areas of Prince William County.
What should a youth football player expect from his youth football coaches? That’s an interesting question, but one we should probably all ask ourselves as we start preparing for the coming season of youth football coaching. Here is my top 10:
10) We expect you to be the adult on the football field. To be above petty bickering, drama and excuse making. We expect you to treat referees, assistant coaches and opponents with respect. We expect you to accountable. When you make a mistake, own it, learn from it and move on, don’t make excuses.
9) We expect to be coached in an age-appropriate level. We expect to be taught skills, techniques and schemes that make sense for the age and skill levels of the player.
8- We expect you to be enthused about the game of football and coaching our team. We expect hustle, optimism and confidence in your abilities as a coach. If you aren’t excited about the game and practice, how can we be?
7-We expect you to be proactive about keeping us hydrated and healthy and to care for us compassionately and correctly when we are injured.
6) We expect you to let us know when We’ve done something right. It’s ok for you to point out when I’ve done something wrong, but I expect you to get as excited about something I do right as you do when I do something wrong.
5) We want your best. We don’t want you to allow us to go through a practice on auto pilot, we want you to hold us accountable to that perfect rep, that perfect technique that will help me become a better player. Once you stop paying attention to me, I know you’ve given up on me.
4) We want a well planned and well organized practice with little to no standing around. We need structure, you have to be the one in charge. We want to be involved and engaged. We expect you to coach everyone, not just the best players. We know when you are not prepared and we know when you don’t know how to handle a group of boys.
3) We expect you to treat ALL players fairly and equitably- we expect that you won’t just automatically place your own sons at Quarterback and Running Back. It’s ok if they earn it, but your kids should be treated the same as everyone else.
2) We want to be able to trust you and want to be able to have the confidence that you have my best interest at heart, that if I follow your instructions, I will improve. We expect for you to care. We expect that you will know our name and care about us individually as both a player and as a person.
1) We expect you to do no harm, to not turn us away from the game of football. We expect that you won’t crush our spirit and interest in the game. Conversely, we want you to inspire a love and appreciation for football and our team in each of us.

Open Up Your Child's Inner Healing Abilities With Bedtime Stories | Childhood Cancers Support for All Affected
Most of us realize the importance of a good bedtime story as children and parents, or reading before we go to sleep at night as an adult. It’s a way to wind down, relax our minds, or take us away to another place.
It helps our children’s minds focus on something other than their own daily lives and what they did or didn’t accomplish. Reading before falling asleep can be a comforting transition between the waking world and the world of dreams. It can help our children practice thinking about what they want their minds to focus on while they’re sleeping.
Reading a positive story at bedtime is a wonderful way to channel that focus. It sets the tone for our children’s dreams and how they wake. We should remember no matter what our age is, we can still go wherever we want to go and do whatever we want to do in our dreams.
Having those thoughts and feelings before our children fall sleep, allows them to find that place within themselves where they can find peace. A peace in knowing that in their minds they can be healthy and strong. They can be hopeful and brave. In their mind, they get to choose what they want to think about. They have control and they are in charge. In their mind, they can be powerful.

A stone and water sculpture marks Plateia Hellas (Plateia meaning town square and Hellas being the Ancient Greek name for Greece), an area between Aberdeen and Newcastle Streets that was designed to acknowledge and celebrate the Greek community in Northbridge.
Around the time of World War One, as the elite began to move out of the area, Northbridge became a hub of European immigration, especially Greek and Macedonian. In the 1950s, post-war European migration brought with it a culture of outdoor coffees and al-fresco lifestyle.
The first Greek Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of Saints Constantine and Helene, was built in 1937 in what is now known as Northbridge. It soon became an integral part of the Greek community and a well known landmark within Perth.
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730009.

Southern Baptists have prepared a statement of generally held convictions called The Baptist Faith and Message. It serves as a guide to understanding who they are.

The Holy Bible was written by men divinely inspired and is God's revelation of Himself to man. It is a perfect treasure of divine instruction. It has God for its author, salvation for its end, and truth, without any mixture of error, for its matter.
There is one and only one living and true God. "The eternal God reveals Himself to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, with distinct personal attributes, but without division of nature, essence, or being.
God as Father reigns with providential care over His universe, His creatures, and the flow of the stream of human history according to the purposes of His grace. "God is Father in truth to those who become children of God through faith in Jesus Christ.
Christ is the eternal Son of God. In His incarnation as Jesus Christ, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. "He honored the divine law by His personal obedience, and in His death on the cross, He made provision for the redemption of men from sin.
The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God. "He exalts Christ. He convicts of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. "He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.
Man was created by the special act of God, in His own image, and is the crowning work of His creation. "By his free choice man sinned against God and brought sin into the human race. " The sacredness of human personality is evident in that God created man in His own image, and in that Christ died for man; therefore every man possesses dignity and is worthy of respect and Christian love.
Salvation involves the redemption of the whole man, and is offered freely to all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal redemption for the believer. In its broadest sense salvation includes regeneration, sanctification, and glorification.
Election is the gracious purpose of God, according to which He regenerates, sanctifies, and glorifies sinners. "All true believers endure to the end. Those whom God has accepted in Christ, and sanctified by His Spirit will never fall away from the state of grace, but shall persevere to the end.
A New Testament church of the Lord Jesus Christ is a local body of baptized believers who are associated by covenant in the faith and fellowship of the gospel and seeking to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth. This church is an autonomous body. The New Testament speaks also of the church as the body of Christ, which includes all of the redeemed of all the ages.
Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water. "It is an act of obedience symbolizing the believer's faith in a crucified, buried, and risen Saviour, the believer's death to sin, the burial of the life, and the resurrection to walk in newness of life in Christ Jesus.
The Lord's Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members " memorialize the death of the Redeemer and anticipate His second coming.
The first day of the week is the Lord's Day. "It commemorates the resurrection of Christ from the dead and should be employed in exercises of worship and spiritual devotion.
God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring the world to its appropriate end. "Jesus Christ will return personally and visibly"the dead will be raised; and Christ will judge all men in righteousness. The unrighteous will be consigned to Hell. "The righteous" will receive their reward and will dwell forever in Heaven with the Lord.
It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples of all nations " to seek constantly to win the lost to Christ by personal effort.
The cause of education in the Kingdom of Christ is co-ordinate with the causes of missions and general benevolence there should be a proper balance between academic freedom and academic responsibility. "The freedom of a teacher in a Christian school, college, or seminary is limited by the pre-eminence of Jesus Christ, by the authoritative nature of the Scriptures, and by the distinct purpose for which the school exists.
God is the source of all blessings, temporal and spiritual; all that we have and are we owe to Him. Christians have a spiritual debtorship to the whole world, a holy trusteeship in the gospel, and a binding stewardship in their possessions. They are therefore under obligation to serve Him with their time, talents, and material possessions.
Christ's people should " organize such associations and conventions as may best secure cooperation for the great objects of the Kingdom of God. Such organizations have no authority over one another or over the churches. "Cooperation is desirable between the various Christian denominations.
Every Christian is under obligation to seek to make the will of Christ supreme in his own life and in human society. ... The Christian should oppose in the spirit of Christ every form of greed, selfishness, and vice.
Church and state should be separate. The state owes to every church protection and full freedom in the pursuit of its spiritual ends. A free church in a free state is the Christian ideal.
God has ordained the family as the foundational institution of human society. Marriage is the unity of one man and one woman in covenant commitment for a lifetime. The husband and wife are of equal worth before God, since both are created in God's image. The marriage relationship models the way God relates to His people. Children, from the moment of conception, are a blessing and heritage from the Lord.

Wow have things been happening here in this part of the world!! Here on the east coast of Australia we have had major flooding due to an ex-tropical cyclone turned rain depression. Boy has it been depressing!! For the last week or so we have had soooo much rain that the Mary River rose here to just under 11 metres. Many people in Maryborough and surrounding towns and cities have lost their homes and valuables to the raging waters. Unfortunately there has been a few deaths as a result of the flooding and the place is a huge mess. Luckily though my family and I are fine. No flooding here just the inconvenience of being surrounded by water and cut off with road closures for a few days. My heart goes out to all those displaced from their homes and those people who lost their loved ones to this tragic natural event. Please join me in well wishes and prayers for those effected. Our state of Queensland will be recovering for a long time to come.
Here is a page I did using some of the photos I took of the floods here in Maryborough. The top photo is of the Band hall completely surrounded by almost 11 metres of water. The photo underneath is of the road that gives us access to Hervey Bay (this is only one part that had been flooded). The flood marker is also on the page indicating the height of the water at the time the photo was taken. This marker is just in front of the band hall.

Right. Today is a day for some much needed positivity, okay? A kick up the arse, if you will. A time for saying what needs to be said, a little tough love us humans need to hear; all in good will to make our lives happier.
This post was heavily inspired by dull, rainy January (because it stripped us of all positivity) and by the wonderful Megan Ellaby, the blogger babe who’s post on appreciating the smaller things in life a few weeks back really got me thinkin’.
For me, January and February are the worst months of the year. Personally, it’s a shitty time, as I lost my Dad in January 2016 and these cold months are a reminder of how much I miss him. And just generally, because there’s nothing like freezing cold, grey weather to strip us of any cheer.
Christmas is over, so crisp, frosty mornings don’t hold the same festive feel as before. New Year has been and gone; we’ve already managed to break those resolutions, reminding us of how awful we are at any form of willpower. And with January taking 835692002379458495 light-years to finally say its goodbyes, it still feels like decades before any sunshine or happy times will come knockin’.
So it’s safe to say that the start of any new year is dull, dismal and dim, and it’s only natural that our moods will be affected by this. But one thing that is absolutely inexcusable (and is one thing that we all continue to do) is to spend these months doing nothing but moan.
It’s so cold (moan); I feel so uninspired at this time of year (moan); why is nothing going right for me this year (moan). I can’t believe that one tiny little thing that wouldn’t usually get me down happened this morning and now it’s 110% going to ruin my day. Moan. Actually no, I think it’ll ruin my week. Moan. Oh for goodness sake, another thing’s happened- 2018 is so officially ruined. M O A N.
Yes, this time of year isn’t the best. Yes, you might not exactly be having the best week of your existence. And times really can get tough, but it’s about how we struggle through to the other side that makes for a worthwhile life. We’re all so guilty of getting caught up in the everyday, that we don’t see the bigger picture. And that’s what this post be remindin’ ya of today. Here’s a few lil things we could all be doing for a happier mindset. It’s time we appreciated the everyday, people!
As Megan details in her post (which you should all read for a dose of positivity) it’s the smaller things in life where you can find true happiness and joy. However you are struggling these months, whether it’s because the dull weather is getting you down, or because you’ve been having to deal with some tragic circumstances, there is always something beautiful that you can take from every single day. We can find solace in those little moments and I honestly think if our brains were trained to only want the simpler things, we’d be very happy people.
For me, these simpler things are those such as having the chance to have a lie in; waking up naturally to the sound of birds singing outside and natural light streaming in through the windows makes me happier and more peaceful than anything else can. Similarly, a weekend with nothing to do but be with those I love makes me feel A-Okay about life. Playing my favourite vinyl on my record player as I wander around my student house, running errands and getting everything tidy. That feeling of elation once you’ve handed in all your university work. Sitting on a bench in a park in summer, watching the world go by. Quiet moments reading a book in bed in the evening. We can snatch these simple, yet beautiful moments from every single day, if we make time for them.
And it’s these moments we instantly forget if something goes wrong in our day. We think everything has suddenly turned to rubbish, and that nothing can possibly be good right now. But these moments are always here, and they’re here to remind us that some things are going well, and that everything can and will be okay.
This is a very cliched mantra, but it has been the mantra that I have stuck to for years, through good times and bad. When things are good, it’s something that reminds me that any successes that come from my hard work aren’t flukes, they’re things that I have worked damn hard for and deserve. When things are bad, I use this mantra as a way to comfort myself and begin to process any traumatic times.
There is only so much that we can do to control how our lives pan out. If we want to work for something, we give it all that we have got and if we get to where we want to be, it’s because we’ve worked hard to get there. If something happens that is distressing: we lose someone we love, we’re made redundant from a job, the sale on our dream house falls through, it’s because life is unpredictable, sometimes scary and often upsetting, and the course of life is sadly just this way- but these things help us learn, grow and become the kindest people we can be.
This mantra can be a tough one to believe in sometimes, especially when we experience upsetting traumas that really don’t feel fair. Life is unfair and it’s unpredictable, and there isn’t really a way to explain why in heck things have to be shit sometimes, but we just have to try our best to move on and to use any experience that comes our way to shape ourselves to be good people.
Honestly, nothing is. Life has its ups and downs- but this is just a fact of life. Nothing will be perfect forever, but likewise, nothing will be absolutely crappy forever, either. A happy medium is what we can hope for! The bad things are character building, and the good times allow us some respite. Sometimes it’s worth taking ourselves out of our heads and assessing the bigger picture: everyone has ups and downs, the world is not out to get us if we’re having a bad week, and things will get better.
The human brain is a funny one, because we are constantly either thinking of the past, or projecting to the future. We might spend our days reminiscing about happy memories and wishing we were back at simpler times, or we’ll be constantly looking ahead on how to go up in the world, thinking that the future will lead us to a happier place. We never live in the moment. But just as the past is a thought (memories are subjective thoughts we have conjured that we replay in our heads) the future is also a construction made by us: a projection into what might happen. Neither of those things are certain. All that is certain is our experience right now. If we didn’t listen to our thoughts, that tell us either the past was a happier time or that the future will be better, we’d be much happier lil beans. Focus on the now: the present is really all we have.
Now this one isn’t a get out of jail free card: it doesn’t mean neglect all responsibilities. But, very often, we don’t indulge in the things that make us happiest enough. If you want to watch an extra episode of your fave show on Netflix even though you know it’ll put you half an hour behind on your uni work, so be it once in a while. Indulge in some retail therapy if you want to. We need to do more of what makes us happy, because life’s too short not to feel happiness, people.
Here is the travel story I submitted to the Facebook group, We Love Memoirs' travel story contest. Alas, it didn't win, but I thought I'd share it here anyway. ​It was fun to put together. Also, our African safari in the fall of 2013 was amazing. As usual when I travel, my goal is to write a poem a day. A Travel Story in Poems Preparing to Go Even while I am on the elliptical reading my New Yorker I wonder: should I add more shirts? should I pick out some silver jewelry? do I need a pair of high heels?

Even while I do my last stretches I know I have more to do: put my toiletries in travel containers, get out my contact lens solutions, lay out my travel cl … [Read more...]
Iâ€™m finally back to real work after a nice long new yearâ€™s holiday rest. And itâ€™s about time. Of course I didnâ€™t stay exactly idle. Iâ€™ve thought long and hard about how to proceed with my writing life this year, and I've made a preliminary list. Iâ€™m sure I'll add more things in the weeks and months to come. Keep slugging away at my novel revisions. Iâ€™m about to start Chapter Six â€“ only Twenty-one chapters to go.

While I've been awaiting comments on my novel from my beta readers I've been editing poems and gathering photos to illustrate the poems from our trip to Africa last summer.

Boni A young person greets us at the airport in a light blue and red two-piece dress and hair tied in long tight braids at the back of his neck. So many beads in primary colors adorn his head, neck, wrists, and fingers, at first I think he is a girl. He introduces himself as our guide Boni, as he drives us to the lodge. He will lead our game tours during our stay in Kenyaâ€™s Samburu district, promising weâ€™ll see this areaâ€™s big five: lions, leopards, elephants, rhinos, and lions. Boniâ€™s forte is tracking. As he drives he looks out the right side of our truck for footprints and fresh dung on the bumpy red dirt roads, clues to which animals … [Read more...]

This book was such a brutally honest account of life in a concentration camp. It shook me to read what human beings were subjected to during such a dark time in history. There was so much suffering and death, but in many ways the story of the survival of this woman is an amazing show of endurance of the human spirit. All the artwork is done in black and white which is appropriate for a story like this. Overall, a gripping read.

Through a series of actions, the plan brings together government, industry, Traditional Owners, researchers and the community and provides a shared pathway to the future.
Over the course of 18 months, and as part of Water Quality Action 17, NQBP has worked alongside Queensland Ports Association (QPA) on a study to:
“Understand the port sediment characteristics and risks at the major ports and how they interact and contribute to broader catchment contributions within the World Heritage Area.”
This knowledge helps us to understand sediment dynamics in the Great Barrier Reef region and to manage port operations in a sustainable way that does not adversely affect the reef. At the same time, it helps keep our ports open and trading effectively to support our economy, communities and way of life.
To support this work, BMT WBM have prepared a quantitative sediment budget of the entire Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and regions surrounding GBR ports.
This work was scoped in 2017 with input from research agencies and has been reviewed by Environment Managers from each port authority, QPA and technical specialists engaged by QPA. In addition, it has also been the subject of independent peer review by Dr Andy Symonds from Port and Coastal Solutions.
The evolution of the GBR has occurred over millions of years as a result of tectonic activity, sediment movements and coral reef growth. This has resulted in a series of islands, outer and inner reefs and a large, relatively protected inner lagoon (open water).The seabed area of the lagoon and inshore areas in particular are made up of varying sediment types including rock, gravel, sand, silts and clay.
Today, and continually over time, the seabed of the lagoon is moving and being suspended in the water column by winds and tides that drive waves and currents. At the same time large storm events, especially cyclones, move large amounts of sediment and the subsequent river runoff from flood rain brings further sediment into the system.
Sediment transport processes on the inner shelf of the lagoon are driven primarily by tidal and wind-driven wave resuspension.The south-east trade winds are dominant between March and October, these winds generate waves which resuspend coastal sediments and also result in a general movement to the north-west. Suspended sediments then become trapped in a turbid nearshore coastal layer that contains higher suspended sediment concentrations than adjacent offshore waters.
As shown in the figure above, there is 90 billion tonnes of sediment within the GBR system with 9 million tonnes entering from catchments every year. Of this around 150 million tonnes is suspended within the water column by waves and currents on an annual basis. Approximately 900,000 tonnes settles out in port shipping areas such as channels, berths and swing basins. Two thirds (~600,000 tonnes) of this may resuspend in the water column during dredging operations to settle out somewhere else – usually in close proximity to the port.

I was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and have two younger sisters. When I was eight, my family moved to Wisconsin, where I still live. I love it here and have little desire to go elsewhere. My husband and I met when we were in sixth grade and started dating our senior year of high school. There is a story I’ve heard that his locker was across from mine in eighth grade, and he had a crush on me then. Much to my chagrin, I don’t remember that. While I went away to college, he stayed in Wisconsin. That was tough.
I graduated from Trinity Christian College in Palos Heights, Illinois, and returned to Wisconsin to marry Doug. For four years, I taught second grade at a Christian school, and then I quit to start a family. God had different plans for us, though. Years of infertility and treatments followed. They were difficult times for us. I was devastated and questioned how this could be His will for us. Slowly but surely, he worked in my heart to accept his perfect plan. For us, that meant adoption.
Twenty-three years ago, we brought a beautiful baby boy home from Vietnam. Five years later, we added an infant daughter from Korea, and eight years after that, a five-year-old girl from the Philippines. What was the hardest trial of our lives turned out to be the greatest blessing.
Our son is now a U.S. Marine. We couldn’t be prouder of how he’s chosen to serve the country that he feels has given him so much.
Our oldest daughter has just started college. It’s been hard on this mama to be so far away from her girl, but we are equally proud of the bright and talented young lady she is.
Our youngest daughter has multiple physical and cognitive delays. She’s our “lifer”, so we’re as empty nest as we ever will be. But that has been a blessing, too. She keeps me from getting too lonely with the other kids gone.
My first publication was in a Barbour novella collection, A Log Cabin Christmas. Wanda Brunstetter was the lead author on that, and it made the NY Times bestseller list. I was literally about to start another book – blank document open, thinking about the first line – when my agent sent an email about this project and asking if I would be interested. I only had a few days to put together a proposal and write the first three chapters. While I did go camping with my family that weekend, I spent much of it in the camper writing.
My debut full-length novel was Snow on the Tulips in 2013. It is based on a family story of a Dutch woman during WWII who hides a wounded resistance worker in her home. All of it was such a learning curve, from editing (cue panic attack at an 8-page editing letter) to cover design, to marketing, to speaking and appearances. And I loved every minute of it.
Since then, I’ve written several more WWII books, several novella collections, and even an Amish romance. My first romantic suspense, The Pink Bonnet, is due out in June 2019. So, I’ve been very busy. While I enjoy writing across a wide range of genres, my favorite by far is WWII.
Right now, I’m editing my sixth WWII novel. The fifth, When the Heart Sings, is releasing in October and is set in a Polish labor camp. It’s very personal for me because it also explores infertility, pregnancy loss, and adoption, all of which I’ve experienced in my own life. The one I’m editing now is set in Hungary and deals with the Zionist Youth movement in that country.
I have another novella to write, but after that, I’m not sure where I’m going to go from here. I would dearly love to keep writing WWII novels, but we’ll have to see how interested my publisher is in keeping going with that line.
In 1943 Poland, the Nazis have forced Natia and Teodor from their peaceful farm to the harsh confines of a labor camp. When the couple is separated, Natia is chosen to be the housekeeper for the camp’s overseer, and Teodor is sent to work in the factory. Despite the strict camp rules—and the consequences for disobeying them—Natia finds a way to communicate with Teodor by sending messages through song as she passes Teodor’s dormitory.
The stakes get higher when Natia finds a Jewish orphan on the overseer’s doorstep. She is determined to protect the boy and raise him as the child she and her husband were unable to bear—but if her German captors discover how much she’s hiding, both she and Teodor may pay the ultimate price. . .
Lord, we bow before You in adoration and thanksgiving, for You alone are worthy of worship. You alone are the Fount of Every Blessing. What a joy it is to read Liz’s stories and see You working the threads of characters’ lives into beautiful tapestries, just as You do the lives of Your children. We exalt Your name above every name in all the Earth. Please bless each word Liz writes for You.
I LOVE Liz Tolsma’s books! She is an amazing author. I enjoyed reading more about her and her writing journey. Historical Christian fiction is my favorite genre to read, and WW2 is one of my favorite time periods to read. I am so excited to read Liz’s newest book, When the Heart Sings!! Thank you for the chance to in a copy!!!
This cover is really amazing! I so enjoyed reading this! Sadly, I have not tried Liz’s books yet, but now, after reading this, I want to read them!
Great to see you in the circle, Becky. I feel the same way about Liz’s book cover and reading her stories.

Today I’m delighted to welcome to our circle Gail Kittleson, author of memoir and women’s fiction. Gail hosts the delightful website, Dare to Bloom.
Gather ’round as we get to know a bit about Gail’s pre-author life, some influences along the way, her journey thus far, and maybe a tip or two.
Thank you, Gail, for carving out a spot in your busy schedule for a visit. We’re excited to get to know you. Thank you also for offering a give-away of an autographed copy of your novel In Times Like These to someone who joins our chat.
I’m an Iowa farm girl, born and bred. I still dip my forefinger into the eggshell when I’m baking, to be certain no speck goes to waste. My grandparents lost a farm in the Depression and earned it back through sheer determination and hard work. They affected me greatly—especially Grandma.
She raised 1,000 chickens and worked from dawn to dusk. She loved to fish, but rarely took the time. I’m told she played the violin, but never heard her. Her mother died when she was eleven, so she started “working out” at other homes, doing those nasty turn-of-the-century necessary daily tasks. You can imagine.
She reared five children, and in later life, made do with her $62 monthly Social Security check. Working in the garden with her stands out in my memory—not one dry lima bean went unused for seed the next year. I’d have to say this contributed to my “crazies.” One can be ridiculously frugal—a kind of crazy I’ve struggled with most of my adult life.
Grandma died when I was a college freshman. I don’t remember her funeral, but certainly recall her advice: If you can’t say something good, don’t say anything at all—things like that. (Tweet That!)
I taught college expository writing and English as a Second Language. Now I write memoir and women’s fiction and facilitate writing workshops and women’s retreats. My husband and I make our home in northern Iowa, where we enjoy our grandchildren and gardening. In winter, the Arizona mountains provide new novel fodder.
Catching Up with Daylight by Gail Kittleson. WhiteFire Publishing, November 2013 http://amzn.to/2kMlWOG
Catching Up with Daylight was my first publication. This book inspires through memoir, contemporary women’s stories, ancient meditation practices, and encouragement to live in the present moment.
This was my first novel. I met the editor at a small writing conference, and she gave me an open-ended invitation to submit. A couple of years later, I did, and my experience with this company taught me a lot.
First, it’s great working with an editor who cares about your work’s quality. I also learned that you give up control when you sign a contract.
The first box of books arrived during my little writing class, and one member took pictures of me hugging the Fed Ex man. (:
Second chances are the farthest thing from widow Dottie Kyle’s mind as she cooks and cleans at a local boarding house.
But every morning and evening as she treks to work, her lonely next-door widower neighbor observes her, hoping somehow to win her heart.
Dottie grieves her son, lost in WWII, and longs to meet her two little grandchildren in California, but the long train ride from Iowa calls up her worst fears. Readers will resonate to Dottie’s down-home integrity and cheer her on as she faces her fears.
In Times Like These, Book 1 of Women of the Heartland series, taught me even more. A professional in the field of verbal abuse, Patricia Evans, read the manuscript and gave her endorsement. She’s sharing my work on her website: www.verbalabuse.com which displays her own non-fiction books.
But Addie fights her own battles on the Iowa home front. Her controlling husband Harold vents his rage when his father’s stroke prevents him from joining the military. He degrades Addie, ridicules her productive victory garden, and even labels her childlessness as God’s punishment.
When he manipulates his way into a military unit bound for Normandy, Addie learns that her best friend Kate’s pilot husband has died on a mission, leaving her stranded in London in desperate straits.
The sequel, With Each New Dawn, releases on February 24. The research for this book transported me to London (in my imagination) and Southern France—pure joy.
In this story American RAF widow Kate Isaacs leaves war-torn London to parachute into southern France and aid the French Resistance. Her alliance with grieving Basque shepherd-turned-Resistance fighter Domingo Ibarra brings both sorrow and relief as she discovers her familial roots, along with second chances.
Reader responses are the very best perk—people thank me for not making things easy for my characters, for allowing them to ask honest questions, even of God. One fan says, “I’ve earmarked Addie’s story so often it looks like my Bible. She’s helping me with a difficult relationship.”
Father, You are the Lord of Angel Armies, the God of Second Chances, and Author of The Greatest Story Ever Told. We bow before You in awe and thanksgiving. Bless Gail with far-reaching influence for good through her stories and make our lives testimonies to Your goodness. For Jesus’ sake
Enjoyed the interview with Gail. I love her books. I was blessed to be a beta reader for With Each New Dawn and loved it.
Clarice, I thought I responded to you before, but something must’ve gone wrong. Anyway, thanks for stopping by, and I mentioned that for me, writing contemporary just doesn’t work – I’ve tried it, and do so much better at historical. I guess we each have our niche, eh?
These books sound amazing. I love historical books and i truly appreciate how you show their struggles. I cannot wait to read. Thank you so much for sharing your memories. I also have gond menories of time with my grandparents, working in the garden, washing clothes in the wringer washer and hanging on line. I still love those old fashioned traditions.
I enjoy remembering (and giving honor to) the older ways and those who led lives of worth. We owe them so much! Thanks for joining the discussion, Debra. You’ve encouraged Gail and me both.
Hanging out here with fellow female authors is fun! Thanks, Linda, for finding some interesting people out there. Gail Kittleson’s historical settings intrigue me, probably because I’ve yet to try writing one! And I love it when an author gives back through teaching and mentoring others in the craft. Kudos to you, Gail!
Yes, Clarice. Gail’s all-around terrific. Her soon-to-be released With Each New Dawn is on my TBR list for sure. Thanks so much for joining in. You’ve affirmed Gail and me both.

The World Health Organization says the rising cost of health care is a struggle for people and governments around the world. The problem is greatest in countries where people must often pay directly for services. A new report says these costs push one hundred million people into poverty each year. Aging populations are one reason why health costs are rising. Also, more people are getting chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease that require long-term treatment. And new treatments for health conditions are more costly than old ones. This year's "World Health Report" offers guidelines to strengthen health financing systems and make services available to more people.The report says about one billion people do not get the care they need because it costs too much or it is unavailable. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan says no one should have to risk financial ruin to take care of their health. David Evans agrees. He is the director of health systems financing for the WHO, which is part of the United Nations. The report says one thing governments can do is provide more money for health care. For example, ten years ago, African leaders agreed to spend fifteen percent of government funds on health. So far, only Liberia, Rwanda and Tanzania have met that goal. The report says governments could also raise money more fairly and spend it more wisely. David Evans says several countries are doing this. He says: "Gabon is a low-income country. It has introduced a tax on financial transactions and that is going to help. If Gabon can do something like that, other countries can do it." He also says Thailand has introduced health insurance for everyone that is tax-funded. So the insurance now pays the cost that the people would have paid themselves.The WHO says smarter spending could reduce health care costs between twenty and forty percent. The report identifies ten areas where better policies and practices could make health systems more efficient. One area is in the purchase of medicines. The report says higher-priced drugs are often chosen even when lower-priced medicines of the same quality are available. Also, medicines can go to waste simply because the right storage is not available.For VOA Special English I'm Alex Villarreal.

This diagram is automatically generated from the data contained in LingHub, and shows the current status of the linguistic linked open data cloud.
The Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud is a collaborative effort pursued by several members of the OWLG, with the general goal to develop a Linked Open Data (sub-)cloud of linguistic resources. The diagram is inspired by the Linking Open Data cloud diagram by Richard Cyganiak and Anja Jentzsch, and the resources included are chosen according to the same criteria of openness, availability and interlinking. Although not all resources are already available, we actively work towards this goal, and subsequent versions of this diagram will be restricted to openly available resources. Until that point, please refer to the diagram explicitly as a "draft"
The diagram is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) license, you are free to share (copy, distribute and transmit) the work, to develop your own extensions (adapt, remix) of the work, and to make commercial use of the work under the condition that you give attribution as follows:

In scientific publications, please also refer to the most recent reference publication available at the time of publication as specified below:
The current version of the diagram was developed by John P. McCrae, Luca Matteis, Christian Chiarcos, Sebastian Hellmann and Sebastian Nordhoff, however, it is officially attributed to the Open Linguistics Working Group and any working group member can modify it.
The development of the diagram itself is designed as a joint activity. However, we all do pursue different application scenarios, so that concrete collaborations will normally not involve all contributors to the LLOD cloud, but rather focus on selected resources from the LLOD cloud and how their information can be combined. You can help the community by using the diagram above or extensions of it, on your websites and in your publications, and by mentioning the OWLG. If you need help to devise a description of the OWLG as a whole, you can ask the mailing list administrators to provide you with text snippets.
From time to time, we plan to present summaries of the progress of the OWLG and the LLOD cloud at selected conferences, in journals, etc. We would like this to be written on a really collaborative basis, and any contributor should feel invited to act as a co-author. Normally, we will announce plans for such summary publications by email to the people who committed to provide their data as part of the LLOD cloud.
So far, we have written a few papers that describe the vision behind the LLOD, that motivate the LLOD, discuss representative types of linguistic resources involved for selected examples, and that describe its development until October 2011 (i.e., before the community efforts really began). These are published as a separate part in the companion volume of the LDL workshop, and a concise summarization over these, extended with a focus on resources relevant to the Francophonie, has been submitted to a special issue of the French NLP journal TAL. With more and more people getting involved, and more resources becoming actually available, these publications should be quickly superseded by updated papers written by a larger number of people.

This summer, one of the nation's favourite sweets got a "hot" new makeover, with Jelly Babies Tropical hitting the shelves, giving fans a taste of the tropics whatever the weather. This is huge news in the confectionery world, because it is the first time ever that new Jelly Babies flavours have been introduced.
We love Jelly Babies here at The Madhouse, as much for the flavours and the soft squishy texture as the pure, childish delight of biting off an unsuspecting Jelly Baby's head with an evil laugh ! The original line-up features five flavours - blackcurrant, strawberry (or is it raspberry? I'm pretty sure there used to be two, both light pink and dark pink), lemon, lime and orange - and they contain apple, lime, orange, strawberry, blackcurrant, lemon and raspberry juice, as well as sugar, glucose syrup, water, gelatine, flavourings and colourings.
The new recruits, on the bottom row in the picture, offer three new tropical flavours : mango (orange), banana (yellow) and pineapple (green). They contain exactly the same ingredients as the originals, minus the strawberry, blackcurrant and raspberry juice.
All three of the new flavours were a unanimous hit at The Madhouse, but we did think it was a shame that they look identical to the original flavours. If they're happy to have the unlikely choice of green to represent pineapple, why not go for totally different colours like blue, white or purple to differentiate them, then they could do mixed bags including both the original and new tropical flavours ?
If you're looking for a fun activity for the kids during half-term, how about making some little cars for your Jelly Babies to drive around on, with fun sized chocolate bars and Smarties as wheels and steering wheels? Great fun and a tasty treat once you've finished playing with them !
Jelly Babies Tropical and Original are available in 190g bags, for a RRP of £1.32 at most major supermarkets.
Ooh I haven't seen these yet but they sound very yummy, I love tropical flavours, I'm sure my children would enjoy them too xxx

The University of Virgina School of Medicine created a comprehensive quiz to determined, based on personality alone, what medical specialty you are best suited for...
Want to know what you learn in medical school? The following is a basic article revealing common conditions in the human body.
Above is a clip of Dr. Ben Carson, a top neurosurgeon and graduate of Johns Hopkins. As a child who grew up in an inner city, he pushed himself to be more than his social circumstances dictated.
Numerous premedical clients have contacted me with their MCAT scores and GPA asking me the fated question, "Do I have a chance of getting into medical school?"
The reality of medical school admission is that the GPA and MCATS ONLY serve as an initial screening tool.
Many premedical students focus on getting into medical school. They shadow physicians and have an idea of what being a physician is like but typically, have different ideas of what medical school is like.
The following is a breakdown of medical school realities. As a physician, I have experienced the sleeplessness, the long ardous hours of studying, the multiple stops at Starbucks, etc. This is the reality of medical school. Medical school is not difficult, per se. It's the massive amounts of knowledge you need to learn in a short period of time that makes medical school one of the most challenging professional schools out there.
Many types of medical schools exist. The typical medical school focuses on the lecture format while new medical schools are focusing on problem-based learning modules.The problem based learning method consists of a group of med students working together to solve a patient case. A physican-moderator typically sits in to guide the group and create the dynamic of the group.
Life as an MS-1 (Medical Student 1) is the most difficult year of med school. Here, you are presented with one of the most challenging medical school classes known to humankind: GROSS ANATOMY For many of you who want to watch a good movie about medical school, check out the 90s movie "Gross Anatomy"--yep that's the title! :) It exactly depicts medical school gross anatomy. Gross anatomy has 2 components: lecture and lab. Lecture is typically lasts for 1 hours while lab is about 4 to 5 hours. Some medical schools have gross anatomy everyday while some medical schools opt to break it down to 3 times a week. The course itself can last three months or one year. Again, it depends upon the medical school. Here, you will learn the wonders of the human body from the cranial nerves, brachial plexus and mediastinum to the femur, humerus and orbicularis oculi muscle in your eye. I'm not gonna lie, gross anatomy is a tough class. You have to keep up with the reading or else you will be behind. Study in groups if you like learning with a group of people.
Histology is the study of human cells in the body. This, too, consists of a lecture and lab component. Oftentimes, you will take histology and gross anatomy together especially if your medical school is systems-based. This means that all your classes are divided up by body system. For example: Month 1 may be about the cardiovascular system, Month 2 may be about the gastrointestinal system and Month 3 may be about the reproductive system and so on and on....
Lab consists of looking at slides in the microscope. I loved histology but didn't appreciate ross anatomy until I was done with it!
Ever watch Dr. G Medical Examiner? Yep, pathology class in medical school is sorta like pathology in medical school. You look at histology slides of say an infarcted heart (heart attack) and know by inspection that it is a damaged heart. This, like most medical school classes consists of lecture and lab.
Biochemistry is sorta like organic chemistry but better. Don't panic, you don't have to distill any liquids in lab or draw any funny structures... as this class is primarily lecture-based. You may have to memorize the Kreb's cycle and glycolysis cycle.
Year 1 of medical school consists of mostly basic sciences courses. I listed only the major classes of medical school most premeds think about...but medical school also consists of medical ethics courses, OSCEs in which you learn the physical exam and more
Year 2 of medical school is typically clinical-based. Here you will learn about most of the diseases...here's a list of a few...
A medical team typically consists of an attending (senior doctor), residents (doctors-in-training) and interns (1st yr residents). As a medical student, I'm not gonna lie, you're at the bottom of the totem pole. Some doctors will make that well-known while others are very nice.
You will rotate through the many clinical specialties such as Internal Medicine (adult medicine), pediatrics, ob/gyn, psychiatry, etc. Here, you will get a taste of what kind of doctor you will become. Your team will grade you on your performance during your rotation. Unfortunately, this can be a bit biased. However, national tests are administered at the end of your rotations to factor-into your grade.
Year 4 of medical school is much like year 3---but a bit more specialized. You can delve into the specialties of medicine even more. For example, if you liked internal medicine---do a gastroenterology, cardiology or rheumatology rotation. Grading is the same as in year 4.
Do you want to work in the hospital and be a healer? Do you want to make medications, perform CPR, work in an ambulance, and be in the front lines healthcare drama? Consider working in the medical profession! There are many medical professions to consider such as doctor, dentist, nurse, and paramedic. The choice is up to you.
There are two types of licensed doctors in the United States, the Allopathic physician (M.D) and the Osteopathic Physician (D.O). Both are fully licensed to practice medicine and prescribe medication. What's the difference? Osteopathic Physicians have an extra tool and learn to use their hands to help diagnose and treat different diseases. Both doctors see patients and become investigators of the body as they try to find out why their patients are sick. Expect to work long hours. Being a doctor is demanding yet rewarding! Average Doctor's salary is greater than $100,000 depending on length of training and specialty. In order to become an MD or DO, take many science courses in college and take the MCAT. Medical school is four years long with the first two years being in the classroom and the last two years being in the hospital. After medical school, pursue residency training. Internal medicine, surgery, family medicine, and pediatrics are just a few of the fields that may be chosen.
Caring for teeth is not as simple as it sounds. Dentists fill cavities, pull teeth, perform root canals, teach healthy oral hygiene, and more! To become a dentist, the education is just as intensive as becoming a doctor. Do well in your science classes, take the DAT or Dental Admission Test, and apply to dental schools by your senior year in college. Residency is not required for dentists but options to train in orthodontics and surgery exist. Lifestyle is not as demanding as the hours are fixed while working in an office. Average dentist salary is also greater than $100,000 depending on training, specialty, and length of experience.
Ever dream of being the next Florence Nightingale? There are many types of nurses. Nurse Practioners, Registered Nurses, Licensed Practical Nurses, and Certified Nursing Assistants all care for patients in different capacities. Nurse Practioners work primarily in clinics, go to school for six years, can see patients on their own and write prescriptions. Registered and Licensed Practical Nurses go to school for two to four years, follow doctor's orders and cannot write prescriptions.
Getting into medical school is no easy task. The stress is high and so is the coffee consumption. The MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) is a required five-and-a-half-hour standardized exam for students wishing to enter medical school. It tests your knowledge and analytical skills in biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, writing, reading and physics. Expect to study many hours for this difficult test. Although preparing for the MCAT can be a daunting task, taking the test requires a few simple steps.
Plan to take the MCAT one year prior to entering medical school. The MCAT is valid for up to three years, so make your plans accordingly.
After you decide when you want to apply to medical school, register for the MCAT. The AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges) offers online registration for a small fee. The test is offered each month, so choose the best date for you.
After registering for the MCAT, decide how to study for the test. Many options are available. Review college science notes and peruse the bookstore for MCAT preparation materials. Take a Kaplan or Princeton Review MCAT preparation course (See Resources for links). These courses are well-structured and provide practice MCATs that simulate real-test conditions. Take note, these standardized test courses are pricey. Decide what is best for you.
After deciding how to study, develop a study plan. Make sure to study all subjects equally. Take many practice MCATs and learn from your mistakes.
After developing a study plan, follow it. Study hard, but remember to take many breaks. The MCAT tests not only your knowledge, but also your stamina. Don't give up.
After studying, take the MCAT. Congratulations, you successfully completed an important process in the admission process to medical schools.

This week we get some Bollywood music from the 70's, 100 tracks best of from a DVD (cut in 7 parts). Today is PART 3.
Police in Namyangju, Gyeonggi, have decided to hand over Himchan of the boy band B.A.P to prosecutors after questioning him on Monday about sexual harassment allegations that were made against him.
“B.A.P’s Himchan was with acquaintances when the misunderstanding took place. He has attended one police investigation since then,” the singer’s agency TS Entertainment said in a statement on Sunday.
The incident is said to have occurred on July 24 when Himchan and five acquaintances traveled to a pension in Namyangju. That day, one of the three women on the trip called police to report that she had been sexually harassed by the singer.
During questioning on Monday, the singer denied all claims made against him. “We were both romantically interested in each other … the sexual harassment allegations are all because of a misunderstanding,” he said during his interrogation, according to police.
“With the evidence we have collected, we have come to the agreement there was sexual molestation involved, which is why we decided to bring this case to prosecutors,” said a representative from the Namyangju police.
Firefighters examine a gosiwon (one-room, low-cost apartment) located in Jongno District, central Seoul, on Friday. The blaze started on the third floor of the three-story building and took two hours to be completely extinguished. Seven people have died in the fire so far. [YONHAP]
A fire swept through a cheap lodging house for day laborers in Jongno District, central Seoul, on Friday, killing at least seven people and injuring 11 others, according to fire department authorities.
Officials say that most were day laborers and those killed or injured were in their fifties and seventies.
The fire broke out at 5 a.m. Some 173 firefighters and 40 police officers were dispatched to put out the fire, which they did two hours later.
“I woke up to smoke a cigarette at around 4:45 a.m.,” said a resident surnamed Shim in an interview with JoongAng Ilbo. “On my way to the rooftop, I saw smoke coming from Room 301. The person in Room 301 was trying to put out a fire. I yelled that there was fire and went downstairs to hit the emergency alarm. But the alarm didn’t work.”
The resident of Room 301 later told police that the blaze started when his electric heater caught on fire. “I tried to put it out with blankets and my clothes but it was no use,” he told police.
The fire department later confirmed that the aged building had no sprinklers, but was equipped with other emergency equipment such as a fire alarm, exit signs and ropes.
“Since the fire started early in the morning and near the evacuation route, it progressed further than it should have,” said an official from the Jongno Fire Station.
According to the Jongno District Office, the building dates back to 1983 and was registered as an office building rather than a residence.
This was why the building was excluded from a National Safety Assessment that 8,300 residencies had to go through earlier this year. It is also why the building wasn’t checked for sprinklers.
A joint field investigation by the fire and police departments is scheduled to take place on Saturday to pin-point the exact cause of the fire and if the alarm didn’t function, as Shim claimed.
“We will check to see if the fire detector installed in each room worked properly. We will make sure to secure CCTV footage to see if there are any indications of crime,” said police and fire department officials.
“They were all hard-working people,” said the owner of the gosiwon as she watched her building burn. “I wish it could have been me instead of them.”

Each time you start a business, offline or online, you must have a solid business plan in order to guide you in the right path. This means utilizing every avenue of marketing, including social media sites. Use the information here to create an innovative approach to social media marketing.
When it comes to social media marketing the right way, it’s all about the titles. It doesn’t matter where you’re leaving a post, you should focus on the right type of title. When titles and headlines hook readers, you are going to notice people go where you ask them.
Use Twitter tools like Twellow and Tweepi. These tools allow you to find users who belong to your target audience and identify the most influential users. Once you’ve identified these people, you should follow them and hope that they return the favor.
Do you run a blog? If so, the button that allows you to retweet should be near the top of all your posts. This will make it easy for visitors to share posts with their Twitter followers. Not to even mention that more and more people will see your material as it’s shared across the web.
TIP! Make sure that the top of all your blog postings have a share button for Facebook. That way your visitors can share your blog with their Facebook friends.
Before settling on a specific social media platform, weigh the pros and cons of each against your business goals. Each one of these social media websites has its own unique set of offerings, and learning what they are can help you get the most benefit from your time spent on them. There might be one or two networking sites that reach more people, making them more worthy of your time than others.
When you tweet, include a tag. Using hash tags makes your updates immediately available to your followers. Think carefully about your tag use. Identify specific groups that your intended demographic probably follows.
YouTube is a great way to target a large audience through social media marketing. YouTube is good for getting visitors to your website, because the visitors will already have knowledge about what kind of things you’re marketing. This is because they have seen your videos about it. If your visitors already know something about your product line before browsing your website, they’re more likely to buy something.
TIP! Give offers that are exclusive to your followers on social media. Give your followers an incentive to buy by giving them exclusive discounts or offering limited edition items with purchase.
All your blog posts should show up on your LinkedIn web page if you have the blog feed. You can use the feature to post a new article, so it will show up on LinkedIn updated. This can save time and money, while gaining free advertising through social media.
Track your campaign’s progress. Figure out if activity increased and how much it increased by. When you can make the connection between your actions and results, it will become easier to create a more effective marketing strategy. If you don’t pay attention to the results, you have no way of knowing if your actions worked.
Keep an eye on your competitors’ activities. Follow their social media presence and analyze what they are doing. You could either try using a similar method or think of something they have not yet started.
Your website should include relevant social networking widgets. Widgets are great tools that can rapidly increase visibility of site. Also, a widget can allow readers to re-tweet or vote on your content right from your page.
TIP! Always make it easy for your website surfers to find your profile on the social media they use through subscription. You can provide your visitors with up-to-the-minute communication by staying in touch with them through Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin or other networking services they use.
Research the concept of social networking. You might keep a Facebook profile already, but using it for business is very different. There are many useful Internet resources and professionals who can advise you with any difficulties you are having.
If you haven’t mastered social media in a few weeks, continue to press forward and learn. People don’t just flock to a new profile overnight, so you have stick with it for a while to realize success with social media marketing. Expect to see growth withing a year’s time, and don’t get impatient.
Never fear asking for assistance with a social media marketing campaign. The market is massive, and professionals exist who can formulate a social media marketing strategy for your company. They are expensive, so you will need to spend a lot if you choose to go this route.
TIP! You want to have the option of opening up a one-on-one dialogue with your customers. People love it when they have a one on one relationship with a company.
There are many services available that can help businesses to manage their Twitter accounts. They offer a number of services. One typical service is automatic follow-back of people who choose to follow you. Another is automatic unfollow of users you have chosen to follow who do not return the compliment in a timely manner. This can help you keep your friends list under control, and also find new friends that have your interests in mind.
When you are looking to create content to put on your Twitter of Facebook, make sure it is proofread. Keep in mind that it is always important to remain professional. Though some Twitter abbreviations are fine, remain cautious when using them. Your content should be attractive, concise and relevant.
You need to keep close tabs on all online content that is being posted about your business. Errors in social media can quickly become viral, causing embarrassment to the company. Negative publicity can sometimes have a bad effect on sales for your company.
TIP! Your website should be tied to your other social media pages. Add sharing buttons on your site or blog so that your readers can share your content with their friends and comment on it.
Follow a successful strategy with well defined step and boundaries when launching your social media marketing operation. With millions of people active on social media sites every day, launching your business on these sites may seem intimidating, but your potential exposure and resulting profits are nearly endless.

Business is being brought to the exchange by an extensive and experienced global intermediary network, which includes some of the leading players in the wealth management industry.
To be considered for the Exchange Officer vacancy you must be a banking operations professional with at least five years experience of private banking transactions management.

Hi! My name is Kajal Jain and I might want to welcome you to my site. Give me a chance to take a few minutes to give you the opportunity to inclination to know me...
In his role as Kantor for the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, Bach composed cantatas to be sung by the choir as well as organ preludes, toccatas and fugues based on chorale or hymn melodies, to be performed as an integral part of the service. He published these keyboard works in several editions under the title Clavier-Übung (Keyboard Practice). The so-called “St. Anne’s” Prelude and Fugue takes its nickname from its similarity of the melody to a British hymn tune by William Croft (1678-1727). Like folk melodies, hymn tunes often spring from unknown sources and often bear striking similarities to each other. Bach did not refer to St. Anne in his own title, and it is not known whether he was even familiar with the British melody. He included the “St. Anne’s” Prelude and Fugue in the third volume of the Clavier-Übung in 1739, but it is not clear exactly when in his career he actually composed the piece.
During the Baroque, individual keys were thought to have properties that could evoke specific emotions in the listener. This idea was just an aesthetic construct in an era when there was no standard reference pitch (such as A=440) and every local organ may have been tuned to a slightly different standard, but for Bach, key designation was important. The key of E-flat, with its three flats, symbolized the Trinity, as did the tripartite thematic structure of both Prelude and Fugue. Bach compiled the Clavier-Übung III into a symbolic liturgical superstructure mirroring Luther's version of the Mass, including chorale settings of the Kyrie, Gloria, the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Communion. The volume opens with the Prelude in E-Flat Major, continues with the aforementioned liturgical settings, and concludes with the Fugue. The two “bookends” are often performed as a typical prelude/fugue combination and have been transcribed for several instrumental combinations.
The Prelude is based on three themes, a majestic dotted-rhythm figure in the style of the French overture, another sedate melody, and a little internal fugue. The French overture theme recurs as a refrain. The Fugue is also in three distinct parts: a formal exposition introducing the fugue subject, which resembles the St. Anne hymn; the second in 9/8 (3x3) meter into which the tune is artfully woven; and a second fugal section.
Living in a highly regimented society and in constant fear for his life, Dmitry Shostakovich frequently used his chamber music to express his most intimate and personal feelings. He was the only Russian composer of note to express his revulsion at the brutal regime in his music and survive to tell the tale. Censorship and official criticism forced him to evolve a hidden complex symbolic language in order to get these works approved.
Shostakovich was a true son of the Russian revolution and, as teenager, a true believer. But he got caught up in the Stalinist nightmare, surviving the purges of the 1930s only because Stalin liked his propaganda film scores, which he cranked out by the truckload. World War II brought a breather and an upsurge of patriotism, the horrors of the 30s being temporarily forgotten. But hopes for a more liberal society were dashed in 1946 with a
resurgence of purges, suppression and disappearances, orchestrated by the cultural commissar Andrey Zhdanov. Hopes rose again in 1953 with the death of Stalin, which brought about some relaxation and liberalization. But the roller-coaster of official approval and disapproval continued, although the fear of exile and threat to life diminished greatly. Shostakovich came relatively late to string quartets, writing his first in 1938, after his
Symphony No. 5. It was not until the late 1940s that he began to produce a steady stream, finishing 15 in all by the time he died, nine shy of the 24 he had hoped to complete. In 1960, his popular Quartet No. 8 was a musical retrospective on his music and his tribulations. Immediately upon completing it, he sat down to write another one, No. 9, which was to be a "children's work (about toys and excursions)." But the sketches did not please the composer and he burned them, stating that it was the second time in his life that he had done “such a trick,” the previous time in 1926. It took until the summer of 1964 before he sat down and in quick succession wrote his Ninth and Tenth Quartets.
During these years, Shostakovich married his third wife, Irina, a young literary editor in a music publishing firm. Like his previous marriages, it was an impulsive act, but unlike the two earlier ones it was a happy union. The composer expressed his thanks by dedicating the 9th Quartet to his young wife. The Quartet No. 9 is in five movements played without pause. It is dramatic and mostly upbeat in mood, except for the fourth movement Adagio, which recalls in its harshness the grimness of his Quartet No. 8. It is dangerous to interpret music according to the biography of the composer, but Shostakovich poured so much of himself into those works created without political constraints that the temptation is irresistible. The Ninth Quartet seems, indeed, to reflect the influence of its dedicatee. The gentle murmuring and light-textured dancing quality of the first movement can surely be understood as a love token. Likewise, the jaunty Allegretto is genuinely funny, a playful polka that horses around with different string textures and combinations.
The contrast in mood, however, in the fourth movement, quickly throws cold water on the fun. The effect is reminiscent of Beethoven’s Quartet, Op. 131, in which the composer created the same effect between the Scherzo and sixth movement. In the passionate and complex final movement, it is difficult to decide towards what or whom the passion is directed. On the one hand, there is a general agitation so typical of Shostakovich finales, but there is also a wonderful dance tune that interrupts the storm. And halfway through the movement, it stops dead in its tracks as if to reconsider where it’s going, only to decide to get back on the dance floor. Still agitated, but not hysterical.
In November 1822, Prince Nikolaus Galitzin, a Russian amateur cellist who had once lived in Vienna and admired Beethoven’s music, asked the composer for three string quartets, telling him to name his price. But – typically for Beethoven – it was not until June 1825 that the first of these quartets, Op. 127, was finished. At the time, Beethoven’s personal life was in chaos. Now completely deaf, he was embroiled in both physical as well as psychological turmoil. Unable to handle his own affairs, the composer was living in conditions best comparable to a modern teenager’s bedroom. In addition to poor physical health, which was in part the cause for the extended delay in fulfilling the commission, he also suffered from paranoia, which took itself out in his stormy relationship with his nephew Karl, ultimately resulting in the latter’s attempted suicide (thought to have been caused by Beethoven’s possessive hectoring).
Yet despite everything, Beethoven was at the apex of his creative powers. After a 15-year hiatus, he went back to the string quartet medium with enthusiasm, creating the five works that are considered together as the “late Quartets.” In Opus 127, he already was demonstrating an entirely new conception of the genre. He increased the complexity and even-handedness of texture, and introduced new structures and harmonic language.
The Quartet opens with a thematic structure often referred to as “statement and response.” The statement is marked Maestoso, and quickly morphs into a more lyrical Allegro response. It is restated twice later in the movement, each time more forcefully, in a different key, and with new, expanded renderings of the response. There is a remnant of a “second-theme” idea from conventional sonata-allegro form, which Beethoven introduces in the minor mode, an unusual move for a piece in a major key. Beethoven and Schubert took the old theme-and-variations form to an entirely new level. No longer merely a series of increasingly decorated versions of tunes with a formal repeat structure, the variations emerge organically from each other. The theme and six variations that comprise the second movement of the quartet include no exact repeats and vary greatly in length. Their relationship to the theme sometimes seems tenuous, and it is no coincidence that the Quartet follows the Ninth Symphony by two opus numbers, when we compare the slow movements of the two works.
The Scherzando third movement opens with four pizzicato chords that lead to the theme in the cello, immediately inverted by the viola. Increasingly prone to abrupt changes in mood, Beethoven suddenly shifts gear in mid-stream. The whirlwind Trio, whose opening two legato notes balance the pizzicato opening of the Scherzo, also suddenly morphs into another universe. Curiously, Beethoven gave no tempo markings to the fourth movement, but the music calls for a fast pace. The first theme contrasts with a quick-march second one that dominates the movement; both themes have a folk-like quality, which became increasingly popular in finales over the course of the century. As in the earlier movements, however, Beethoven throws in some surprises: some funky dissonances and a foot-stomping passage in case audience members have fallen asleep. The extended coda introduces a totally new mood in a new time signature (6/8) by stretching the themes and expanding them to create a lyrical interlude before the end.

I thought I would have a little fun with my artistic side and try my hand at doing a book cover. This was just for play and I know the images aren't even any good. Just some random stock images I found off the site I usually use. If I continue to practice I may consider doing my own covers one day, but we shall see. It's still fun to play every once in a while and take a break from the usual day to day grind.
Really really good...your current covers that are professionally done are awesome but it seems to me that you have the ability to do your own work here...don't sell yourself short!!
Wow thanks Heather and Gniz. @Heather, I found the images at Dreamstime. @gniz, thanks for the support. I would really love to do my own covers. I think I will practice for a while and see about doing my covers for my "Freaked" series, which won't be out for quite a while. I will definitely share my cover journey with you all though. :-)
Yeah, I really like the last one too! It would be cool if you posted the stock images so I can see what you're putting together. I like to see the befores and afters. :)
“Life is a path. On that path you might stumble and fall over a small rock, and possibly meet a warm person lending a helping hand. You will also find a small chair to catch your breathe. At the end of that path, you can find family.”
The family’s natural journey begins. Birth is the moment where the baby takes his first breaths and a new door called ‘parents’ open for the couple.
In Natural Birthing, the medical staff accurately conveys the meaning and significance of birth and through continuous communication, proceeds with the necessary tests according to medical standards and individual’s unique situation. By teaching the mother to start exercises that aid nutrition, relaxation, and breathing helps reduce the unknown fear and become a proper guide. Also, we discuss the birthing environment along with your midwife, thoroughly explain all the possibilities that may occur during childbirth and help prepare you for the immense change quickly approaching.
To help promote health and natural birthing, MediFlower is running a Natural Birthing Class involving various techniques to help the birthing experience through natural means such as exercise, breathing, nutrition, and rehearsals. Also, through this education the couple gradually realizes that birth isn’t an experience for the mother alone, but natural progress of life the mother goes through with her husband.
A midwife is usually assigned to mothers who are about 30 weeks in their gestation. A midwife uses her extensive experience to safely lead the mother through the whole process of prenatal care, nutritional supplements, labor and birth, breastfeeding, and newborn care.
Medi Flower’s Birthing Center is staffed by nurses and midwives 24 hours a day for postpartum and newborn care. For any questions please call your midwife.
At Medi Flower, we have International Board of Lactation Consultants (IBCLC) and are running a breastfeeding clinic to facilitate the quick recovery of the mother and the healthy growth of the baby.

Twenty years ago I began teaching relaxation to veterans and others suffering PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder).
One of the most effective methods to help them relax, as well as using specific yoga postures was teaching the Yoga Nidra technique.
The method of systematically relaxing certain body parts helps the brain to relax and in doing so allows the entire nervous system to begin to move into the para sympathetic state. This relaxes the diaphragm sufficiently to begin conscious breathing.
Find a quiet space to lie on your back (bolster under knees if your back is uncomfortable also small one under neck if necessary).
Let your arms release away from your body, palms turned upwards. Your feet will rest hip width apart, with your toes falling outwards. If they don't, start a small jiggling movement through your entire body to ‘loosen up’.
Gently close your eyes, a eye pillow (with natural fragrance of lavender oil) can be nice to relax the eyes. Check your body is symmetrical, imagine a line running from the crown of your head down through to the centre space between your feet.
Bring your attention inwards and become conscious of your breath. Don't let the mind fall into judgement, rather become the observer of the breath. The gentle in breath and the gentle out breath.
As you move through the meditation take as long as you need to at each stage. If you are unable to connect with any body part, simply apply a little tension to that area and then release with the breath.
As we go through the physical body, if you come across a part of your body that you can’t actually feel then just slightly tense it, the release it. Pay a little more attention to this area.

In 1997, the Roth IRA was introduced. This new IRA allowed for contributions to be made on an after-tax basis and all gains (or growth) to be distributed completely tax-free. Since then, people with incomes under $100,000 have had the option to convert all or a portion of their existing Traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs. Beginning in 2008, participants with funds in eligible employer sponsored plans could also roll those funds directly over to a Roth IRA in a qualified rollover if their income did not exceed the $100,000 threshold. Starting in 2010, all IRA owners and participants in eligible employer sponsored plans, regardless of income level, are eligible to convert their Traditional IRA and pre-tax funds in an employer-sponsored plan [401(a)/(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b)] to a Roth IRA. Is this a good option for you? A conversion has both advantages and disadvantages that should be carefully considered before you make a decision. This calculator compares two alternatives with equal out of pocket costs to estimate the change in total net-worth, at retirement, if you convert your Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA.

According to a recent story in Yahoo Sports News, Championship tennis player, Novak Djokovic recently switched to a gluten free diet after seeing a nutritionist and being allergy tested positive for gluten. Since then,he had won the Davis Cup and the Australian Open. Additionally he has been in the U.S. Open finals and is currently on a 39 match winning streak.
Many adapt the diet because they have developed a gluten sensitivity related illness, but what are the implications for someone who is not overtly sick. It is my own clinical experience that athletes are often able to improve their performance and endurance by going on a GF diet. Why?
The protein is known to cause abnormal immune function, inflammation, malnutrition, and more. The problem is that gluten can cause all of these issues silently (hence the term silent celiac). For example, an autoimmune reaction against the muscle tissue can occur for years before it becomes clinically recognized. If this happens to an athlete, recovery time and muscle strength will be affected. Another example is the autoimmune reaction that occurs in asthma (a well known condition induced by grain ingestion). If this happens to an athlete, lung function and oxygen capacity are affected, thus reducing the athletes aerobic capacity.
Not only is it possible for a gluten free diet to improve athletic performance, it is common. In my clinic, I see it all the time. The spectrum of how people react is wide. The following two examples illustrate this.
Gluten (and other food intolerance issues) Destroyed Ian’s ability to be an athlete. See his story here…
Gluten free diet made this young athlete stronger and shortened his recovery times. See his story here…
Gluten-free food has become popular and profitable — but sometimes products labeled “gluten free” — aren’t. Now, the Food and Drug Administration is preparing strict new standards – and that’s a relief for people who are allergic to gluten
(CBS News) Gluten-free food has become popular and profitable — but sometimes products labeled “gluten free” — aren’t.
Now, the Food and Drug Administration is preparing strict new standards – and that’s a relief for people who are allergic to gluten.
CBS News correspondent Elaine Quijano reported Jennifer Shannon is a careful shopper, double-checking labels to make sure the food she is buying is gluten-free.
Shannon told CBS News, “If a company is going to sell me a product based on the fact that it’s gluten-free, I think they should be held accountable for it.”
Shannon has celiac disease, an allergy to gluten, which is a protein found in common grains like wheat, rye and barley. About three million Americans now suffer from this disease, which can have a wide array of symptoms, such as bloating, constipation, problems digesting food, numbing feeling in the extremities, and for some sufferers a rash.
Right now, the gluten-free label on the products is not regulated — something the FDA is looking to change by establishing a tough new standard for labeling foods as gluten-free.
Gluten-free products have gone mainstream and are big business, ringing up $2.6 billion in sales – up 30 percent in the last five years. Kelloggs’ new gluten-free Rice Krispies is now a top seller.
Some celebrities are even advocating a gluten-free diet for health benefits alone. But not all doctors are on board.
Dr. Peter Green, director of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University Medical Center, told CBS News, “A gluten-free diet is not necessarily a healthy diet. People who are on a gluten free diet for an extended period can become iron-deficient and B Vitamin deficient.”
Shannon said, “Gluten-free food is the only medicine for celiac. It’s the only thing available and it’s a cure essentially. It’s how you heal yourself through eating and so knowledge of what’s in the food you’re eating is very important.”
The new standard, “Early Show” co-anchor Erica Hill noted, matches the one already in place in Europe. It’s expected to take effect early next year.
IF Helene Godin had decided to rethink her life at a different time, a bed and breakfast might have been her chosen fate. Or perhaps a little independent bookstore with a marmalade cat, good coffee and some comfortable armchairs.
But this being the second decade of the 21st century, Ms. Godin chose a different course after she quit her job as a Manhattan lawyer, resolved to temper her workaholic ways, and set out on a second career. She opened a gluten-free bakery.
So did Edie and Dan Irwin in Los Angeles after their graphic-design business faltered in the recession. (Their specialty is artisanal gluten-free bread.) And Christine Reed in Ashford, Conn., when she concluded that working as a buyer for a manufacturing company did not fulfill her soul. And Michelle Gillette in Bayport, on Long Island, when she gave up teaching high school Spanish. (The grand opening of her gluten-free bakery and cafe, called Ms. Michelle’s Urban Gourmet, took place on Memorial Day weekend.)
As long as there have been jobs, there have been fantasies about leaving them. Often this involves escapes to pretty settings (the proverbial bed and breakfast in Vermont), or fitness nirvana (ski instructor), and, if not financial reward, at least no irritating co-workers or domineering bosses (in fact, usually no bosses at all).
Some fantasies run their course; owning a little country newspaper, a common daydream of past generations of journalists, has all the allure of a migraine these days. But into the vacuum usually come other ideas more illustrative of a particular moment. And so it is today that we find the growing appeal of gluten-free, not just as a dietary regimen but as a professional Plan B.
Who even heard of gluten (or the lack thereof) a decade ago? The estimated 1.3 percent of the population who had celiac disease, which is basically an inability to digest gluten, did, but the general public awareness was minimal.
Now, many more people know that gluten is a protein contained in wheat, rye and barley, and it has a crucial elastic quality that holds together the ingredients of breads, cakes, cookies, pasta and most any other baked good you care to name. Those who are allergic to gluten, or who simply have a hard time digesting it, can’t eat many desserts or dietary staples like pizza or sandwiches.
Even those who can eat all the gluten they want increasingly have some vague idea that it’s healthier not to. Certainly many weekend athletes took notice recently when the tennis star Novak Djokovic partly attributed his stunning 40-plus-match winning streak to his gluten-free diet.
So naturally, gluten-free has become a growing business concept. The Gluten Free Registry (glutenfreeregistry.com), a database, now lists more than 19,000 “gluten-free friendly” establishments around the world. The Chicago Tribune named “gluten free” one of its top 10 buzzwords a few years ago. Ms. Reed’s gluten-free vegan bakery, called Shayna B’s & the Pickle (after her two dogs), got a big contract last month when it was hired to supply the Wesleyan University graduation with 1,300 gluten-free blondies, biscottis and chocolate chip cookies.
Helene Godin didn’t think or care about gluten — or baking, for that matter — when she was catching the 7:01 train to New York City every morning. In a 22-year career as a media and intellectual property lawyer, she had held some big, wonderful jobs — including positions at NBC, Reader’s Digest and Bloomberg.
She loved it. But, acknowledging her workaholic inclinations she said, “I realized I needed to stop.” With the encouragement of her husband and teenage sons, she walked into Bloomberg one day last spring and quit on the spot. “I’ve decided I don’t want to be a lawyer anymore,” she said.
On a recent Thursday morning, Ms. Godin was tending to last-minute details before her grand opening, which was to happen that Saturday, complete with a ribbon-cutting ceremony by Representative Nita M. Lowey. Everything looked perfect.
The door handle to the shop, on the main commercial thoroughfare in the Westchester County town of Hastings-on-Hudson, was made of a French rolling pin. The walls were freshly painted in a cheerful yellow (shade: buttercream) and rich brown (chocolate). Delectable raspberry muffins, ginger cookies, coconut cake, lemon cake and four-layer chocolate cakes lined the countertop. (She was offering samples to her many testers in town, not to mention to a reporter.) Neighboring merchants dropped by with good wishes. The liquor store guy came bearing a bottle of wine.
“I didn’t quit with any plan whatsoever,” Ms. Godin said. With her free time, she enrolled in a baking boot camp at a culinary institute (vegan baking, since that was the class with spots available) and came up with an idea. She had known she wanted her next act to be local (no more commuter trains), and ideally appealing enough that her sons would want to stop by on the way home from school. A bakery seemed to fit. Yet a regular bakery wouldn’t do it.
The baking boot-camp instructor had told the class that gluten-free was “hot” these days. Ms. Godin wanted to start a business that would be “a destination” for people in neighboring towns. People might not drive to Hastings for a raspberry muffin, she reasoned. But they might make the trip for a supremely delicious, healthful, gluten-free raspberry muffin, especially if allergies kept them from eating the regular kind. And she was going to work until she came up with the best, tastiest gluten-free treats around. “I didn’t want to do muffins that tasted like beans,” she said.
The trick for Ms. Godin (and herein likes the key for many gluten-free entrepreneurs) was not to turn off regular, allergy-free customers by trumpeting that all the offerings are gluten-free. Hence the name she came up with: By the Way Bakery (no “gluten-free” in the title). The concept: boy, this is delicious and, by the way, it’s gluten-free.
The appeal of gluten-free bakeries speaks to the current interest in food and health, and to our allergy-laden times. It also has that all-crucial Plan B element of providing joy, satisfaction and pleasure to others.
Ms. Gillette, the former Spanish teacher who opened a gluten-free bakery last weekend, spent her summer break teaching a baking class for children a few years ago. She found a startling number of them could not eat the treats they made because of allergies; the most common allergy was to gluten. “There’s nothing like seeing a five-year-old make a chocolate chip cookie and she can’t dive into it,” Ms. Gillette said. “It kind of broke my heart. I told myself I’m going to have to teach myself how to be a gluten-free chef.”
A number of gluten-free bakers, like Taylor Nicholson, a former litigation consultant, and Anne Hoyt, a former banker, were drawn to the business because of their own health issues. The pair, who are mother and daughter (Ms. Hoyt is the mother), suffer from celiac disease. After altering their own diet and cooking habits, and with the encouragement of friends, they decided they could put together a viable business selling the products of the gluten-free recipes they’d devised. They held their breath and quit their jobs. Their Wholesome Foods Bakery in East Dallas opened just over a year ago.
“It was very scary in the turbulent economic situation,” Ms. Nicholson said, “to quit a job that had a good career path for my mom and I. But I think we had a lot of faith in our product.”
So far, so good. “It’s been incredibly fun,” Ms. Nicholson said. “Owning your own business, your mind never shuts off. But it’s different, and we’re so passionate about what we’re doing.”
For others, gluten-free is a different sort of Plan B, a way to pick up the pieces after a previous professional life faltered. For years, the Irwins had been lucky to have corporate clients from the booming mortgage business for their graphic-design business, who had ample need for commissioning of logos, advertisements, invitations and other designs. The biggest lender of all, Countrywide Home Loans, was their biggest client.
Then came 2008, when Countrywide became the public symbol of ineptitude and corruption in the mortgage business — and the Irwin’s business went down, too.
But Edie Irwin had always loved to bake. She had already been doing some work on the side for a vegetarian restaurant and was becoming interested in gluten-free. “I’d tasted a lot of gluten-free bread and thought, ‘Wow, this stuff is terrible,’ ” she said. “I thought I could do better and thought because I didn’t need to eat gluten-free, I could hold it to a higher standard.”
So when the partners in that restaurant had the opportunity to buy a gluten-free bakery in Culver City, outside of Los Angeles, they asked the Irwins to join them, take a one-third ownership stake, and take over the running of the business.
The Sensitive Baker, as their bakery is called, is growing fast. “I spent years sitting in my office and didn’t realize how much I wanted to be out talking to people,” Mr. Irwin said, citing another important quotient to most people’s Plan B equations.
Elsewhere in Los Angeles, Paul and Marilyn King were going through a similar crisis. Their business, a contracting company that built and maintained commercial buildings across the country, had done very well for 20 years. But when the real estate industry collapsed, their business did, too.
“I was pretty much in a state of depression,” Mr. King said. “I didn’t want to do anything, I didn’t know what to do.”
In the past, his wife had conducted a side business baking wedding cakes and other custom cakes for friends, business clients and members of their church. She’d stopped a few years earlier after learning she was gluten-intolerant. But with their economic livelihood in a shambles, she came up with an idea to give it a try again, this time focusing on gluten-free products.
“One day my wife comes to me and says, ‘I’m going to start a bakery,’ ” Mr. King said. “I wasn’t the most supportive husband: ‘The worst economy in our lifetime — you want to start a business? Gluten-free?’ ”
He agreed to it as a “stopgap source of income.” Today it’s become an all-encompassing enterprise; their business, Tia’s Bakery, now sells gluten-free products in health and natural-food stores across the country, including Whole Foods stores in 14 states.
“There was a certain satisfaction in putting up a 10-story building,” Mr. King says of his old profession. “But it can’t be matched when someone thanks you for something you’ve given them that they haven’t been able to have.”
Nevertheless, the prospect of their gluten-free enterprise ever becoming as successful as their commercial real estate business is a long shot, Mr. King acknowledged. “Anyone who thinks they’re going to start a food company as we did, with no money, better be passionate about it,” he said. “If you’re in it for the money, good luck to you.”
There has been quite a buzz recently over a new vaccine for those that suffer from Celiac Disease. Will it successfully treat the autoimmune disorder and eliminate the need to adhere to a gluten free diet?
July 22nd, 2010 the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute announced that a group of Doctors and Scientists had identified the three protein fragments toxic to people with Celiac Disease. The research group headed by Dr. Bob Anderson head of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute’s Coeliac Disease Research Laboratory, published their findings in the international journal Science Translational Medicine.
The Doctors and Scientists studied more than 200 Celiac Disease patients. The patients ate bread, rye muffins or boiled barley. Six days later, blood samples were taken to measure the strength of the patients’ immune responses to 2700 different gluten fragments (peptides). The responses identified 90 fragments as causing some level of immune reaction, but 3 gluten fragments were revealed as being particularly toxic, causing the majority of immune response in those with Celiac Disease.
Dr. Anderson, who is also the CEO of Nexpep Pty. Ltd., a Melbourne based biotech company, incorporated these findings of the 3 proprietary peptides to develop a ‘peptide-based’ immunotherapy. The goal; create a vaccine to desensitize people with Celiac Disease to the toxic effects of gluten by injecting patients with small amounts of the three toxic peptides. This is based upon the same principles as desensitization for allergies.
The Phase I trial undertaken in Melbourne, Australia, evaluated the safety, tolerability and bioactivity (T-Cell Response) of the vaccine developed by Dr. Andersons’ Nexpep Pty. Ltd., known as Nexvac2. During Phase I trials weekly injections were administered over a three week period. 34 healthy celiac patients of the HLA-DQ2 genotype who were on a strict gluten-free diet took part in this trial. 19 subjects were given the vaccine while the others were given a placebo. Three different dosages; 30 micrograms, 60 micrograms and 90 micrograms were administered to the 19 subjects. Subjects experienced some nausea and gastrointestinal distress, but these symptoms were worse for patients receiving the highest doses. These patients had gastrointestinal symptoms similar to what they’d experience after eating gluten products and included vomiting. One subject receiving 90 micrograms withdrew from the study due to extreme gastrointestinal distress. Dr. Anderson and team believe this suggests the vaccine uses the correct peptides for eventually being able to tolerate gluten.
As a Mother of a child with severe Celiac Disease, and a wife whose husband has silent/latent Celiac Disease, I question the current and future efficacy of this vaccine. Several questions come to mind when I read the details of this study. Dr. Anderson and his team found 2,700 gluten fragments (peptides) in the patients systems after ingesting wheat, barley and rye. Of those 2,700 they believed that 90 fragments were causing a reaction to gluten. The team then determined that the worst reactions were caused by 3 fragments, so that is where their focus lies, on only 3 of 2,700 potentially toxic peptides.
Another concern is that all grains contain gluten. Dr. Anderson and team have only studied the effects of wheat, barley, and rye in this trial. I have not found, in any of my research, their plans to incorporate other grains into their testing methodology. Dr. Anderson admits that many Celiacs on a strict gluten free diet (a diet restricting wheat, barley and rye) still show signs of damage to their small intestine 2-5 years after removing gluten from their diets. Could it be that healing has not occurred because Celiac patients have not eliminated all gluten containing grains from their diet?
While the news of this vaccine sounds promising Dr. Anderson and team will not know for many years whether these 3 “proprietary” peptides are truly the ones that cause damage to the small intestine. We must also keep in mind that to date this vaccine has only been given to 19 people, those who carry the HLA-DQ2 genotype. This genotype accounts for the majority of Celiac patients, approximately 80%, however, efficacy for patients who are HLA-DQ8, HLA-DR3 and those with Gluten Sensitivities has yet to be determined.
Dr. Anderson’s Nexpep Pty. Ltd. was brought into the U.S. market, and is now ImmusanT. Leslie J. Williams, a former venture partner with Battelle Ventures is now President and CEO of the privately held startup, and Dr. Anderson holds the position of Chief Scientific and Medical Officer.
It is expected that ImmusanT will begin Phase 2a trials of the Nexvax2 vaccine within the year. The goal of Phase II is to demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the body’s rejection of dietary gluten. Anderson believes that upon repeated Nexvax2 administration, the number of gluten-specific T cells capable of triggering a pro-inflammatory response will subside, and regulatory suppressor T cells will increase in number to establish tolerance to dietary gluten.
Future plans for ImmusanT include collaborating with INOVA Diagnostics to improve and eventually replace the current testing substrates (including endoscopy) for Celiac Disease diagnosis. Work to discover peptides for other variants of Celiac Disease (HLA-DQ8, and HLA-DR3). Prevent Celiac Disease with Nevax2 in genetically susceptible patients, and use the vaccine for patients with IBS that respond to a gluten free diet.
Almost everyone remembers having Rice Krispies when they were a child. Soon, children who suffer from gluten sensitivity will be able to enjoy the classic snap, crackle and pop in the morning as well.
According to the Rice Krispies Facebook page, the new cereal has already begun to ship out, so you should see it at your local grocery store soon.
“We heard the strong desire from people within the gluten-free community, especially parents, for more affordable foods that they can serve their families, and we are helping to fill that need,” said Doug VanDeVelde, senior vice president of marketing and innovation at Kellogg’s.
The cereal will be produced in a separate facility that has been making gluten-free products for nearly a decade. Kellogg’s has guaranteed that each batch of cereal will be tested to ensure it is gluten free.

Homeowners love concrete, for both interior and exterior use. Outdoors, large expanses of concrete can create environmental problems, though, as they block stormwater from draining off into the soil. The solution? Pervious concrete is a material that provides the strength and durability of standard concrete, yet permits rain and melted snow to drain easily and naturally.
We consulted Hunter McFarlane, construction expert at Lowe’s, for detailed information on the pros and cons of pervious concrete.
Pervious concrete (AKA permeable concrete) is a paving system for driveways, courtyards, pathways, parking lots and more. It’s composed of aggregate particles coated thickly with an air-entrained paste of water and cement, containing very little sand (or none) to increase its permeability. These concrete systems are carefully designed with patterned structures, which allow rainwater and snowmelt to naturally and effectively sink back into the soil.
Permeable concrete is an environmentally friendly paving option for removing standing waters from large spaces of pavement. Its use is included in the EPA’s recommended Best Practices for dealing with storm water runoff.
Pervious concrete is most often used commercially, in large parking areas and paved lots. Residentially, permeable concrete can be used for driveways, pathways, and walkways. Permeable paving can also be applied to low traffic or unpaved roads.
Permeable paving lessens the worry of puddles, holes, mud and loose tiles. Cracks built into the design of the pavers prevent oil and puddles draining from driveways into street water systems. The natural collection of rainfall returns to the soil and recharges the groundwater, reducing pollution and soil erosion, not to mention damage to the concrete.
Drainage systems on real estate properties are becoming expensive, but permeable concrete reduces stormwater buildup, lessening the need for water retention ponds, swales or similar installations.
Pervious concrete may be tinted in various attractive hues, and stamped or saw cut for interesting decorative concrete textures.
Sidewalks and paths made of pervious concrete are accessible to people using mobility aids, such as walkers or wheelchairs, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
It’s necessary to hire a contractor experienced with permeable concrete for successful installation. Proper prep is vital, as the soil must be level and compact, and must have a gravel base initially installed. Then, the subgrade (mixture of gravel) used to create the permeable pavement has to be moistened frequently. The pavement needs to be cured up to seven days after installation to ensure it gains durability and doesn’t dry too quickly.
Permeable concrete is more expensive than other patio, hardscape and garden path options. A package of 18 Gravalock Slim Grid 56, sold exclusively at Lowe’s, is $145.07 ($2.42/sq ft) while a standard, stone paved patio or pathway can range from $1.67 to $2.06/sq ft, depending on size and type.
The choice of sealants for pervious concrete is more limited than for other types of pavement. Seal with a product that allows vapor transmission and apply only a light coat.
Pervious concrete tends to require regular sweeping and occasional pressure-washing to remove dust or plant growth that might otherwise clog the pavement.
Permeable concrete is often used on wide parking lots or spaces of pavement for draining large amounts of water off a large space quickly. For most residential hardscaping, permeable concrete isn’t essential, as the width of most patios, sidewalks, or pathways is small enough to allow drainage on the sides. A typical, comfortable sized 4-ft wide garden path will not block rainwater or call for additional drainage options.
For homeowners who’d like to build a DIY patio, walkway, or garden path, standard stone materials are inexpensive and easy to install without professional help. Drainage rock can be used in the bottom of patio containers to improve bottom drainage and to prevent soil leaking onto decks and patios.

I am still snapping pics of all the food. If you want to know how I make anything let me know. It is all pretty straight forward so far. Simple whole foods either sauteed, baked, roasted, boiled (par boiled mostly) or raw.
I have had a couple of No Scale Victories (NSV). We are not allowed to weigh or measure during the 30 days so we pay more attention to the changes taking place in our bodies instead. I have had chronic sinus congestion for years and I am seeing that slowly go away more each day. My ears are opening up and I am having less and less pressure in them. Another thing I have noticed is that my stomach is more calm and indigestion is lessening. My skin is less red and more healthy looking already and I am not having the blotchiness and bumps like I am having an allergic reaction after I eat.
I am also moving through the phases as predicted. I was pretty on edge on days 4 and 5 and today for day 6 all I want to do is sleep and chill.
I had two of my meals at work and Miss Sherrie has all orange stuff... table cloth, plates, mugs, etc...
The sausage is homemade for breakfast, lunch was a baked sweet potato with avocado and bacon on it. Dinner was a Chicken Primavera that I shared earlier and it is from the Whole30 Guide that was just released.
For breakfast today I had some homemade coconut yogurt with a paleo nut granola and fresh fruit. I had another one of those homemade sausages with it. For lunch I had some paleo turkey chili with avocado and a half a plum. The third picture is my new "toy"... a SPIRALIZER that makes any vegetable just about into spirals. I did zucchini noodles (Zoodles) for dinner with paleo meatballs and a Whole30 friendly Marinara sauce with a side of broccoli. It was very good and I did not miss the real pasta.
I will be having a cup of tea shortly. Most tea and coffee is allowed on this as long as it has no sugar or artificial sweeteners, harmful chemicals, soy or anything else unnatural. I am enjoying my nightly chamomile tea. I have cut coffee to mornings only and the symptoms have been very manageable. I have not had any headaches just some mild body aches and tiredness.
So, tomorrow is one week down and three to go. The next 4 days are said to be the hardest so I might go into hiding. LOL Just kidding... sorta. I am going to be kind to me for Mother's Day weekend.
Hey, Leann! Glad you got through the KILL days and are now in the sleep and chill days. I remember something being said about a day coming where your clothes suddenly feel tighter. Then it passes. I have to go look up which day it is, but I remember thinking that it seemed so odd that it came after being so good for so long. One of those things that just happens in the recovery. I think I would be terribly discouraged at that point and give in were I not aware that it's a perfectly common phase of the journey.
About the spiralizer, I have one that is less versatile than yours. I bought it when I tried going raw. I was very impressed with how good zucchini noodles were. I haven't used mine in awhile. I kind of forget I have that option. But I will try to remember it next time I want to do spaghetti. Sure is better for me than the gf noodles I love. Better on the blood sugar, that's for sure!
Congrats on getting this far! Don't get too quiet! ;) I like hearing about your experiences, good and bad.
Hello, my name is Leann (wife and mom of four). I love Jesus and am not ashamed to say it out loud. I write about food, family, books and other creative endeavors. I write to encourage women to look for the joy in their daily lives. I do this to encourage women to celebrate their home and family life. I hope your time here brings you encouragement as you move through your days.

The other night I was at the park with Kristi and Tyler playing basketball. It was a regular old night, but I turned to look at the lake, and had to take a picture. I've grown up with this park and this lake, and not once have I thought of it as especially pretty...but Friday night...it was.
And then...18 mosquitoes bit me at once and ruined the moment. But...for a minute at least, I was totally in love with nature. Hee hee.

A couple of weeks ago on 12/12/12 I wrote a post titled 12 Things For 12/12/12. That one was more a post about stuff I believed in, more of an opinion piece. This one is something quite different.
I decided to do a post on things this blog addressed in 2012. This particular post is #199 on the year, and since we all know I’ll have at least 2 more posts, if not 3 more, by 12/31, it’s easy to say that I’ve written more than 200 posts this year, which is actually down for me and yet has made for a more comfortable blogging year, especially since I added 2 more blogs last year.
I talk about multiple topics in the video, and to get you to watch the video I’m not going to necessarily tell you what all those topics were. However, I did have these 12 titles and links that I briefly mentioned in some fashion, which is what the video was based on. So I’m going to give those links beneath the video. It’s about 20 minutes long; I was shooting for 10 minutes but there’s no timer! I did it using Google+ Live Hangout, which means anyone could have been watching, except I started it around 12:45 or so in the morning, so I doubt anyone saw it live, and that’s just fine. Hey, at least I know Brian will watch it, though I mentioned Sheryl, Ileane, and Holly. 🙂
Blogging Blogging, blogging topics, Business, health, I'm Just Sharing, Mitch Mitchell, motivation, Social Media, Writing
I know the title of this post could seem confusing to some people, but to others they’re probably only now getting another introduction to who I am. My name is Mitch Mitchell; has been for, oh, at least 35 years or do. “Mitch” isn’t the first name I was born with; no, I’m not giving it, but for some people it’s not hard to find. I just don’t choose to use the name, haven’t since I was 16, but people who met me through someone else who gave them the other name tend to use it . Since I don’t like it, I just choose not to tell it to anyone, even if my main organization is called T. T. Mitchell Consulting, Inc.
For all the years I’ve been blogging I’ve always gone by Mitch. It really hadn’t occurred to me to have it being anything else. Yet, at some point near the end of last year I figured it was time to start putting my entire name into blogging. I really hadn’t thought much about it until I started writing my posts about influence. Realizing that I wanted a bigger slice of the blogging and overall internet and social media pie, and other reasons, it suddenly came to me that many people by this time might know “Mitch”, but they didn’t know “Mitch Mitchell”.
Of course, just saying that means nothing without some background. So, here’s a part of the thought process for it all, something that you might think for yourself at some point.
1. I have a lot of articles on the internet. I have my EzineArticles posts. I have articles on my S&S site. I have articles on a lot of other websites that I’m not going to list. I’m in a lot of regular magazines as well, many of them health care related, but other topics as well. I started thinking that it would be easier for people who might see some of that stuff to realize that I’m the same guy who was writing all that stuff, even if it’s across the board.
2. There’s one prominent Mitch Mitchell and one a little less prominent that I’m competing in name against. Let’s face it, I’m not going to overtake the Mitch Mitchell who used to play drums for Jimi Hendrix any time soon, deceased or not. His first name wasn’t really Mitch either, but John. There’s also a reporter for the newspaper in Fort Worth whose name I see all the time; being born in Fort Worth, that’s a strange coincidence to say the least. I think I compete with him on a regular basis; at least in the top 50 listings of the name I come up at #16 because of my business blog, and at #23 because of this blog. As a matter of fact, out of the top 50 listings only 2 of them aren’t me or the drummer, and none of them the reporter; I can live with that. 🙂
3. There’s another “Mitch”. Actually, I’ve known of Mitchell Allen of Morpho Designs for many years, but our paths rarely crossed until fall of last year when we both ended up on BloggerLuv (which I’m not putting up a link for because it’s possibly gone forever, as it’s not showing up anymore for now) and started talking. Suddenly, being “Mitch” didn’t make much sense anymore with their being two of us showing up in a lot of the same places, and he’d always had his last name attached so it made sense that I do it as well.
4. For that matter, there are a lot of “Mitch’s” out there, even some female ones. Sure, my image accompanies me on most blogs, but I’ve found that if you don’t have a Typepad account your image won’t show up there. Suddenly, I’m just “Mitch” on the wind without any real recognition of who I might be. At least being listed under my full name will get me fairly quickly on a search engine; just the first name wasn’t going to cut it.
5. Of course, my business name is T. T. Mitchell, and I could have gone with that, as I did on LinkedIn. However, it’s so weird having people calling me “T. T.” there, and I’m trying to figure out if I can change it. In the long run whenever I meet people and they call me that I tell them to call me Mitch, and I realized I didn’t want to get into that kind of confusion across the board.
And there you go. It might seem like kind of a complicated process, but I’ve noticed many of you who comment here use both your first and last name, and since I have a long range goal for using my full name it makes sense for me to change over to it now. From a marketing standpoint, it seems to be a no-brainer. In my opinion, it’s much better than a keyword name any day of the week. What are your general thoughts on the subject?

For handsome friends, who are as gorgeous as eggplants and as elegant as a row of corn — and the others — as plain as potatoes, and so good for you.
For funny friends, who are as silly as brussels sprouts and as amusing as Jerusalem artichokes, and serious friends as complex as cauliflowers and as intricate as onions.
For friends as unpretentious as cabbages, as subtle as summer squash, as persistent as parsley, as delightful as dill, as endless as zucchini, and who — like parsnips — can be counted on to see you through the long winter;
For old friends, nodding like sunflowers in the evening-time, and young friends coming on as fast as radishes;
For loving friends, who wind around us like tendrils, and hold us despite our blights, wilts, and witherings;
And finally, for those friends now gone, like gardens past, that have been harvested — but who fed us in their times that we might have life thereafter;

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang's Remarks on Shooting Incident at the Premise of the Chinese Consulate-General in Los Angeles
Q: It is reported that on the early morning of August 1, local time, an unknown gunman of Asian origin fired multiple gunshots outside the Chinese Consulate-General in Los Angeles. Can you confirm this information?
A: At about 6 a.m. local time on August 1, an unidentified man opened fire outside Chinese Consulate-General in Los Angeles and no one of the Consulate was killed or injured.
The Chinese side takes this incident seriously and has already made serious representations with the United States. China requires the United States to solve the case as soon as possible and take concrete and effective measures to ensure the security of the Chinese diplomatic missions, institutes and personnel in the United States.

Amid the recent crackdown on dissidents by the Chinese government, the case of Liao Yiwu, the well-known poet and chronicler of contemporary China, is particularly interesting. For years, Liao’s work, which draws on extensive interviews with ordinary Chinese, has been banned by the authorities for its provocative revelations about everyday life. In early July, amid a worsening atmosphere for artists and intellectuals critical of the Chinese government, Liao fled to Germany via a small border crossing to Vietnam in Yunnan province.
Liao first came to prominence in 1989 when he recorded an extended stream-of-consciousness protest poem called “Massacre” about the Tiananmen Square crackdown. He was subsequently arrested and spent four years in prison, where he met the series of outcasts and misfits who became the protagonists of his first book on China’s underclass. Written in the form of questions and answers, these stories became symbolic vignettes about people from a range of offbeat and unusual professions or situations. Some of them were translated in The Paris Review in 2005, and they were collected and expanded in the 2008 book The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories, China From the Bottom Up.
Now, one of Liao’s other three books, God is Red: The Secret Story of How Christianity Survived and Flourished in Communist China, is about to be published in the United States in September. It tells the story of Christian persecution in the early Communist era, mostly in minority areas of Yunnan province. He has also written a memoir of his four years in prison that has just been published in Germany to wide acclaim. His fourth book, on China’s new underclass, has yet to be published.
I recently spoke with Liao at Berlin’s Literaturhaus, where he easily blended in amid the tourists and would-be hipsters. His head clean-shaven, he appears younger than his fifty-three years, a short, powerful man who often lapsed into a thick, Sichuanese dialect. He talked about his decision to flee, his new book, and how he plans to continue his work from afar.
Ian Johnson: The Chinese newspaper Global Times said Liao Yiwu is not in exile. It said you’re just on holiday and that nowadays it’s not so strange for Chinese to go abroad for extended stays. They say your decision to go to Germany has to do with marketing your books. Are you really in exile?
Liao Yiwu: I never said I wanted to go into exile or flee. It’s just because if I didn’t my books wouldn’t get published. I guess I won’t go back for a while. I’m doing publicity for the prison book now, then I’ll go to the U.S. for my Christianity book. Then Taiwan for the Chinese edition of the prison book. Then back to Germany, where I have a one-year DAAD fellowship in Berlin. So when that’s all over, I’ll see if they haven’t forgotten me.
They said, “two books of yours can’t be published overseas.” One is the prison book. The other is the God book. They said both are unacceptable. So I talked with them and asked why. They asked me to sign a paper [promising not to publish]. They said these were “illegal cultural products.” They said these two books disclosed secrets.
Yes, especially the first half of the year. Ahhh, I don’t know. I think it’s the government’s own problem. That call for a Jasmine Revolution. They took it so seriously but it was just something someone posted on the Internet. It didn’t exist, but after it was posted they came by all the time, asking and asking. No one had heard of it! They’re nervous.
My writing is illegal … I don’t know. I’m just writing something and now have broken their law. I don’t want to break their laws. I am not interested in them and wish they weren’t interested in me.
The prison book is pretty cruel. I was serving time in Chongqing. At one point they tortured me so much I smashed my head against the wall to try to kill myself. I passed out and then over the next few days the non-political prisoners came by and said, “Hey buddy, if you really want to kill yourself that’s a stupid way to do it. A better way is like this: you find a nail sticking out of the wall and smash your temple against it. It’s much more effective, believe us.” So this book is maybe more cruel than the others. The authorities said to me: “If you publish this book we’ll send you back to Chongqing.” There’s no way I’m going back there. That’s too terrifying. They said we don’t care about the Mao era. You can write about that. The ’50s and ’60s are okay.
Yes, but the religious question in China is so great that it’s also forbidden, especially the subject of Christianity. I didn’t consider this when I was writing it. Haha, if I had thought of that I wouldn’t have written it [laughs]. They say it’s illegal to publish it abroad. This is strange. It’s a secret if foreigners read it, but not if Chinese read it. So it’s a secret for Ian Johnson to read, but not for me [laughing].
Me, I’m the kind of person who doesn’t have a definite plan. I had this opportunity to meet the Christians and it moved me so I did it.
It’s like this. I was in Yunnan trying to interview the last landlords of China, the ones who were persecuted in the early communist years. I met some people who told me about these Christians. I went to meet them. It was a really poor place. Unbelievably poor. No electricity, no roads, no telephone. We walked four or five hours to get to one village. But I thought this was so unbelievable. You’d get to a village and there’d be a church. Westerners had been there before, a century earlier, and built these churches. It was remarkable. They worked in these villages until 1949 when the Communists took over. The foreigners were expelled and a lot of the Christians killed. The stories are unbelievably cruel. In one case the father was executed and left on the side of the road. The family wasn’t allowed to pick up the corpse. When I heard this I cried.
There are too many stories about China! People say, “you won’t have anything to write about here,” but the problem is I can’t write them all. There are too many.
In some of the other books, no. But in this case [God is Red] I did. But when I write down their answers I try to make it sound as good as possible. I’m a writer so I want to use all my skill to write their stories.
I had a copy of [the classic Chinese novel] Romance of the Three Kingdoms and made tiny notes that I put in the book. It was really difficult, but in this way I was able to recover a lot of memories. These books are different. God is Red was difficult because I had to walk a lot of roads and eat a lot of bitterness, but I was glad to be able to write it. They were moving stories. But the prison book was difficult to write. It was painful.
Yes, on the new underclass: some of them are unemployed, others simply don’t fit into society. But I’ve got more. I have seven or eight books I can write. I have a lot of material on me. I don’t lack material.
I’m already fifty-three years old. I’ve lived through a lot. The 1980s were a golden age for Chinese thought and literature. Then came 1989. Then came the reforms and the economic growth. No one thought the Communists would be so tough and strong. It’s caused all these waves of immigration. After they took over there was a big wave of immigration as people fled. Then after 1989 there was another wave of about 100,000 who left. Now there’s a new wave of people leaving, even though the economy is so good. At least among many artistic people it’s like this. You can’t do anything meaningful in China. If you return you have three choices: flee, sit in prison or shut up. I had to flee. Liu Xiaobo and Ai Weiwei weren’t able to flee but I was. It’s probably because I interviewed a lot of these underclass people so I understand how the police think. That allowed me to figure a way out. I have contacts in the underground.
Sure, communication is never a problem. I like Berlin. East Berlin has a lot of underground bars that remind me of China. There’s one street there with a lot of prostitutes. I’ve been there many times to observe and watch how different German prostitutes are from Chinese prostitutes. The Germans are more polite. If you don’t want to, they leave you alone. In China, several will fight over you.
I’d like to publish in China but since 2001 I haven’t been able to. In the 1990s it was difficult but then after 2001 nothing at all. There is a lot of illegal, underground publishing. Most is related to sex. A friend told me I’ve got some good news for you: your book on the underclass is competing with the sex books! That was funny. But the two books coming this year are the ones I most value. They are the most personal and have moved me the most.
[Sighs] Slowly they’ll understand. For example, if I’m arrested they have to deliver food to me in prison—it’s a burden for them [laughing]. All those trips to the prison [laughs]. I’ve spared them those trips …
She does, but she wishes I wasn’t mixed up in politics. But I’m not. I’m not interested in politics. I’m not like Liu Xiaobo. I didn’t write a Charter 08. I did sign it. The police asked me why I signed it and I said I don’t know, I just felt like it.

I like being able to import all the data into a spreadsheet and immediately jump to receipts. When I photocopy them on a scanner bed it’s hard to quickly find what I need but with this you can click on the name and jump right to the receipt. Wish I knew how to edit the pdf easier if I need to add or subtract a receipt and I wish that I could just download instead of email the information and then download it
This gets better and better. I’ve been using it ever since it came on the market, and wouldn’t be without it!
This app replaces my scanner, does a better job and is just plain fun to use. I’m entering all receipts for business and personal and am able to keep them separate.

In its own unique way, personal property tells the story of life. The first half of life is about acquiring as much personal property as we can reasonably house, and the second half is about trying to get rid of it all.
As young adults, we acquire our own places to live and rush to fill these yawning, empty spaces. If we’re lucky, we prosper, have families and move to ever larger quarters. These new spaces call for more furniture and decoration, and the children clamor for more toys and accessories. Many of us go on to fill garages, sheds and storage units, as well.
Eventually, the day comes when the children launch and begin their own acquisition campaigns. The parents, now entering the second half of life, begin to contemplate downsizing so they can spend more time travelling and less time vacuuming. Every inch of their four-bedroom house is occupied by papers of unknown origin, outgrown clothing, inherited figurines from the prior generation, boxes of grade school art, prom dresses, toys, framed art, photo albums, craft supplies, holiday decorations and excess furniture.
The prospect of sifting through all this personal property and making hundreds of decisions about its ultimate disposition is simply paralyzing. The dread associated with this task may be the single greatest reason 85-year-old widows wind up alone in those four-bedroom houses, still surrounded by mountains of items. They want to move to assisted living, but there are only two rooms there. Somehow, they have to get rid of six rooms worth of stuff, and they have put this chore off for 20 years.
An entire industry has sprung up around the problem of personal property. There are appraisers, consignees, estate sale vendors, “pickers”, Ebay stores and charitable organizations that will accept certain donations. It seems there are buyers out there who may want our stuff and a host of merchants willing to assume the role of middle man.
Having helped countless seniors overcome the hurdle of downsizing, and having liquidated large volumes of personal property attached to decedent estates, we offer the following definitions, guidelines and advice for those poised to take this plunge:
Professional, certified personal property appraisers are the great awakeners. Their services may stop us from underselling something of significant value. More often than not, though, it is their duty to tell us that those old pieces of grandma’s furniture are not worth nearly what we might have hoped. However disappointing this news may be, we need to know the truth about what we own and what it may be worth to someone else.
Appraisers charge for their time. They will come out and look at the personal property, conduct research (as needed), and then submit a report noting items of value and their estimated worth.
Some appraisers may offer to buy items from your collection. While convenient, it is generally not good business practice to sell something to the very person who has just apprised you of its worth.
Consignees are professionals who offer to sell personal property on your behalf without buying it themselves. They typically have a large database of prospective buyers and/or a storefront where they will offer your merchandise for sale. They make a living by keeping a percentage of the sale price.
Consignment is a good option when the appraisal reveals that you have a small number of reasonably valuable items amidst a sea of more commonplace merchandise. The consignee will take those few things of value, leaving you free to sell or donate the lesser items.
Pickers buy things outright. They come in search of items they can re-sell on Ebay or at flea markets, and many are seeking particular types of items for which they know they have a market. Many tend to take small items (hats, framed art, collectible figurines, board games) they can carry away with them. We typically ask these vendors to pay in cash.
Not all estate sale vendors are the same – some operate at the high end of the spectrum, and others at the low end. Many will review your appraisal report to determine if you have enough merchandise of value to make a sale viable for them. Estate sale vendors, like consignors, keep a percentage of the total bank at a sale. They have to advertise the sale, prepare for it by tagging all items, and staff it, so there are quite a few associated expenses. If they don’t feel your sale will generate enough revenue to cover their expenses and leave them with a bit of profit, they will likely decline.
Estate sales are most appropriate when the volume of items to be sold is large (i.e. an entire household). Plan on having to get rid of unsold items – not everything will sell. Cars can be included, and often serve as anchor items to attract buyers to the sale.
Auctions are conducted off-site by professional auctioneers. Like consignors and estate sale vendors, these professionals are compensated with a percentage of the sale proceeds. They will take only those items they feel confident they can sell. Some auctioneers have websites on which you can track the sale. One of the central benefits of this option is that the saleable merchandise is off site and out of the way if the house is being prepared for the real estate market.
Goodwill and Salvation Army are among the better known charities interested in personal property. This is a gift, of course, and not a sale; the estimated value of the donated items can typically be used as a tax deduction, however. It should be noted that charities are very well served these days and impose limitations on what they will accept. Some charities no longer take books, stereo and TV consoles, old computers, and metal items (file cabinets). It is well worth it to call ahead and ask them what they do not accept.
Some charities still visit neighborhoods and collect items from the doorstep. There are limits here, too. Most will tell you exactly how much they will take on a given visit (i.e. five boxes, ten bags) and when they will take it – they may only visit your neighborhood once every six weeks, and you will have to wait.
If a client is moving to a senior living community, we often recommend that they move first – taking just the personal property they need and can accommodate in the new space – and then allow us to tackle the remainder. Not everyone can afford to move without first securing the proceeds from their home sale, but there are definite benefits to being out of the fray when the liquidation process is underway. It is stressful and rejuvenating all at once to see the property go.
We acquire….and later we liquidate. This seems to be the natural order of things, but the undertaking of this effort feels anything but natural. Please call us at 630-953-2154 if we can be of assistance in “weeding the garden” of someone you know.
For more information regarding our senior property services, please call 630-953-2154. Our staff is ready to help answer the questions you may have.

For the final activity in this session, we'll look at an interesting application of ratios that again demonstrates the amazing patterns that emerge when we examine mathematics.
Fibonacci was the nickname of Leonardo de Pisa, an Italian mathematician. He is best known for a sequence of numbers that bears his name. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 1, 1. Each new number is then found by adding the two preceding numbers:
The Fibonacci numbers are found in art, music, and nature. You can find them in the number of spirals on a pine cone or a pineapple. The numbers of leaves or branches on many plants are Fibonacci numbers. The center of a sunflower has clockwise and counterclockwise spirals; the numbers of these spirals are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
Examine a pineapple, looking for its three different sets of spirals. Use a toothpick to mark a starting place, and hold a pencil at the bottom of one spiral. Count the number of spirals of this type, moving the pencil as you count. Stop when you get back to your starting place. Now count the spirals in a different direction.

At a non-descript cafe on the side of a non-descript street in Da Nang, I sipped a cà phê sữa đá and thought of a recent conversation I had with my mother before leaving for Southeast Asia. I was having a coffee then as well, and I had mentioned that caffeine tends to keep me up at night if I have it too late in the day. My mother made an incredulous face and said, “That’s because you don’t work hard enough. If you work hard like your father and I do, you can fall asleep right away.” To me, that was a strange thing to say because my mother doesn’t work (and has never really worked), unless you call unnecessary clothes shopping a form of employment.*
So there we were in Da Nang, proving her point. We were getting tired of constantly bouncing from one place to another and the Southeast Asian heat followed us around, quietly beating us into submission. A friend in Saigon suggested Da Nang as a quiet place to hang our hats for a while so we trusted her. The city itself doesn’t look like anything special, and is as unassuming as they come. But look a little closer, and there is an empty, beautiful beach lining its eastern coast, a lush peninsula to the north and some damn good food.
We did the required touristy stuff like checking out the Bodhisattva of Mercy on Son Tra peninsula (we called her “The Lady”) and spending the day exploring the Marble Mountains. While both of these places were pretty interesting in their own ways, what we enjoyed doing the most was chilling by ourselves during the day and getting the more local experience with our new friends at night.
Beaching was very much on our list of priorities so we made a beeline for a private beach on My Khe. Well, not really a beeline, because we skirted around the main entrance to the hotel and entered through the side entrance to the beach like a couple of sketchy mofos… I guess we kind of are. Don’t get me started on privatizing beaches in these developing countries. We had lunch at an overpriced but decent restaurant next to the beach, soaked up the cleanliness of it all and pretended for a moment that we were guests of this overpriced resort.
The next day, we loaded up on lychees and dragonfruit at the local market and made our way to the public beach area. We pretty much had the area to ourselves, save for a couple of young European girls sunning and a couple of pale Korean girls who were hiding from the sun under the beach umbrellas. We swam in the warm water, caught little crabs, played with dead ones and did the stupid kind of stuff people who haven’t been to a beach in years do. I came home with a ridiculous, patchy sunburn like a total amateur.
And the next day we did it again, but this time with more fruit, a delicious take-away lunch from a noodle place, and more slatherings of sunblock. In addition to the beach chairs which we rented for $1.50 each, we rented inner tubes which added a whole lot more to the entertainment factor. Late in the afternoon, a small group of fishermen started hauling in their net and N helped for about one minute before letting them do their thing. It took them a good two hours of slowly pulling in their catch by letting the strength of their backs and legs do the work. Two hours of work yielded a surprisingly small catch of baby squid, cuttlefish and small fish, but we were told later that the morning haul brings in a bounty of big fish and squid.
However, the city really came alive after the sun went down, when the locals came out of the woodwork to hang out in the slightly cooler temperatures. The otherwise empty beach totally transformed at night into a social hub. It would start filling up with locals around 4pm when we were getting ready to leave. The ladies renting chairs and umbrellas would wake up from their daytime naps to set up chairs closer to the water, and a woman selling or renting colorful kites set up her stand in the sand nearby.
At 8pm every night, locals gathered in droves to watch the Dragon Bridge (which looks like something from an amusement park) spew jets of mist from its mouth. Middle-aged women from a dance class danced with the most unenthusiastic expressions on their faces to tango music, led by their flamboyant young dance teacher. Young women and men sat outside cafés on small stools to people watch. Parents watched their children run around and climb on the random marble sculptures by the river.
These ladies are having a lot of fun. You just wouldn’t ever be able to tell because they act like their families are being held hostage until they dance for their freedom.
To fully immerse ourselves in the nightlife of this quaint little city, we hung out with a Couchsurfing local Nha and her buddy Hai. During the week and a half we spent in Da Nang, these two put us on the backs of their bikes and zoomed around from one place to another. Nha is a purchaser at the Intercontinental in Da Nang (I think it’s the most expensive hotel resort there, and starts at around $500/night), which sounds like a pretty sweet job. Hai is fluent in Japanese, and works for a company that sells airline industry products to Japan.
This was the first time we spent so much time with young Vietnamese people, and they taught us about their city over local delicacies. We pigged out on what they call “junk food” — delicious savory snacks that young people like to eat — and Nha laughed and shook her head when I told her this is what we would call “bar food”. People don’t eat junk food with beer, she explained (I still think they’re missing out on this potential combo). They both tried to keep it together while N busted out her rusty pre-Unification Vietnamese and gave them examples of phased-out words she had been using with her family her entire life. On the backs of their bikes, we talked about Vietnamese customs versus our own. It really says a lot about a place when young professionals like Nha and Hai say that they want to live in Da Nang for the rest of their lives because they love it so much.
Nha and Hai showed us how this small, modest-looking city — most often only seen as a way-point to a more desirable holiday destination like Hoi An and Nha Trang — was definitely the best city we’ve spent time in since we landed in Saigon. Food was varied and delicious (this area is great if you like seafood), it wasn’t as congested as Saigon which made it easier to walk around, the vendors were still friendly without being annoyingly pushy, there were fun albeit kitschy sights to see, tourist-packed and pricier Hoi An was close enough for a day trip (40 minutes by car or bus) and we just couldn’t resist having an empty beach so close by.
About halfway through my lazy days in Da Nang, my mother emailed me to tell me that it looked like I was having fun and that she wished she too was on the beach. When I responded and told her to join us somewhere so we can hang out, she responded, “I would but I’m very busy.” And I imagined her primping before happily heading out to hit up a sale with her sisters. She was so missing out.
* I’m kidding about my mother not working. She works very hard to keep us fed and taken care of, and for our house to be in tip-top working condition. AND she moonlights as a professional lacquerware artist.

If you've been on a house-hunt around Houston and nearby areas, you've probably heard your agent or maybe other men and women mention Infinity Title. Many homeowners and individuals in the real estate sector might by now be acquainted with the name. But, newbies and first-time homebuyers might have an interest in the information that Infinity Title is actually among the biggest Title Insurance Companies currently operating in Houston, Texas.
The company has been handling real estate closing transactions and title insurance policies since 2007. Being around for in excess of a decade, Infinity Title has eased thousands of homebuyers, sellers, and lenders through the closing process. In turn, the company has acquired unique as well as valuable perceptive of the market that only time and knowledge is able to impart. As the company grows, so does its client base. In 2017 alone, Infinity Title attended to almost 1000 closing transactions.
But what's title insurance and precisely why is it important, you ask? Let us break down the points.
First of all, a title company validates the legitimacy of a real estate title. They are necessary players in ensuring and defending the rightful ownership of the purchaser as he or perhaps she acquires a property. To make positive that the title is valid, the company does a comprehensive search and examination of records and papers so as to find out Infinity Title that not one other party stake a claim on the property for sale.
The title insurance also works to this end. The title search, no matter how thorough, is not a hundred percent foolproof. A title insurance policy safeguards the interests of both buyer and also lender in the unfortunate occasion that any dispute over the ownership of the property arises in the future. These disputes rarely happen, but when they do, the legal fees and financial repercussions are tremendous burdens. It won't hurt to be ready.
You will find 2 sorts of title insurance policies. The lender's as well as the buyer's insurance. Some lenders may just need to have one - the lender's coverage, but we recommend you purchase both. As stated, a bit of foresight goes a very long way. If sometime in the long term, someone claims to be the rightful owner of the home of yours and it is proven that the title is really wrong, the title company will be obligated to pay you out and the lender the amounts you invested as well as lent for the house respectively.
Infinity Title Company Houston is committed to producing quality customer care through every level of the closing as well as insurance process. With this regard, it has its own in-house attorney in the person of the founder and owner himself, J Paul Caver. Possibly it's fitting to point out that Paul Caver graduated cum laude from the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law and is Board Certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization in Residential, Commercial, and Farm and Ranch Real Estate Law. That said, he and his company are actually much more than skilled at carrying out closing transactions and keeping them on track.

Let’s just be honest. C-level leaders don’t take a lot of web surveys. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t NEED their feedback. It also doesn’t mean they don’t WANT to share feedback.

Today's cold, blustery Western New York weather brought a nice variety of birds to the feeders. I also noticed our heated bird bath getting some use too. I haven't seen too many birds actually bathe in it, but I've seen many American Goldfinches drink from it. I keep it clean and it's heated. I suspect it isn't placed in a spot that affords enough protection. I read the bathers feel nervous if they can't fluff after a bath in a place that provides some protection. I am going to move the bath this spring to see if that helps... But today, at least, the bird bath offered some nice, warm water, for our cold friends! Enjoy the variety; I sure did!

Chai Lattes are my absolute favourite hot drink, and TeaPigs Chai tea comes in a very close second. Now I am aware that we're very much in Summer, but that doesn't mean Chai spiced things are out, right? So I decided to put a recipe that I found in my 'Domestic Sluttery' book to the test. The book claims to provide ways for women to 'cheat their way to a perfect lifestyle', and is full of recipes, cocktails, little house decorating tips, and general life hacks. It's a real coffee table book, and I personally love browsing through it... mainly because it's so beautifully presented, but also for the useful and often funny little tips and tricks. Anyway, I tweaked the recipe slightly and the cakes turned out really yummy, so I thought I'd share with you all! You will need:
450g icing sugar 200g soft butter a drop of milk 1 tsp vanilla extract Step 1: Preheat your oven to 175°c (fan), and line a baking tray with cupcake cases. Step 2: Heat your milk in a pan on a low heat until it's simmering. Take your milk off the heat and add your teabag. Leave it for no longer than 1 minute before removing it, and let the milk cool.
Step 3: Mix all your spices together, and add most of this to your flour, along with the baking powder. Add all the spices if you plan on making a plain vanilla icing (or lemon, or orange... lots of flavours work!)
Step 4: Cream your butter and sugar together, add the eggs and vanilla and beat everything well. Add the flour and the milk gradually, alternating between the two. Make sure you have a smooth consistency that's not runny, but will drop off a spoon.
Step 5: Fill each cupcake case on your baking tray two thirds full and bake for approximately 15 minutes. They should be golden brown and cooked in the middle. Step 6: To make the icing, simply mix your butter and icing sugar together, and add any flavours you would like. This could be the leftover spice mix, a bit of cinnamon, or some other yummy flavour.
Hi everyone! My internet is back, I have returned from an amazing trip to Alton Towers for a few days, and I am ready to catch up on my blogposts, read about what you've all been up to, and start writing again.
I begin with the third and final photos from my day in Kew Gardens, in a post which features my favourite Rock Garden (which is prettier than it sounds, I promise!), the colourful Plant Family Beds and a beautiful Peacock. So if you like pretty photos, pretty flowers, and pretty animals then continue reading...
To anyone who thought the idea of a Rock Garden sounded dull and boring, then just take a look at this.
Words cannot describe the beauty we entered as we walked through this arch. The Plant Family Beds are slightly further out than a lot of Kew's gardens, but because of this they're also incredibly quiet and peaceful - don't miss them out if you visit!
If you've been reading my blog for a while then you will know how much I adore lakes. They just seem so tranquil and peaceful, and I'm not surprised that I found this beautiful blue lake in a place like Kew.
We passed by a duck nesting next to the lake, and I was really glad to see that the area around it was well bordered off so visitors couldn't disturb it! There were so many ducklings about as well, but they were all busy running about with their mothers, and I don't like annoying the poor animals!
I wanted to end my post and my trip to Kew Gardens with this great picture of a Peacock, because they're such incredible creatures! They're also very photogenic (as far as animals go), which is probably down to the fact that they're also hilariously vain. This particular Peacock was slowing turning around in the middle of a large group of people, all taking pictures and admiring the feathers. He was definitely a complete show off, and provided some great entertainment for his audience!
Who needs to decide on one cookie flavour, when you can make these Half & Half Cookies and have two? These are the perfect solution to those indecisive baking days, and they are not only delicious, soft and chewy, but also look pretty unique.
I got the idea for these from Sally’s Peanut Butter Swirls, but as I don’t like peanut butter in my cookies, I used and adapted the recipe for her Chocolate Chip Chewy Cookies.
Step 1: Mix together the flour, baking powder, cornflour and salt in a large bowl. Move half of the dry ingredients into another bowl, and add the cocoa powder to this bowl. This will be your chocolate half.
Step 3: Pour half the wet ingredients into one bowl of dry ingredients, and the other half into the other bowl. Mix together with a large spoon or rubber spatula.
Step 4: Add the chocolate chips to each bowl and fold them in. Cover the dough with a tea towel or cling film and chill for 2 hours, or up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory because it helps the softness and it prevents your cookies from spreading in the baking tray.
Step 5: Remove both bowls of dough from the fridge and leave them at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Pick up almost a tablespoon of normal dough, and the same of chocolate, and mould the two together so that they form one cookie. If you want smallish, thick cookies like mine then flatten the dough as I have done in the picture above. If you want thinner and large cookies then flatten them even more. Place each finished cookie onto a greased baking tray.
Step 6: Bake your cookies for 11-13 minutes at 175ºc (fan oven). Your cookies will seem slightly undercooked but that is what makes them extra soft and chewy!
Okay, so this may be a slightly dramatic title, but a little incident has left me realising how easy it is (especially as a blogger) to rely a lot on the internet, and the online world in general.
On Tuesday, we attempted to switch internet provider. They intended to cut off our broadband at 8am, and said that it would be back by midnight. At 10 o'clock there was no internet, and no update, so my Dad called up only to be told that our transfer had been delayed for a week. A week. After a few hours of frustration and questioning as to how this was possible, and how such a large internet provider could just cut off our internet with no promise of it being fixed for another week, myself and my sister began to brainstorm ways to entertain ourselves minus the internet.
I know a lot of people who don't rely on these kinds of things, because they aren't particularly interested in technology, they don't own smartphones, and they have barely even heard of YouTube. I am not one of these people, although sometimes I wish that I was!
I have come to realise in these past few days that although the internet is essential for many things nowadays due to the fact that so much is online, it is not essential for entertainment, nor is it essential for happiness.
The conclusion of this little incident is that I have compiled a list of things to do that don't require wifi, to help me in the future and anyone else who relies a heck of a lot on the internet and wants to take some time out to enjoy life without online distractions!
1. Read something new Search the house for books that you may have never gotten around to reading, and text a few friends to see if they have any they would like to let you borrow. I read the whole of The Fault in Our Stars (great by the way, I cried every few pages) in less than a day on Tuesday. I then felt incredibly proud of myself and productive for the rest of the day!
2. Brainstorm, plan, and write lists Use this time to get seriously organised with minimal distractions. Plan blog ideas, write a travel wishlist, plan your next few friends birthday presents, anything!
3. Get crafty Normally I would say browse Pinterest or the internet for inspiration... but that obviously requires the internet. So think about something you've never got round to completing, or even starting. I have a DIY post or two that I really want to get a start on and I think it might actually happen now that I have less distractions!
4. Spring Cleaning It's so therapeutic, trust me! This also goes with number two in the sense that it's a great time to clear your head, and try to organise your life.
5. Have a movie marathon I haven't watched any of the 50+ DVDs on my shelves for quite some time, so I've been picking out some of my favourites from when I was a teenager and passing some time watching them.
6. Go exploring Walk everywhere. Wonder everywhere. Don't go back home until you have completely come to a halt.
7. Spend time baking and cooking I know some of my readers feel like they can't cook or bake, but if you have lots of time on your hands then why not dedicate a big chunk of it to learning some baking basics? Chocolate chip cookies? Cupcakes? A classic Victoria Sponge? Your family and friends will thank you!
8. Edit photos Unless you use an internet editing program. If you're anything like me, then you take as many photos as possible of something in the hope of increasing the chances of getting a great photo. Then you end up with 200 photos of the same flower to sort through and edit. If you use an offline program then no internet is a great opportunity to focus your mind on producing some great edits and getting those photos organised!
9. Go outside No seriously, just leave the house. Or make yourself a nice cocktail, sit in the garden and have a little quality time with your notebook. Be inspired by your surroundings, and hopefully it won't rain or you'll have to scrap this number on my list.
10. Fill in the blank. I really can't deal with only having 9 points so here is one for you to think of something yourselves! (Or you could just find your nearest free wifi coffee shop and sit in there for the whole day. I am currently in Cafe Nero but only to post this, I promise!)
I hope my UK readers are enjoying the sunshine right now! And if you live abroad then let's be honest, if we have sun, then you probably have our sun times two.
I decided to dedicate a whole post to The Barefoot Walk experience and The Rose Garden, because the roses were so lovely, and the walk was kind of unusual but a pretty cool experience!
'The Barefoot Walk' is basically a walk along all different ground textures. Now I don't mind feet, but on a whole I like my shoes and socks, and I like my shoes and socks on. The thought of walking barefoot through a woodland intrigued but did not particularly excite me, so I thought I'd give it a go anyway for my mum who was very, very, (and perhaps too) excited about it.
First stop: the pine cones. These were actually kind of nice to walk on, and they didn't really hurt at all!
The walk also featured multiple logs, stones and sand. Now I love stony beaches, because it means I can avoid the sand between my toes and in my flip flops, but when you're walking on stones because you actually have a reason to and need to in order to reach the sea, they feel slightly nicer than they do when you're just walking along them for the sake of it.
My sense of balance is rubbish. I mean seriously rubbish. I couldn't even walk across the stepping stones without wobbling, but then again I blame part of that on Tash, who has an even worse sense of balance, being in front and stumbling about herself.
Tash braved the mud and walked straight through it. Her verdict was that it was smelly, squelchy, and just generally unpleasant! I'm glad I was boring and took the easy route to the side of it! Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who hates getting dirty at all (I mean, I love festivals, so I can't hate mud), but I just wasn't expecting it on a beautiful summers day in the middle of Kew Gardens. Maybe next time!
Anyway, after Mum and Tash had washed their feet thoroughly, we ventured on to (finally) admire the beautiful flowers of Kew Gardens. Our first stop was the Rose Garden, and as Roses are one of my favourite flowers, I was pretty excited and keen to snap lots of photos.
This is a photo from my sister's camera, and it was actually me jumping into her shot and photobombing the roses. I think it adds a little bit of fun to the photo, but she wasn't best pleased!
I'm actually really happy with these two photos. Tash was using her DSLR and when you're taking pictures of things like flowers it's often pretty easy to tell the difference between the quality on my camera and hers. I think my Panasonic Lumix did a great little job of focusing though and I'm pleased with the result!
I hope you guys like this post, and don't mind that I have another one coming up. I am trying to alternate between my Kew posts and other posts though, so if you don't enjoy them then don't worry - the next post will be something different!
If you do enjoy them however, then the third and final part of my Kew series is my favourite. It features Peacocks, Ducks, and in my opinion the most beautiful part of Kew: the Rock Garden (looks better than it sounds, trust me).
There we were having a lovely, sunny walk along the fields with Saffy, my cocker spaniel. She's pretty good obedience wise but she's not the most obedient of dogs, so she tends to run off into the fields and the long grass where I can't see her, and I have to stop regularly to call her back. On this particular walk however, she seemed to generally be in an obedient mood... or so I thought.
Now on this particular walk there are many, many gaps in the hedges which open out onto even more fields. So when I called for Saffy and promptly saw her little face poking out through the gap, I showered her with praise at how clever and sweet she was. My friend was particularly impressed.
Upon reaching the gap in the hedges properly however, I realised that Saffy was not being an angel and waiting for me because I had called her, as I had thought.
Of course, when I shouted at her to get out of the mud she preceded to jump around in it even more, and get as much on her as possible! It's always a game to dogs, but it does make for great entertainment and you can always count on them to put a smile on your face.
She genuinely looks like a crazy little monster sometimes, especially when she is doing her best to get as much dirt on her as possible!
Want to know the healing properties of some popular flowers and herbs? My trip to Kew Gardens last week was not only full of sunshine and beautiful scenery, but also a surprising amount of educational information. There were even some analogies to Peter Rabbit made which did a great job at grabbing my attention... and my camera's!
My mum currently owns a years pass to the beautiful Kew Gardens, and her birthday just happened to be around the time of their special Plantasia event. Plantasia is described as a 'fantastical world of botanical wonders and sensory experiences', and was informative, very bizarre (a barefoot woodland walk?), but pretty fun overall.
Hello awkward outfit of the day. How do fashion bloggers do it? Seriously. Even with no one around, my sister taking the picture was enough to make me feel all awkward and embarrassed!
Can we just appreciate this analogy for a moment? These teacups are just adorable, and although I already knew this about Chamomile, I love how they related it to Peter Rabbit.
Here I am, relaxing in the 'Loveseat' which was surrounding by Mandrake - apparently a deathly plant which was used in Harry Potter. Scroll down to the last picture to see where I realised the love seat was actually awkwardly situated on the giant's body...
Tash was also wearing a pretty Kimono and looking lovely as always. We often get asked if we're twins, and people often also assume that she is the older sister, but we have never thought that we looked very alike at all! What do you guys think?
Oh, the wonderful Pagoda. We bought three tickets to climb the 253 steps and have the chance to see the wonderful views. Mum was so pleased with herself when she managed to get to the top, and even got a certificate at the end which she kept and will probably hang on the wall, knowing her!
Way, way in the distance we could just about make our some of London sights. Unfortunately the picture was taken through a window (opening windows wasn't allowed!) so you can't really see much, but it was beautiful, especially with clear blue skies like this.
And here he is in all his glory. Now you can see where the 'loveseat' is situated and where me and Tash were sat for a good twenty minutes. How embarrassing!
That's it for The Healing Giant and The Pagoda! You may notice that there is a severe lack of flowers in these photos, and that I have left an air of mystery around the 'Barefoot Walk', where you have a 'sensory experience' mentioned at the beginning of this post. The Gardens are massive, so instead of one incredibly and unbearably long post, I decided to split my photos into two. I mean, it might even be three, there are that many photos. In the next few days look out for some beautiful flowers and perhaps even a Peacock...

The time has come for my annual London Summer Bucket List. I made one last year, I've made one this year and I will make one every goddamn year until I have ticked everything off my list. I had a look at my 2015 Bucket List the other day and realised how gushy I am about the city, so I'm going to tone it down a notch this year and just say that I am absolutely buzzing/over the moon/excited/happy/ecstatic about moving over there at some point in the near future. There seem to be so many opportunities in London to go places, meet people, eat wonderful food, drink wonderful drinks, be all cultural and just have a fab time in general, so I've had to narrow my list down a bit to just 10 when really it should be about 50.
This is very touch-and-go because the weather is so god-awful in England but I just think the atmosphere would be so lovely and chill (so long as it wasn't raining). The Nomad Cinema, The Luna Cinema, and Rooftop Film Club are all looking promising, and appear to be showing a range of classics and very recent films, but we'll just have to see.
On the website, Pergola on the roof is described as 'an incredible food court set 170-feet-high under a canopy of flowers and filled with some of London's finest restaurants.' Seriously, how could anyone not want to go there?
Anyone that has been reading my blog for a while will know that I am big on musicals. I mean, big. This year, Aladdin The Musical is on the cards with my family, but I'm also dying to go and see Rebel Wilson star in Guys and Dolls.
Honestly, it is shameful that this still hasn't been ticked off my list. Shameful. I'm looking forward to this when I actually move to the city, and I'm looking forward to meeting a load of new people.
The ArcelorMittal Orbit is apparently Britain's largest structure, it's part of the Queen Elizabeth Country Park and you can go down this great big slide so that sounds super fun.
We have this god-awful picture of me, my brother and my sister standing next to Johnny Depp about ten years and I finally got a new picture the other day when I went with my friend. I'm now almost taller than him which is kind of funny.
My social media feeds are always full of photos from the Carnival over Summer time and I'm determined to go this year.
Yep, still have not fulfilled this wish which I've had ever since it opened. There was one time I nearly got there, but it was a spontaneous decision and I was wearing converse trainers. Big no.
I heard of the one in Leeds, not the one in London but either way, I love a good cocktail and I'm sure I would be completely and utterly in my element if I went to this event.
There's so much more going on in London than what's in my bucket list and I would love to hear your recommendations in the comments! What's your favourite thing about London in the Summer?
We are talking about moon, and it not only used in the field of astronomy, but it has its existence in several cultures at that time when astronomy was not an established field of science.
Here we will discuss about the lunar calendar - a calendar which is prepared on the basis of different phases of moon. As most of us use the Gregorian calendar, there do exist some cultures across the world which resort to the lunar Calendar or we can say the moon phases calendar in now days also.
as we already know that lunar Calendar 2011 is based on the phases of moon's cycle or the lunar cycle. This lunar cycle goes as follows: new moon → first quarter → full moon → last quarter → new moon. In lunar calendars, a month refers to the period between two full moons or two new moons - depending on which lunar calendar is taken into consideration. There are different types of lunar calendars differs from the each other. If we take the example of the Hindu calendar then in that, the month starts with a full moon and ends with the next full moon. If we consider the Chinese lunar calendar, the month starts with the new moon and ends with the next new moon. You can refer to the 2011 full moon calendar for the 12 days of the year wherein you will be able to witness the full moon in the sky.
Considering to these phases of the moon calendar, the first full moon appearance in 2011 is scheduled for 19th January at 09:22 PM (21:22 hours.) On this day the moon will appear very bright and full from the planet. Other than the dates of full moon, the full moon calendar 2011 given above also has the dates of new moon enlisted in it. In Chinese calendar, you can start with 3rd February, 2011, which marks the beginning of the Chinese New Year 2011 – the Year of Rabbit. On a new moon day, it will appear as if there is no moon in the sky and you will have to resort to a telescope to witness this celestial body.

The only hope in the harshness is a 6th Ranger with the power to get the thugs to bug off.
Sunday dawned and I was sad. No Smith & Deli today because they were not open. Thankfully I had planned ahead! I had chilled my chai overnight in the fridge and enjoyed it with some leftover chester scroll before heading into the Forum. And I ate the doughnut for second breakfast during the opening session of the forum.
I will talk briefly about the days' talks here. I went to a talk about the work that the Coalition for the Protection of Race Horses is doing, a talk on intersectionality and diversity (which was a highlight), a talk called 'One Bad Day', which I will talk more about in a moment, a talk on how the meat industry is manipulating people about the environment, a fascinating talk about using psycholinguistics to get our message across, and a talk about share holder activism. All good talks.
I did just want to touch on the 'One Bad Day' talk. Many people who buy into humane meat do so on the belief that the animals have super lives and then 'one bad day'. The first half of this talk was about the totally pathetic regulations governing the transport of live animals, which can include extended periods with out water. The second part of the talk was from an ex-abattoir worker who is now a vegan, about his experiences in the abattoir. This was a hard talk to sit through, and it was very clear that he is still quite traumatised from his time there. It also shed important light on something we don't often talk about in the animal community, about the exploitation of many workers within the abattoir system. He lived in a town where the abattoir was the main employer, and education was minimal, so if you couldn't somehow get out of the town you just went to work at the abattoir. His compassion for his former co-workers, as well as for the animals, was touching.
Okay, that got a bit heavy, so back to food! I had two lunches. The first was an Everything Bagel with Dill Cream Cheese that I had bought the previous day from Smith & Deli. It was so good! Though the seeds went everywhere!
Second lunch was something light, a mix of kale and quinoa salad and spring green salad from Sumo Salad. As well as a green juice, which sounded really savoury but ended up having pear and lemon juice in it so was sweeter than I was expecting.
The reason for the light lunch was because I had big dinner plans at Smith & Daughters. When I was in Melbourne last year on my birthday Leigh and I went here for dinner, but we had just been poisoned by the evil Trippy Taco, and so our dinner was pretty uncomfortable even though the food was great. Thankfully we were feeling better the next morning and had a great brunch there! But this was my redo at dinner. I was hungry and not feeling sick, so things were getting off to a good start! And then they got better. NOM. I started with a delicious grilled apple, lime and mint juice.
There were three of us at dinner, and we shared a bunch of food. This is the Champinones al Ajillo - button mushrooms simmered in a creamy Spanish sauce of Pedre Ximenex, garlic & smoked paprika, served with toasted bread. This was so good, the sauce was drinkable! It just could have done with some more bread for soaking up that sauce.
The Layered Queso Dip was also fantastic. I had this last year, but my tummy was so sad that it was just a bit too much back then. Now, it was super yum! House-made cashew cheese layered over spiced black bean dip, topped with salsa and served with corn chips. There was no wrong here.
The Kale and Leek Bake was a combination of braised leek cooked with kale in a bubbling cream sauce and topped with crispy garlic bread crumbs. Yum.
This huge potato platter was the Patatas Con Romesco Ahumado, crushed and fried chat potatoes with smokey romesco sauce and chimichurri. I suspect there may have been a bit of coconut oil in play here because I did have a faint coconut oil hangover. It was a super generous serving! I love chimichurri and this was great.
And finally the tuna and pea croquettes, described as Spanish bechamel folded with tuna and green pea and served with caper aioli. I was a bit wary of mock fishy-ness, but this was lovely. Not as good as the paella fritters.
We finished our meal with some of their delicious quince-stuffed doughnuts. I seem to have forgotten to take a photo, so here is a photo of them that I took when I was there at brunch last year.
And of course no trip to Smith & Daughters is complete without these little guys as dining companions. The return of Salt and Pepper Ninja!
This dinner was delicious, though very rich! I was a little overcome by food as I waddled back to my AirBnB to get some sleep. I am so happy I finally got to have my proper Smith & Daughters dinner!
I was heading home the next morning, but I left enough time to visit Crumbs Organic Bakery in North Melbourne (not the one in Ascot Vale) for breakfast. I was still a bit full from the night before, but a breakfast of doughnuts helped me through. I had my favourite cinnamon sugar sourdough doughnut, and also branched out and tried the lemon curd filled doughnut, which was delicious! Very good curd. I also had a chai, which sadly was not a patch on the chai from Smith & Deli, but nothing ever is.
I also bought some goodies to take home with me, and for my lunch on the plane. But I was so full that I didn't actually eat until I was home and suddenly in the mood for pastries for afternoon tea. I had bought another cinnamon sugar sourdough doughnut, a Nutella doughnut, and a raspberry and rhubarb pastry from Crumbs. They were all so good.
I shared these with my parents, along with that challah sticky bun I had bought two days before from Smith & Deli. Stored in a snap lock bag in the fridge and then given a quick zap in the microwave, this was incredible! The sticky sweet glaze was rich, like brown sugar, rather than being overly sweet. I could eat an entire one of these and then some!
Crumbs also sells savoury options, and I had bought a spinach, tomato, mushroom and red onion calzone for lunch on the plane. As mentioned I didn't eat it on the plane, but it kept well overnight and I had it for lunch the following day.
Overall it was a really good weekend in Melbourne. The food was great, the people were lovely, the food was amazing... even though I was seriously craving some greens and smoothies by the time I got home. The forum was also a good learning experience, there are so many people out there doing amazing things, I feel kind of inadequate. Hopefully it will fire me up to become more involved! Oh, and did I mention that the food was out of this world?
Between breakfast and lunch I took a trip to the Cruelty Free Shop to pick up some goodies. The Cruelty Free Shop has an online store, but also shops in Sydney and Melbourne. It is the only place I seem to be able to get my favourite Tropical Source chocolate chips, and they have a lot of other goodies as well, so it is well worth a visit if you are in the area.
After shopping, it was back to Smith & Deli to meet up with a friend for lunch. This is their awesome sign out the front of the shop.
It was a lot busier at lunch time, particularly because this is when they serve their famous sandwiches! Once we were in possession of our goodies, we headed back to the park for a lovely lunch. I got another chai as well, this time iced because it was hot.
Smith & Deli has an extensive list of sandwiches, which can be a bit overwhelming when you have the chance to just order one. For the month of MoFo, Quinces and Kale reviewed most of these sandwiches, which helped me to narrow it down. I chose the Home Alone - seitan turkey, mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts, stuffing, cranberry sauce and gravy on a roll. It was glorious. Messy, but glorious!
My friend had the Club Sandwiches Not Seals, which he said he loves! I also love a good club sandwich, though the amazingness of the club at Wayward in Seattle is still fresh in my mind. One day I would like to try this club. it looks pretty great!
I also had one of their apple pie spiced doughnuts, which was lovely. Kind of like a cinnamon doughnut but with a hint of apple.
Full from lunch, I headed into the city to see the David Bowie Is exhibit at ACMI. I love Bowie. I have loved Bowie ever since I was younger, when I saw him in Labyrinth. I think there were a lot of us who thought Sarah was an idiot for wanting to take her brother home and not stay there and be with Bowie and be his queen. Incidentally, I have seen those breeches at the Science Fiction Museum in Seattle, where the original Jareth costume is displayed. I also enjoy his music a lot. What I didn't realise is that he is a creative genius! I learnt so much about him, his history, his music and art... it was amazing! It is only in Melbourne until the 1st of November, if you have a chance to see it. Get ready to swoon a bit.
I spent quite a bit of time in the Bowie exhibit, because it was fascinating and it was also a nice break from the hot sun outside. Eventually I went to meet my friend Jess for dinner at Warung Agus, a new-to-me place but one of his favourites. It is not a vegan restaurant, but has a good vegan menu. Sorry for the crappy photos, the lighting wasn't great and my phone camera has decided to have difficult focusing sometimes.
We started with Krupuk Singkong, which is spicy cassava crackers with peanut sauce. This was a fun starter, and the crackers were not too spicy for me. The peanut sauce was good, however no peanut sauce can measure up to the brilliant peanut sauce from Araya's in Seattle.
For our mains, we shared the Tempe Jagung (tempeh in sweet soy sauce with corn, spring onion and spices) and the Tuung Mebasa Santen Lalah Manis (sliced eggplant and tofu braised in coconut milk, sweet soy and spicy gravy), and some rice of course. We also had some Sesaur (shredded coconut with palm sugar and spices) on the side. It was very nice! I enjoyed the nutty friend tempeh, but the stand out for me was the beautiful eggplant. So silky and delicious!
Wow, some of those photos were worse than I realised. Afterwards we took a longer stroll back towards Carlton, and stopped at Casa Del Gelato for some vegan options. The small option here has three scoops in... I am not sure in what universe that is small. Anyway, we had chocolate, strawberry and jasmine. The jasmine was lovely, and combined it was like a super fun neopolitan blend.
The next morning was the first day of the conference, and I headed straight back to Smith & Deli to pick up some breakfast! As well as a yummy chai, I had the Friend Zone, which is a toasted cheese, tomato and ham sandwich. Delicious!
I also got a Chester Scroll to take to the conference for a snack - this had mashed potatoes, gravy, peas and cheese in it. Yes, it was as good as it sounds.
Then it was a tram down to Melbourne Town Hall for the first day of the Animal Activist Forum. I attended some great talks, including a talk on the role sanctuaries play in animal advocacy by Kyle Behrend from Edgar's Mission (complete with super cute photos!), a talk called 'What to say when you don't know everything' by psychologist Clare Mann, an update on Ag-Gag laws in Australia from Voiceless and a talk by Ron Prasad on the five keys to effective outreach.
Lunch wasn't provided at the forum, so I headed to Supercharger at the Emporium for some much needed wholefoods. In the big bowl, the base is butternut mash with sesame seeds and also some fresh baby spinach. This was then topped with avocado tofu smash with tofu and spices, shredded beetroot, carrot, radish and ginger with braggs, fermented daikon and garlic and tahini sauce. In the small bowls, there is braised assorted mushrooms in ginger broth and chickpeas in cinnamon curry. I also had a blueberry, strawberry and sage infused water. It was all great, except for the avocado silken tofu smash. It was advertised as being 'like guacamole', but the tofu taste was too strong and I couldn't really taste the avocado.
After the conference, I headed back to Smith & Deli to pick up some snacks and breakfast for the next day as they are closed on Sunday and Monday so this was my last chance. I bought this box of sweeties. Gluten free raspberry chocolate brownie, sugar doughnut and sticky challah bun.
For dinner, I went on a solo dinner date to Yong Green Food, which is one of my favourite places in Melbourne. I started with a detox turmeric shot, because they are tasty.
I was in need of some greens, so I ordered my favourite Seaweed Salad. This is so light and fresh, I could eat it all day!
I also tried the Tofu Katsu, which is something new. A tofu katsu patty served on a generous bed of coleslaw with brown rice, pickle and katsu sauce. The katsu itself is unique, it is not simply a slab of tofu but is a mix of tofu, shiitake, arame and veggies coated in crunchy quinoa.
When I got home I had the raspberry chocolate brownie I had bought from Smith & Deli. Holy smokes, that was amazing! So perfect, rich, moist, dense, fudgy... such a great deep flavour, not too sweet. Perfect. I could have had a million.
I went to Melbourne over the last weekend to attend the Animal Activist Forum but also to eat a lot of food. I achieved both missions.
Choosing accommodation is important for any trip, and I hit AirBnB with a goal in mind. I wanted to find somewhere close to the Fitzroy end of Brunswick St, and specifically Smith & Deli (more on that later). I found this absolute gem. Perfect location, easy walk to all the food (7 minutes to Smith & Deli), a tram stop right outside to get you to the city (where the conference was), but also very walkable if you are keen for a stroll (took me under 20 minutes to walk home from Melbourne Town Hall). If you are looking for a place to stay in Melbourne I recommend this one, plus there is a cat called Max!
Anyway, back to Smith & Deli. Smith & Deli was opened this year by the people who run the amazing Smith & Daughters, and I have dreamed of going there forever! I got in on Thursday afternoon, made my way from the airport to my AirBnB and then went straight to the Deli. I arrived too late to have one of their famous sandwiches, but it was more afternoon tea time anyway and boy did they do afternoon tea well!
I had a vanilla slice and a jam doughnut. I am not sure if there was some coconut fat in the vanilla slice, because I did feel slightly ooky afterwards, but it was so good while I was eating it. The passionfruit icing was perfectly tangy! And the doughnut was good as well, with a hefty dose of jam in the center.
Thursday night is trivia night at Cornish Arms, a pub that has a separate vegan menu. I was super excited to meet up with my friend Michelle for trivia. A Sydney friend Elizabeth (aka MC Pony) also came along, plus some Brisbane vegan friends who were also in town. We came third (with a bunch of other teams), but really it was about the food. I had been looking forward to their weekly vegan special of Peking Duck Pancakes, but they were all out! Devastated! Elizabeth and I ended up sharing a pizza and a pot pie. The Hawaiian pizza was, I'm sad to say, really not that great. The toppings were uneven, and their inclusion of large chunks of strange and fatty mock chicken were out of place. The crust was pretty average as well. Michelle had the Souvlaki pizza (also pictured here), which she said was good, it certainly looks more appealing.
The pot pie we shared was much better, though was really more a shepherds pie with a cheesy mash topping rather than pastry. I think the filling was based on the Lamyong meaty mushroom chunks. The gravy was outstanding! Chips are always welcome, and I was glad of the peas as a spot of green in an afternoon and evening of very beige eating.
Brisbane friends Bec and Carol both had the parma, which I didn't get a photo of but it is hilariously giant. Bec chowed it down with impressive gusto!
But my eating didn't end there. I had also bought a cute mini lemon and raspberry cheesecake from Smith & Deli and it was waiting in the fridge for me when I got home. Amazing. Beautiful buttery biscuit base with a tangy light creamy center. So good.
The next morning I was straight back to the Deli for breakfast. It was not very busy there, and the lovely staff answered all my questions about coconut oil content of different things (sadly the croissants were out for me, they are only available on Saturdays if you are interested in them). I ordered my first of several delicious chai lattes. They make the best chai! And I also ordered and Egg McMartinez, which has a tofu egg, bacon and cheese (BioCheese, which is coconut oil based but a single slice does not hurt me), I also got some aioli with it. This was super yum!
And then I went back to the Deli immediately for second breakfast. Another chai and a delicious Vegemite and Cheese scroll.
In this day and age, there are so many replacement vegan products available that it is very easy to make vegan versions of so many favourite omni dishes. Food is such an important part of our daily lives, that the thought of giving up our favourites can be daunting. But you don't have to, you can just make it vegan! Convert the recipe, convert the omni. Will it be 100% exactly the same in taste and texture? Probably not completely. But it will taste good and hit the spot.
Veganize It by Robin Robertson is the perfect book for those looking to ease the transition, throw up some quality conversion meals, or are just love good vegan food. (I personally get cranky when people talk about vegan meats and cheeses as being 'conversion foods' for new vegans... you don't have to give up things you enjoy... and you can pry the Field Roast Apple Sage Sausage out of my cold dead hands.) Depending on how much time you want to spend in the kitchen, you can create your own products or you can buy them from the supermarket, Robin has options for both.
This is the first time I've posted about this book, so let's see what I've been eating! As mentioned, I am just doing mini round-ups for MoFo to ease the burden of reading so much, but I've made lots from here so keep an eye out for future posts!
Bacon-Topped Mac Uncheese: You know I can't resist a good mac and cheese, and look at this beauty! Oh my gosh, it is one of the best mac and cheeses I've had, it is so rich and cheesy and smoky. The sauce is a cashew based noochy sauce (my favourite type). For the bacon, I used some tempeh bacon, also from the book. This recipe was so easy, but you could use any sort of homemade or store bought bacon you wanted. I used 8oz of pasta, and got three servings (but I would have eaten more if I could!). So delicious.
Beyond BLT: This recipe used more of that yummy tempeh bacon. The sandwich also has mayo (I used Vegenaise but there is a recipe in the book), spinach, tomato and avocado. I used some grainy sandwich bread, lightly toasted. I love BLTs, and this was a very satisfying sandwich.
Mushroom Stroganoff: The book has a whole chapter dedicated to vegetable based favourites, like using delicious meaty mushrooms (a blend of portobello and white) in this stroganoff. I 100% left out the green capsicum and added some peas as well. You can either make your own cashew sour cream for the sauce, or use store bought. I made the sour cream recipe, which was very nice, though I did alter it slightly to remove the coconut oil (I just replaced it with a drizzle of canola oil for added richness, though I imagine mine was not quite as thick as the original). For the stroganoff, I got three serves with brown rice and baby spinach.
Fettuccini Bolognese: This is a very filling dish, giving me 5 tasty serves. The recipe calls for finely ground seitan or tempeh, but I used a packet of Tofurky ground beef, and it also has some more of that yummy tempeh bacon in it. The book has a recipe for making your own pasta if you like, but I just used some straight from the packet! The sauce is tomato based, with the addition of cashew cream. I don't remember ever having a creamy addition to the 'spag bol' of my youth, but some Googling has educated me on the origins of true Italian bolognese. I ended up just adding half of the cashew cream though, and I left out adding any veggie broth to the sauce entirely, as it was looking very saucy. I only used 8oz pasta rather than 12-16oz, so I am glad I cut out some liquid or it would have been swimming.
Sahara didn't only love her polka dot bed and her basket, she also loved this fluffy pink bed that I bought for Dim Sim. No bed was safe from Sahara's attentions.
That mac and cheese is my favorite! I've made it several times already, sometimes without the bacon. Recently with broccoli florets. I should really try some of the other recipes you tried out. I am not sure which others ones I tried off the top of my head.
Omg mac n cheese. That looks ace. Also loving the look of that stroganoff, I also put peas in mine, so good!

His role as lead guitarist of one of music’s most beloved bands, AC/DC, earned him a spot in the hearts of many for his ability to riff you into a trance while frolicking around a stage as if he didn’t have a care in the world.
His “schoolboy with a flair for the dramatic” style could be seen onstage night after night. He donned crushed velvet blazers, newsboy caps and white socks with such confidence that his eccentric garb became not only acceptable but completely appropriate.
He now holds a spot in the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame and is recognized by Rolling Stone as one of their greatest rockers of all time.
Young’s accomplishments stem from years of dedication – AC/DC is one of few bands to survive for decades, and continues rocking to this day.
When you see Young onstage in his signature gear, it becomes terribly clear that true talent and style never has an expiration date.
If you want to rock out Young’s look, try wearing an over-sized, boxy Stella McCartney blazer, and pair with Marc by Marc Jacobs Esther Oxford crepe shorts.
To get the tie effect without wearing a tie, try a contrast placket shirt, like this one from A.L.C. For your accessories, go for a platform heel with ankle socks, and for that special rock ‘n’rol playful touch, sport this Emmanuel Katsaros ‘Blow Up’ bag, which is kind of the purse version on a blow-up doll.
Now go and grab your “Back in Black” album, turn up the volume, do your best air guitar and rock the f*ck out.

This fact led me toward the field of education, where I have worked in various capacities for over a decade. Presently, I am employed as the Yoga & Meditation Instructor at The Advent School in Beacon Hill.
Throughout my career, I have come to know so many amazing adults and children. Each, unique and special in their own way and each possessing the following 4 things: a need to be understood / cared for, a need to feel safe, a need to be encouraged and a need to experience joy & be playful. Being confronted with the needs of my students brought about a great deal of reflection, regarding my own life experiences. It also roused a sense of responsibility, uncovering an awareness of what I believe is my purpose; to teach adults and children in a more meaningful, holistic way, using my own experiences to connect with my students through understanding, compassion and the ability to directly relate to many of the things that make them the most vulnerable. This awareness was my pathway to teaching yoga.
My personal yoga journey began shortly after I relocated from Central Massachusetts to the Boston area in 2003, albeit casually. In an effort to self-regulate (via Hatha yoga) after long hours working as a Teacher / Youth Educator, I attended weekly yoga classes at a local gym and began practicing at home with the help of podcasts. What I found early on in my yoga journey was a feeling of peace and calmness that was comparable to what I discovered on one of my exploratory long walks through the woods as a young person. The calm that came to me by way of yoga began to affect the way that I thought, the way I interacted with others (and myself*) and more specifically with my students. It heightened my compassion and also deepened the desire that I had to do more meaningful work. I found myself incorporating yogic breathing techniques and various yogic principles & practices into my daily interactions with students.
Inspired by the enthusiasm of my students and motivated by a conversation shared with a co-worker, I pursued my Yoga Teacher Training with Sharon Trull and first became a Certified Children’s Yoga Instructor through Child Light Yoga. This certification was later enhanced by my 200 hour YTT completed with 4 Corners Yoga of Dorchester, focusing on Trauma Informed Yoga.
For me, becoming both a Certified Children’s Yoga and Trauma Informed Yoga Instructor seemed like a natural step forward as an educator, allowing me to be even better equipped, to not only continue offering quality programing to the children that I served every day, but also empowering theme by providing them new tools and techniques to care for themselves in physically and emotionally healthy and become more mindful through yoga. I was then about to connect with their parents, which has allowed families to continue their yoga practice outside of the studio or workshops that I have facilitated. I was lead back to the importance of meeting the 4 needs of the children and adults that I mentioned earlier: a need to be understood / cared for, a need to feel safe, a need to be encouraged and a need to have fun / be playful and have dedicated myself to creating environments that facilitates these things.

I’m currently 27 weeks pregnant (today in fact!) I have one of these apps that tells you how the baby is growing and today it’s 38cm and the size of a cucumber! I’m feeling kicks all time now which is amazing! I still can’t quite believe I’m growing a tiny human inside of me!
I’m finishing for early Maternity at 30 weeks which means I can concentrate more on the blog and have a nice amount of time to ‘nest’ before baby arrives.
This is officially my last week working from home, which means my last week of actually getting any work done! I have one week at home then one week in the salon which is the perfect balance.
I save all my work and to-do’s for my week at home then when I’m in the Boutique I get to be with my clients, the team and help the general daily running of a busy salon.
I have really mixed emotions about maternity leave, one part of me wants to jump up and down (if I possibly could!) dreaming of sleeping in late, catching up on all the great TV dramas that everyone always talks about and I always miss (mainly because I can’t stay awake past 10pm!) and becoming the perfect house wife. Then there’s the other side of me that’s knows the novelty will wear off after a week or 2 and is scared i’m going to loose a little piece of ‘Susie’ and miss salon life and the girls.
The Blog for me has been a bit of a life saver. A way I can still keep in touch with the salon, the team & the beauty industry.
Next week Laura and I (my salon Bump Babe) are having a joint baby shower which is super exciting! The girls have been planning like secret squirrels so we genuinely have no idea whats going on so I will be sure to keep you posted!…

NUTRITIONAL TARGET MAP™ The Nutritional Target Map™ allows you to see at a glance how foods line up with your nutritional and weight-management goals. The closer a food is to the right edge of the map, the more essential nutrients per calorie it contains. For a more nutritious diet, select foods that fall on the right half of the map.
The closer a food is to the top edge of the map, the more likely it is to fill you up with fewer calories. If you want to restrict your caloric intake without feeling hungry, choose foods from the top half of the map.
Foods that are close to the bottom edge are more calorie-dense. If you want to increase your calorie intake without getting too full, choose foods from the bottom half of the map.
CALORIC RATIO PYRAMID™ This graphic shows you what percentage of the calories in a food come from carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and alcohol. If you are trying to achieve a specific distribution of calories, such as the 40/30/30 distribution of the Zone™ diet, or the more traditional 60/30/10 distribution, the Caloric Ratio Pyramid™ will show you how recipes, meal plans, or individual foods line up with those goals.
Foods low in fat, for example, will cluster along the bottom edge of the pyramid, ranging from foods that are high in carbohydrates (at the left edge) to foods that are high in protein (at the right edge). Foods low in carbohydrates will cluster along the right edge of the pyramid, with foods that are high in fat at the upper edge and foods that are high in protein at the lower edge. Foods that have roughly the same number of calories from fats, calories, and protein will be found closer to the center of the pyramid.
ESTIMATED GLYCEMIC LOAD™ Glycemic load is a way of expressing a food or meal's effect on blood-sugar levels. Nutrition Data’s patent-pending Estimated Glycemic Load™ (eGL) is available for every food in the database as well as for custom foods, meals, and recipes in your Pantry.
How to interpret the values: Experts vary on their recommendations for what your total glycemic load should be each day. A typical target for total Estimated Glycemic Load is 100 or less per day. If you have diabetes or metabolic syndrome, you might want to aim a little lower. If you are not overweight and are physically active, a little higher is acceptable.
NUTRIENT BALANCE INDICATOR™ This symbol offers a visual representation of a food's nutritional strengths and weaknesses, with each spoke representing a different nutrient. The spoke for dietary fiber is colored green, protein is blue, vitamins are purple, minerals are white, and yellow represents a group of commonly overconsumed nutrients: saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
A Completeness Score between 0 and 100 is a relative indication of how complete the food is with respect to these nutrients. Although few (if any) individual foods provide all the essential nutrients, the Nutrient Balance Indicator and Completeness Score can help you construct meals that are nutritionally balanced and complete.
PROTEIN QUALITY Protein quality is dependent on having all the essential amino acids in the proper proportions. If one or more amino acid is not present in sufficient amounts, the protein in your diet is considered incomplete.
Each spoke on the Protein Quality graph represents one of the nine essential amino acids, and the graph shows how close the protein in your diet is to the optimal distribution of amino acids recommended by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board.
An Amino Acid Score of 100 or higher indicates a complete or high-quality protein. If the Amino Acid Score is less than 100, a link is provided to complementary sources of protein. By combining complementary proteins, you may be able to increase the overall quality of the protein you consume.
Adding other foods with complementary amino acid profiles to this food may yield a more complete protein source and improve the quality of some types of restrictive diets.
Source: Nutrient data for this listing was provided by Custom. Each "~" indicates a missing or incomplete value.
Percent Daily Values (%DV) are for adults or children aged 4 or older, and are based on a 2,000 calorie reference diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower based on your individual needs.

Nutrition Data's opinions and ratings are based on weighted averages of the nutrient densities of those nutrients for which the FDA has established Daily Values, and do not consider other nutrients that may be important to your health or take into account your individual needs. Consequently, Nutrition Data's higher-rated foods may not necessarily be healthier for you than lower-rated ones. All foods, regardless of their rating, have the potential to play an important role in your diet.
NUTRITION DATA'S OPINION Nutrition Data awards foods 0 to 5 stars in each of three categories, based on their nutrient density (ND Rating) and their satiating effect (Fullness Factor™). Foods that are both nutritious and filling are considered better choices for weight loss. Foods that are nutritious without being filling are considered better choices for healthy weight gain. Foods that have more essential nutrients per calorie are considered better choices for optimum health.
Nutrition Data also indicates whether a food is particularly high or low in various nutrients, according to the dietary recommendations of the FDA.

This page shows the components of the CVSS score for example and allows you to refine the CVSS base score. Please read the CVSS standards guide to fully understand how to score CVSS vulnerabilities and to interpret CVSS scores. The scores are computed in sequence such that the Base Score is used to calculate the Temporal Score and the Temporal Score is used to calculate the Environmental Score.
The base metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant with time and across user environments. The Access Vector, Access Complexity, and Authentication metrics capture how the vulnerability is accessed and whether or not extra conditions are required to exploit it. The three impact metrics measure how a vulnerability, if exploited, will directly affect an IT asset, where the impacts are independently defined as the degree of loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For example, a vulnerability could cause a partial loss of integrity and availability, but no loss of confidentiality.
This metric reflects how the vulnerability is exploited. The more remote an attacker can be to attack a host, the greater the vulnerability score.
A vulnerability exploitable with only local access requires the attacker to have either physical access to the vulnerable system or a local (shell) account. Examples of locally exploitable vulnerabilities are peripheral attacks such as Firewire/USB DMA attacks, and local privilege escalations (e.g., sudo).
A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. Examples of local networks include local IP subnet, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, and local Ethernet segment.
A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable”. An example of a network attack is an RPC buffer overflow.
This metric measures the complexity of the attack required to exploit the vulnerability once an attacker has gained access to the target system. For example, consider a buffer overflow in an Internet service: once the target system is located, the attacker can launch an exploit at will.
Other vulnerabilities, however, may require additional steps in order to be exploited. For example, a vulnerability in an email client is only exploited after the user downloads and opens a tainted attachment. The lower the required complexity, the higher the vulnerability score.
Specialized access conditions exist. For example, in most configurations, the attacking party must already have elevated privileges or spoof additional systems in addition to the attacking system (e.g., DNS hijacking). The attack depends on social engineering methods that would be easily detected by knowledgeable people. For example, the victim must perform several suspicious or atypical actions. The vulnerable configuration is seen very rarely in practice. If a race condition exists, the window is very narrow.
The access conditions are somewhat specialized; the following are examples: The attacking party is limited to a group of systems or users at some level of authorization, possibly untrusted. Some information must be gathered before a successful attack can be launched. The affected configuration is non-default, and is not commonly configured (e.g., a vulnerability present when a server performs user account authentication via a specific scheme, but not present for another authentication scheme). The attack requires a small amount of social engineering that might occasionally fool cautious users (e.g., phishing attacks that modify a web browser’s status bar to show a false link, having to be on someone’s “buddy” list before sending an IM exploit).
Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. The following are examples: The affected product typically requires access to a wide range of systems and users, possibly anonymous and untrusted (e.g., Internet-facing web or mail server). The affected configuration is default or ubiquitous. The attack can be performed manually and requires little skill or additional information gathering. The 'race condition' is a lazy one (i.e., it is technically a race but easily winnable).
This metric measures the number of times an attacker must authenticate to a target in order to exploit a vulnerability. This metric does not gauge the strength or complexity of the authentication process, only that an attacker is required to provide credentials before an exploit may occur. The possible values for this metric are listed in Table 3. The fewer authentication instances that are required, the higher the vulnerability score.
It is important to note that the Authentication metric is different from Access Vector. Here, authentication requirements are considered once the system has already been accessed. Specifically, for locally exploitable vulnerabilities, this metric should only be set to 'single' or 'multiple' if authentication is needed beyond what is required to log into the system. An example of a locally exploitable vulnerability that requires authentication is one affecting a database engine listening on a Unix domain socket (or some other non-network interface). If the user must authenticate as a valid database user in order to exploit the vulnerability, then this metric should be set to 'single.'
Exploiting the vulnerability requires that the attacker authenticate two or more times, even if the same credentials are used each time. An example is an attacker authenticating to an operating system in addition to providing credentials to access an application hosted on that system.
This metric measures the impact on confidentiality of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones. Increased confidentiality impact increases the vulnerability score.
There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database.
There is total information disclosure, resulting in all system files being revealed. The attacker is able to read all of the system's data (memory, files, etc.).
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and guaranteed veracity of information. Increased integrity impact increases the vulnerability score.
Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. For example, system or application files may be overwritten or modified, but either the attacker has no control over which files are affected or the attacker can modify files within only a limited context or scope.
There is a total compromise of system integrity. There is a complete loss of system protection, resulting in the entire system being compromised. The attacker is able to modify any files on the target system.
This metric measures the impact to availability of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Availability refers to the accessibility of information resources. Attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system. Increased availability impact increases the vulnerability score.
There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. An example is a network-based flood attack that permits a limited number of successful connections to an Internet service.
There is a total shutdown of the affected resource. The attacker can render the resource completely unavailable.
The threat posed by a vulnerability may change over time. Three such factors that CVSS captures are: confirmation of the technical details of a vulnerability, the remediation status of the vulnerability, and the availability of exploit code or techniques. Since temporal metrics are optional they each include a metric value that has no effect on the score. This value is used when the user feels the particular metric does not apply and wishes to "skip over" it.
This metric measures the current state of exploit techniques or code availability. Public availability of easy-to-use exploit code increases the number of potential attackers by including those who are unskilled, thereby increasing the severity of the vulnerability.
Initially, real-world exploitation may only be theoretical. Publication of proof of concept code, functional exploit code, or sufficient technical details necessary to exploit the vulnerability may follow. Furthermore, the exploit code available may progress from a proof-of-concept demonstration to exploit code that is successful in exploiting the vulnerability consistently. In severe cases, it may be delivered as the payload of a network-based worm or virus. The more easily a vulnerability can be exploited, the higher the vulnerability score.
Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.
Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.
Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).
The remediation level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization. The typical vulnerability is unpatched when initially published. Workarounds or hotfixes may offer interim remediation until an official patch or upgrade is issued. Each of these respective stages adjusts the temporal score downwards, reflecting the decreasing urgency as remediation becomes final. The less official and permanent a fix, the higher the vulnerability score is.
A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available.
There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.
There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.
This metric measures the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability and the credibility of the known technical details. Sometimes, only the existence of vulnerabilities are publicized, but without specific details. The vulnerability may later be corroborated and then confirmed through acknowledgement by the author or vendor of the affected technology. The urgency of a vulnerability is higher when a vulnerability is known to exist with certainty. This metric also suggests the level of technical knowledge available to would-be attackers. The more a vulnerability is validated by the vendor or other reputable sources, the higher the score.
There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground.
There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.
The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be "Confirmed: when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-ofconcept exploit code or widespread exploitation.
Different environments can have an immense bearing on the risk that a vulnerability poses to an organization and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metric group captures the characteristics of a vulnerability that are associated with a user's IT environment. Since environmental metrics are optional they each include a metric value that has no effect on the score. This value is used when the user feels the particular metric does not apply and wishes to 'skip over' it.
This metric measures the potential for loss of life or physical assets through damage or theft of property or equipment. The metric may also measure economic loss of productivity or revenue. Naturally, the greater the damage potential, the higher the vulnerability score.
A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in slight physical or property damage. Or, there may be a slight loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.
A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in moderate physical or property damage. Or, there may be a moderate loss of revenue or productivity to the organization.
A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in significant physical or property damage or loss. Or, there may be a significant loss of revenue or productivity.
A successful exploit of this vulnerability may result in catastrophic physical or property damage and loss. Or, there may be a catastrophic loss of revenue or productivity.
This metric measures the proportion of vulnerable systems. It is meant as an environment-specific indicator in order to approximate the percentage of systems that could be affected by the vulnerability. The possible values for this metric are listed in Table 11. The greater the proportion of vulnerable systems, the higher the score.
No target systems exist, or targets are so highly specialized that they only exist in a laboratory setting. Effectively 0% of the environment is at risk.
Targets exist inside the environment, but on a small scale. Between 1% - 25% of the total environment is at risk.
Targets exist inside the environment, but on a medium scale. Between 26% - 75% of the total environment is at risk.
Targets exist inside the environment on a considerable scale. Between 76% - 100% of the total environment is considered at risk.
These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending on the importance of the affected IT asset to a user’s organization, measured in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, That is, if an IT asset supports a business function for which availability is most important, the analyst can assign a greater value to availability, relative to confidentiality and integrity. Each security requirement has three possible values: low, medium, or high.
Loss of Confidentiality is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of Confidentiality is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of Confidentiality is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of Integrity is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of Integrity is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of Integrity is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of availability is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of availability is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).
Loss of availability is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization (e.g., employees, customers).

Visited many different shops searching for the best furniture set for us. Were built with a good choice, but did not have precisely what we were looking for. They let us know that they can order furnishings from other shops. We found a settee, love chair, and recliner that people really loved at Ashley Furniture. I proceeded to go to a couple various Ashley stores trying for the greatest deal. Returned to Furnishings Electric outlet, offered them the model figures, plus they could save me hundreds of dollars.
Came right here a few days ago to look for some household furniture since a trainer I know suggested I check it out due to their great prices and selection. Rich, among the owners helped us out and it was really pleasant but additionally straight forward. We gave him a price range we wanted to stay within and that he showed us a few options to select from. We found 2 that people loved and made the buys. We are back again for more furniture quickly
Great customer support, I had been helped by Austin texas and that he was really friendly and there wasn't any pressure, he was individual and answered my concerns. There's a decent amount to select from and lots of the couches are fully customizable and that i could personalize my sofa to suit perfectly in my house. And also the cost is great for things i selected. General great experienc, I have no complaints.

“Having broken away from my illusory self, I was desperately seeking a path and a meaning to life.” This phrase perfectly sums up Alejandro Jodorowsky’s biographical project: reconstituting the incredible adventure of his life. Alejandro Jodorowsky was born in 1929 in Tocopilla, a coastal town on edge of the Chilean desert, where this film was shot. It was there where he discovered the fundamentals of reality, as he underwent an unhappy and alienated childhood as part of an uprooted family.

Lumen Trails comes in 8 colors. They differ in the sample categories to get you started. The core functionality is the same. Each version is a fully functional, multi-purpose tracker that you can customize to track anything. Download your favorite from the Apple App Store.
One is that it makes it easier for us to find users who are looking for a solution to a specific problem (e.g. time tracking or food journaling), and then let them discover on their own that Lumen Trails solves that particular problem, and more.
The other reason, not surprisingly, is that people do like to choose the color of the icon. Our iPhones have become our most personal devices. If you are going to use our app every day for years to come, you want to make sure you love the icon that comes with it.
We have worked very hard with the team at Duarte to make sure our icon is simple and elegant, and won’t get old with repeated usage. We hope that you love it, and that you’ll find a place for it on your home screen.

“What I REALLY like about it is that it’s pretty much an all-in-one system without the thousand-dollar-plus all-in-one cost. I push one button and all the magic happens, and it’s quite entertaining to watch the espresso cascade through the milk and create separate layers. I also like that I can take the milk and store it in my fridge. I’ve done some temperature tests, and only noticed a five-degree increase after making a double latte, before I put it back in the fridge. This is nice, as you would think that to be so close to all that heat, it would be a much bigger temperature fluctuation.”
If you want a fully automatic machine that makes a great espresso, the Jura is a great option. It has a built in burr grinder, meaning you'll get the freshness of a semi-automatic machine. It allows you to choose from three cup sizes, meaning it will brew a coffee, an espresso, or a ristretto (a short shot). You can also choose the strength of your coffee, selecting between dosage sizes of 8–10 grams. The machine has a relatively easy to use touch screen. And, the spout that dispenses the coffee has an adjustable height, making it possible to maximize your crema depending on your cup size—the closer to the cup the spout, the better the foamy creaminess will be on top. It includes a milk steaming compartment and steamer, which creates a creamy, well-incorporated foam.
This product is their smallest K-Mini™ K15 Single-Serve K-Cup Pod Coffee Maker, but it still delivers the delicious taste and reliable quality you expect. Its small size ensures the K-Mini™ coffee maker is perfect for kitchens with limited counter space, college dorms, and other small spaces. Its portable design makes it easy to transport anywhere you go, so your favorite beverages are never far away. Whether brewing coffee, tea, iced tea, or hot cocoa, the product makes single-cup brewing...
Why it's great: As much as we appreciate freshly ground coffee beans for our espresso, let's be honest: when you *accidentally* snooze your alarm (five times) in the morning and don't even have time to brush your hair, chances are the last think you're gonna think about doing is grinding some freakin' beans. This could be a problem if you're someone (like me) who can't function without a strong dose of caffeine in the morning. However, not a problem with Nespresso. This life-saver heats up in less than 15 seconds and gets you tasty espresso at the push of a button. You get your quick fix without sacrificing quality.
Brew café-quality espresso with just a push of a button with state-of-the-art espresso machines from Sur La Table. Go beyond the time-consuming, manual steps of making espresso to enjoy an appliance that will do it for you. From warming your cup to self-adjusting the brewing pressure, automatic brewers are favorites among today’s espresso fans. Better yet, these fully featured makers handle all the details, so all you need to do is press, sip and enjoy. Easily prepare delicious coffee every time with an espresso maker from Sur La Table.
Start your morning out right and perk up your day with a freshly brewed pot of coffee! This 12-Cup Retro Series Coffee Maker features an easy-to-read backlit LED display and a push-button control panel which allows for easy programming on the 24-hour clock and delay timer. The 2-hour automatic shut-off is built in for added safety while the pause-and-serve lets you pour a cup of coffee while in the middle of brewing.
This grinder produced the most even grounds out of all the machines I tested, and its range of output is all-encompassing. The coarsest setting produces large flakes, while the finest setting produces puffy grounds akin to powdered sugar—perfect for Turkish coffee. In between, I was quickly able to find the ideal settings for my Hario Woodneck, Aeropress, and even mason jar cold brew.
While it’s hands down the best cheap espresso machine on the market, Mr. Coffee isn’t on the same level with the Rocket or the Breville. Its shots lack the richness and complexity of true espresso, tasting more like a full-bodied Americano. Its layer of crema disappears quickly, and its shots don’t offer the gorgeous, gradient colors that you’d get from a machine like the Rocket. That said, it ranked fourth for taste among the machines we tested, so it’s still a solid option if you don’t need the finest coffee quality the market has to offer.
"I love this machine! I've been using my Mr. Coffee Cafe Barista for 9 months and it's still going strong. I mainly bought it because I was spending way to much getting coffee drinks like lattes and macchiatos at the coffeehouse. My favorite feature is the fact that it steams and froths the milk at the same time. You can also control the amount of froth that it makes which is an awesome feature. I also have a Mr. Coffee burr grinder Mr. Coffee BVMC-BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, Black/Silver so that I am making the freshest coffee possible and I buy my coffee freshly roasted from a local company. The results are great!"
To make it easy for you, we’ve gathered up the best espresso machines on the market, carefully weighed, and prioritized several criteria in testing and put together these targeted espresso machine reviews that are specifically meant to help you cut through all the confusion and just get the best deal on the home espresso maker that fits your style.
"Love the Flair. Bought about a month ago and have been dialing in my home roasted espresso routine. The crema production is unrivaled even with commercial machines costing 5x more. Any shot less than spectacular is due to user error or inadequate grinds/bean quality. Using this device has been a treat and I thoroughly enjoy the fun ritualistic aspect. There is something to be said for physically pressing out all those tasty flavors rather than letting a machine. Owning the flair puts you in full control of every single aspect of the shot and allows for pressure profiling which no device can do cost effectively. Highly recommend the signature chrome and it looks stunning as a permanent countertop staple. Just found out you can make espresso with room temperature water that produces some outstanding results."
Delight yourself with an intoxicating cup of freshly brewed coffee by using Proctor-Silex 4 Cup Coffeemaker. This coffee maker has a smart design that occupies less space, and is easy to store when not in use. This coffee maker is made of premium quality materials, which makes it sturdy and durable. This coffee maker has an illuminated on/off switch that is easy to operate. The 4 Cup Coffeemaker by Proctor-Silex has a water window, which allows you to keep a check on the water level within the...
"I've wanted an espresso machine for a while now but just don't have the room for it. I started researching the Nespresso line and wasn't sure how I'd like it at first. I am not usually a fan of pod style coffee machines and was worried about how well this would perform. I got the Pixie model because I don't have a big kitchen and this thing takes up barely any space on my counter. The water heats up quickly so in less than a minute you can have a cup of espresso. As other people have mentioned, it is kind of loud but it is only for a few seconds and doesn't seem to disturb anyone else in my house. The few seconds of noise is worth it for me to have a delicious latte a few minutes later. There is a little box that collects the pods (up to 10 I think) for easy disposal. I also feel like the Nespresso pods have a much better flavor that other pod coffee. If you want a quick espresso and don't have a lot of space for a machine then I highly recommend the Pixie. I am very happy with it and use it daily."
Now you can make authentic espressos, lattes and cappuccinos to suit your taste, in the comfort of your kitchen. Whatever your preference — single or double espresso, cappuccino or latte — the manual espresso machine brews authentic barista-quality beverages just like you enjoy at your favorite coffeehouse. With a manual espresso machine, you are guaranteed a true crema that’s rich, creamy, and full of flavor. Water and steam are heated separately thanks to the dual thermostat system, allowing crema to reach the ultimate consistency without scalding the coffee. For milk-based beverages, the manual frother mixes steam and milk to create a rich, creamy froth for evenly textured drinks — just the way you like them. Our patented three-in-one filter holders give you total control over your beverages and allow you to choose from one shot, two shot, or convenient espresso pods. The built-in tamper provides great flavor without the guesswork, and while the cappuccino systems may vary in method (one-touch automation for a semi-automatic model, versus an advanced manual frother for a traditional pump espresso machine), the results are consistently excellent. Don't like the idea of coffee grounds spilling everywhere, but still love the taste of fresh coffee? If you want all the convenience of an attached milk steamer and espresso maker, but less of the mess, we recommend the Nespresso range, with its convenient espresso pods, just as versatile as any of our other coffee machines. At De’Longhi, we’re proud of our manual espresso machines, and we hope you’ll be as enchanted by them as we are. Choose from a range of sleek, stylish designs, in black, red or stainless steel. Our machines are easy to use, easy to clean and easy to fill — exactly how they’re supposed to be.
When it comes to features, our top pick’s little sister, the OXO On 9-Cup Coffee Maker, looks and feels much the same: a single-button dial, programmable start times — even the timer that lets you know how old the coffee is after it’s been brewed is identical. On this version, the water reservoir isn’t detachable, but it brews coffee significantly faster than the 12-cupper’s 14 minutes(!) and it’s $100 cheaper. It’s a great machine that didn’t earn our top spot simply because the coffee it makes didn’t perform quite as well as the other three top picks in our taste tests, and it doesn’t let you tinker with water temperature and extraction the way the larger machine does.
"I have used this machine for about a week, and it is awesome! I had used an espresso machine frequently years ago, but got sick of the grinding, prepping, priming, etc., especially before work in the morning. So, I eventually gave up and bought a plain-ole coffee maker. Unfortunately, "regular" coffee, to me, tastes like hot water. I even tried a Kuerig, but returned it within a month - it was more convenient, but the coffees are no higher quality than any grocery-store brand coffee. So I debated for a long time about whether I should wait for one of these brand-new Nespresso Vertuoline machines, or just buy one of the older, espresso-only Nespresso machines.
The moka pot is most commonly used in Europe and in Latin America. It has become an iconic design, displayed in modern industrial art and design museums such as the Wolfsonian- FIU, Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, the Design Museum, and the London Science Museum. Moka pots come in different sizes, from one to eighteen 50 ml cups. The original design and many current models are made from aluminium with bakelite handles.
The gist: The Nespresso Inissia is very similar to the Pixie. It also comes with one-touch options for either a single espresso or lungo cup size. It pumps with 19 bars of pressure and also heats up in less than 25 seconds. With over 2,500 reviews, it stands out with a 4.4 star rating on Amazon. The Inissia has more or less the same internal workings as the Pixie (including the 0.7 liter water tank), so the quality of espresso produced should be pretty identical. The difference: unlike the Pixie, which is made of metal, the Inissia's exterior is mostly plastic and has a slightly funkier design. However the Inissia comes in several colors, including red, black, silver, and titan.
A steam-driven unit operates by forcing water through the coffee by using steam or steam pressure. The first espresso machines were steam types, produced when a common boiler was piped to four group heads so that multiple types of coffee could be made at the same time.[2] This design is still used today in lower-cost consumer machines, as it does not need to contain moving parts. Also, steam-driven machines do not produce as high of a pressure for extraction compared to pump-driven. This results in the crema, a hallmark of an espresso, being of lower quality.
It’s not that cone filters won’t make a great cup of coffee — the OXO On 9-Cup still ranked fifth out of 10 in our taste test. But flat bottoms generally allow for the grounds to be more evenly extracted and increase the coffee’s flavor. (It’s no coincidence our other three recommendations have flat-bottom brew baskets). You may have to do a little more tweaking to get this coffee maker’s brew to the best it can be, and that’s the other reason we like the 12-cupper more. This smaller version doesn’t let you tinker with water temperature.
Most people who have this in their homes are happy with it thanks to how easy it is to use and how delicious the coffee comes out. One person said they didn’t know how they managed without it. Some people did have issues with it breaking sooner than they would have liked, but they majority of those who own it were satisfied with the quality of the product.

Making the perfect espresso can be a labor of love, but not everyone who wants to drink espresso wants to do all that labor. Pod-based machines make it easier, but then you have fewer type of coffee to choose from. This machine solves both of those problems since it has adapters for most of the popular pods, including Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, K-Fee, or Verismo by Starbucks, and you can also use your own fresh ground coffee.
Bunn-O-Matic came out with a different drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200–207 °F or 93–97 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water to the bottom of the boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic coffee brewer, which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.

The point of getting a great machine is that it takes the fuss out of your coffee making — if you’re going to fiddle around so much, why not just get a Chemex? But our refrain throughout this entire review has been that a coffee maker is only one part of the good-cup equation. Some methodical experimentation could reveal a whole world of taste you never knew you could achieve.
Why it's great: The Magnifica is the lazy espresso aficionado's dream device. It's basically the same thing as having your local coffee shop barista make your drink for you, only you don't have to leave your house or worry about them spelling your name wrong on your cup. Since it's a super-automatic, it pretty much takes care of everything, from tamping, to grinding, to extracting. The only thing you really have to do is fill the containers and push a few buttons. There are so many great features on this thing, with the reheat function being a customer favorite. And the fact that it's able to remember your favorite drink settings? *Chef's kiss.*

Where MistoBox really shines is in its efficiently designed website and deep customization. If you want to, you can sign up for a scheduled delivery of curated espresso blends or single origin coffees and just let it ride—no input is necessary beyond the initial question of what kind of roast you like. But if you want to get a little more involved, you can rate each coffee you receive to refine future shipments or—if you want to take the future into your own hands—curate your own list of upcoming beans with a feature MistoBox calls the "Brew Queue." The number of choices is dizzying, and there are plenty of user reviews to guide your way thanks to a very active community.
Semi-automatic machines are not quite as customizable as a manual machine, but they let you play with a lot: You can change the coarseness of the coffee you use, the amount of coffee you add, and how long you pull your shot. Expect a decent learning curve to figure things out, and know that you’ll also need some additional equipment, like a quality coffee grinder.
"This machine has turned me into a bonafide coffee snob. While it took some time to tweak all of the essential dimensions (water temp, grind size, coffee amount, draw time, basket type, etc.), I now make the most delectable coffee on earth because of this gorgeous contraption. It's the first thing I think about when my eyes open in the morning. I've ditched all of the other coffee-making paraphernalia in my kitchen (french press, grinders, baskets, pour-over devices, and others . . .) because they pale (literally) in comparison to the gold that comes out of this happy faucet. If my apartment goes up in flames and I have to escape quickly down the fire escape, my espresso machine is coming with me."
The gist: The Cisno is the perfect way to enjoy good espresso on the go and takes the spot as Amazon's Choice for portable espresso makers with 4.5/5 stars. This little guy is small enough to fit in a cup holder, yet pumps at 15 bars of pressure, powered by a rechargeable lithium battery. All you need are Originaline Nespresso capsules and some water. The process is super simple: Insert the Nespresso capsule, pour water into the 50ml water cavity, push the one big button on the Cisno, and boom— automatically pump and enjoy you cup of espresso. Tryna stay fancy? You still have the option of using your own coffee grounds if you get reusable stainless steel capsules.
If you're ready to pull the trigger on buying an espresso machine, be prepared to shell out a little cash. Espresso machines can be wildly expensive. Rightfully so. Pulling a perfect shot requires precision: the machine must maintain both precise temperature and stable pressure throughout the brewing process. Achieving this stability is difficult and requires complex machinery, which is why you can find machines for upwards of 6,000 dollars.
While we love the all-inclusive features of the Breville, there’s one thing it can’t do on its own, at least not without a hefty repair bill. If you love dark roasts, any machine that features an internal grinder is off-limits. The oily shine characteristic of dark roasts builds up in any grinder — but while you can disassemble and clean standalone grinders, this is rarely an option for internal ones. The residual oil left in an internal grinder will, at best, give future shots a rancid flavor. At worst, the oil will clog the grinder. If you want to brew dark roasts on the Breville, plan on buying a separate grinder.
If you’re not one yourself, you definitely know one. Espresso, which originated in Italy, is a finely ground, highly concentrated version of coffee that packs a punch of caffeine into a single one-ounce shot (or two, if you’d like a double-shot), making it richer and stronger than a regular cup of coffee. People who drink espresso know that it’s all about quality, which means if you’re not getting your tiny cup of life from your local barista, you best do your research and invest in a worthy espresso machine to make it at home.
For first-time espresso machine owners, the Breville offers the perfect balance between hand-holding and customization. You’re in charge of basic steps like measuring out and pulling your shot, but the Breville makes it easy to adjust things like the coarseness of your grind and the amount of espresso. The user manual walks you through every step of the brewing process, and altering the default settings is easy, thanks to a display panel that clearly labels all buttons and lights. Our shots were beautifully layered and gave us truly gorgeous colors as the espresso flowed out of the portafilter.
Hand-tooled and bench-tested in Italy, this espresso maker looks, works, and performs like it belongs in a small coffee shop, despite fitting tidily on your kitchen counter. This machine is built to last 10 to 15 years; less expensive machines at best might survive the five-year mark, and some can’t be expected to reach three. We also loved the sheer quality of every part included with our Rocket. The heft metal tamp fits perfectly in the machine’s own portafilter baskets and improved the shot-making experience of other machines when we used it with theirs.
Why it's great: With the exception of a few exterior differences, getting the Inissia is basically like getting the Pixie at a discounted price. Aside from the quality espresso, it comes with all the same Nespresso perks: The Nespresso welcome kit has 14 unique capsules and access to the Nespresso club. Through the Nespresso Club you can order capsules either online or by phone, as well as get personalized advice and technical support for your machine 24/7. Not too shabby for a tiny little machine of its price. For those who don't mind being a little less fancy with the exterior design, the Inissia is definitely a great option.
The De'Longhi comes with a durable, high-quality stainless steel boiler which would serve you well over time. Other notable features include a swivel jet frother for easy cappuccino and latte prep, a dual-function filter holder that gives you a choice between ground coffee and pods, and a self-priming function which we recommend for the absolute best results.

So while yes, $150 (current price as I review this item) is a good chunk of change, I honestly believe it’s worth it. This is a high-quality machine that will hopefully last a very, very long time. The quality of the espresso is very good, and in the long run, it will save you the cost of espresso-based drinks at the coffee shop. It all evens out in the end! If you are considering buying this, my advice is to just do it. It’s worth it! Love love love!”
Jealousy, murder, and desperation. Lundagård‘s reviewer Tindra Englund think that Lund’s Student Theatre’s (LUST) Medea is an excellent cure for those who have been overdosed with student humour.
Some light flares on the poorly furnished scene, the wind howls and all costumes are almost colourless. The lack of distractions makes it possible for Euripides’ timeless anti-tragedy to come closer than ever, even though it was written almost 2500 years ago.
The drama begins with an anxious nurse who is afraid that her mother-in-law has lost her mind. The reason for Medea’s scream and rage is that her husband Jason has left her and the children, to get a new wife. And not any wife; it is the king’s daughter. This, even though Medea has let down her own family (which ensured her father’s death) and has moved to Corinth for her husband’s sake. To make matters even worse, the king decides to banish her.
The scene between the king and Medea feels like up-to-the-minute social criticism. The powerful king decides to banish the powerless woman because of his own fear of her. But what is paradoxical is that it’s his actions which break her and makes her adhere a desperate act. A desperation recognized by many contemporary refugees.
As a refugee, stranger and an abandoned woman, Medea has no rights and she is desperate and jealous. Attached to a choir of “women” she decides to refuse to be a victim. Instead, she shall have revenge. But when she decided to kill her own children, the feminist struggle passes into pure madness, and no woman can no longer support or understand Medea’s decision.
Initially, most of those who have been unhappily in love, or been betrayed by the one they love, can recognize themselves in Medea. And she also accurately highlights the timeless patriarchal norms that are to women’s disadvantage, in heteronormative relationships and as well as in society.
Unfortunately, the final act of LUST’s version of Medea falls in an unrealistic way to madness. This is made most clear when she, unconcerned and smiling, listens to the disturbing stories of how her murderous plans’ success, which in the end means the death of her own children. Here I miss a deeper and clearer and more nuanced inner struggle.
Even in the first scene, I have difficulty to emotionally keep up with the play and it felt somewhat stiff. It may also be because of the stagy English and the slightly over the top gestures. But when Medea enters the stage, the story completely captures me. And by far, the most outstanding actor performances is in some of the scenes between Medea and her ex-husband. And by the servant who, in the final act, delivers the death announcement.
