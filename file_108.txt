In my ongoing quest to turn my house into a smart home, I decided to replace many of the important light switches with Leviton Wi-Fi Smart Switches or Dimmers. I chose to use Wi-Fi switches/dimmers instead of smart bulbs for a few reasons:
Light switches allow you to control other motors/appliances, like ceiling fans (which our house has)
Smart switches require a neutral (white wire), since they need to draw power, which is available most if not all of our light switch boxes

well written and awesome album, am still hahahaing from the term igno-screen from Doublethink diary entry 9. Never the less, its so true, love the content displayed throughout, very informal and saddening, especially the fact that am one of them unfortunates who live in the land similar to ignoratia.
Appreciate the sound recording of the rap genre type, what your Anu people call The last Great Awakening, and since i live in the era of them ancestors you speak of, the lyrical skill, flow and content you utter, i can really say, you sound allot like this dude with a afro named akala,-hahaha!
I swear down bruv,AK4700624, if you could meet this akala you will get along, the degrading values of Ignoratia, you discuss, akala discussed the very same issues in my world, but just like the ignorance of Ignoratia, people chose to close their ears, and get a big plate full of ignorance, violence and control by the higher caste. But some freaks, just like yourself and me did exist in my era to, and appreciated akala in using his gift for a better world.
One more thing too, mr.AK4700624, the idea behind XXL, was very well executed, even i was like what the heck is this ?!!, not the best i have heard, there’s allot of elements in this tune, that remind me of shitty mainstream music, and it was missing that underground feeling but later i realised the message that was seen through all the jungle music, with a pop chorus, thumbs up to the elders from anu mate, since Ignoratia is a lot like my era of life, it worked very well, am able to listen to it around ignorant people, and while they enjoy the beat and chorus, i enjoy the beat, chorus and subliminal message delivered through.
from the perspective of someone who worked hospital pharmacy for 16 years and was raised in the household of one of the largest family practitioners in the SE U.S.(who tried to fight from the inside), this is nothing but the truth.

Now here's what I know about power supplies: they supply power. Oh, and they have wires sticking out of them. That's all I got.
So, after calling around a bit today, I decided the best thing to do was to yank the power supply from the dead maching and bring it into a computer store. I figured I'd have my best chance of matching it up that way.
The closest place to where I was that even had a shot at providing me with the new supply was Best Buy. You know my feelings about Best Buy, but there were the best option it seemed.
I walked into the store holding this metal box spewing wires and found the first sales agent in the computer department. I expected him to not know the difference between a power strip and a power supply.
But get this - he knew exactly what I needed! He had just built out a gaming box and had just shopped for his own power supply. Best Buy had three or four power supplies available on the shelf, and he picked the one that best matched the specs of the older supply.
I wanted to open up the box and physically compare the two units. He said he wasn't authorized to do this, but maybe the Geek Squad could. Fine, I could live with that.
He took me over to the Geek Squad counter where a bunch of uniformed agents were able to help me. We opened up the box (after I bought it, that seemed fair) and inspected things. Here's the thing - the Geek Squad guys knew what each of the different cables connected in to and why. They actually knew obscure technical details.
I was shocked. I assumed I would have been dealing with some cluless set of reps, and instead, I was dealing with true geeks.
We had a great time at one of Shira's co-worker's party. The food was great, and the desserts were out of this world.
The night included a pay-per-view showing of the Ultimate Fighter Championship. Wow, what a brutal sport. Not my schtick, but plenty of other people enjoyed it.
What other woman in the world would accompany her hubby to a data center at 2:30 in the morning, to help address a power supply issue? Only one - my wife.
She's sitting here reading the only thing available - a copy of eWeek which has an article about Linux on the Desktop.
If you follow one blog, follow this one. Oh wait, never mind that. If you follow one blog, make it mine. Then make LifeHacker your second.
XMLStarlet is a must have tool for dealing with XML when using Unix shell scripts. XMLStarlet allows you to compose tiny XSLT stylesheets right on the command line. Because of this capability, it allows you to bridge painlessly bridge the world of XML and Unix text oriented tools.
Here's an example. Suppose you wanted to get a list of all the recent posts from your buddy's blog. How do you do this? Well, grab their RSS feed and process it, right?
Create an on the fly XSLT stylesheet that loops through each entry element and gets the value of the title
Run the results through the standard nl command, which numbers lines and discard all but the top 5 lines
This doesn't begin to capture the power of XMLStarlet, but at least you get the idea that processing XML doesn't need to be a big 'ol hack.
Naturally, XMLStarlet takes some practice. But, the docs are good, and the results are worth the effort.
Oh, and I should mention, all of the above works just fine on Cygwin under Windows XP too. So you really have no excuses not to take advantage of this slick tool.
I was browsing Amazon and came across this list: So you'd like to... Go armed without going to jail (don't ask me what I was shopping for).
The list contains various items you can buy off of Amazon and use as weapons, including a book that describes how to use ordinary stuff as weapons.
A list like this really exposes the flaw behind the TSA hurry-up-and-ban-it strategy. The fact is, you can't make people safe by simply taking away things people have previously used as weapons. Why? Because there's an endless supply.
I have no idea what the solution is to airplane security - I just know that attempting to ban anything that can be used as a weapon is simply not possible.
Surprisingly, while the list contains such make shift weapons as a hair brush and carabiner, it leaves off the really deadly ones like lipstick, bottles of water and worst of all, pie.
First, a bit of context: one of Shira's favorite foods are hot dogs. When Shira and I make Thanksgiving dinner for ourselves, we make hot dogs. Yes, we like them that much.
So, imagine our joy and delight when Perry gave us Old Fashioned Hot Dog Roller Grill! For most people this would be a novelty gift, for us, it's a new critical kitchen appliance.
As everyone knows, you can't receive an Old Fashioned Hot Dog Roller Grill without busting it out and making some dogs. So that's exactly what we did. We had a cook-in, right there on our living room floor! See:
And here's the best part -- the hot dogs cooked by this sucker came out perfect! They really did taste good. So, if you do decide to give someone this device, you'll be comfortable knowing your gift will actually work.
I know that about.com typically puts out gift giving guides for their topics, and they cover dozens (hundreds?) of topics. The problem is finding these guides. Unless, of course, you have Google do the looking for you.
After you search, look through the first page or two of results, and you should find at least one gift giving guide.
I mentioned that I was going to upgrade my mp3 player (another $9.99 model). It turns out, the new model (now called the Power Up! Digital mp3 player) is pretty much the same as the old model, with a few minor differences.
There's been a slight change (I'm not sure I can call it an improvement) in the firmware of the device, so the menus look a bit different. Also, the translation of the manual has changed. Not improved, just changed. Check out this gem from page 27:
General MP3 customer will suffer "the data divulges a secret" of harassment, don't wish to let own personal data seen by other people, be afraid using hour only have to delete first. Result in very the hemp is vexed.
Even though the manual is absolute gibberish, the controls are plasticky, and the headphones actually made the sound quality significantly worse - I still recommend the device, if you can get it for $9.99. It'll serve as a thumb drive, voice recorder, and mp3 player. All useful things. And you won't feel bad when it breaks in a year or two.
Now that I've got a new device, what am I filling it up with? Here are some of the first items to go on it:
Spam is evil. Permission based e-mail marketing can be a good thing. If you want to do the latter, you should check out MailChimp.
Duct Tape Marketing pointed me to the service, and it looks like it could be a handy way to get the word out about a product or service.
It's that simple. You'll find plenty of interesting things to read, and you'll only have to visit one website a day.
LifeHacker has a pointer to this curious service: Criagsnumber.com. I suppose the goal is to allow you to post a phone number in your Craiglist classified without posting your number. Though, Craigsnumber.com isn't actually part of Craigs List.
Now the only person you're sharing your number with is craigsnumber.com, and the question is, do you trust them?
See, when we signed up for a business account we were told we'd get two years without any fees. There was only one catch: you had to go back to the bank to get the second year's fees waived.
The quick info desk guy genuinly tried to solve my problem, and only when he couldn't did he make we wait in a queue.
The person who helped me with the problem ended up finding me a way to waive all my fees on the accout, for *life*.
Overall, I'm really impressed. I love online banking, but it's good to know the person-to-person form can be just as useful.
While hanging out with my high school buddy Greg Lavine (of Salt Lake Tribune fame), I kept on mentioning to him that I'd send him a link to what I was talking about. Well, here are those links. Enjoy Greg!
DarynKagan.com: The woman who went from being an on Air TV reporter to publishing her own stories on the web. (As heard on Oprah radio)
Publish a coffee table book of your photos: The calendar is great, and I look forward to the 100 page glossy book version. See other ideas too.

Today Greg and I got to hang out at the Hirshhorn gallery in Washington, D.C. (it's part of the Smithsonian Museum). We ended up getting a tour (it was us, and two other folks, so it was an almost private tour) by an art teacher / docent. The Hirshhorn does these tours daily, so if you are in D.C., check the times, as they are worth seeing.
We got to see all kinds of sculpture, from the interesting to the absurd. I can't begin to explain the meaning behind the pieces, just that they were all interesting. Here's a bit of what we saw:
Tonight marks 12 years since the Shira and I had our first date. It was Christmas Eve, and of course we went out for Chinese food at a restaurant named Ho Ho. Tonight we remembered the event by going out for Thai food.
I recall clearly that I had marpo-tofu that night and tonight I had roasted tofu - so not much has changed.
So, my trusty cygwin setup on my laptop totally started acting up. All of a sudden, X-windows wouldn't start up, and emacs started giving me an error message like:
I finally got a message about "child_copy: linked dll data write copy failed" and typed that into Google. Sure enough, someone else was having this error, and suggested a fix.
The problem? Cygwin and the Logitech Quick Cam software don't play nice together. Simply remove the Quick Cam software from the system tray/startup, and everything goes back to working.
Update: after applying the above fix, things got better (X started!). But I was still getting random issues. So I ran rebaseall, and that appeared to help too.
Here's an interesting list of things to shoot for in a well designed system. It has the usuals like scalability and dependability, but also ones that I may not have thought of like composability and accountability.
This list could be inspirational in your next design, or may help to explain why a current design didn't work.
I'm going to continue my delayed Switzerland blogging. This time, I'm blogging because the notes I made for this post are in a notepad that's basically full and is going to get replaced any day now.
One of the aspects of Switzerland that surprised me was how little English people spoke. I had (have?) that ridiculous American view, that at the end of the day, everyone speaks English. And of course quite a few people did, but many didn't.
This meant that's Shira's French went from being a novelty to actually being required. To help me communicate, especially on my lone travel day, Shira gave me a handful of phrases she thought I should know. And sure enough, they turned out to be really handy.
In fact, if I were to go to another country where I didn't speak the language, I'd probably learn this list as a starting point. It's a wonderful feeling being able to properly thank some one, or even ask if they speak English in an intelligent way.
I just posted my first YouTube video. YouTube does an excellent job of making the upload process as painless as can be. I only ran into one big snag: the video file that my camera recorded was ginourmous, so ginourmous in fact that YouTube (rightfully) wouldn't accept it.
It turned out, the .avi file was over 150 Megs. YouTube has a limit of 100 Megs so I needed to do something if I wanted to post there.
I Googled around looking for suggestions from people as to how they typically compress their videos. Surprisingly, I didn't find much, until I eventually came across a reference to Windows Movie Maker.
Windows XP came through again!, It turns out, XP has its own movie software built in that steps you through the process of creating and compressing a movie. While no doubt not a slick as the Mac version, it was really workable and did just what I needed. And just like my discovery of the Windows Remote Assistance feature,Movie Maker had been there on the Start Menu all along.
So there you have it: if you have a digital camera that shoots .avi files and Windows XP, you should be all set to publish your next master piece on YouTube. Now there's nothing stopping you from being the next Steven Spielberg, or at the very least Senor Spielbergo.
Parent Hacks pointed me to this really interesting experiment that Gretchen Rubin is carrying out. She's spending a year researching, and blogging about tips, theories, suggestions and ideas for how to be happy.
She covers topics from why you should smile more to suggestions for defusing a child's tantrum. Ever Wednesday is tip day, so there's some to check back for every week.
This is all part of a book project, and no doubt serves as a way to test her material out before committing it to print. In the end though, it's probably a win-win, as she'll have better material, and I'll have goodies to blog.
Pardon me, I'm off to go read about packing tips she learned the hard way, and then after that I might read up on Ben Franklin's suggestions for living a virtuous life.
My friend Alex Chan pointed me to a (new to me) Windows project that just live. I'm going to do my best to blog it without making any obnoxious remarks. Here's what the main project page has to say:
Oh, I can't resist just one remark: 130 commands? Yikes, that seems a bit slim. I have 906 commands in /usr/bin/ on my cygwin install, and that's with installing only standard tools.
Happy חנוכה (or in English: Chanukah or Hanukkah)! Want to learn more? You can get the facts, jump to the how to or skip right to the gambling (the preferred Hanukkah kids activity). Chanukah celebrates an oil-related miracle, so to recall this we tend to eat foods that make heavy use of oil.
I know, it's tough having a holiday where deep fried sugar donuts are a feature (the recipe calls for 12 cups of oil!).
The solution the author uses is simply to start every paragraph of text with a comment character. As the author explains:
Also, beginning with this post you will notice that the paragraphs all start with semicolons, as if this were a source file. Well you would be correct. In an effort to keep the code in these discussions as real as possible, the entire post starts off life as a scheme source file. Further, every effort is made such that you can merely cut and paste this entire post, text and all, into your favorite editor or directly into DrScheme and you should get precisely the same results as I show in the text.
Still, I'd love to see a Scheme solution where code was marked off by delimiters instead of the text of the article. I think the Haskell version I found earlier is easier to read and run than this approach.
Did you know that Paula Abdul was Jewish? Or that Aerosmith had a Jewish connection? Or how about the Bangles? Or Bare Naked Ladies? Or Kiss?
I just made my first Wikipedia contribution ever. I'm amazed how easy it was for me to sign up and contribute.
Whether you want to write your next novel or do some 3D modeling, this list has a piece of software on it for you.
I even added to the list by including netcat and tcpdump for windows. These are two of the most useful network debugging utilities available, which make them great candidates for your flash drive.
I'm thinking a great holiday gift this season would be to not only buy someone a flash drive, but then fill it up with lots of useful goodies. This list should be a great place to get started.
I can't fully explain why, but this post of Chuck Norris facts brought me to tears of laughter. That's bad, right?
If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can't see Chuck Norris, you may be only seconds away from death.
Whenever I shop for purses with Shira I can't help but imagine what it would be like if men carried purses.
No doubt I'd have the biggest model possible - one of those duffel bag types that barely pass as a purse. And it would be packed with a every gadget possible - from a PDA to a scanner/printer. It would have a library of things to do, a photo studio, broadcast studio and enough food for a few meals.
You know a certain technology has really become a commodity for the masses when you find it at the Target checkout line between the batteries and Snickers Bars.
XM radio is offering a twist on the usual holiday radio channel. Along with a slew of Christmas channels they are offering Radio Hanukkah.
Radio Hanukkah - XM 108, is XM's first-ever channel dedicated exclusively to Jewish culture. Airing for the duration of the Festival of Lights from December 15 to December 23, Radio Hanukkah features the best in Jewish music, comedy, Broadway, talk and kids programming.
If you act today, you can even listen to the programming if you aren't a member of XM. Just sign up for their free promotion. Even the promotion has a holiday twist to it:
The normal free trial of XM Radio Online lasts only 3 days, but miraculously we have been able to extend it to cover all eight days of Radio Hanukkah.
Here's a hint for those who've forgotten the special promo code. It is the title of a famous Chaim Potok book about two friends Danny and Reuven. Take the two-word title of the book and enter it as one word as the special Radio Hanukkah promo code.
(For those not in the know: Hanukkah celebrates the miracle that a small crucible of oil lasted for 8 days instead of 1.)
I'm impressed with the job they've done here. The attention to detail, like suggesting that complaints be sent to Kvetch@xmradio.com, shows that someone actually put some thought into this. I only wish I could have mentioned the site sooner.
And what did my family do on Christmas? Chinese food on Christmas Eve and a movie on Christmas Day, of course. What else is there to do?
Serendipity pointed me to this hilarious website: engrish.com. Engrish is a catch all phrase to describe good attempts by foreigners to use proper English, but that fall a little short.
I don't usually get a kick out of other people's errors, but this time I couldn't resist. I just know somewhere there's a guy posting in Thailand pictures of Americans making the same kinds of errors.
Besides, with all the errors I make on my blog, I wouldn't be surprised if it was featured on engrish.com.
I came across this article that talks about implementing "a Haskell toy to visualize twos-complement binary numbers". I know, it doesn't sound like exciting reading. What's cool about it isn't so much the content of the code, but how the code is presented. The author made use of literate programming to write up this program.
Literate programming more or less reverses the roles of comments and code. Instead of code with delimited comments, it's comments with delimited code. Traditionally, you run one program to extract the code from your source file, and another program to extract the text/documentation.
I haven't seen many uses of literate programming that seemed genuinely useful. But, the above article may change my mind on that. See what I mean:
In the above example, code is marked by a > in the left hand column and everything else is just passed through as text. The end result reads like a story that one can both read and execute.
This whole approach seems like a powerful means of communication. While I can't imagine large systems being written like this, I can begin to see some really interesting possibilities.
And lest you think that literate programming is just for academics, consider that every time you run Javadoc you are effectively practicing literate programming.
Browsing through Cool Tools again tonight I came across Kevin's recommendation of the Uncle Mark's Gift Guide.
The gift suggestions are nice because they cut right to the chase - want to buy a digital camera, buy a Canon Powershot SD 30. Want to buy an mp3 player? Get an iPod. He gets more creative than that, and goes as far as suggesting you buy the gift of an empty e-mail inbox for someone. While these direct recommendations won't appeal to geeks, they'll be immensely helpful for the non-techie who wants to buy that special gift.
Then he includes an almanac...which is just what you'd expect an almanac to be: random tidbits of information. He covers topics from how to run a meeting, and an ideal umbrella strategy to how to walk through New York City. It's a pleasant read, and you may just learn something.
As documents go this is a must read, just to be reminded that all documents don't have to follow the same format, style and approach.
As usual, I enjoyed reading Joel Spolsky's blog entry about yet another hot topic: simplicity in software. As Joel explains, it's kinda hip to produce really bare bones software, and offers a voice for why this isn't a good thing.
It's a really good read. If you want to know more though, I'd suggest you pick up a copy of The Inmates Are Running The Asylum by Alan Cooper. In this book, Cooper explores another form of simplicity (and lack of features) in software.
Cooper suggests that a well designed piece of software should have an emphasis on being designed right, and should not compensate for poor (or no) design by simply layering on features.
For some applications, like say Photoshop, this probably doesn't hold true. If you use Photoshop (or emacs for that matter), you want the kitchen sink and then some. But for other applications, like say your music player, fewer features is probably a good thing.
The most immediate options to me are: Now Playing, Library, Rip, Burn, Sync, Guide. None of this means a dang thing to me, and I'm a geek by trade. I can't imagine what my mom must think when she opens up this program. I'm sure these are all important and useful features - but I just want to play my music, or watch a video.
What Cooper explains in his book is that simply cramming features into an application doesn't make for a quality user experience. Instead, the right features, and fewer of them should be included. This, in the end, will make for a higher quality experience.
Cooper's form of simplicity isn't easy or cheap to attain. Though it is the kind of effort that produces the iPod and the like.
Browsing through Keven Kelly's Cool Tools site (an absolutely must read blog), I came across this nifty list of charities he's fond of.
Shira and I especially liked the Modest Needs site, which offers small loans to help people out of tight spots. With their published list of requests, it's hard not to read them and not want to give. It doesn't hurt that the site seems to come across as really responsible (they send money to the creditor, not person asking for the support) and promises to give 100% of your donation to people in need.
Kevin Kelly's Cool Tools blog mentioned this neat little radio controlled airplane. Checking around on the net, it gets pretty remarkable reviews considering it's only $30.00.
Shira and I are always stumped with what to buy kids (and most adults), so this seems like a handy option to have around. I can't imagine you can go too wrong with anything that flies and could potentially cause structural or bodily harm.
What other great gift ideas do you have? Oh, and if budgeting is your thing, you should check out the Get Rich Slowly suggestions for a frugal Christmas (and I assume Chanukah/Kwanzaa).
That's nothing! Guy Kawasaki has decided he's going to get his next book idea by doing more or less the same thing. He's started a PBWiki site dedicated to capturing ideas about this next project.
He's even gone one step further, and shared the password (it's kickbutt if you're curious) and is asking for people to submit their ideas.
This is risky/curious move that requires just the right amount of chutzpah, which Guy tends to have plenty of. Of course, once a stunt like this has been pulled off, it'll seem lame when the next guy does it.
Of course if Guy really wanted to get input on his ideas he should make use of Tenspotting. That way, he won't just collect the raw ideas, but will see what the crowd's wisdom really is.
Now that I've switched over to the Blogger Beta, it's time to think of a redesign for the blog. Not only do I need this to take advantage of some of the features of the latest version of blogger, but just because I'm hopelessly in need a of a fresh look.
Of course I don't have time to work on the redesign, but I do have time to jot down notes. Which is what I've done.
I plan to keep adding/tweaking my redesign notes writeboard until I have things settled enough to actually work on it.
I haven't used writeboard in a while. I was pleasantly surprised to find the site still there and still looking impressive. If you haven't checked it out, give it a peek.
Check out: Januine Creations. It's an example of using blogger to host a tiny e-commerce site (hey, if you can use blogger for hosting a novel, why can't you use it for e-commerce?).
NOTICE: Customers are not allow to ask about the material used. Januine Creations guarantee you that we use good quality materials.
Just doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling. And the layout of the site could use some work too. But overall, the idea is a good one.
One feature I've noticed is often on sites that cater to younger audiences is the ever present Shoutbox. A shoutbox is a kind of site wide comment area / sign-in book / chat area. It provides an easy and dynamic way to provide feedback for the site and its members.
Shoutboxes tend to allow only brief messages to be exchanged between users. However, to the generation that communicates in IM speak like lt me knO wen U R out of claS, this size limitation isn't really a problem.
I came across myshoutbox.com which allows you to painlessly setup a shoutbox on your site. I'm considering adding one to new design I put in place when I fully switch to the blogger Beta.
After a marathon eating out fest for Shira's birthday (3 Thai restaurants in 4 days!), she decided to give me a treat and take me to a place she knew I would love.
For lunch today we hit Max's Kosher Cafe (2319 University Blvd, Wheaton, MD 20902). We had your typical kosher food: matza ball soup, a knish and schwarma. The schwarma, which is essentially a gyros, was terrific. It was served in the traditional manner: a bit of lamb, gobs of veggies and sauce all overflowing in a pita.
The restaurant itself was good for what it tries to be: an every day eat'n kosher establishment. I give it a 9/10, though that's mostly because there's almost nothing else to compare it to.
Every year Smitty and Amy's holiday part sets the gold standard for these type of events. The food selection is always incredible (my overhead snapshot just can't do it justice) and tonight was no different.
Shira and I had a great time, and I was especially fortunate to find a fellow geek to both chat with and learn from.
Everybody needs an online stopwatch at some point -- and there's never one around! Well... Now there is! online-stopwatch.com
How right they are. Ever since I found this site on Google's homepage widget directory I've been a fan. It's now part of my utility site list (along with goodies like tinyurl).
My friend Gareth was kind enough to share this story with me, and allow me to post it here. It goes along with my other stories about customer service.
For my wedding anniversary, my wife ordered me a Bosch 12" Single Bevel Composite Miter Saw, per my request. Like many things on the web, Amazon had the best price going (about $250) along with a shockingly low $6 shipping charge for this wonderful 55 lb item. It took a few weeks for my new toy to get to me, but eventually it did on Wednesday. When I arrived home after work, I saw no sign of a big box and assumed it hadn't been delivered yet. Au contraire, as UPS had apparently dropped it off on my front porch at 1:18pm according to their package tracker. Sure enough, a call to UPS confirmed this and subsequent visits to the neighbors did nothing to help me find my package. While on the phone, UPS indicated that I could not file a claim myself, but would have to do so via the shipper (Amazon); swing and a miss. A visit to the Amazon website for the customer service number led me to handy feature which allows you to input your phone number and have Amazon call you back IMMEDIATELY. Upon picking up the phone, I waited all of about 30 seconds before being connected to a real person; not bad for 4:30pm at this time of year. After relaying the story of my lost package, my British-accented friend quickly arranged for a free replacement to be shipped out to me with delivery scheduled for two days later!
A few hours later, the doorbell rings. My friendly UPS driver has just dropped off a large box with "Bosch" written on the side. When questioned as to why the box was reported delivered at 1:18pm, he indicated that he had scanned the bar code, but forgot to take it out of the truck until now. Laughably, he then asked if I had called it in to the UPS station.
Another call to Amazon using their online caller dowitchey, and at about 7:30pm it takes all of about 45 seconds to reach an real person. After chuckling at my story, he politely asked me to hold while he attempted to cancel delivery of my replacement toy. Shockingly enough, he was too late and the saw was on its way. I was asked to simply refuse delivery and have it sent back to them, and then thanked for my honesty.
So on one side, UPS not only gave me the runaround by unexpectedly delivering my package six hours after they said they had, but also required me to make a call to another company before they would provide any assistance. On the other side, Amazon replaced my $250 item without question, had it on its way inside of three hours, and had enough customer service staff to keep its customers from having to wait on hold forever during the holiday shopping season. Not to mention, I didn't have to wander through some sort of touch-tone maze just to talk to someone. Way to go Amazon!
You simply never know when you'll need a corrupt file so that you can blame the computer, not yourself, for not getting work done.
Thanks to FileDestructor.com you can create any size Office document filled with nothing but realistic looking garbage in seconds.
Thread Across The Ocean, by John Steele Gordon, is the story of the laying of the first transatlantic cable. This telegraph link provided for the first fast transmission of data between the US and Europe.
Perhaps surprising, this book isn't really about the power of global communication. The value of that is more or less assumed. Nope, this book is all about dealing with failure. And I mean big failure.
In this case, you had a company that was dealing with the brand new technology of under sea cables and managed to have, and cope with, every setback possible.
From cable construction issues to simply having it snap while laying it across the bottom of the ocean, this was Murphy's law in practice. And when, in an instant, the cable snapped, so did any chance of success. Time to go back and face the investors, and raise yet another round of funding.
The neat part is all that you can learn from their adventure. The project demonstrates first hand how iteration, testing, contingency planning, R & D and formal process can take a potentially impossible problem and make it realizable.
Without these aspects, as their first attempt showed, the project would never have succeeded. Contrast that to their final attempt to lay the cable, which made the exercise appear almost easy.
Next time you are on an tricky project, pick this book up - it'll be a fun read and might inspire you to try something a bit different to do the impossible.
Today I came across Clipmarks, a Firefox plugin, while looking for the CSSViewer Plugin (which, by the way, is an awesome plugin which every developer who touches CSS should be using).
The Clipmarks idea is a really cool one - when looking at a page, you can tag bits of to create a clipmark. These clipmarks are then stored, annotated and shared on a central server. You can even add a clipmark-roll to your blog so that people can see what your surfing and clipping.
I haven't had a practical reason to use the plugin yet, but from what I can tell, it's really well done and should be handy. A kind of easy to use scratch pad.
I've started a Top Ten Must Have Firefox Addons list. How sad is that I don't even use 10 addons - how ungeeky can you get?
Here's a site to test your knowledge of 80's games and toys. Do you remember any details of the Smurfs or He-Man? Now you can put all that knowledge to good use!
Today I needed to convert a bunch of file names with hex values in them into files names with decimal values in them. And here's how I did it.
First, to do the actual math, I used bc - the standard Unix command line calculator. bc does all sorts of neat things, and among them, display values in a different base than they are input in. You can do the following in bc:
Next, to pick apart the name of the file so that I could rebuild them with a different filename, I used sed. I did something like:
This says to replace the entire string with the text leading up to the first _. The result here would be blah.
Finally, I wanted to take the converted decimal numbers and pad them with zeros. I did this by making use of the printf command. This looks like:
Simple, eh? Maybe not. But with practice, you can be cranking out commands like the ones above without even thinking about it.
Shira and I learned about Saran Vegetarian Indian restaurant (5157 Lee Highway, Arlington, VA) last night, and as one of her birthday dinners, decided to try it.
It's 100% vegetarian menu, which means I can (and will!) eat everything on the menu. This is always a big treat for me.
The menu selection was large, offering Northern and Southern style dishes. I can't remember the last time Shira and I were at an Indian restaurant and saw something we'd never heard of. Well, tonight was different - we both got to try something new, with more things to try in the future.
The dining experience itself might be considered a little rough around the edges. There's nothing like being served room temperature tap water to get things off to a poor start. But I'd like to write aspects like this off as part of the local charm of the place.
Overall I'm quite pleased with this find. The big menu and better location than other all veggie places makes it a hit in my book. The fact that their starter menu contains more deep fried yummyness than a burger joint doesn't hurt matters either.
One of Ideas2Executables' projects is officially open to friends and family (and if you are reading Ben's blog, he considers you a friend or family). The site is tenspotting.com, and while we can't take credit for the idea, we did help implement it. The site is the brainchild of Gavin Purcell (of tvinjapan.com fame) and is a really cool take on the top 10 list, if we do say so ourselves.
The site can be used for top 10 lists of any kind, from Top 10 Greatest Athletes Ever to Top 10 Microbrews. (And, of course, there's Ben's favorite, Top 10 Simpson's Characters.)
Among the neatest features of the site are the ability for anyone to edit any list, a drag-and-drop interface for rearranging lists, the ability to insert a dynamic view of a list in your blog, and finally, the ability to get a shared view of the list which gives a view of the list with everyone's opinion.
Don't forget the disclaimer that this is in Friends and Family beta mode. If you find bugs, let us know, and be gentle with it!
A special thanks to Jordan Rose for contributing to the design and to Alessandro Colomba for developing the SISCweb framework which powers the site.
2. To clean the caulking around bathtubs and showers, fill a trigger-spray bottle with vodka, spray the caulking, let set five minutes and wash clean. The alcohol in the vodka kills mold and mildew
15. Swish a shot of vodka over an aching tooth Allow your gums to absorb some of the alcohol to numb the pain.
I simply never imagined there would be that many uses for Vodka. Apparently, it's the duct tape of liquids.
Here's an interesting article on using mobile technology for activism. It's oriented towards teens (aren't they supposed to be playing video games and getting stalked on MySpace? Where do they find the time to change the world?!), but us adults can play along too.
Here's a nifty hack for creating blended backgrounds. Using a combination of CSS and transparent images, you can end up something like:
What's nice is that the color aspect of this is located in CSS, which means you can easily tweak the background without mucking with the gradient.
Red Ferret mentioned a service which allows your web page readers to include a snapshot of themselves on your web page.
Sounds both useless and entertaining! I don't have a webcam, but perhaps someone who does can contribute a snapshot?
While reviewing a blog entry talking about gimmicky business ideas, the author tossed out this link to Eight No Cost Ways to Market Your Business.
These are good, common sense ideas. I like that these ideas are more about adding value than fooling someone into buying your product.
I stumbled across this cute and educational story about using commas (yes, commas) while reading Joyce's blog.
It reminded me, I so need to go back and learn the formal rules of grammar, as I still tend to depend just on what feels right. Luckily, I have a wife who knows all these rules and isn't afraid to share them with me.
My trusty Mach 256MB mp3 player is in need of an upgrade. As I mentioned in my original review, the materials are basically crap. So, I'm actually surprised it's lasted this long (and I do beat it up pretty bad).
And what to upgrade to? Well, to the 1GB version of course! Tiger direct has it on sale now for $9.99.
If you still don't own an mp3 player, you should check out this deal. For $10 bucks, you really can't go wrong.
As you can see from the attached photo, I finally have my laptop back. I'm mobile again! While I love the huge screen, and high resolution of the desktop, nothing beats being able to carry around my laptop.
I was really surprised how easy it was to sync up my desktop and laptop. I simply copied c:\cygwin back and forth between the machines.
Because I have everything stored in my home directory (c:\cygwin\home\bsimon) I knew I grabbed all my personal files. I also ended up copying the exact same tools (emacs, X, etc.) between boxes.
I'd like to think that Cygwin's (and Unix in general) reliance on plain text files played a role here. No silly registry settings to forget about, among other Windows mysteries.
Two files that weren't in c:\cygwin that I wish I had copied over were my Firefox bookmarks and my Trillian configuration.
It sure is good to be back to my laptop toting self. I'm tempted to hold a meeting in the conference room tomorrow, so I can use the projector - just because I can!
And here, I was getting all agitated about a silly 5% restocking fee. That's nothing! A buddy at work was telling me about his builders, and what a crummy job they did.
I just love that he has an outlet where he can share his story with the world. Hopefully, other's will learn from his experience, or even better, the Builders will come around and try to make things right. Either way, I know I certainly won't be using CW Custom Builders anytime in the future.
I just love this picture my friend posted of a stud they used - I think this neatly sums up their devotion to quality:
It's hard to believe it's been over a year since Shira's dad has passed away. Today we remembered his passing by having the unveiling of his headstone.
The attached photo shows the top of the new headstone with a bunch of small stones on it. It's Jewish tradition that when you visit a grave site you leave a stone, rather than flowers, to show that you were there.
Flowers are a good metaphor for life. Life withers; it fades like a flower. As Isaiah says "All flesh is grass, and all its beauty like the flower of the field; grass withers and flowers fade" (Isaiah 40:6,7). For that reason, flowers are an apt symbol of passing.
But memory is supposed to be lasting. While flowers may be a good metaphor for the brevity of life, stones seem better suited to the permanence of memory. Stones do not die.
As promised, here are selected photos from our Switzerland trip. We ended up having a great time, despite the wet weather. We saw lots of cool sites, ate cheese and chocolate, and oggled watches and knives. Pretty much everything you should do on a trip to Switzerland (except ski!).
Chanukah came early this year! Shira's mom opted to give us and Elana/Shmuel's gifts in person rather than during the holiday.
We made out like bandits - getting books and lots of pretty stuff for the house, among other things.
We have a small business that specializes in helping individuals and companies turn their ideas into working software.
Today's goal was to setup a Scheme programming environment on my new Galaxy S9 Plus phone. I planned to use the same tools I'd used...
Yesterday Shira was paying an electronic invoice when she noticed a neat feature. The invoice contained a link that took her right to PayPa...
You just never know when you'll need a fake credit card number - and when you do, here's a site can provide them for you. This ...
I'm loving the FPDF PDF library for PHP. It's simple enough that I can hack it when needed, yet powerful enough that I don't...
I've noticed a fairly interesting weed along my usual walking route , and today I decided to see if I could name it. Here's what...
My brother's check engine light came on in his car a couple days ago. This, of course, could mean just about anything from a loose gas cap, to an imminent system failure. That one little light sure packs a whole lot of information in it.
Of course, a mechanic can for a fee, extract the exact error code that triggered the light to come on. This is annoying because (a) you've got find a mechanic when the light comes on; (b) you've got accept that they'll charge you an exorbitant fee for an activity which takes under 1 minute to perform and (c) you've got to hope that they aren't fibbing to you as to what the trouble codes actually are.
Luckily, we've got our buddy Justin who has a code reader and was able to extract the information in just a few seconds. Combine that with Google, and troubleshooting the problem was a breeze.
Though, this got me thinking -- why don't I own a code reader? A quick search on Amazon showed that they weren't very expensive. As I talked this over with my brother, it occurred to me that we didn't technically need a code reader at this moment. But, aha! That's the perfect time to buy one.
So for $54.99, we officially invested in a Actron CP9410 PocketScan. This little puppy will read and reset the diagnostic code from any car since 1996. Best of all, it even rates the codes it finds on a scale from harmless to urgent. Perfect for a non-car geek like myself.
We gave it a try tonight on my brother's car (which is still having it's check engine light come on). It worked flawlessly.
Not knowing anything about code readers, it's really hard to say that this one is better than what's out there. But, when you consider the rating system I mentioned, as well as the ability to plug the device into your PC to update it with new codes - it strikes me as pretty dang sophisticated. Especially for $50.
I should probably have one of these in the glove compartment of both our cars. It only needs to come in handy once during the life time of the car to make it more than a worth while purchase. And even if it gets used only to confirm what the mechanic is going to tell me, it's still a winner.
Funny, it was only a week or two ago that I was actually thinking about buying one of those. The place where I take my car charges something like $100 or $130 "diagnostic fee". Which they will credit towards the repair, but what if it's only a $20 part that you need?
While we're conversing about auto repairs... Ben, do you mind if I ask on your readers if anyone knows of a good mechanic in the Arlington/Northern Virginia area? I'm not looking for special deals (I know cars repairs can be expensive), I'm just looking for someone I can trust when they tell me it'll cost $X to fix my goblygook valve (or whatever).
Yeah, for a $100 reading fee you're far better off getting the code reader (even I can do that math). Or better yet, just borrow mine ;-)

"Love is patient and kind; it is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrong but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. So faith, hope, love abide,these three, but the greatest of these is love." 1 Corinthians 13
"A person should hear a little music, read a little poetry and see a fine picture every day in order that wordly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which God has implanted in the human soul." Goethe
"Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be shelter to the other; now you will feel no cold, for each of you will be warmth to the other; now there is no loneliness for you, for each of you will be companion to the other. Now you are two persons, but there is one life before you. Go now to your dwelling place, to enter into the days of your togetherness, and may your days be good and long upon this earth."
"It is not gratitude, my child I ask, nor do I seek to make my will your own; the memory of your babyhood though you are grown enchants me still; nor ever was a task performed for you save lovingly. I do indeed thank you that you have brought me days of bright felicity in all your ways and hours of grieving so few. No, do not thank me now but think upon your childhood tenderly when I have gone and if in sudden sweet remembering you too find deepening joy in each small thing done for your child or in your ministry to one beloved you will be thanking me. " unknown author
"Take kindly the gift - your life in time. Ponder the beauty within you, and know you were made with care. Consider the wonder of the world around and pray to understand your purpose. Give of your gift to others with courage and love deeply, for in loving is your spirit's treasure. Forgive those who may render you pain, being forbearing in your justice and generous in mercy, for in grace are the secrets of peace.

"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you - to give you a future and a hope. And when you call upon me and search for me with your whole heart I will hear you, and you shall find me. And I will gather you up...and bring you to your homeland, and you shall be my people and I will be your God." Jeremiah 29:11-14 and 30:22
"Lord, make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; where there is sadness, joy. O divine master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled, as to console; to be understood, as to understand; to be loved, as to love. For it is in giving that we receive; it is in pardoning that we are pardoned; and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life." St Francis of Assisi
"To laugh often and love much; to have won the esteem of the intelligent and the affection of children; to have earned the trust of the prudent and weathered tragedy with grace; to have found in suffering a kinship with humankind; to appreciate beauty; to inspire the best in others; to have endowed your spirit's treasure whether in loving a child, lifting a burden, or redeeming an ill; to have given without interest of gratitude; to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation; to know that even one life has tasted joy because you have lived." variation from Ralph Waldo Emerson
"You have given me so much...when you believed in me, and loved me for who I am, and did not judge me, or use me, or try to change me to suit yourself. You listened and helped me hear myself. When I just needed you there, when words were useless, you understood. You held my hopes, my fears, and my regrets and I felt safe and loved and strengthened for confiding in you. You gave me laughter and filled my world with your spirit and made me feel appreciated and enjoyed. You have given me reason to embrace life; happiness, the precious precious gift of your friendship, your love, your beauty, and my better self. You" © David Kreider
"To show great love for God and our neighbor we need not do great things. It is how much love we put in the doing that makes our offering something beautiful for God." Mother Teresa of Calcutta
"To love and be loved; to find beauty in everyone, joy in adversity, and in each moment an opportunity for kindness. To listen and to care; to abhor violence and injustice; to never let it go unchallenged, to understand my humble place as well as my great worth in the universe; to recognize the wrongs I have done; to forgive those of others, and to pursue peace and understanding with my kindred upon this earth." © David Kreider
"If a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music he hears however measured or far away." Henry David Thoreau.
"When you were an infant I loved you and out of the darkness I called you my child. It was I who taught you to walk and I took you up in my arms but you did not know that I comforted you. I led you with cords of kindness, with bands of love. I was to you a mother who lifts her infant to her cheek. I bent down to you and fed you. How shall I ever give you up? My passion is kindled warm and tender for it is I who gave you life and my spirit is ever with you. Return to me, child, that I may keep you and hold what is good. I will renew your spirit and love you freely. You will flourish, your beauty will blossom, and your fragrance go forth as wine." Hosea selections from 11:1-9, 14:1-7 paraphrased

"Look to the mountains - to the greatness God has made; therein lies comfort; therein lies inner strength; therein lies peace of mind. Look to your fellowman as though you would look through the eyes of God...and you will find love, and you will find peace, but above all you will find truth." anonymous
"The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you; the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace." Numbers 6:24-26
"I tell you, do not be anxious about your life...Look to the birds of the air and see the lilies of the field, how your heavenly Father provides for them and adorns them with beauty! How much more precious are you than they! So I tell you do not worry; your heavenly Father knows your needs. But seek first his kingdom and his ways and all these things will be yours as well." Jesus' sermon on the mount
"To laugh, to cry, to reach out, to expose your feelings, to publically express your ideas and dreams, to love, to live, to try; all risks. The person who risks nothing gains nothing, has nothing, and will be nothing. He or she may avoid a momentary setback or embarrassment, but in the end they will not learn, feel, change, grow, love, or live. They are slaves to fear. Be free!". author unknown."
"The Lord's unfailing love and mercy still continue fresh as the morning, as sure as the sunrise. The Lord is all I have and so in Him I put my hope. The Lord is good to everyone who waits upon Him, to the soul that seeks Him." Lamentations 3:22-25
"Prayer is not asking. It is a longing of the soul;...the tie that binds one to one's creator. It is daily admission of one's weakness...It is better in prayer to have a heart without words than words without a heart." Gandhi."

I formed you in your mother's womb, I adorned you with beauty, and as a mother remembers the child at her breast, I have engraved you in the palms of my hands and I cannot forget you. The nations will know I have blessed you, for among them you will be my chosen child in whom I display my splendor." Isaiah, Hosea, Psalms, Ezekiel

Seed catalogs are arriving in the mail, but before you order consider making a trip to the Mercer Public Library to see the selection. Gardeners can “check out” seeds this year, grow them in their gardens and hopefully harvest seeds in the fall to return to the Seed Library. This process can benefit gardeners in our northern climate because the seeds harvested from successful fruits and vegetables in our area will likely do better in subsequent years.
The Mercer Seed Library’s mission is to encourage local gardeners to grow and harvest a variety of seeds. The library currently has seeds such as tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash, lettuce and herbs, all locally grown. There are also seeds from commercial growers, and most are organic and non-hybrid varieties. The seeds are available to local gardeners at no cost or obligation.
Gardeners are encouraged to save seeds and return them to the seed library when possible, but all are welcome to take seeds from this community resource whether they intend to save seeds or not.

How many times have you walked into your kitchen and thought: “My kitchen really needs a facelift?” I can’t tell you the number of times I hear from friends who share this dilemma. The problem is that they aren’t quite ready for a complete renovation or a brand new kitchen. They simply want to breathe new life into a dated kitchen, whether ultimately to sell the house or to stretch the life of the kitchen for a few more years.
So, how do you make an impact when refreshing your tired kitchen? Start first with the cabinets. If they are sound and in good shape, consider having them professionally painted. Techniques differ amongst painters — some brush the paint on, while others spray, so be sure to ask your painter about his process. The prep work takes the most time and is a vital component of a great paint job, so make sure that you’re hiring a meticulous, professional painter with great references since this won’t be an insignificant amount of money.
If your countertops are in good shape and aren’t dated, consider yourself lucky! Replacing countertops is most-definitely an option, but will certainly impact your costs, especially if your budget is tight. And if you’re replacing your countertop, this would be a good time to switch out your faucet for a newer model, and your sink for an undermount (if you don’t already have one).
While changing out a dated tiled backsplash for something more current will require demolition and repair to the sheetrock, this is a change that will have tremendous impact. Make sure to hire a good tile installer who knows how to remove the old tile, repair the wall behind and install new tile. The process will take several days, but the wow-factor will be big.
Changing out your cabinet hardware will also go a long way towards making your kitchen look fresh. If you currently have cabinet knobs and want to change to bar pulls, now is the time to do so since the painter can easily fill the holes. Just remember: you’ll need to hire someone to measure and re-drill holes for the new hardware once the cabinet paint has cured. Alternatively, if you want to keep it simple and manage your costs, opt to keep the same type of hardware you currently have (i.e.: knobs or bar pulls) and just replace with a different style and/or finish. No need to patch and re-drill holes.
Finally, a great way to make a big statement is to replace your lighting. Does the light fixture over your kitchen table appear dated? Do the pendants over your island look like they are stuck in the ’80s? Lighting is often overlooked and is such an integral part of any space, and updating it can be literally transformative. For some reason, people are often reluctant to change out light fixtures, when in fact this is one of the most impactful changes you can make in any space — give it a try!
Clearly even a facelift in your kitchen isn’t for the faint of heart, but if you’re willing to live through both the mess and the frustration of being displaced for a few weeks, these changes will certainly have a big impact on your space. Any good designer can guide you through the process and manage all of the details to help you with your update. It’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it!

Oh, Lard. I’m old. If I wasn’t so handsome it would be a tragedy, how old I am. Maybe I should be asking how young are you? Change the subject, get out from under the spotlight. Stop thinking about my coffin. Well, I was born in 1948, so you can do the math, but let me give you a piece of advice…don’t ever, ever, ever, EVER get old. It’s just not worth it. But if you choose not to heed my advice, let me give you another bit of advice…study the martial arts every single day. Never let a day pass without studying. If you’re lying in your death bed with the family gathered and sobbing, if you know you have only a few seconds of life left, have somebody say some lines from a Bruce Lee movie, or maybe give a little Kiyai when you leave your body. You do that…and your life will be worth it. Now, youngster, ten push ups, then do your forms. Signed ~ old doddard Al

Editor’s Note: This is part of a series at Jaded Politics titled “Opposing Views”. Today we look at the issue of Syria from both sides. The following is an argument in favor of Syrian intervention.
Last week the world was reminded yet again what tyrants are willing to do in their constant need to suppress dissent and secure their grip on power. News reports and US intelligence confirmed that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces were responsible for killing over 70 civilians and injured hundreds more in the country’s Idlib province.
The general sentiment among leaders in Europe and the US was mainly a mixture of horror and outrage. Russia had in 2013 assured the world that, in compliance with existing UN resolutions and a diplomatic agreement with the US, the Syrian dictator no longer possessed any chemical weapons capabilities.
Of course, both President Obama and Trump each appeared to share a common, sincere and naïve belief that Russia could be a useful partner in the fight against ISIS. They badly miscalculated. Putin has used ISIS’s threat as a pretense to bolster Russia’s proxy dictator Assad (an ally of Lebanese terrorist entity Hezbollah) with roughly 80% of military strikes in its “ISIS campaign” actually aimed at non-ISIS targets, including civilian hospitals and schools in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Isolationist sentiment prevailed as some in both parties bought into the false narrative that standing up to Russian proxies inevitably leads to World War III. That trend was taking a substantial toll on US moral standing in the world.
Assad’s regime remains one of the top state-sponsors of terrorism. Hezbollah has reciprocated by overly intervening in the Syrian civil war. As one leader exclaimed, “It is our battle, and we are up to it.” Like other jihadist campaigns, Hezbollah’s top priority is the destruction of Israel, the top US ally and sole free market democracy in the Middle East.
Moreover, the consensus among Syria political experts is that Western countries’ hesitation to enforce international law has encouraged more violations from one of the world’s most repressive regimes. They maintain that roughly three years ago, Assad (aided by Russia) essentially called President Obama’s bluff in crossing asserted “red line” – using sarin gas against rebel fighters. Though it was only a “bluff” in the sense that the Obama administration was not quite willing to retaliate militarily in the absence of Congressional approval. Obama had previously sought to back up his red line with a targeted bombing aimed at Assad’s chemical weapons facilities, Congressional members from both parties voted down the Use of Force Authorization.
Although there were several rationales withholding support, the most dominant was their own constituents’ disdain for again engaging a dictator in the region. One found many liberals, conservatives and libertarians all echoing similar rhetoric that assumed launching a limited strike on Assad would mean becoming bogged down in another drawn out campaign akin to those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The administration then tried to resolve the situation diplomatically, ultimately trusting the Russians verify that Assad’s chemical weapons were eliminated.
When photos and videos emerged recently showing Syrians, including children, suffering from a brutal sarin gas attack, it became clear that the Russians had not bargained in good faith. Some politicians have continued adhering to the same misguided isolationist talking points which they resorted to after Assad’s previous chemical attacks against his own people. But events since that time continue undermining these politicians’ claims that the US has no national interests in assisting any Syrian rebels, or at a bare minimum, in ensuring that Assad is not able to achieve victory using chemical weapons that were first banned under the 1925 Geneva Protocol.
The hesitation has emboldened most repressive regimes and aggravates the likelihood of war rather than reducing it. Self-described “non-interventionists” actually offer little more than a repackaged version of isolationism. In their effort to prevent war by ignoring threats to our national interests and those of our allies, it frequently leads to a bad case of self-fulfilling prophecy.
When dictators violate essential rules of war, Western countries can either try to enforce them by diplomatic means, respond decisively through a military strike, or offer some harsh rhetoric on television and social media condemning the regime’s actions. Critics assume that because the Syrian airfield was not completely annihilated by the US missile strikes, the US did not achieve its objective of deterring Assad or Russia.
Virtually no one, even the most hawkish politicians in Congress, are proposing large scale troop deployments to Syria. However, they warn that permitting chemical attacks to become the norm in that region or anywhere will not be a remote threat for long.
Some liberals and conservatives operate under the delusion that there is zero link between Assad’s tyranny and many Syrians being willing to oppose him. Despite claims to the contrary, there were in 2013 an appreciable number of relatively moderate Syrians who may have been able to consolidate non-Jihadist opposition. Air and logistical support likely would have sufficed to meet that objective. Many have since been wiped out by Assad’s forces and Russian attacks.
The claim that we risk a larger war with Russia has been rebutted by decades of evidence demonstrating that standing up to Russian proxy dictators does not inevitable result in open war. If anything, history has affirmed time and again that appeasing such leaders merely bolsters their ambitions for territorial expansion. Permitting Russia to continue strengthening its sphere of influence in the Middle East, just as in Eastern Europe, actually increases the chances of a larger war breaking out.
Just for starters, the America can also increase diplomatic pressure on Russia at the UN and other venues to stop vetoing every effort on security council at sanctioning members of Assad’s regime. Other military options exist besides invading Syria. Special ops forces can provide logistical support to rebel elements who meet stringent conditions. The US could help organize a regional Sunni-led coalition to take out ISIS because clearly, after two years, Putin and Assad have their interests served by keeping some sort of ISIS presence. Moreover, it would help ensure that once ISIS is hopefully destroyed, the resulting power vacuum is not quickly filled in by another emerging Jihadist group such as al-Nusra Front.
President Trump stated that the attack changed his “attitude” on Assad, one can infer that he no longer sees his “America First” foreign policy strategy (which initially appealed to “non-interventionists) and advancing the interests of human rights as being mutually exclusive. Whether this signals a serious effort to bolster US moral standing or merely an isolated deviation from a hyper-realist foreign policy, remains to be seen.
It was only days before the recent sarin gas attack that Secretary of State Tillerson indicated the US does not consider removing Assad a top priority. Now after the attack, Tillerson has told Russia that they can either stand with the US and our allies or continue to side with Iran and Hezbollah. The response was not consistent, but it surely has not been a net loss and is far superior to not acting at all. Russia and Syria were both given a heads up that strike was imminent, allowing them the chance to move their own people out of harm’s way. This is not going on the warpath.
By moral standing, we are talking about the United States’ credibility on the international stage when attempting to persuade countries on any course of action. It is not just an abstract concept but something that eventually has a tangible impact if more countries doubt our willingness to offer more than harsh rhetoric in these situations.
One Senator pointed out a propaganda strategy used to undermine American interests during the cold war – the narrative that the United States only cares about human rights when it does not burden us at all. The American public have become so conditioned to retrenchment and shrinking of US sphere of influence over the past decades that we think any assertive foreign policy posture inevitably results in full scale war.
Modern informational warfare has been effective at making false flag theories take hold and spread on social media. Russia and Syria specifically make that argument literally every time these reports surface when all out intelligence points to Assad regime being responsible. It’s a convenient rationale for his government to rely on. That he would use them again was reasonably foreseeable and indeed many did predict this turn of events.
Fairly informed people who buy into these claims recklessly ignore the reality that Assad’s forces have used chemical weapons (chlorine and sarin, among others) over 200 times since 2012. They also ignore intelligence reports confirming that Russia knew about the sarin attack in advance and even tried to cover it up by launching its own bombing missions at a nearby hospital.
While 57% of Americans support the limited strike against Assad, the Syrian dictator and Putin are betting that American political leaders and the public at large are not willing to take the steps necessary to force Assad out of power. They may be right.

Chalk another one up on the list of â€œthings our mothers and grandmothers knew, which are now confirmed with extensive researchâ€. Doctors Urge More Playtime for Children It’s always a pleasure to have intuition and/or common sense confirmed.
Parents who remembered having great chunks of unscheduled time to themselves when they themselves were children have been lamenting the busy lives of our children (as well as the chauffer-duty involved in getting them hither and yon) for quite some time now. My own child was not one of those terribly over-scheduled moppets, but she have day-care, pre-school and holiday summer day camp. The one characteristic that stood out for me was her inability to amuse herself for hours on end, and my sister and brothers and I had to do. She was very social, very well-behaved, and well-adjusted, but she had never had to go into her room, or out in the yard and create her own fun. She had a distinct tendency to look to any adult responsible for her to provide the amusement, and still today looks more towards television to pass the time.
Still, what old truism will turn out next to have a valid foundation? My money is on â€œeating dinner with the family really does foster close families.â€ I’ll work on this myself, if I could get the grant money!

How in the world did I miss this? I'm only a week behind. This is a lovely verse and of course, I adore your magnificent fairy.
Today I want to share a couple of cards I've created with the Vintage Autumn collection by Maja design. These papers are so gorgeous and are suitable for any occasion. I think this card would be the perfect wedding card.
The pink roses are handmade. I make a lot of handmade flowers these days. It takes a while to get the hang of it, at least for me, but once you master the technique it's so much fun.
I also discovered a new technique, by accident acctually. I was going to color in the leaves with Distress Ink, but my ink pad was too dry. I ended up placing the die cut leaves right on top of the pad and rubbed the ink on and voila! I got this great effect where the white still shows up on the leaves. Love it. I'll be using this technique a lot on future projects.
Next up is a card with almost the same colors but instead of white accent color I used black. I like both effects. It depends on what you're going for. This is a birthday card and I used a wreath I bought for Christmas projects, but I think it looks just as great on other type of cards.

Warren Haynes, the Allman Brothers Band guitarist, routinely plays with the surviving members of the Grateful Dead, now touring as The Dead. He’s just finished a Dead show in Washington, D.C. and gets a pop quiz from the Huffington Post.
He pauses and thinks, hands on his side. “I don’t know the real origin. I know myths and rumors,” he says. “I’m really confused about the first time I heard it. It was like a police code for smoking in progress or something. What’s the real story?”
Depending on who you ask, or their state of inebriation, there are as many varieties of answers as strains of medical bud in California. It’s the number of active chemicals in marijuana. It’s teatime in Holland. It has something to do with Hitler’s birthday. It’s those numbers in that Bob Dylan song multiplied.
The origin of the term 420, celebrated around the world by pot smokers every April 20th, has long been obscured by the clouded memories of the folks who made it a phenomenon.
The Huffington Post chased the term back to its roots and was able to find it in a lost patch of cannabis in a Point Reyes, California forest. Just as interesting as its origin, it turns out, is how it spread.
It was Christmas week in Oakland, 1990. Steven Bloom was wandering through The Lot – that timeless gathering of hippies that springs up in the parking lot before every Grateful Dead concert – when a Deadhead handed him a yellow flyer.
“We are going to meet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais,” reads the message, which Bloom dug up and forwarded to the Huffington Post. Bloom, then a reporter for High Times magazine and now the publisher of CelebStoner.com and co-author of Pot Culture, had never heard of “420-ing” before.
The flyer came complete with a 420 back story: “420 started somewhere in San Rafael, California in the late ’70s. It started as the police code for Marijuana Smoking in Progress. After local heads heard of the police call, they started using the expression 420 when referring to herb – Let’s Go 420, dude!”
Bloom reported his find in the May 1991 issue of High Times, which the magazine found in its archives and provided to the Huffington Post. The story, though, was only partially right.
It had nothing to do with a police code — though the San Rafael part was dead on. Indeed, a group of five San Rafael High School friends known as the Waldos – by virtue of their chosen hang-out spot, a wall outside the school – coined the term in 1971. The Huffington Post spoke with Waldo Steve, Waldo Dave and Dave’s older brother, Patrick, and confirmed their full names and identities, which they asked to keep secret for professional reasons. (Pot is still, after all, illegal.)
The Waldos never envisioned that pot smokers the world over would celebrate each April 20th as a result of their foray into the Point Reyes forest. The day has managed to become something of a national holiday in the face of official condemnation. This year’s celebration will be no different. Officials at the University of Colorado at Boulder and University of California, Santa Cruz, which boast two of the biggest smoke outs, are pushing back. “As another April 20 approaches, we are faced with concerns from students, parents, alumni, Regents, and community members about a repeat of last year’s 4/20 ‘event,’” wrote Boulder’s chancellor in a letter to students. “On April 20, 2009, we hope that you will choose not to participate in unlawful activity that debases the reputation of your University and degree, and will encourage your fellow Buffs to act with pride and remember who they really are.”
But the Cheshire cat is out of the bag. Students and locals will show up at round four, light up at 4:20 and be gone shortly thereafter. No bands, no speakers, no chants. Just a bunch of people getting together and getting stoned.
The code often creeps into popular culture and mainstream settings. All of the clocks in Pulp Fiction, for instance, are set to 4:20. In 2003, when the California legislature codified the medical marijuana law voters had approved, the bill was named SB420.
“We think it was a staffer working for [lead Assembly sponsor Mark] Leno, but no one has ever fessed up,” says Steph Sherer, head of Americans for Safe Access, which lobbied on behalf of the bill. California legislative staffers spoken to for this story say that the 420 designation remains a mystery, but that both Leno and the lead Senate sponsor, John Vasconcellos, are hip enough that they must have known what it meant. (If you were involved with SB420 and know the story, email me.)
The code pops up in Craig’s List postings when fellow smokers search for “420 friendly” roommates. “It’s just a vaguer way of saying it and it kind of makes it kind of cool,” says Bloom. “Like, you know you’re in the know, but that does show you how it’s in the mainstream.”
The Waldos do have proof, however, that they used the term in the early ’70s in the form of an old 420 flag and numerous letters with 420 references and early ’70s post marks. They also have a story.
It goes like this: One day in the Fall of 1971 – harvest time – the Waldos got word of a Coast Guard service member who could no longer tend his plot of marijuana plants near the Point Reyes Peninsula Coast Guard station. A treasure map in hand, the Waldos decided to pluck some of this free bud.
The Waldos were all athletes and agreed to meet at the statue of Loius Pasteur outside the school at 4:20, after practice, to begin the hunt.
“We would remind each other in the hallways we were supposed to meet up at 4:20. It originally started out 4:20-Louis and we eventually dropped the Louis,” Waldo Steve tells the Huffington Post.
The first forays out were unsuccessful, but the group kept looking for the hidden crop. “We’d meet at 4:20 and get in my old ’66 Chevy Impala and, of course, we’d smoke instantly and smoke all the way out to Pt. Reyes and smoke the entire time we were out there. We did it week after week,” says Steve. “We never actually found the patch.”
But they did find a useful codeword. “I could say to one of my friends, I’d go, 420, and it was telepathic. He would know if I was saying, ‘Hey, do you wanna go smoke some?’ Or, ‘Do you have any?’ Or, ‘Are you stoned right now?’ It was kind of telepathic just from the way you said it,” Steve says. “Our teachers didn’t know what we were talking about. Our parents didn’t know what we were talking about.”
It’s one thing to identify the origin of the term. Indeed, Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary already include references to the Waldos. The bigger question: How did 420 spread from a circle of California stoners across the globe?
As fortune would have it, the collapse of San Francisco’s hippie utopia in the late ’60s set the stage. As speed freaks, thugs and con artists took over The Haight, the Grateful Dead picked up and moved to the Marin County hills – just blocks from San Rafael High School.
The Waldos had more than just a geographic connection to the Dead. Mark Waldo’s father took care of real estate for the Dead. And Waldo Dave’s older brother, Patrick, managed a Dead sideband and was good friends with bassist Phil Lesh. Patrick tells the Huffington Post that he smoked with Lesh on numerous occasions. He couldn’t recall if he used the term 420 around him, but guessed that he must have.
The Dead, recalls Waldo Steve, “had this rehearsal hall on Front Street, San Rafael, California, and they used to practice there. So we used to go hang out and listen to them play music and get high while they’re practicing for gigs. But I think it’s possible my brother Patrick might have spread it through Phil Lesh. And me, too, because I was hanging out with Lesh and his band when they were doing a summer tour my brother was managing.”
The band that Patrick managed was called Too Loose To Truck and featured not only Lesh but rock legend David Crosby and acclaimed guitarist Terry Haggerty.
The Waldos also had open access to Dead parties and rehearsals. “We’d go with [Mark's] dad, who was a hip dad from the ’60s,” says Steve. “There was a place called Winterland and we’d always be backstage running around or onstage and, of course, we’re using those phrases. When somebody passes a joint or something, ‘Hey, 420.’ So it started spreading through that community.”
Lesh, walking off the stage after a recent Dead concert, confirmed that Patrick is a friend and said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if the Waldos had coined 420. He wasn’t sure, he said, when the first time he heard it was. “I do not remember. I’m very sorry. I wish I could help,” he said.
Wavy-Gravy is a hippie icon with his own ice cream flavor and has been hanging out with the Dead for decades. HuffPost spotted him outside the concert. Asked about the origin of 420, he suggested it began “somewhere in the foggy mists of time. What time is it now? I say to you: eternity now.”
As the Grateful Dead toured the globe through the ’70s and ’80s, playing hundreds of shows a year – the term spread though the Dead underground. Once High Times got hip to it, the magazine helped take it global.
“I started incorporating it into everything we were doing,” High Times editor Steve Hager told the Huffington Post. “I started doing all these big events – the World Hemp Expo Extravaganza and the Cannabis Cup – and we built everything around 420. The publicity that High Times gave it is what made it an international thing. Until then, it was relatively confined to the Grateful Dead subculture. But we blew it out into an international phenomenon.”
Bloom, the reporter who first stumbled on it, gives High Times less credit. “We posted that flyer and then we started to see little references to it. It wasn’t really much of High Times doing,” he says. “We weren’t really pushing it that hard, just kind of referencing the phrase.”
The Waldos say that within a few years the term had spread throughout San Rafael and was cropping up elsewhere in the state. By the early ’90s, it had penetrated deep enough that Dave and Steve started hearing people use it in unexpected places – Ohio, Florida, Canada – and spotted it painted on signs and etched into park benches.
“They said, ‘The fact is, there is no 420 [police] code in California. You guys ever look it up?’” Blooms recalls. He had to admit that no, he had never looked it up. Hager flew out to San Rafael, met the Waldos, examined their evidence, spoke with others in town, and concluded they were telling the truth.
Hager still believes them. “No one’s ever been able to come up with any use of 420 that predates the 1971 usage, which they had established. So unless somebody can come up with something that predates them, then I don’t think anybody’s going to get credit for it other than them,” he says.
He does take pride in his role, though. “I still have a lot of friends who tell their friends that they know one of the guys that started the 420 thing. So it’s kind of like a cult celebrity thing. Two years ago I went to the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam. High Times magazine flew me out,” says Dave.
Dave is now a credit analyst and works for Steve, who owns a specialty lending institution and lost money to the con artist Bernie Madoff. He spends more time today, he says, composing angry letters to the SEC than he does getting high.
The other three Waldos have also been successful, Steve says. One is head of marketing for a Napa Valley winery. Another is in printing and graphics. A third works for a roofing and gutter company. “He’s like, head of their gutter division,” says Steve, who keeps in close touch with them all.
“I’ve got to run a business. I’ve got to stay sharp,” says Steve, explaining why he rarely smokes pot anymore. “Seems like everybody I know who smokes daily, or many times in a week, it seems like there’s always something going wrong with their life, professionally, or in their relationships, or financially or something. It’s a lot of fun, but it seems like if someone does it too much, there’s some karmic cost to it.”
“I never endorsed the use of marijuana. But hey, it worked for me,” says Waldo Dave. “I’m sure on my headstone it’ll say: ‘One of the 420 guys.’”

So, awhile back one of you asked if you could get high off of tea made by boiling marijuana stems in water. When we asked you what you thought about, 37% of the responses said that there was not a chance in hell that this would work, 34% were unsure, and only 29% thought that this could work. Well, we’re here with an answer for you that some of you might not like to hear.
It doesn’t work, there’s not a chance in hell that you can get high off of “stem tea”. This came as a real disappointment to us, but we got over it pretty quickly.
So, if you want to make a drink you can get high off of, follow the directions below. And, sorry we’ve been holding out on you for so long. We busted this myth a while back, but thought it would be most appropriate to release the results on Drinko, I mean Cinco, de Mayo.
You see, THC does not dissolve in water. However, it does dissolve in fat and alcohol. That’s why you can make cannabutter, because butter contains lots of fat molecules for the THC to bond with. But, there is also a concoction known as “green dragon”, which uses alcohol to bond with the THC instead of fat. Now, don’t be disappointed if you’re not 21 yet and can’t get your hands on any alcohol, we have a method that is practical for stoners of all ages.
Now, you are obviously going to need some type of alcohol to do this yourself. Everclear works best, moonshine would be even better if you have it, Bacardi 151, you need something with very high alcohol content. The higher the alcohol content the easier it is, and the more potent brew you will end up with. Now, here’s something I bet you didn’t know. You can get 166 proof (that means 83%) alcohol at any major grocery store in the United States, even if you aren’t 21. You need to go to the baking aisle and get McCormick’s Pure Lemon Extract, but don’t drink it. Now, because that was said of course someone is going to drink it, so when that happens; post a comment so we know how miserable it was. For the rest of the post we are going to use the term extract, if you choose to use everclear or whatever just substitute that every where we say extract.
You’re going to need about one ounce of extract for every gram of weed you plan to use. Grind up your weed and place it on a plate, microwave it for 10 seconds, four times, allowing it to cool to room temperature between each time you zap it. Take the extract and pour it in a coffee mug or measuring cup and stir in your weed, after its been microwaved. Don’t microwave the extract.
You need to create a double boiler, which means place the mug or measuring cup in a pot of boiling water. Make sure the water doesn’t pour into the mug, and let the mixture heat up. If the extract starts to boil, take the pot off the heat, let it cool, and then put it back on the heat. You don’y want the extract to boil, you want it to be just under boiling. If you have a thermometer keep the extract at 165 degrees Fahrenheit, if not just makes sure it doesn’t boil. After its been on the heat for 20 minutes, take it off and let it cool down. Filter it with a coffee filter or paper towel, and then admire your creation. It will be very green, your very own green dragon. We recommend that you mix the green dragon with another beverage for your taste buds sake, but we don’t judge. Drink it however you want, and let the good times roll.
If anyone needs any clarification on any of this process, send us an email or post a comment below. We wish everyone a very green Cinco de Mayo. And, hope that you all enjoy your new favorite drink.

I capture images from hidden places, I immerse myself in the life of unknown artists and keep learning from other cultures.
I love languages and translating books, and when I travel I take my cameras and start shooting. Music projects absorb me 100%, I'm truly blessed to be working with a wide range of artists, in collaboration with Grammy winning producer Ian Brennan: from italian superstar Jovanotti to Grammy-award winning band Tinariwen, from American underground rock-legend Bob Forrest to acclaimed Grammy-Nominee Zomba Prison Project.
The theme at the 75th Golden Globes can be summed up in two words: women’s empowerment. Hollywood’s biggest stars wore black for the “Time’s Up” campaign taking a stance against gender inequality and sexual harassment. Female actors also spoke their mind onstage—Natalie Portman’s bold one-liner was understood loud and clear, while Oprah Winfrey’s speech received heaps of praise. The night was filled with powerful moments, but relive five that still have people buzzing.
Meyers joined in on the campaign against sexual harassment from the moment he stepped in front of the crowd. “Good evening ladies and remaining gentlemen,” he quipped. Moments later he added, “It’s 2018, marijuana is finally allowed and sexual harassment finally isn’t.”
Brown, who has fans crying on nearly every episode of This Is Us, won best performance by an actor in a television series drama. He became the first black actor to do so. He passionately thanked the show’s creator and writer, Dan Fogelman, saying, “You wrote a role for a black man, that could only be played by a black man. What I appreciate so much about this thing is that I’m being seen for who I am and being appreciated for who I am. And it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or dismiss anybody who looks like me.”
It was a big night for HBO’s Big Little Lies, a female-led show. When Dern won best performance by an actress in a supporting role, she spoke about supporting those “who are brave enough to tell their truth.” “May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture’s new North Star,” she added.
“And here are the all male nominees,” Natalie Portman said when presenting the award for best director with Ron Howard. The short yet poignant line quickly became one of the most talked about moments of the night. Barbra Streisand remains the only woman to receive the best director award. She took it home for Yentl in 1984.
After a standing ovation, Oprah Winfrey touched the nation with her speech while accepting the lifetime achievement award. Winfrey, who became the first black woman to be given the award, spoke about making strides, the importance of the press and praised the women who came forward in the last year. “What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have,” she said.
Attributes are widely used in .Net libraries such as XML serialization. The syntax of attributes is very confusing until you realize that attributes are actually classes. This article provides a quick guide to understanding attribute syntax, how to read it, and how to look up an attribute documentation to be able to spcify them in your programming practice.
This article is not a thorough reference on attributes but a quick stab at the main features of attributes so that you can gain an understanding of attributes and start using them after the first read.
There are lot more attributes in XML serialization to control the serialization process. You can see these attributes in the references section of this article. But for now these two attributes are sufficient for our discussion.
When I have encountered these attributes first my first problem was figuring out how to read this attribute specification. What is the meaning of "[XmlRoot("somename")]"? I could guess that they are trying to set the name of the root node of the XML. But the syntax is unclear because in one case they are specifying a string directly inside quotes, in another case they are using some sort of a key to specify the string against.
Some times they use commas to separate multiple attributes, and sometimes they stack them. Sometimes there are repeated attributes and sometimes not. Sometimes they seem to be applied to fields and sometimes to classes. It seemed to be a very inconsistent set of rules.
But it turns out there is a mehtod to this madness afterall. The key to understanding to attributes lies in the fact that they represent .Net classes (first class citizens of the .net world). Let us investigate this aspect of attributes for a second.
Because an attribute is a class, an attribute's name is a classname. A classname includes a namespace and so does an attributes name. So what class does "XmlRoot" represent? This name is a short cut for "System.xml.serialiation.XmlRootAttribute". I will show you later how this long name shrinked to a just "XmlRoot".
Because an attribute specification is the specification of a constructor, what goes between ( and ) are the arguments to that constructor. Like a regular class an attribute can have more than one constructor.
An exception to the above construction rule is that the attribute specification allows you not only to construct a class but also set its public properties. This means that if the class has some public properties, the specification needs to accommodate a way to set these properties as well. The construction syntax is extended to manage this need. The public properties are named and specified following the regular arguments usinga key/value pair syntax
The specification of an attribute can take multiple forms, all leading to it's construction and setting of its public properties. Doesn't matter how you end up specifying an attribute you derive a final fully qualified construction specification for the attribute where you will have the constructor arguments followed by the optional public properties.
Documentation of an attribute (because it��s a class) is available just like the documentation of any other c# class. You look up the arguments of its constructor and you look up the public properties of the attribute class. An attribute documentation in addition will also specify what programming constructs for which this attribute is applicable.
The first line identifies a fully qualified class name of an attribute followed by the constructor arguments, followed by the public properties. The second line omits the namespace from the fully qualified name. The third line omits the "Attribute" suffix from the class name. This is purely a convenience offered by the programming facilities. Let us see some examples demonstrating these variations.
1 is allowed because this attribute has a default constructor and three public properties which are set in that line
2. is allowed because this attribute also has a constructor that takes one argument. Two public properties are set in addition in the same line
attributes are specified inside of [] and usually specified right above the programming construct to which they belong. The common programming constructs are field names, method names, class names etc.
If the namespace is imported, you can just use the unqualified class name of the attribute while specifying it. This is similar to the usage of specifying a class name where you can omit the namespace as long as the namespace is in scope.
It is a convention to end the attribute class names with "Attribute". This is optional, although recommended
The suffix "Attribute" can be ommited from the specification. .Net will add this suffix to locate the class. If the original class does not have an "Attribute" suffix then the name is used as it is to look for the class.
Some attributes allow multiple instances and some don't. Compiler will give an error if it is set non-multiple and if you try to repeat it
The IDE knows to go to the right help section for that attribute class even if the attribute name is in its short form (sans "attribute" and sans "namespace")
"Programming C#: Attributes and Reflection" by Jesse Liberty at O'Reilly This is an excellent and fairly complete reference on the subject
"Controlling XML Serialization Using Attributes" in .Net Framework Developers Guid This reference goes into the detail process of effectively using these attributes to serialize such elements as arrays and collections

Let me just say at the outset that I think the ABC’s response to the new digital media environment has been innovative and outstanding. Not only is their website full of fascinating content from their TV and radio networks but they have also started to produce innovative community projects like Pool, and their mix of commentary at Unleashed is terrific.
But it struck me when I clicked on a story at their website this morning that there is still a way to go. The story “Modern Mag,” from Radio Australia, about the launch of a new fashion magazine for Islamic women is on the news home page under “The best of the ABC” banner. It has a short description: “Aquila Asia is a fashion magazine aimed at Muslim women in South East Asia,” and a picture of a veiled woman (see pic above). When you click on it you get an audio player of the five minute interview with the magazine’s editor. It’s a good listen and challenges some misconceptions about contemporary Islamic women.
However it is – or should have been a visual story – a women’s fashion magazine is a visual medium and one of the main topics of discussion is the use of varied models which reflect the differences in the lives of Islamic women. It would have been a simple matter for the producer in prepping the story to ask for the editor to email a couple of sample spreads and images which could have been loaded onto the program’s website with a brief two para introduction. Or with permission these images could have been taken directly from the magazine’s website.
This would have had two effects: on air, the presenter could say, “If you want to know more about Aquila Asia take a look at our website,” and in the post-live online environment, the presentation of the audio with the addition of simple visuals provides a much stronger representation of the story. The presenter even refers to the magazine’s website during the interview without providing viewers with a web address. Again if the small story had been preloaded, this information would also have been available to readers.
I don’t deny that there are resource implications in this type of approach, but if the workflow is handled well they can be minimal. I have written before about how a multimedia approach demands a simple checklist that associates sourcing of multimedia elements with the traditional checklists already a part of all editorial pre-publication workflows. As a transitional approach I am not even saying that all radio stories demand this type of treatment but radio producers do need to ask themselves: is this a story which needs additional visual material provided through our website. If the answer is “Yes,” then contemporary listeners will expect nothing less.
American public radio NPR are ahead of the curve in making this transition and show what a contemporary online radio environment should be like. They also have one of the only decent news apps for the iPad.
“The best of the ABC” can no longer be produced in simple one medium format – the best now demands a multimedia approach.
And the Aquila Asia website, which is fascinating, can be found here. They even have a facebook page.

On January 21st, I was one of millions who participated in the Women’s March. In the days following the march, I read articles and saw photos of women in the least likely of places participating, including thirty people on an expedition ship in Antarctica (marching with penguins!) and five women in a cancer ward in Los Angeles. It has been broadly reported that the Women’s March was the largest one-day demonstration in US history, and for me, seeing so many people stand up to resist the incoming government was invigorating. The Washington Post reports country-wide turnout for the Women’s March at between 3.2 million and 5.2 million people, their best bet hovering around 4.1 million participants. I take this as indicative that many people feel as I do: something needs to change, and we must resist our current administration. But even typing this sentence, I see in myself the challenge that I think many of us feel — “something” needs to change. We need to “resist.” But what does this mean?
In trying to determine for myself the most fruitful ways to participate in this resistance, I took a look at the Guiding Vision and Defining Principles set forward by the organizers of the Women’s March on Washington. One of the first statements made is “Our liberation is bound to each other’s.” As I think about how to move forward in my own life and my own commitments to activism, I aim to center this principle. It is human nature to focus on our own needs, fears, and lives. I marched, of course, for myself and for my own access to healthcare, the right to control what happens to my body, and equal compensation for my labor. I would be lying to say otherwise: I am not selfless. But, I also marched with the understanding that my ability to march was a privilege afforded to me as a straight, white, financially stable, able-bodied woman, and that many others who need more protection than myself did not feel welcome, safe or able to attend. There is a sad irony in the fact that one group of women who could perhaps benefit most from our protest and support are quite literally barred from attending these events: women who are currently incarcerated.
Currently there are over 200,000 women in prisons in the United States. While one could argue that this is a relatively small issue, particularly in comparison to the 2 million men the US currently incarcerates, it’s important to note that the United States holds only 5% of the world’s population of women, but 30% of the population of female prisoners. In other words, we put women in prison at rates dramatically high rates. During her speech at the Women’s March on Washington, feminist scholar and prison abolitionist Angela Davis mentioned the issue, calling for “resistance to state violence perpetrated by the police and through the prison industrial complex.” While Davis has long been a vocal advocate for changing the way our country misuses mass incarceration to “solve” social issues, I was pleased to notice that she was one of multiple speakers who drew attention to the prison industrial complex at the women’s march. Addressing these issues from a national platform focused on women’s rights indicates that the problem belongs to all of us, and that we must educate and involve ourselves in order to continue to impede (and ideally to reverse) the devastating effects of mass incarceration. The good news is that while progress is slow, it’s happening: culturally, we are becoming more aware of state-sanctioned violence and its devastating effects, particularly on communities of color, and we’re finally calling for lawmakers to address the failings of our systems of justice which are structurally racist and benefit a for-profit prison system while costing Americans billions of dollars a year. However, despite the uptick in popular interest in the subject (think Orange is the New Black), very few of us know what to do about it. In my mind, the question of what we should do to fix the problem is not particularly useful until we have really reckoned with how we got here in the first place.
Our system of mass incarceration has been growing at a rapid rate since the early 1980’s, due in large part to the criminalization of drug addiction and poverty. It is widely accepted that the War on Drugs, a movement coined by Richard Nixon, has drastically contributed to the rise of mass incarceration. It has taken monumental effort to simply slow this expansion, and thinking about shrinking the prison population substantively becomes even more challenging. We understand that our current methods aren’t working: we’re locking human beings–many of whom struggle with addiction and mental health issues–into cages, with little access to their own communities, educational opportunities, therapy, or addiction services. What we’ve come to understand, albeit too late, is that this makes people violent and angry, exacerbates struggles with mental health, and rarely leads to rehabilitation, which is the “goal” of prison in the first place. The vast majority of the over two million people currently housed in prisons across our country have arguably been made worse rather than better by “doing time,” and over 90% of them will reenter our communities after serving their sentences.
Returning to society with a felony conviction is no cakewalk: while the laws differ from state to state, folks who have been convicted of a crime are nearly always demonized and are often denied access to government support while they try to get back on their feet. Folks frequently struggle to find stable employment, as many companies are hesitant to hire anyone with a criminal record. Given the struggles people often face during re-entry, prison almost never functions simply as a place you live for a bit while you make up for something you’ve done wrong. Instead, it often harms the chance that those who have been incarcerated can be successful in the future. As scholar and activist Ruth Wilson Gilmore argues, “Prison is not a building ‘over there’ but a set of relationships that undermine rather than stabilize everyday lives everywhere.” This reframing has been useful for me in my own thinking about the ways in which the prison industrial complex effects all of our lives. Prisons are not just buildings, and those inside them are not just criminals. When we push ourselves to question these definitions, we create the possibility of more successful conversations about how to address the problem: in short, by complicating our own views of who is in prison and why, we can actually simplify the issue.
By dividing ourselves into “us” and “them” — those on the inside and those on the outside — it becomes much easier to write off or ignore the experiences of people who are in prisons. By terming folks “criminals” and warehousing them away from society, we render them silent and invisible. This invisibility, both literal (we hide prisons behind barbed wire fences in rural communities) and metaphorical (we behave as if anyone who has been convicted of a crime no longer deserves to have a voice in our society, and enforce this judgement with laws barring citizens from voting during and/or after their incarceration), allows us the mental distance needed to avoid reckoning with the experiences of people who are incarcerated or really wrestling the circumstances that got them there. Frequently we place blame solely and squarely on the “choices” of individuals without addressing the structural impact of state-sanctioned violence in their lives, or the ways in which conditions entirely out of their control might have affected their lives prior to arrest and conviction. Without addressing these facets, it is impossible to truly understand the underlying systemic issues that must be addressed in order to improve living conditions not only for people who are incarcerated, but for all people living in the United States. We must shift from thinking of prisons as buildings that keep us safe from bad folks to viewing them as representative of a skewed set of relationships that negatively affects all of us — relationships we are bound into as actors, not bystanders, and for which we are accountable and responsible.
This boundedness — the hidden but profoundly entangled relationships between those of us who are in prisons and those of us outside of them — is precisely the reason mass incarceration is a feminist issue, and one that the organizers of the Women’s March address specifically in their vision and principles, arguing that it is our moral imperative to dismantle the gender and racial inequities within the criminal justice system. The rate of imprisonment has grown faster for women than men, increasing by 700% since 1980, and the majority of women in prison have a child under the age of 18. Incarcerated women also face a high rate of violence and sexual assault. We are committed to ensuring access to gender-responsive programming and dedicated health care including substance abuse treatment, mental and maternal health services for women in prison. We believe in the promise of restorative justice and alternatives to incarceration. This statement situates the dismantling of the prison industrial complex not as a peripheral concern but rather as a central goal of the organizers, vital to achieving the broader goals of the movement, to holding our government accountable to the tenants of our constitution, and to ensuring that our our elected officials legitimately champion and fight for “liberty and justice for all.”
Many of us believe that our tax dollars should fund government investment in the well being of Americans and ought be used to provide things like affordable health care, sufficient public education, access to clean water, protection of public lands, and a community-based police force that protects rather than brutalizes those it has sworn to protect. These are not obscene or unreasonable requests; they are common sense investments that are not only vital to the success of our country, but are actually cheaper than managing the repercussions of our failures to provide reasonable care for those who live in this country in the first place. From here, it follows logically that we that we must do a better job of supporting those who have ended up incarcerated due in large part to lack of access to these basic human rights. The Women’s March in January functioned not as an initial exhibition of new and exorbitant demands, but rather as a recent, well-publicized example of a longstanding fight for appropriate representation in government and reasonable access to basic human rights.
At the root of the issue, the majority of women in prison, many of whom are women of color, have been incarcerated for crimes that stem directly from trying to survive in a country that is, at best, uninvested in them doing so, and at worst explicitly committed to ensuring that they are unable to live freely or at all, let alone thrive. Author of The New Jim Crow, Michelle Alexander, offers stark statistics:
The overwhelming majority—over 90%—of women in prison have suffered sexual and/or domestic abuse, and have lived in extreme poverty. In 2004, more than 90 percent of imprisoned women reported annual incomes of less than $10,000, and most hadn’t completed high school. They find themselves behind bars primarily for minor drug offenses and for crimes of poverty and survival […] our women’s prisons are filled with people from the poorest, most vulnerable and marginalized segments of our society, whose offenses are often a consequence of their circumstances.
These numbers indicate that the vast majority of women who are incarcerated are in prison because they have been failed by our country. They have not had access to even minimal support that some of us, myself included, have been lucky enough to rely upon in moments when we have needed help. Frequently, instead of being given the chance to go to rehab, or being protected from an abusive partner, or being given support in finding alternatives to sex work, women (over half of whom have children under eighteen) are deemed “criminal” for trying to survive, and are thrown in jail.
Children from families where either parent is incarcerated (and this is not a small number: ten million American children have had a parent incarcerated during their childhood) are far more likely to experience childhood instability and extreme poverty, effectively putting them substantially more at risk to continue the cycle of mass incarceration. When men go to prison, children most often stay with their mothers, but when women go to prison, children sometimes live with family members, but frequently go into foster care. In most cases, the burden to the state of incarcerating a mother and supporting her children in the foster care system is substantially more expensive and less effective than the simple safety nets outlined by activists: the idea that drug addiction is a health issue, not a criminal issue; the idea that women should have access to safe and legal abortion;the concept of a mandatory minimum wage and affordable childcare. To address the issue of mass incarceration, we must call for the redistribution of government funds to programs that legitimately support people in America who are struggling, rather than continuing to funnel exorbitant amounts of money into prisons that harm not only those they are supposed to rehabilitate, but also those left outside the walls.
Many activists argue that incarceration, while not good for anyone, is particularly harmful to women, but few of us want to wrestle with the fact that there is a sad ordinariness to the abuse that many women experience inside of prison.The type of physical and sexual assault that happens to women who are in prison also happens every day to “free” women across the country. In prisons, these issues are simply magnified. Many tactics utilized in carceral spaces are particularly problematic because they function as state sanctioned and supported methods of control and abuse that women have already experienced outside of prison walls. Rape of women who are incarcerated by male guards is absolutely an issue, but this is at least acknowledged as problematic. Also problematic is much of the everyday strategy used to manage people who are in prison, nearly all of which relies on violation of the physical body in order to maintain control: think invasive strip searches, isolation and restraints, physical violence, abusive language and constant surveillance.
As is often the case, women’s bodies come to function as sites upon which larger social struggles are enacted. Women struggle to maintain autonomy over their own bodies whether they are incarcerated or “free,” but within carceral spaces, which utilize structures of control and punishment, these struggles become all the more extreme. Horrific treatment of women takes place behind the walls of prisons without repercussion, but the repercussions of these methods do not stay behind the walls of prisons, and in large part neither do the women who have suffered this punishment. As Angela Davis has argued, “the deeply gendered character of punishment both reflects and further entrenches the gendered structure of the larger society.” In order to fully address the systemic patterns of abuse that operate within the carceral system, those of us who believe in an intersectional, anti-racist feminism must work to educate others on the ways in which intersections of class, race, and gender lead to disproportionately harsh treatment for poor women, indigenous women, women of color, and undocumented women. We must have difficult conversations with others who have not yet had the opportunity educate themselves about the historical context in which the prison industrial complex came to power, and encourage them to question the common, comfortable belief that prisons protect us, the good folks, from the criminals who did terrible things and deserve to be there.
Those of us who see systemic marginalization as damaging to our country should address the prison industrial complex as a forefront concern. Without truly understanding the structural history that lead us to this point, it’s nearly impossible to imagine a way out. Here are some excellent places to start:
Ava DuVernay’s documentary 13th. You can stream it on Netflix and in an hour and a half you’ll have a much clearer understanding of the ways in which systemic racism has shaped our methods of justice.
Angela Davis’s Are Prisons Obsolete, which is conveniently available for free in PDF form, does an excellent job of forcing us to question not only the abysmal conditions in the vast majority of prisons, but the existence of prisons in the first place. Look especially to Chapter 4, “How Gender Structures the Prison System” for an in-depth and fascinating examination of the gendered aspects of the prison industrial complex.
Ta Nehisi Coates’ article, “The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration” illuminates the need for lawmakers, many of whom now see that mass incarceration is failing on all fronts, to reckon with the history that got us here in the first place.
Michelle Alexander’s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness has quickly become a seminal text among those advocating for disruption of the prison industrial complex, and is well worth purchasing.
As with all causes, we will do the most good by following the leadership of the people most affected by the issue we’re attempting to address. While it can be hard to access the stories of those who are incarcerated, we must work to bring their voices past the walls of prisons, and we must amplify their stories. The vast majority of these stories teach us that the methods we are utilizing are failing, and that we must imagine and then bring into reality alternative ways of addressing the social issues we are attempting to solve by warehousing and punishing people in our country who have already been marginalized. In 2003, Angela Davis wrote, “The most difficult and urgent challenge of today is that of creatively exploring new terrains of justice, where the prison no longer serves as our major anchor,” and this statement still holds true. Just as women’s rights are human rights, the issue of mass incarceration is a human issue. Those of us who marched on January 21st marched under the leadership of a group of women calling for us to affirm our shared humanity– a humanity that is currently stretched tenuously through barbed wire fences and concrete walls. It is our responsibility to strengthen these bonds and to work toward transforming our broken system of mass incarceration into a system of justice that is legitimately restorative.

Loosely translated ‘ceilidh‘ means party, and has evolved to describe an energetic night of live music and dancing. Ceilidh dances come from traditions around the British Isles and are fun and inclusive to all ages/abilities, which means they’re great entertainment for all your family and friends! The caller’s role is to explain the dances and act as a master of ceremonies, in other words to make sure the evening runs smoothly and everyone has a fantastic time.
Lisa grew up near London, going to ceilidhs across the UK from a young age. At the age of age 18 she worked with mentors from Cat’s Calling Academy to prepare her first calling gig at the popular Oxfolk ceilidh club. Later she became president of the Sheffield University Society, regularly guiding around a hundred inebriated students through an evening of energetic dancing!
She now has a wealth of experience from appearing at weddings, parties, dance clubs and folk festivals in the UK and abroad. Her repertoire of dances has expanded to include Old English Playford dances and American contra dances, as well as English, Scottish and Irish Ceilidh dances and some of her own devising. Her ethos is that that the important thing is having fun, not ‘getting it right’, so she will often adapt the dances to suit the age and ability of the audience. Whatever the event, she always aims for the evenings’ dancing to be fun, energetic and inclusive!
Live music creates a vibrant atmosphere that will get your feet tapping and your guests on the dance floor! Lisa can call for a band of your choosing or if you prefer she can recommend a band to suit your needs. She currently works with a number of excellent live bands, including:

The Growing Pains of Adrian Mole Sunday July 18th. My father announced at breakfast that he is going to have a vasectomy. I pushed my sausages away untouched. The Mole family is in crisis and the country is beating the drum of war. While his parents have reconciled after both embarked on disastrous affairs, Adrian is shocked to learn of his mother's pregnancy.
The True Confessions of Adrian Mole, Margaret Hilda Roberts and Susan Lilian Townsend Adrian Mole is an adult. At least that's what it says on his passport. But living at home, clinging to his threadbare cuddly rabbit 'Pinky', working as a paper pusher for the DoE and pining for the love of his life, Pandora, has proved to him that adulthood isn't quite what he expected.
Adrian Mole: The Wilderness Years is the fourth book in Sue Townsend's brilliantly funny Adrian Mole series. Thursday January 3rd I have the most terrible problems with my sex life. It all boils down to the fact that I have no sex life. At least not with another person. Finally given the heave-ho by Pandora, Adrian Mole finds himself in the unenviable situation of living with the love-of-his-life as she goes about shacking up with other men. Worse, as he slides down the employment ladder, from deskbound civil servant in Oxford to part-time washer-upper in Soho, he finds that critical reception for his epic novel, Lo! The Flat Hills of My Homeland, is not quite as he might have hoped.

Every time the phone rings my mother snatches it up as though a kidnapper were on the line. Adrian Mole is thirty, single and a father. His cooking at a top London restaurant has been equally mocked ('the sausage on my plate could have been a turd' - AA Gill) and celebrated (will he be the nation's first celebrity offal chef?). And the love of his life, Pandora Braithwaite, is the newly elected MP for Ashby-de-la-Zouch - one of 'Blair's Babes'. He is frustrated, disappointed and undersexed. But a letter from Adrian's past is about to change everything . . . 'Adrian Mole really is a brilliant comic creation. Every sentence is witty and well thought out, and the whole has reve..

I attempted to do an Icewind Dale 1 LP a long time ago and I ran into so many technical problems with screenshots and flickering windows that I ended up abandoning the damn thing out of frustration. I'm curious if you are experiencing similar.
Just using Fraps, and not having any trouble. You'll see a few black artifacts in the first few shots, but that's just because I had my color depth set wrong.
I am Heronius Napalm V, esq., and if that proves too troublesome for you I suppose I could let you off with "sir." Anyway, I came to Icewind Dale because mother wouldn't stop going on about how we need a man to live up to the Napalm name, and how my brother Ignatius simply wasn't going to cut it. Bothersome nonsense, really, but I got on board this boat to quiet the old gal. I suppose I'll just have to show these ne'er-do-wells the true meaning of fantastic. Speaking of: My shipmates are...quite the bunch. There's one ridiculously pretty elf who I think is trying to bed me. I was flattered at first, but then a rather tomboyish young lady (who persists in threatening my genitalia with harm) told me the elf was actually a man. Embarassing business, that. There's a pair of half-orcs on board too, one who fancies himself a spellcaster (the nerve!), and one who seems content with screaming, drinking, and breaking things. There's also one of those "free-love" hippie types you hear so much about. Don't know about that one.
I'm Kruskrak Fairhair, and I may have gotten myself into a terrible mess. I think everyone on this boat is crazy, and I only got on board because there's bound to be people who need protecting in Icewind Dale with all the fighting going on, but...oh well. I can't ask the captain to turn around now, that'd just be rude...But at the same time, these people! There's another half-orc on board, and all he really does is forward all the stereotypes people have about us. I don't think he likes me. There's a sorcerer on board, but he mostly spends his time walking around talking loudly to himself and waving his arms about. I don't think he likes me either. A lady monk got on board - do I call her a nun, by the way? I'm not sure, and I don't think she'd like it - and the only times I've talked to her she's insulted me. I don't think she likes me. There's a druid fellow too, and he's nice at least. I wonder if he takes controlled substances, though. There's also an elf, and...bless his heart, but he's dumber than a bag of bricks. He won't stop singing, either, and while it's not bad per se, it keeps me up at nights.
Call me Clobberella. Is that my real name? Doesn't goddamn matter if that's my real name or not, because that's what you will call me. Anyway, you could call my life up to this point a series of failures, and while I'm a bit glad that those monks took me in and taught me to fight, I think they're sending me to my death up here, the bastards. And the people on this boat! They're all insufferable! The half-orcs are managable at least; one's stupidly destructive and predictable, and the other's a damn pushover. The elf...eh, let's just say he's not doing the rest of his race any favors. That damn hippie won't stop trying to hug me, and good lord he smells awful. The sorcerer is the worst though...Swear to the Gods, I'm gonna kick his dick in.
Urggzob has no time for introductions! Urggzob has time for drinking and time for fighting and time for wenching! They tell Urggzob to get on this boat and he will have plenty of time to smash, but THEY WERE WRONG! There is nothing to smash on this boat except friendly people! Confusing people, too! The man in orange who likes fire talks in big words, which make Urggzob FURIOUS! The woman in blue acts like a man, and leaves Urggzob conflicted! The other half-orc should give Urggzob his half so Urggzob is ALL orc and other half-orc is ALL puny! The elf sings songs which make Urggzob's head hurt! The nature man keeps talking about nature which DOES NOT interest Urggzob at all!
Hey, brosefs! I'm Marty McSuperfly, and I'm on a magical journey right now! I got on a boat because they say it's going north, and I've never been up there. I wonder if they have bears? I've always been a fan of bears, because bears are cool. The other folks here are pretty cool too. I mean, there's this girl who's all like "I can punch with the harmony of my body and spirit" or something like that, and some guy who likes fire. A lot. And then there's a couple of half-orcs and they're pretty nice, even if they don't really get along with each other, and an elf who likes writing poetry and just chilling. I like that.
Hi everybody! I'm Pip Prancerson, and I think this trip is going to be a simply fabulous way to get some new songs written! By golly, if the people on the boat with me are any sort of sign, then this is going to be an amazing adventure. Like this one magic casting-y guy - he's a very good looking human, as humans go, and he actually knows how to dress himself! I was sure I'd be the only one. It'll be nice to coordinate outfits with him. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah! There's a really nice guy (with drums!) who's really calm all the time and I think he's all about peace and happiness too, which is nice because I'll have someone to run my poems by when there's time. That one half-orc - the quiet one - seems nice, but by golly I can't get him to open up. Hopefully we'll have tons of time to talk on the road! The other half-orc is a bit scary, and I hope I can show him a happier, more peaceful way. That would be nice. There's also a monk lady who only knows how to talk by insulting other people, I think. I'm sure she's a sweet girl who just needs a bit of TLC to open up.
As our party leaves the boat, it becomes rapidly apparent that no one thought to bring anything other than sticks. Sticks. Except for Clobberella, who didn't even have one of those.
Our party, after convincing the dock guards that we can help, carry on our merry way into the dock structures.
Marvelous execution, people! Carry on like that and we'll be a right force to be reckoned with in no time.
Marty makes haste to cure Pip's fire wounds - for those of you keeping track, Napalm has done all of the damage TO the party thus far - and Urggzob finds a locked chest.
Continuing their negligence for property laws, the party busts into house after house. Despite a warning from the gods themselves that this chest may be trapped, Urggzob continues as usual.
With Heronious narrowly escaping death, the cats are finished off. The party retreats to the Salty Dog Tavern to recuperate.
Difficult to see though it might be, Urggzob has gibbed a goblin with one swing of his greataxe here.
Eventually, we wind up in the dock warehouse. The dock manager encourages us to stealrequisition all the goods that we find.
After glorious battle, the party sets out "exploring" the warehouse. Urggzob seems...preoccupied, though.
Way to pick up the slack, gents. I bet the Mayor'll be pleased as pudding when he hears what I've done.
1)image size. Is the dialogue readable enough for you? If not, I can size/crop things differently so that it's more legible.
2)Dialogue. I'm cutting out lots of dialogue windows because they're mostly filler and I don't want eighty-some screenshots of just dialogue windows per update. Is this alright with everyone?
3)Character nonsense. Too much? Not enough? Just right? I'm having a blast writing it, but how well do you guys like it?
In the upset of the century, we'll be going to Darzog's nah I'm just kidding, we're totally going to the lava fields.
The hintbook talks up the difficulty of the Northern Sphinx, but it's significantly easier than, say, Golem Dungeon: a party that's cleared out Rivercity can probably take it on for some quick experience and loot. Then again, Golem Dungeon is easily one of the top five toughest areas in the game (not counting post-game World of Xeen content), so maybe that's an unfair point of comparison.
Anyway, the main obstacles in the sphinx are the locked doors and the high Might requirement to open the sarcophagi. I guess the mummies might be a problem if you've got a party with a poorly-armoured Druid in it (don't use Druids).
I like the layout of the sphinx: it actually occurred to the designers to make it sphinx-shaped and everything. (I am an easily impressed person.) In fact, the in-game automap even calls the first and second levels "Sphinx Body" and "Sphinx Head" respectively. The sand-jet traps tend to be put in devious places like corners or in front of doors where it's hard to avoid walking into them, sometimes more than once.

The 1970's are calling and they want their terrariums back! Actually, they're the coolest and EASIEST way to add some greenery to your home - and make you feel like a master gardener all at the same time!
The amazing, Tovah Martin www.tovahmartin.com, whom I had the great good fortune to meet, wrote this great book, entitled (wait for it) Terrarium!
She has a wealth of info inside the pages and shows some fun examples of terrariums to try at home; some as simple as an air plant plopped elegantly in a martini glass.
For a dinner I was hosting, I decided that it would be fun to have terrariums at each table and then the lucky guests could leave with one. So, off I set to gather all my materials:
apothecary jars: I found some cheap ones at Michael's www.michaels.com(a great craft store and if you wait long enough, you can use a coupon since they have them all the time)
moss: in this case I used sheet moss, but you can also use reindeer moss which is rounder and a brighter, chartreusey green
plants: (I wish I could have found some miniature ones, but instead I just grabbed what I could find, like herbs and African violets, begonias, small-leafed coleus, and baby ferns
clippers: the one's here are Joyce Chen, which you can find in garden or cooking stores since the tips work well for snipping. Watch out though, because I've sliced many a finger tip with these buggers!
tip: Stonewall Kitchen www.stonewallkitchen.com and Terrain www.shopterrain.com sell many tools, accessories and even plants for terrariums so knock yourself out! (I didn't here due to budget and time - story of my life...sigh)
Start with a clean apothecary jar. Don't forget your "Goo Gone" if you don't want to see the price label stuck on the glass. Because once your terrarium is filled, it'll be hard to scrape it off.
Pebbles are great for drainage and when combined with charcoal, the mixture provides the perfect base for the potting soil
Mix one part charcoal with one part pebbles in a good amount to cover the bottom of your container (I'm so scientific, aren't I)
Then put at least a couple of inches of good potting soil over the base, and at least enough to cover the roots of the plants you're using
I LOVE Martha Stewart (note: topic of a future post :)), but as you can see, I'm not her. I'm messy and proud of it. It doesn't matter what things look like while you're making it. All that matters is the end product.
Take your plants out of their pots and break up the roots a little so they'll be more likely to root in their new home - your lovely terrarium. Snip off parts that are too tall and won't fit once your lid is on. You can even break up the main plant into many smaller ones for multiple terrariums
And the final installation at my club. Try to vary the heights of the jars on the tables to make it look more interesting. Then figure out some fun contest for your guests so they can win one and bring it home. Let's start a terrarium revolution!
I'm Nanny and my passion is flowers. My style is natural, beachy, and a bit preppy. I love parties, celebrating my family and friends and basically finding fun anywhere I can! Let the Wild Rumpus Start!!

Claim Advances or legal financing is non-order of movement, assembling that gave that you don't get a settlement you owe us nothing. We are starting late repaid at the end of a productive indictment change over.

Presettlement arraignment financing is given by a lawsuit supporting companionship to an offended assembling not long after a settlement or honor is won, with the longing that the shocked assembling will unavoidably affirm cash from his lawsuit.

Mark recently reviewed this book, and I would encourage you to read his thoughts. We must both get the free audiobook of the month from www.Christianaudio.com. This is the third David Platt book I read this year, with “Counter Culture” being the first and more recently, “Radical.”
All of Platt’s book have essentially the same theme: Americans, American Evangelicals in particular, have distorted the Gospel message so that we can live comfortable, wealthy lives in the face of extreme poverty and lack of resources for the spread of the message of the Bible. It’s funny because now I live in Southern California where the average income is pretty steep. I’ve noticed the cultural Christianity in this area and reading Platt’s books have given me perspective on where our priorities should be.
Follow Me is about disciple making. Jesus told His disciples to follow him and He will make them “fishers of men.” In the process however, all the disciples lest two died for the faith they were proclaiming. His point is that there is a cost to disciple making, one that we as Americans don’t want to admit. We would rather get a good job, go to a nice church, work on ourselves, build a nice retirement savings plan so we can retire at 60 and waste away for the rest of our lives. In reality, the Gospel message should transform us to live a life full of meaning in the building up of other disciples, the church, and the Gospel in our work and in the entire world. This is the “call to die” as the title refers to; as Christians, we weren’t meant to be cold and lifeless and full of ourselves. We were meant to: share the Gospel; to help the poor; to build up the Church; to make disciples; and to die to ourselves. This sounds reminiscent of Platt’s book “Radical” but I would argue that disciple making IS radical. Is this not the reason the disciples of Jesus lost their lives? Were they not disciple making? And Christians around the world are martyred every day because they dared to spread the Gospel, because they dared to make other disciples.
We in America do not put such a heavy price on disciple making. We see Christianity in lackadaisical terms, where we go to be filled on Sundays and maybe Wednesdays and then do nothing in between. Platt’s argument is that we need to be intentional in disciple making. I’m so grateful to my Church, Compass Bible Church, that has materials and opportunities for people to become disciple makers through their “Partner’s” program. When we get into the habit of cruising along in our comfortable Christianity, we don’t grow and we don’t realize the impact we are to have on the world. If we really are suppose to be “salt and light” to the world, you would think that we would be more involved in the lives of others. You would think that we would have a heart for the poor; that we would be cognizant of the 6,000 of the 11,000 people groups that have no access to the Gospel; that we would make all efforts to fulfill the great commission and take the Gospel to “all nations”; that we would be evangelizing at our work, in our community, and in small and big businesses alike. There are approximately 1 billion Christians on planet earth. This number includes Catholics. So the mission field is huge. And we need to realize that our commitment to the Gospel in Evangelical America is sometimes one of indifference rather than passion.
Hi KariI am also a member of the Fellowship of Christian blogegrs and found your blog there. My blog is His Loving Embrace and I am also still a new member. I suffer from Fm/CFS and find it such a wonderful opportunity to let our Lord Jesus live His life through me. I am so glad that He brings beauty out of ashes and strength out of weakness, for with this illness that was all I could offer Him: ashes and weakness. Thanks for your beautiful thoughts.Blessings
MOSS:The BNP is not remotely 'ambivalent' towards Jews, and never has been. The party leaders routinely practise Holocaust Denial.It is true that recently the BNP has spoken out in support of Israel *but* this is purely because should the group, G-d forbid, ever come to power, it would swiftly 'repatriate' all British Jews to Israel. That is the only reason why the BNP supports Israel. Make no mistake. The BNP has well established links with virtually every neo Nazi group in Europe.

Kumi is Ryo Mashiba's sweet-natured, but hard-working and willful younger sister, and as such understands him better than anyone else. She will do almost anything to support her brother and make him happy, including going to his matches even though she doesn't like to see him get hurt. Ippo becomes infatuated with her early on.
But didn't have a chance to tell her until more than a year later, when they met in an hospital as patient and nurse some months after the Ippo/Mashiba ring. They become friends and Kumi comes to like Ippo back, but their relationship tends to suffer from their friends' and relatives' constant interference.
Number VIII of the Chronos Numbers, Baldor's been groomed for his position with Chronos from birth. He is passionate and impulsive. His loyalty to Chronos and violent tendencies are thus extremely strong. He wields the rocket-boosted hammer "Heimdall," and frequently chews bubble gum. He, together with Kranz, participates in a mission to capture Kyoko (As stated above). He is extremely vicious and aggressive, as shown by the way he tries to kill Train in his mission, and by the way he violently smashes a group of Shooting Star soldiers on Clarken Island's castle.
Baldor has only briefly appeared in the final part of the anime, but he does not appear in the mission of capturing Kyoko because in the Anime it does not take place. He is one of the Zero Numbers, that along with Mason plan on using Eve in the Eden Project.
Mei is a girl that can only be described as "normal" when compared to her older brother. While she's a devoted member of her school's Wind Orchestra Club, he's a famous musical prodigy.

I am quite the sucker for music-themed anime and manga, so of course I had to read this. Then again, I feel that music-themed manga is harder to enjoy compared to music-themed anime simply because viewers are able to hear the soundtrack.
Now then, if you like seeing individual development, a musical manga is good. The main character is always trying to be a better musician and understand the world and people around him/her, and in Andante, this is no different. What is unique to this manga, then, is the element of family drama. The introduction of Melvina into the lives of Mei and her brother Natsu seems to be a burden the way their parents dump her on them, but when they realize her musical ability, their initial viewpoints change. That doesn't mean their problems are over, however.
The beginning of the manga did not start out in a very interesting manner, though it did pick up later, much like in Miho's Kodomo no Omocha. I can't say that I really liked the biggest problem that arose, though it did make the story very intriguing. Though the ending was conclusive enough, I was not satisfied with it, hoping that there would be better closure for the main character.
I was expecting a good amount of humor from having read Miho's older and most famous manga Kodomo no Omocha, but the laughs were kept to a minimum, especially because of the conflicts within the family and the seriousness of the profession of music. That's not to say that there aren't any funny parts, though; I did spend a few good moments laughing to myself.
The protagonist Mei is a likable character. Though her brother Natsu is the musical prodigy, she is not an exceptional player, though she isn't terrible, either. This makes her an easier character for the reader to relate to, as perfection isn't everywhere. She cares about her brother a lot and would do anything to help him, yet she tries to hide her own problems and solve them herself. She is a brave young girl who has yet to discover her own strength and determination.
Natsu is the boy that possessed musical talent as a child, so everyone foresaw his success as a composer and musician in his future. He is a handsome man who garners a lot of attention for his work and performances. Like his sister cares about him, he is also extremely protective of Mei. He often overworks himself, though, in order to meet deadlines for composing music. Natsu spends hours in his studio thinking of new melodies and rhythms. I still find him a mysterious character in the way that he completely immerses himself in another world. While this type of character is too typical in a musical manga, he almost seems necessary.
Melvina is the beautiful Australian relative who comes to live with Mei and Natsu for some reason. Though she is from another country, she speaks Japanese well. She takes time adjusting herself to life in Japan because she's quite innocent and naive about city customs and Japanese schools. Her voice is breathtakingly beautiful and she loves to sing. I was a little annoyed at her naivety, but her actions made sense later on and I liked her a little better.
The artwork of Andante is almost the same as that of Kodomo no Omocha. It is typical 90s manga style with small faces, big eyes, flat hair, etc. What I didn't like so much was the same-face syndrome. Mei and Melvina looked very similar to me and only slightly differed in height. I could only tell them apart because they wore different hair styles, and they changed those often. It was particularly strange because Melvina is said to be very pretty, and for Mei to look the same made that fact mean nothing.
With all this said, I give this manga 7/10. While the plot was semi-interesting, I didn't particularly like the problem that came up later, though I can't deny that it was successful in moving the story along. I also did not like the ending. The characters were not too exciting to me, but I did like Mei. The art was all right. Overall, it was a pretty okay read after the exciting part was over. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more as an anime adaptation mostly because of the musical aspect.

Last Tuesday we went on a field trip to the Fish Hatchery for Tyler's preschool. It wasn't anything to fancy but it is close to Medford and the kids had a blast. Alex loves riding in the backpack. We'll have to go on hikes when the weather gets nicer. Flat Adam went for a ride in the backpack as well. The whole group around a pool of Rainbow Trout. They give you a huge bucket of food and let the kids go feed the fish. Tyler made me so nervous and kept trying to get close to the fish. At one point he went under the fence and was standing right next to the pool. I almost had a heart attack. Inside the visitor's center there were all sorts of stuffed animals. It was pretty cool.

Writing Credits: Robert M. Fresco, Martin Berkeley (screenplay), Jack Arnold, Robert M. Fresco (story)
Doctor Matt Hastings - The local MD in the small Arizona town of Desert Rock. He has quite the area to cover and often reaches his outlaying patients by flying his own single engine plane out to their homes. He’s the one who realizes something funny is going on out in the desert.
Stephanie "Steve" Clayton - A biology student, working to get her Masters. She comes to Desert Rock to work and study under Gerald Deemer and Eric Jacobs. She hits it off with Matt soon after arriving in town and the two strike up a friendship that could easily lead to some boom-boom.
Professor Gerald Deemer - A leader in nutrient biology, he holes up in the desert with his friend and colleague Eric Jacobs, along with grad student Paul Lund. Concerned about overpopulation, they are trying to discover a way to feed Earth’s growing millions. No, they didn't invent cheap Ramen.
Sheriff Jack Andrews - The local law in Desert Rock. Definitely the type that is set in his ways, he is somewhat of a doubting Thomas. He chastises Matt several times for the doctor’s ideas. Eventually he does listen, especially when a giant spider comes stomping toward town.
Joe Burch - He runs the local newspaper in town and as such, is always on the lookout for a good story. When people turn up dead from acromegalia and others mysteriously turn into piles of bones, he is nearly beside himself with joy. Naturally, he doesn’t belief Matt’s idea of a giant spider.
Eric Jacobs - Working with Gerald Deemer in their desert lab, he has developed a synthetic nutrient that they hope will help feed people. He decides to test it on himself. The sad result is the rapid onset and advancement of acromegalia, which gives him his lumpy appearance.
Paul Lund - The grad student working with Gerald Deemer and Eric Jacobs. Like Jacobs, he tests their new synthetic nutrient on himself. Also like Jacobs, he develops a fatal case of acromegalia within days, culminating in his death, but not before he attacks Deemer and injects him with the nutrient.
Josh - He runs the front desk in the hotel lobby. As such, he performs many secretary-like duties for Matt, who maintains his office in the same building. A bit of busy body, he eavesdrops on phone conversations. Survives the film but eventually is done in by a giant spider in another film.
Andy Andersen - This poor SOB is a local rancher that discovers some of his livestock turned to nothing but bones. On advice from the sheriff, he rounds up his remaining animals in a corral and stands guard over night. Thus he is there to see the giant spider and then be eaten by it.
The Tarantula - When we first see it, it’s already the size of a large dog, thanks to Deemer's nutrient. Once it escapes the lab, it keeps getting bigger, until by the end of the film it's damn near the size of an office building. Has a tendency to roar and spy on people through open windows.
The familiar Universal International logo graces our screen and the recycled music from earlier UI films blares out at us. It’s time to sit down, shut the hell up and watch the movie! We fade in on the desert: hot, barren and lonely…curiously, exactly how I like my women. The mournful cry of the wind is all we hear, reminding us that the place is a desolate wasteland. Unto this arid wilderness comes a lone figure, stumbling amongst the rocks and brush in his pajamas. Yes, you heard me, in his PJ’s! He’s either having one hell of a sleepwalking spell or he’s going an awful long way to get a glass of water.
So the Arthur Dent wannabe stumbles and falls. When he picks himself up, we see that his face is pretty ugly. I mean beyond fugly. This is not a natural fugly. This can only be the result of some sort of mutation. His body shows odd lumps and bulges under his clothes, more signs that the old boy has a serious glandular disorder. Either that or he’s retaining an awful lot of water. Anyway, he finally keels over one last time and dies. Cue the (recycled) music, titles and credits.
A single engine plane lands at a desert airstrip. Piloting the craft is Doctor Matt Hastings, who has just returned from a visit to one of his more distant patients, who has given birth to twins. Matt hops into his car and heads into the desert community of Desert Rock. By golly, if it doesn’t remind me of San Angelo in The Monolith Monsters.
Matt parks his car and like only people in the movies do regularly, he slides across the seat and exits the vehicle through the passenger side door. I’ve seen this behavior a lot in older films. Did people have some sort of aversion to getting out of the driver’s side? Where they afraid that a passing vehicle was going to nail them if they emerged from their car into the street? What was the deal?
Matt enters a hotel where it seems he maintains an office along with other businesses. A central desk in the lobby has an old guy named Josh who informs Matt that Sheriff Jack Andrews has been calling for him all day. Josh gets the Sheriff on the phone. He wants Matt to come over right away to look at something, saying it’s important. Matt is tired, but agrees, so he heads right back out again.
Once at the Sheriff’s office, Matt learns that Jack wants him to look at a body that was found near the highway. Jack thinks it may be a biologist named Eric Jacobs, but is not sure, explaining that the body is deformed somehow. The pair of them walk over to the undertaker’s place to view the body. Matt does not think the body could be that of Eric Jacobs, as the corpse shows all the signs of being afflicted with some disease for years. Jack saw Jacobs just a month prior and noted that the man looked perfectly normal.
About now, a Professor Gerald Deemer walks in, having been called earlier by Sheriff Andrews. He runs a lab of some sort out in the desert, Eric Jacobs being a biologist that works with him. He views the body and positively identifies it as Jacobs. Matt and the Sheriff grill Deemer, wanting to know how Jacobs could become so deformed so quickly. Deemer admits that what afflicted Jacobs was a disease known as Acromegalia, where the pituitary gland goes haywire and the body becomes deformed. Despite the disease taking years to manifest physical changes, Deemer says that it has only been four days since the late Jacobs complained of muscle aches. He offers no explanation for the rapid development, only saying that Jacobs had grown delirious and that was why he ran out into the desert wearing only his jammies.
Deemer now leaves. Matt doesn’t buy the acromegalia explanation at all. The Sheriff doesn’t seem to care.
We now see professor Deemer returning to his home out in the middle of the desert. A large place, he has his lab set up within. His lab has all the usual assortment of things for a scientist. There are lots of glass beakers and tubes and strange gizmos. The walls however, are all lined with cages filled with various animals. Without delay, Deemer dons an apron and carefully fills a syringe with some strange liquid contained in a secure box. He has to stick his hands in gloves attached to the side in order to accomplish this, and then put the syringe in a drawer through which he can extract it.
Now he makes a circuit of the room, checking the clipboards hanging before each cage. These detail the type of animal, their age, the nutrient type he is administering to them and the day of their last injection. When we get a look at some of the various rodents – white rats and guinea pigs – we see that they are huge! Easily the size of a medium to large dog, it’s apparent that their unusual size is due to whatever it is he has been injecting them with.
He picks up a small cage with a normal sized tarantula in it, but behind him is a large glass cell with another. This one is about the size of a German Shepherd and no doubt will cause most people to die instantly from shock if ever found scurrying across the lawn. Even William Shatner would be forced to remove his hairpiece and throw it at this beastie if it ever came crawling into Campe Verde.
While Deemer continues to inject the lab animals, another person quietly enters the room. This guy is just as bloated and deformed as the late Eric Jacobs. Seriously, how many mutated lab assistants does this guy have around here? This new guy is Paul, at least that’s the name Deemer calls him when he is attacked by the newcomer. During their struggle, the glass to the big tarantula’s cell is broken, allowing it to escape. No one notices this as a fire has also started while the two men fight. The spider casually walks out the back door and into the desert.
Meanwhile, Deemer has been knocked unconscious by Paul, who takes the fallen syringe containing the growth nutrient and then injects Deemer with it. Paul then takes a few steps and drops dead. A few seconds later Deemer comes to and sees the lab ablaze. He quickly puts it out, but in the aftermath we see that the place is a wreck and numerous lab animals were lost. No doubt he believes the big tarantula was one of them. Fool. Not wanting to involve the authorities again, he buries Paul’s body out in the desert.
The next day we see Matt arriving at the Sheriff’s office again. Once again, he exits his car via the passenger side door. Whatever. He informs Jack that he went to Phoenix to visit a medical library and research Acromegalia. His findings show that it would be impossible for it to develop within four days like professor Deemer claims happened to Eric Jacobs. Matt is sure that Deemer is hiding something, especially since he was in such a hurry to bury Jacobs…and not just because this is the desert and corpses are gonna start to stink really fast. Additionally, Matt is sure that whatever it is the two men were working on, it has something to do with Jacob’s death.
Jack isn’t too sure about it all and thinks that Matt is just suffering from a bruised ego. They don’t have long to talk about it because Joe Burch comes stomping across the street and into the Sheriff’s office. He runs the local paper and is steaming mad that Jack didn’t tell him about the death of Eric Jacobs. The three talk briefly about acromegalia and Professor Deemer. Finally, Joe decides to visit Deemer and ask him some questions.
Later a bus rolls into town and a smokin’ hot brunette steps off when it stops momentarily. She heads into the building where Matt’s office is located. I suppose the bus terminal is located there as well. She asks old Josh about catching a bus out to the Deemer place, but he informs her that there won’t be any more today. The only taxi in town is also not an immediate option, as the owner/operator is on a long trip and won’t be back for two or more hours. All the smokin’ hot brunette can do is wait, so she sits down in one of the chairs scattered about the lobby area. Josh tries to press her for information, but she is rather aloof.
Matt emerges from his office and tells Josh that he is expecting a call and to transfer it to the Deemer place when it comes through. Realizing where Matt is heading, Josh tells him to take the smokin’ hot brunette with him. She says that she does not wish to impose but Josh says that Matt would be glad to drive her. I’ll say! I can just imagine how he would like to drive her! Matt helps her with her luggage and before they can depart, Josh asks if they are going to introduce themselves. They look at each other, and then look at Josh and in unison answer, “No!” Then they walk out.
Halfway to the Deemer place Matt introduces himself. The smokin’ hot brunette introduces herself as Stephanie Clayton or “Steve” for short. I’ll admit, the nickname is kinda cute, but it’s not the name I wanna be shouting out in the throes of passion. It doesn’t matter if no one else can hear me. It just wouldn’t sound right to my ears.
Steve explains that she is a biology student doing graduate work and that Professor Jacobs offered her a position out at the Deemer place. She will stay there and be lab technician, student and cook. Matt informs her that Jacobs died the previous day from acromegalia, but that he is not sure it was the real cause of death.
The car continues through the desert and after they have passed one stretch of road, who should come sauntering along? That’s right! Professor’s Deemer’s escaped tarantula, only now the thing has gotten even larger. It’s easily the size of a large car of truck. That can of Black Flag ain’t do any good. Better call in a truckload of DDT.
Arriving at the Deemer place, Matt sees that Joe Burch’s car is parked outside. When no one answers the door, they go on inside where Deemer is showing Joe and a photographer the burned out lab and explaining how an electric panel shorted out and caused the fire. The newspaper men leave and Steve introduces herself to Deemer, explaining that Eric Jacobs had hired her. Deemer recalls being told about her arrival and offers her the opportunity to stay, despite the setback of the fire and Jacob’s death. Steve asks about a Paul Lund, who was supposedly assisting Deemer and Jacobs but the Professor says that Paul is no longer there. No shit! He’s buried out back in the desert!
Deemer gives Steve and Matt a quick tour of the lab (what’s left of it) and explains that his work is to increase the food supply in the world in order to meet the demand of an ever-increasing population. Funny enough, he goes on to explain how by 1975 there will 3 billion people on Earth and by 2000 that number will increase to 3.25 billion. Ha! I wonder what folks would have thought back then if they knew that by the year 2000, there would over 6 billion people? Anyway, Deemer shows them around some more and we learn that he has been using a radioactive isotope as a bonding agent for the synthetic nutrient he has developed. Great, here we go again with the radioactivity.
The phone rings about now and it turns out to be Josh looking for Matt. After taking the call he prepares to leave, having to make a house call on his way back to town. Before he goes he talks to Deemer again about the acromegalia that killed Jacobs and expresses his doubts. Deemer gives him permission to perform an autopsy so that he will know for certain that it was indeed acromegalia. Matt thanks him and heads out.
Later, Sheriff Andrews drops by the undertaker’s place, where Matt is performing the autopsy. Matt admits that Eric Jacob’s did indeed die from acromegalia. Jack is rather upset, feeling that Matt made a big stink over the issue for nothing. He storms out, but Matt is still puzzled by it all.
Out at the Deemer place, we see the Professor instructing Steve on the safe handling of his radioactive nutrient. They inject a baby rat with the stuff and look over some other enlarged rodents. Deemer talks about how they need to defeat the instability in the nutrient before they can try it on humans. While blabbering on, we see Deemer rubbing his upper arm as if something is bothering him. Hmmm…might it have something to with that injection the late (and highly deformed) Paul Lund gave him? I’d say it’s already been tried on Humans and the fugly visages of Lund and Eric Jacob’s are the proof!
Sometime later, Steve heads out to catch the bus into town so she can get her hair done. Ha! She might be a scientist with brains, but the filmmakers are still going to make her all girly by having her insist on a regular hair styling. As he leaves, we see Deemer rubbing at his arm again.
In town Steve runs into Matt, who flirts shamelessly with her and convinces her to take a walk with him in the small park at the center of town. All towns in the 50’s seemed to have these locations. Hell, I half expect George McFly to come to running past, Biff hot on his ass. He quizzes her on life at the Deemer place and she expounds on the work being done there. When she becomes worried about missing her bus, he offers to drive her back home.
As they drive, they talk about the beauty of the desert and decide to stop near some large rocks. They walk around, admiring the scenery and stop for a smoke. As they sit, some large rocks come tumbling down behind them, one boulder even hitting the camera and shaking it. Matt and Steve jump out of the way and once the rockslide is over, look around to see what started it. Alas, nothing can be seen. They hop back in the car and continue on, but as they drive off, gigantic spider legs can be seen rising from behind the rocks. Holy crap! That thing is now the size of a small building!
Matt drops Steve off at the Deemer place and she invites him inside to see the rabbits. Professor Deemer sees them coming and quickly runs up the stairs and hides. They come into the lab and Steve is astounded at how much the animals have grown in size since she left earlier in the day. The phone rings, but it’s just Josh calling to tell Matt to make a stop on his way back to town. Matt leaves, but not after more flirting with Steve.
Once Matt is gone, Deemer appears and grills Steve on why she brought him into the lab. Deemer doesn’t seem thrilled about it, but the freaky part is his face. There’s something wrong about it. There’s no large mutation of any kind, it’s just…off. Steve heads upstairs and Deemer to the lab, where he looks in a mirror. He then regards an empty syringe and no doubt pieces the clues together and realizes that the late Paul Lund injected him with is own nutrient when he lost consciousness during the fire.
On his way back to town, Matt stops by the spot he and Steve sat and were nearly crushed by the rockslide. Looking around he is startled by Sheriff Jack Andrews, who saw Matt’s car while on his way out to the farm of Andy Andersen. It seems Andy claims something has been eating his cattle and has a stack of bones to show the Sheriff. Jack asks if Matt wants to come along and the two head out.
At Andy’s place they are shown the skeletal remains of several cows, the flesh stripped clean. Matt suggests mountain lions as the culprit but Andy knows it wasn’t anything like that. Nearby is a large puddle of some strange pasty liquid. Andy is less concerned with that than with the danger to his livestock. All Jack can do is advise him to round up his remaining animals and stand guard overnight. He and Matt then leave.
Night falls on the Andersen place. All his horses have been contained in one corral. The animals start to become skittish and we soon see why: cresting the top of a nearby hill is the tarantula and it is now gargantuan, easily the size of a ship…though maybe not quite as big as a battleship. The colossal arachnid just sits there, regarding the tiny horses below and then ever so slowly, begins to descend the slope. This sends the horses into a panic, the animals running in endless circles.
The spider closes in and we even get a Spider-cam shot, showing us what the big beast sees out of one of it’s numerous eyes as it zeroes in on one particular horse. The spider also roars, something I never knew that spiders did. I was under the impression that mammoth spiders sounded like winded drunks, but maybe I was misinformed. Anyway, along about now Andy Andersen comes running outside with his rifle. The Spider-Cam fixates on him and he lets loose with a single shot at the big tarantula. Yes, you heard me, a single shot! He backs away from the advancing spider but bumps into a wall. Forgetting about his rifle or the stunningly original idea of turning and running like hell, he just stands there frozen in fright as the tarantula closes in to make a meal of him. He screams in horrifying fear and then things fade out.
Now we see an old pickup truck winding its way through the desert hills at night, following a narrow two-lane road. In the bed of the truck are a few sheep that can be heard bleating. In the cab are two guys, one who is driving and one who looks asleep. As the vehicle heads down the road, we see the giant tarantula coming over the hill ahead. The two guys in the cab see the spider and exhibit the slack-jawed, wide-eyed stare of disbelief that is common in the surfer community...and imbeciles. Next thing we know, the cab is twirling around in a circle and then we see the entire truck flying through the air to land in a broken heap. Seriously, it looks like the producers used a crane to lift a pickup truck really high and then let it drop. The tarantula advances toward the wreckage. We can assume that all the sheep and the two dorks, whether alive or dead, were soon gobbled up.
Day comes and we see Matt arriving at the scene of the truck crash. Already there are Sheriff Jack Andrews and his men along with newspaper man Joe Burch. Jack shows him the remains of the vehicles passengers: nothing but bones. Jack adds that there were no skid marks on the road and an inspection shows that the brakes still work. Nothing to indicate how the truck left the roadway and ended up several dozens yards off the road in a field.
Also nearby are more of those big puddles of white goop that were seen at Andy Anderson’s ranch. In fact, Jack informs Matt that Andy is dead, too. It seems his wife found him by the corral, stripped down to bones like the livestock, more big puddles of goop around his remains.
Joe is unsure what to make of everything, so Matt advises him to write this up as an accident until they can clear things up. Printing rumors and half-truths will only scare people. Borrowing a thermos from one of the deputies, Matt then collects a sample of the goopy white stuff.
Back at his lab, he examines the stuff, but can’t nail down what it is. All he knows is that it is related to insect venom. Joe and Jack are not buying it, but Matt is positive. He suggests to the other two doubting Thomases that they take the sample to professor Deemer and let him examine. Jack and Joe agree and head out while Matt calls Deemer.
At the Deemer place, Steve answers the phone and is relieved to find that it’s Matt on the other end. She’s trying to tell him that Deemer is sick and won’t see a doctor. Unbeknownst to her, Deemer is descending the stairs behind her. He approaches and pulls the phone from her grasp. She looks at him and screams. Of course, we can’t see what he looks like at this point and must rely on her terrified reaction to gauge his looks. Matt calls out to Steve, but the line goes dead. Without wasting a second, he rushes out the door.
Zoom! Just like that he’s in his car and careening through the desert, not seeing the giant tarantula as it walks around the hilltops in the distance. Arriving at the Deemer place he finds Steve outside waiting for him. She takes him inside where professor Deemer is having a hard time breathing. When we finally see his face, we find that it is now very distorted, as if one side of his face is sliding off his skull.
At this point, Deemer is lucid enough to provide some plot exposition to Matt, Steve and the Audience. He relates how his partner Eric Jacobs and their assistant Paul Lund injected themselves with their experimental nutrient, only to develop acromegalia and die within four days. He explains how Paul attacked him and injected him with more of the nutrient while he was unconscious.
The professor then talks about all the giant sized specimens they had before the fire. A big rat, a guinea pig the size of a police dog and a big tarantula – all lost in the fire according to the professor. Now, this is why Deemer is an idiot. The fire at the beginning certainly did not burn very long. Definitely not long enough to reduce a cow-sized tarantula to nothing. Surely, there would have been some remains left behind. The lack of said remains should have clued him in to the fact that spider escaped, but he’s too much of a moron to figure that one out.
Deemer passes out about now, so the other two take him upstairs and put him to bed. Later, Matt leaves Steve with some pain pills for Deemer and them leaves, saying he wants to check something. See, he’s no dummy! He’s put two and two together, unlike most people in these old films that stumble around blind to the obvious. Giant pools of insect-like venom? People and animals stripped to their bones? A giant tarantula that supposedly died in a fire? Yup, he suspects what is going on, but has to confirm his theory.
Using his plane, he flies to the Arizona Agricultural Institute where he consults with specialists and has it confirmed: the strange white goopy crap is tarantula venom. The Institute Doctor says that it would take a hundred tarantulas to produce the amount of venom Matt brought with him. Matt says that he found pools of the stuff four and five feet across, two to three inches deep. The other doctor is not sure what to make of that, thinking that it is clearly impossible.
Now comes the staple of these old giant bug films from the 50’s. The Doctor rolls out and plays a short film on tarantulas, describing to Matt their habits, abilities and vulnerabilities. While he is addressing Matt, we all know it’s the audience in the theater this information is being presented to, just so the folks in the theater will know just how nasty, freaky and all around scary the tarantula is supposed to be (for purposes of this film of course). The part you need to remember is that a tarantula predigests its food. It injects its prey with a paralyzing venom and then floods the wound with a natural solvent so that the flesh can be slurped up like some sort of meaty milkshake.
Matt chats with the Doctor a few more minutes and realizes that if there is a giant tarantula on the loose out there somewhere, it would be the most deadly thing that has ever walked the Earth. Obviously the man has never encountered Louie Anderson at Sizzler on all-you-can-eat BBQ rib day.
There is a gigantic spider on the loose and right about now it’s strolling around the desert knocking over phone lines. This prevents Matt from calling back to Desert Rock from Phoenix. With no other choice, he decides to head back in his plane.
Night has fallen and after a shot of the spider walking through some power lines, we see a couple of old guys at a makeshift campfire somewhere in the hills. I don’t know if these two are vagrants passing through the area or are locals that decided to camp out for some reason. It really doesn’t matter. As they sit at their fire, the spider comes up over the hill behind them and begins descending the slope in their direction.
Both men hear something and turn to look at the approaching monstrosity. Like all folks in these films, they stare wide-eyed at it for a second or two out of sheer disbelief. Then abandoning their fire, as well as all pretense of rational thought, they turn and run like hell. They don’t get too far before one old dude takes a tumble and falls. His buddy runs on several feet before he realizes his pal has fallen. He runs back and helps him up. Then the pair run on again.
Now, each of these old guys only has two feet. Plus, they are old. Their chances of outrunning a colossal tarantula are about as good as my chances of winning American Idol. In other words, no shot in hell. The pair run on, but again, the same guy falls to the ground. This is the point where if I was the first guy, I would just keep running. He already helped the other guy once. A second fall? That’s just nature thinning the heard. I’d take my chances and keep running. Alas, the first guy is nicer than me. Again, he turns back to help his friend, but this time it is too late. The spider is upon them. It roars and another Spider-Cam shot zooms in on the two men as they huddle together on the ground. GOBBLED!
Matt flies back in to Desert Rock and from the airport phones Sheriff Jack Andrews. He wants him to round up some men as well as the state police and meet him at the Deemer place. Jack is reluctant at first, but Matt insists and the Sheriff ultimately agrees.
Meanwhile, the tarantula is still stomping around, bumping up against power lines. This causes the lights to flicker at the Deemer place. Inside, Steve gets up from her desk and checks on the Professor, who is still sleeping. Steve returns to her desk and there is an eerie moment when the camera pans to show the large window nearby. Outside one can see the desert and in the distance, the giant spider, which is approaching the house.
The spider walks up to the house and in true peeping tom fashion, peeks through the window at Steve in her night robe. There is another freaky moment when we see the spider’s eyes and jaws through the window, the big arachnid now grown so large that it fills the window. And then we realize it still isn’t that near when it moves even closer to the house and appears even bigger! Arrrg, somebody call the exterminators, quick!
Finally, the spider roars and attacks the house. Steve sees it through the window and screams. She runs out into the hall. In his room, the shaking has awoken professor Deemer and we see that his acromegalia is much, much worse. Remember how he looked before…like half of his face was sliding of his skull? Well, now it’s worse. One half of his face is much lower than the other, his eyes no longer next to each other. Kind of like Shannon Doherty…only not quite as bad.
The house continues to collapse and Steve races into Deemer’s room just in time to see him pushed out the window by a colossal spider leg and right into the waiting jaws of the beast. She screams and runs out of the house.
Matt arrives about now in his car and sees the big spider atop the house, looking for all the world like it is trying to hump the collapsing structure. Quickly he gets Steve into the car and they race away, the spider following them after stomping the house another time or two for good measure.
Matt and Steve race through the desert, the spider in the distance behind them. They run into Jack, who has brought along a convoy of deputies and State Police officers. Everyone stops and jumps out of their car, but before the Sheriff can ask Matt what in the hell is going on, someone spots the tarantula rising over a distant hill. It sits there a moment and watches them, giving everyone a few seconds to stare incredulously at it. Then it begins following the road in their direction. Steve points out that it will most likely follow the road right into Desert Rock.
Two State Police officers stay behind with Matt’s car, armed with machine guns. Everyone else hops in a county vehicle and roars away, back toward town. The officers that stayed behind begin unloading their machine guns into the spider, which doesn't slow it down in the slightest. Abandoning any pretense at heroism, they hop in Matt’s car to make their getaway. Alas, the car won’t start! One guy keeps trying the ignition, but the other warns him that he’ll flood the engine. Finally they decide to run, but of course it’s far too late. The tarantula roars, Spider-Cam closes in on them and they let loose their final terrified screams before being gobbled.
In the Sheriff’s car, while Jack drives, a State police officer is relaying instructions to evacuate the town of Desert Rock within thirty minutes. Jack suggests dynamite as a way to combat the beast, so plans are made to collect some and meet up at some point outside of town known as Devil’s Rock. In the back seat, Matt thinks that dynamite might do the trick, but suggests calling in the Air Force. Quickly, the officer relays instructions for someone to contact the commander at the nearby airbase. Everything needs to happen fast, as it will be light soon.
Note - It is at this point that the movie enters its final segment, so if any of you really feel the need to watch this film and not know the ending ahead of time, skip the rest of this section.
In Desert Rock, morning has dawned and we see that the dynamite has been collected and loaded onto a truck. It heads out with newspaper man Joe Burch following. Meanwhile, people are fleeing town in such numbers and with such haste that you’d think Andy Dick was performing live in the town center. A brief cutaway shot shows jets lifting off from the airbase.
The truck with the dynamite meets up with the others out in the desert and everyone quickly starts placing the crates in the middle of the road. Meanwhile Joe Burch is expressing his doubts about the reality of a giant tarantula…that is, until the beast comes sauntering over the distant hills. Then he gets this look on his face like he just soiled himself. The explosives are finished being put in place and then everyone jumps back in a vehicle. They race down the road a ways, unspooling wire from the back of the truck. Then they stop and rig up the detonator. Watching carefully, they time their detonation so that the dynamite explodes just as the spider passes over it.
KABOOM! There is a huge explosion. Dirt and dust fill the sky, obscuring everyone’s view. And then…the tarantula keeps on coming, walking through the haze like nothing had happened. With no other option, it’s time to hop back in their vehicles and race back to town.
Desert Rock is…well…deserted when they arrive. Everyone wonders what they are going to do, but they don’t have much time to yak about it as the spider can be seen crossing the desert and coming in their direction. Everyone makes a mad dash for a vehicle, but before they can race off again, Matt spots four jets overhead. Everyone stops and watches as the stock footage of jets engages the tarantula, first by shooting rockets at it and then by dumping napalm on it.
The USAF is quite obviously not to be fucked with, cuz one moment the spider is waltzing through the desert, shrugging off the missile attack and a few seconds later it’s nothing more than a colossal pile of burning limbs amidst a furious blaze not seen outside of Satan’s domain.
The giant tarantula is dead. Matt, Steve, Jack, Joe and the others stand in the middle of the street and watch as its mammoth corpse burns in the distance. Pew! Imagine the smell!
Often, when people think of science fiction films from the 1950’s, the first thing to pop into their heads aside from black and white photography, is the preponderance of giant monsters, many of which were bugs of some kind. The decade was literally infested with movies about enlarged pests roaming the countryside, gobbling up folks and generally being a nuisance. The cause for such enormous creatures? In most cases it was man’s failure to contain the dangerous influences of radiation, the new buzzword on the lips of the nation since the end of the Second World War.
Tarantula is the quintessential giant bug film from the 1950’s. Aside from the super-sized critter to menace folks, we have other stereotypical ingredients: radioactivity to jump start the enlarging process, good intentioned science gone haywire and regular, everyday folks caught up in the unusual events. Everything unfolds naturally, as one would expect it to, though for some impatient folks, the eventual rampage by the tarantula itself doesn’t really begin until nearly fifty minutes into the film’s eighty minute running time. That’s not to say the build up is dull and boring, but monster lovers may not get as much monster action as they’d prefer.
The characters are both typical and atypical for the era. In the lead we have the kick-ass John Agar as Doctor Matt Hastings. As the competent, outgoing physician in the small desert community of Desert Rock, Matt makes for a very sympathetic character. His easygoing manner makes him the type that others would quickly take a liking to. While Matt is not as overt in his actions as other roles played by Agar, the character still has a quiet strength and a way of making things happen. He’s the one who pieces together the clues and realizes what is happening and it’s through his insistence that action is taken to counteract the threat.
For the female led we have the gorgeous Mara Corday as Stephanie “Steve” Clayton, a scientist and biologist who is studying and working under Professor Deemer in order to earn her Masters. While female scientists were not unknown in 50’s cinema, they were often rare and still often clung to the roles demanded of them by society. Thus, Steve here, while being of superior intellect, still succumbs to knee jerk emotions and screams and panics in a bad situation. And this is after she purposely takes time away from her studies in order to get her hair done! It’s almost as if the film (and others of the time) was saying that despite her academic accomplishments, she would never truly be useful in an emergency situation. I find that to be rather distasteful, but that’s how things were then.
The supporting cast lends considerable credibility to the narrative, with Universal regulars Nestor Paiva and Ross Elliot as Sheriff Jack Andrews and Newspaper man Joe Burch, respectively. Each does their part to play doubting Thomas throughout the film, but it’s the banter between Jack and Matt that really helps liven things up. In these exchanges we can see the repartee between two public figures in town that have known each other for years and have developed a friendly, if often mildly adversarial, relationship. This goes a long way in helping convince the audience that this town and these people are real. Leo G. Carroll adds a brief sad note with his role as Professor Deemer, whose devotion to science can only be viewed as tragic, in view of its results.
One of the standouts in the film are the special FX. Most films of the decade sported extremely crude methods for bringing to life their monsters. Though substandard in modern terms, the FX in Tarantula were pretty top notch. Sure, in a few scenes you can see where the matte isn’t cut properly, but the filmmakers did an excellent job of making a normal sized tarantula appear to be gargantuan and smoothly integrated it into shots of real outdoor locations, often with live actors in the same shot. Overall, one of the best FX jobs of the decade, IMO.
Ultimately, while not quite attaining the classic status that other 50’s films have earned, Tarantula is definitely one of the better efforts of the decade. While the story unfolds in a very predictable manner, there is still quite a bit of enjoyment to be had, especially for fans of such films. A must see for devotees of the decade.
Desert Hijinks - Lots and lost of running around the desert here. Hell, the movie is set in Arizona, so it's impossible to avoid. I never did see anyone sweating like a pig, though.
Giant Bugs - One ginormous tarantula that starts off the movie the size of a St. Bernard and grows until it has reached Godzilla-sized proportions.
Giant Monsters - Aside from the gargantuan spider, which is the main reason for this icon, there are also super large rats and guinea pigs, though not as big as old eight-legs.
Science - The never ending goal of science to make life better for everyone by creating artifical nutrients to feed the world, results in a giant spider that nearly eats the world.
Stock Footage - Not a whole lot. Basically just a few brief shots of jets taking off, flying and launching missiles. Look close and note that the jets aren't always the same type.
Violence - People and livestock are eaten by a giant spider, which involves having your flesh dissolved and then sucked off your bones. Thankfully this all happens off screen.
Matt: “But what if circumstances magnified one of them in size and strength, took it out of its primitive world and turned it loose in ours?”
Specialist: “Then expect something that’s fiercer, more cruel and deadly than anything that ever walked the earth.”
This was another one of those films that I knew about as a kid before seeing it, hearing stories about it from my dad and other relatives. I finally caught the film on TV in the early 80’s, but really don’t recall much from that initial viewing. It was either the second or third viewing that really sticks in my mind. The film was played on a Saturday, on one of those monster matinee shows that vanished years and years ago. This particular one began about ten or eleven AM, so the movie (pushed into a two hour time slot) lasted until either noon or one PM. A friend had spent the night and before heading out for the day to do something, we watched the movie, playfully hiding under the blankets when the monster spider appeared. I have no idea why we did that, as we were pretty much past the age of such theatrics. I suppose we were bored. I do recall that I wanted to stay and watch the rest of the movie, but my friend Eddie was eager to get outside and go do something. After all the years since then, Tarantula has been become one of my favorites from the 50’s. It’s the type of film I put on to relax or when I’m ill. Comfort food for the monster lover’s soul.

They're young and beautiful but they have a specialty: emptying balls, gobbling cocks... They turn men's family jewels into some kind of raisins. All they want is get cummed all over. Whether it's on their little angel faces or on their big tits, they want sperm and they want it in large quantity. They enjoy bukkakes and gang-bangs for this always guarantees a whole load for them. If they could take Tupperwares with them to bring some back home, well, they surely would. Big sluts who love studs' white cum. We'd even think that they've been doing this all their life and yet it's a passion, somewhat like a second nature. They're most certainly spermophile and most definitely not spermophobic.
This is a compilation of pretty girls getting cum-covered. They love these handsome studs' precious semen and, above all, they want to get facials, asking for more. For them, it's like a magic potion since they want all the liquid to run down their cheeks before dripping on their well-rounded, curved breasts. Whether they're blonde or brunette, they're all hooked on cum and when they get a good cumshot on their mug, it's like wearing a beauty mask. This is a real must-see for the lovers of sperm and bukkake, in general. Here are all the sluts in the world gathered together in an exclusive video of male jizz showers.
A POV sequence for all those who dream to give a good fuck to their pretty blonde neighbor. This time their dream comes true… the neighbor who is really pretty, blonde and very slutty looks at your cock with an irresistible look, kneels down and sucks it greedily and voluptuously staring at you with her blue eyes while she swallows your dick. When you get a raging boner and her pussy is dripping, she moves her G-string aside without taking the trouble to take it off and impales her nice shaved pussy on the heavy prick. You penetrate her deeply, she goes up and down your cock moaning with pleasure, her small and sharp tits wriggle in all senses. She makes you come and unload your jizz at the same time. Your neighbor is a real slut!
A guy is on a naturist beach and he has decided to put some beautiful naked girls on a video tape. He notices in the water a beautiful blonde girl in her twenties who has bath naked and who comes back to the beach. Therefore he hides his camera and keeps filming the young woman on her towel. She has a gorgeous body and while she is lighting a cigarette she is spreading her legs wider and wider in front of the objective. She is incredibly sexy and after a few minutes she starts fondling herself thinking she is all alone and nobody is spying on her. She lays on her back the hand between her legs stimulating her clit. She is a genuine slut to do this in front of everybody but nobody blames her for this, this nasty babe would deserve a good fuck. What a pity I was not there!

She's busy greedily wanking and blowing with her mouth and hands without slackening speed so that none of them goes flaccid and each faucet feels its nectar rise up. With a dick in each hand, two or three penises in her mouth and the rest of them jerking off over top of her, the young blonde's throat is filled to the brim. She's done such a great job that her reward will be worth the effort; the sperm gushes out of six overaroused penises, fills her mouth, remakes her cheeks. After the effort, the comfort!

@ 2017 - Special Programme for Promotion of Millets in Tribal Areas, Department of Agriculture and Food Production (Government of Odisha) and NCDS & WASSAN
Milltek Sport has built an enviable reputation for quality and reliability, owing partly to an intensive programme of new product testing and a continual assessment and redevelopment of existing products.
Milltek have been supplying their hi-flow sports catalyst and downpipe assemblies for the Golf 5-generation of vehicles since it was first released back in 2005. Since then, they have owned two Golf GTis, an Audi TT 2.0T and an Audi S3, all of which covered many miles of varied development motoring – including considerable time on the racing circuit under track day conditions. All the vehicles were remapped to suit their higher-flowing exhausts and all vehicles were fitted with an uprated polyurethane engine torque arm insert.
The primary reason for fitting this uprated part to the 2.0T cars is to reduce the amount of movement these engine produce during acceleration and deceleration. Not only does this improve the stability of the exhaust system, it also has the added bonus of making gear shifting smoother to enhance the driving experience further.
Such has been the success and reliability of this combination of torque arm insert and the Milltek downpipe and catalyst, Milltek have upgraded the downpipe kits to include the Powerflex engine torque arm insert as standard.

I’m often asked if how I feel about my eight year old Master M is any ‘different’ to how I feel about my biological kids. The answer is a resounding no.
My partner at the time went through IVF and had her eggs removed, fertilised with the same anonymous sperm donor I used for my older children, and then all three of these resulting embryos were transferred into me. One of these successfully implanted – I attribute this to the ‘medicinal’ shot of brandy that was given to me after the embryo transfer at the clinic – and I fell pregnant with Master M.
We were absolutely thrilled. I can remember sitting on the sideline watching my partner play sport while I was pregnant with a little part of her growing inside me. What an overwhelming all-encompassing feeling of love. It was the closest thing I have ever come to understanding truly sharing a child with someone in a heterosexual sense of ‘sharing’.
I felt like this baby was part of me, not just because my blood was nourishing him as he grew, but because he was biologically half of the same donor my other two kids shared. This is a strange thing to say, but I felt like this was somehow partially my contribution. I knew this donor made wonderful children, and I knew this baby was going to be such a gift, just like my other two before him. And like them in ways I couldn’t even imagine.
After a late night poker session in the back shed with friends, my waters broke three weeks early. Forty hours later, including a sixteen hour stall where it seemed he decided he was staying put after all, Master M arrived. I can recall all too clearly staring at him when he was placed in my arms, adoring his beautiful little face. From the moment I laid eyes on him, I couldn’t have loved him more.
No he doesn’t look at all like me, but neither does my sister look like my mum. I’m sure there are many of you out there with children who don’t look like you.
Statements that have been made to me such as ‘But he doesn’t look like you, or have your genes’, or ‘You were just the oven’, while hurtful, say more about the person making the statement than they do about me.
And from the moment my boy was growing inside me, he was every bit my child and the subject of my motherly love.
I am a same sex mother of five children, and no, I have never been in a straight relationship. I am one of the lucky few who has had access to a range of assisted reproduction techniques, all thanks to one man who decided many years ago to donate his sperm. Little did he know that one day there would be 48 children out there from his donations, five of which I’m lucky enough to call mine. To contact me, please email me at myrainbowtribe@gmail.com.

Cherie Gruenfeld placed first in her age group at the AVIA Wildflower Triathlon this past weekend, besting the 65-69 year-old age group for the Half-Ironman distance. (She beat the 60-65 year-old women for good measure, too.)
Known for a particularly hilly and grueling course – many participants wonder how it is possible for a course to have so much “up” and so little “down” — the AVIA Wildflower Triathlon is one of the largest triathlon events in the world, with 7,500 athletes and 30,000 spectators attending each year. The event features a 1.2 mile swim in Lake San Antonio, a 56 mile bike ride that includes the notorious “Nasty Grade” — a nearly five mile grade which climbs 1,000 feet (300 m) from bottom to top of “Heart Rate Hill” — and finishes with a 13.1 mile run, more than half of which is done off-road on hiking trails. It’s a tough, fiendishly difficult course that will test the mettle of any triathlete.
Lucky for Cherie, she’s got mettle in spades. And she’s got medal, too. A first place medal, that is! Join us in congratulating Cherie on yet another awesome victory.

At Boingo, we are passionate about enabling the ultimate fan experience. When Kansas State University approached us to help them achieve their goal of “the best fan experience in the Big 12,” we jumped at the opportunity.
Boingo recently installed hundreds of Wi-Fi and Distributed Antenna System access points at Kansas State’s Bill Snyder Family Stadium. In the words of K-State Athletic Director John Currie, “the difference has been transformational.”
We checked in with the Wildcats to see how their fans are enjoying the new network. From Snapchat to stat-checking, it sounds like K-State fans are ready for the next level of the game-day experience. Check out the video here!

As we near the holiday season, wishes for peace on earth abound, from traditional musical refrains floating over the airwaves on local radio stations, to a heightened awareness of the human condition, both locally and in locations across the globe. We always care. It’s just that at this time of year, we seem to care more. Or at least, we remember how much we do.
At the same time, the stresses of holiday shopping, family gatherings, and closing the 2014 business books can create a perfect and ironic tension with peace as an inner state of mind. Peace at home, in the nitty-gritty of our day-to-day interactions, can easily get lost in the end of year shuffle.
One of the tenants of Dancing Freedom, Peace Begins with Me, offers a useful reflection on the way our own actions, large and small, create ripple effects that either contribute to – or detract from – a larger sense of peace.
Recently, I found myself in a group of four women discussing peace, in relation to the recent events in Ferguson, MO. Not surprisingly, our views were as diverse as the response to the incident itself. Yet despite our different views on how to achieve it, the desire for justice and peace among us was palpable. It’s often like this, I think. We all want peace. We’re just not sure how to get there.
One of the women in our group suggested taking a look at ourselves, and checking on whether we were driven by a desire to get even… or by a real desire to create peace, alluding to the fact that the two approaches may lead to quite different kinds of action. While it didn’t prescribe one obvious answer, the comment struck me as a profound reflection on the theme peace begins with me.
This week, I invite you to ask yourself the question “what does it mean to be a starting point, when it comes to peace?”
In your movement practice, pay careful attention to your mind chatter this week. What are you frustrated about? What are you angry about? What has you feeling righteous? Rather than ignore it or stuff it down, I encourage you to literally do the opposite. Let yourself feel it. Dance it. Jog it. Exaggerate it. Running it through you in a safe, non-dangerous environment like your regular movement practice is a good way to get to know what’s there. In my experience, when we’re unaware, it tends to drive us underneath the surface.
Once you’ve had a chance to feel it all, ask respectfully for it to show you another way. Another path. Another version of the story. Invite a sense of compassion, and see what physically unfolds next. Here, subtle shifts in sensation or emotion may point to doorways that you hadn’t noticed before.
In life, notice the ways you perpetuate strife. Without judgment, take an intention to catch yourself in the act a few times this week. The ways are often subtle, and may not look like we expect. For example, in staying quiet rather than addressing an act of unkindness, we may judge ourselves more “peaceful.” Yet if we’re still boiling inside a few days later, it may be that the act of passivity directly contradicted your deeper desire for peace. Get the idea? As much as taking nasty action to get even with person who triggers you may perpetuate something other than peace… so may doing nothing but gossiping about him behind his back.
To say the least, this practice is far from black and white. Make use of your body sensations and deeper intuition here. What does it feel like in your body when you’re genuinely contributing to a legacy of peace.
Building your inner compass to detect subtle nuances is a great way to the starting point for peace.
With intention, any physical activity can be used to cultivate the personal qualities we need and want to bring into our lives. Whether you’re a corporate executive, an athlete or an artist, this blog offers a platform for you to create your own intentional movement practice, as well as an opportunity to communicate with a community of like-minded people walking the same path of body-mind-spirit integration.

There are some unexpected obstacles that you will face with a cat. Finding a pet without preparing first is a terrible mistake. Although, preparation may not be enough to fix every cat problem. This will ensure you know all you can for a great relationship.
Before acquiring a cat, be sure that you have the wherewithal to take care of all necessary vet care. Cats reproduce at an alarming rate, and spaying or neutering is essential to keeping cat population under control. Check spay, neuter and vaccination costs and packages with local vets and clinics and be sure you can afford to give your cat proper medical care.
Avoid eye contact to make friends with a cat. Ever wonder why cats seem drawn to the person who likes cats the least? The answer lies in cat body language. To cats, staring is "rude" and can be considered a challenge. Looking away shows that you respect their space and are not going to be a threat. So next time you are looking to meet a new feline friend, look away and let them approach you.
Is your cat constantly munching on your house plants? If so there is a fix for this. Growing oat grass or catnip yourself can help entice your cats away from your plants. Giving them plants that they can eat and like will help draw them to those plants over and over again.
An inexpensive rubber welcome mat helps keep cat food off your floor. This is also a great tool to keep your cat from tracking litter out of the box. https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/11/business/tech/sharp-launch-smart-cat-toilet-can-identify-health-problems/ mats cost about three dollars at dollar stores. Put your cat food dish on one and your litter box on another.
With these 10 basic care tips tucked safely under your belt, you will be prepared to offer your pooch the best life he could ask for.
There are few things in life that are more fun and rewarding than bringing a dog into your family. Your dog will offer your family years of love and loyalty — as long as you provide him with food, shelter, responsible care, and love in return. Top 10 Dog Care Tips - Dogtime
If you just got your cat you want to take them to the veterinarian right away, especially if it is a feral cat or kitten. Kittens are born with parasites and need shots and medication to get rid of them. Feral cats can carry diseases. This is why it is important to have them checked out immediately.
When you move your cat from one house to another, be sure to move the cat last. Set up a quiet room with familiar items for the cat. Keep your cat in the room and quiet for a day or two. https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/pets-and-environment/181017/learn-the-tips-on-how-to-take-care-of-your-dog-this-diwali.html and feed the cat in the room. After a couple of days, the cat can explore the rest of the house.
Cats are great pets, but their litter boxes can be unsightly and have an odor. If you can't stand the sight of your litter box, then it is time to go shopping. There are many different styles of litter boxes on the market. Some are even disguised as fake potted plants. Not only does it look better, it controls the smell as well.
Do you have more than one cat? If so, then you should have more than one litter box as well. Having one for each of your cats will give them multiple spots to go. If the odor gets too much you can add a little baking soda to the litter to freshen it up.
Turn out simply click the following article and use a black-light to identify the source of that mystery cat urine smell. Cat pee contains phosphorus, which glows brightly under this type of light bulb. This is especially useful because otherwise you might not be able to see the exact area to be treated. Use a piece of chalk to lightly trace the outline of the stain so you can see it when you turn the regular lights back on.
If you have a kitten, a very important part of raising him is to get him socialized. This means making sure he is comfortable in many situations. These include: handling by humans, grooming and nail care, vet visits, and other social situations. The time to do this is between ten and twelve weeks of age.
When bringing a new kitten home, take it slow. It is tempting for children to want to play with the new addition to your home immediately. But the young cat will likely be scared. Give the cat time to acclimate itself to your home and to get comfortable with everyone.
Your cat should be given food from a can. Dry food is cheaper, but some wet foods have more benefits. The water content is higher, and there is more protein and fat in the canned food. This food is easier to chew for old cat. Speak with the vet, but food in cans tends to be better.
Cats will generally do whatever pleases them, and this is fine, just as long as it doesn't destroy your property. A little training can go along way in keeping your items safe. Be gentle with your cats, and don't scream, yell, or use violence with them. Whistles and squirt guns can alert your cat that they're doing something wrong.
If you suspect that your cat is pregnant, make an appointment with the vet as soon as you can to make sure that is really the case. There are a few serious illnesses that can mimic pregnancy, so you want to make sure that none of these has affected your cat.
Make sure you know of any holes in your home that your cat might get into. Cats are able to fit into gaps that are tiny. Kittens are even more apt to get into these holes. Look into this before getting a new cat. Cover all large holes to prevent a hazard for your cat.
Kittens should never be taken from their mothers before they are eight to ten weeks old. During this time, kittens learn most of their social and instinctive behaviors, and removing them from the mother too soon can cause future behavioral issues the mother cat could have taught them had they not been removed too early.
Feed your kitten a variety of cat foods to avoid a finicky cat later. Pick different textures and different brands on a regular basis and your kitten will learn to enjoy new tastes. This can also avoid feeding problems if your usual brand is no longer available in your area.
Owning a cat is not easy. It is going to require a lot of work on your part to make sure your cat remains happy and healthy. However, if you implement the advice mentioned in the article above, there is no reason why you can't be a wonderful owner to your feline friend.

I would like to try the instagram. I have been in this business since January 5 and not doing very well. Took me a month just to get my children to join & this company is actually giving out shares as you join. Like I said, it took me a month just to get my children to understand the concept of the shares, after sharing the video of Magic Johnson being interviewed by Ellen Degenerate about his reqret for turning down Nike tennis shoes, with one of the owners of Nike being one of the owners of this company & how this is time sensitive, but no one else is interested. Please help.
4. Cassette tape or video sponsoring. If your company has an exciting cost-effective product cassette tape, it can be used in place of or in addition to a brochure. These are automatic merchandisers that stimulate people to action. While opportunity tapes are important, most successful recruiters lead with a good product tape. Once people appreciate your product offering, they're more open to the business opportunity.
This lead type means you speak only to serious prospects who’ll be expecting your call. These are delivered in real-time. Out of 25 leads usually there’s only 1 that’s qualified and fits. They need to have a min of 10 hours per week to work on their business, own a computer, have internet, have money to invest, etc. You get the name of the agent who talked to them so you can use it when you’re following up.
By buying leads month after a month, a network marketing rep builds his or her own list of leads, usually in an autoresponder. You can then continue to market to these people for years to come. The best idea to continually give them value, your emails could perhaps have a ratio of 80% value to 20% sales. If all you do is send sales offers to your list, you will see your open rates go down, and your unsubscribe rates go up.
Fll-Inc can handle the pre-qualification of Business Opportunity Leads. This can be accomplished by gaining information from the leads about what their needs and goals may be. All of the leads are followed up with and examined carefully to ensure that they are suitable Business Opportunity Leads and that they will be able to provide the level of success or results that are desired.
The main website a lot of people use when they are online is social media. These websites are where you can sit there and talk to anyone around the world that you know, and chances are that most people you know have an account on these kinds of things. You’ll want to make sure you do some looking into making a business account, because marketing through your personal profile may not do so well for you. Social media sites are free to use, but they also have ways you can pay for ads that go out to people.
Hello Network Marketer, Tired of old, worn out, over-priced network marketing leads that cost you hard-earned money… but leave you without new distributors? Tired of friends and family avoiding your calls? If you’re like most distributors I know, time and money are valuable to you. You can’t waste it on cheap, worn out recycled leads. Nor do you want to chase your friends and family. Otherwise, you’ll become a charter member of the NFL Club… No Friends Left!
Those were some awesome apples Jason ;-) haha. And I can relate with your story and struggle. I was frustrated and struggled for a long time when trying to gets mlm leads… Lead generation for your mlm/network marketing business should be done with “Attraction Marketing” like you suggested. Thanks for the great value in your video and article Jason!

Video – Having video on a page can work for you or against you depending on what information is provided in the video posted on the lead capture page. The video should NOT be a business presentation. Again, it should pick the interest or curiosity of the prospect to entice them to complete the webform so that you can capture a lead. General testimonials can work well in video. They should not be specific to any product or company by name but should relate to the prospect how it has worked for them. Video on a lead capture page is an option; not a requirement. We’ve been successful in generating targeted mlm leads without video on the lead capture page.
Great article and you nailed it regarding purchasing leads. I tried a few times talking with various people over the phone but none committed. I often wonder how the greats like Dexter Yager and Bill Britt (both amway reps) built their businesses to such a large magnitude without the use of social media. I certainly believe social media has made building network marketing businesses much easier than back in the day.
"The business opportunity leads here at Oppseekers are setting a higher standard in the industry! I have experienced a greater response rate and faster team growth since I started using their leads! I have also taken it a step further and recommended these leads to my entire team and now I am getting them for FREE! What a concept! Thanks Oppseekers!"
Your goal with MLM or any business is to make more money than you spend. It can be tough to face rejection. Many network marketers give up because they don’t like dealing with it or don’t know how to close a sale. Wouldn’t it be great if all your prospecting could be done rejection free and your offer will go in front of people that are interested in a home business opportunity?
More great content, Ray! I have a plan to implement your sticky note / bandit sign idea soon, and will check out the MLM Leads site as well. Question – and you may answer this in your training so excuse me if you do – but what are your thoughts re: setting up special phone numbers for bandit signs/sticky notes? Is there any need to create a buffer between us and the signs via a separate number?
Get them to watch a company presentation and then ask them what they liked about what they saw. One of the, if not THE, best question to ask a bought MLM lead is: “What has recently changed in your life that has you open to a home business?” This question is frigging awesome to get them to open up. If your upline has not provided you with a place to purchase MLM leads for practice and to work with, I have a partnership with Responsive Data where you can buy MLM leads on this site. I have personally bought from this site and the leads are good quality but like I said, you STILL have to treat them like a lead, not a laydown sale. My favorite type are the local leads as I think it is a bonus if I can say I live in their area.
We have the largest business database available anywhere, with information on more than 13 million US companies and 57 million companies worldwide, ranging from large public corporations to small privately owned firms. You can also visit our business Specialty/Response Lists for additional lists available. Our business list advisors understand the importance of identifying the perfect list for your B2B marketing campaign.
Use social media. Posts asking people to join your team won't likely produce results, but if you're clever, you can use social media to generate interest in your business and possible leads. For example, if you sell weight-loss products, you can promote before and after pictures on Pinterest or Instagram. If you sell makeup, you can post tutorials on YouTube that you share across social sites.
There are a variety of ways to generate web traffic for your mlm lead capture page. You can create Facebook posts, write Craigslist ads, newspaper ads, fliers, write blog articles, write ezine articles, post Twitter links, send email broadcasts or refer friends and family and direct them to your lead capture page. Unfortunately these methods can take considerable time without much in the way of mlm lead generation.

Here’s how it works: a person accesses the internet and requests information about working from home. Within seconds of when they click “Submit,” their information is emailed directly to you!

"Your business opportunity leads continue to get better! The more I use your services, the more dollars I earn! My experience with your services started about 3 months back when I was searching for some reliable and genuine leads for my home based business. After reading through your site, I decided to take a chance and order some leads. But BOY! I never expected the results so swift and so good. The leads were turning into sales in no time and I had to order another fresh list. I have been ordering almost weekly since then and as expected, this time too, the conversion rate is tremendous. I'm surely planning to buy another list at the earliest."
The ultimate way to do this is "bring value to the marketplace". I have learned and realized that how we do business these days is all about relationship building! All the great leaders and the self-made millionaires/billionaires, they taught us only one amazing thing that really works! ---- "be a person of value and a person of service!". Create value. Bring value to the marketplace. Provide solutions to peoples' problem... be out there helping as many people as you can! And believe me, leads and money will naturally come. And one more thing --- by doing this, you will gave fun building your business! Think about that!
No matter what you are selling online, your chances are much higher that these business opportunity buyers will actually take action, than with a list of bizopp seekers.  Bizopp buyers are actively looking, researching and buying the things they feel they need to increase their income.  And when it comes to increasing their income, people can become locked-into a product that is appealing.
Experienced marketers understand the benefits of buyer leads. That's why we like to include buyers leads in our featured MLM Phone Leads and MLM Postal Leads. Our MLM Buyers Leads offer 100% U.S. names: preferred because your response rates will reflect the fact that buyers have already expressed an interest and have purchased something to help them get started. That's a real plus!
The following is a list of organizations that according to their website descriptions provide business opportunity leads. Database Systems Corp. is not affiliated with any of these organizations nor does it promote or endorse the products and services of these companies. These websites provide various types of leads including business marketing leads, business opportunity leads, opt in MLM leads, network marketing leads, home business opportunity leads etc.
3. Business cards, buttons and brochures. Most companies offer sales aids that help the cold sponsoring process. If you owned a store, you would put out your "open for business" sign at the start of each day. Wear an "open for business" button promoting your product. Something catchy will inevitably create interest. If people are bold enough to quiz you about the button, they're probably outgoing and a great prospect. Pass out literature with your phone and e-mail, and use your business cards. Do this consistently. The law of averages says something has got to happen.
We supply quality, satisfaction guaranteed network marketing leads to thousands of clients. Some of the companies we provide leads for are Ameriplan leads, Coastal Vacation leads, Herbalife leads, Ecoquest leads, Xango leads, Vemma leads, MLM leads, Mannatech leads, Noni leads, Morinda leads, Neways leads, Nuskin leads, Melaleuca leads, Monavie leads, Fruta Vida leads, Prepaid legal leads, Usana leads, Synergy leads, Eventis leads, Emerald Passport leads, Legacy leads, 4life leads, Lifeforce leads, Nikken leads, Mentors in Motion leads, Better Universe leads, Liberty League leads, and many more Network Marketing leads.
Reciprocal Links and Link Building Link Building Service Reciprocal Link Management Real Estate Link Building On Line Gambling Link Building Adult Site Link Building
The internet is made up of literally billions of links, that link together web sites from around the globe. The purpose of these links is to make it easy to find associated information.
Search engines use the links in much the same way, and to this end reciprocal and non-reciprocal links help to promote your web site on the SERPs within many of the major search engines.
During any Search Engine Optimization project it is necessary to research and build links to your site. Search engines do prefer them to be naturally built up, but it doesn't hurt to give them a helping hand if done correctly.
When we build links for any web site we ensure that you link campaign is made up of sites that relate to your site and therefore would be the sort of sites that would want to link to you and that it would make sense to be linked with. Just as an example when working with a real estate site, it would make sense that visitors would be looking for other real estate information, mortgage information, real estate lawyer information, movers etc. So the idea is that we help to build up our own little web, of reciprocal and non-reciprocal links, that relate to your web site.
The search engines will find your site and add them to their list of sites that they need to crawl and index.
The search engines will then use the information in the link to assist your ranking. The keywords within the anchor text on the sending site also have a weighting on your ranking.
So link building is very important and we provide a full link building service we will also provide you with a link management service where we check on a monthly basis and advise you of any sites that have removed your link or if their site is no longer available.
We will research and build reciprocal links for almost any web site on the web, but we have three particular specialty areas where we have had huge success.
These are all areas where we have great contacts within the sectors and are able to source reciprocal links for you with good quality sites and relatively good speed. Link building will be a part of SEO for a long time to come. Non-reciprocal links do help if you can persuade people to give them to you, but many people want a link back directly for giving you one, so the secret is to work with a theme.

“Fashions come and go, but fashion is eternal,” so stated Yves Saint Laurent, on the list of twentieth century’s most celebrated designers. Just a few many years in the past, gentlemen wore bell-bottom pants having a number of jewelry, but at this time, that appear is deemed tacky and costume-y, specially amid much larger adult men. So consider an excellent appearance inside of your closet and examine in case your garments can preserve up with contemporary models. The problem with remaining massive and tall is that it’s tough to uncover a thing stylish that may be as part of your size. Nonetheless, that doesn’t signify you should not try out; it isn’t as challenging since it appears. Actually, you don’t should change almost everything about your wardrobe to become actually modern. Below are a few of your minor belongings you can adjust.
Sunglasses Here’s a common rule to keep in mind when dressing up for just a night time out: prevent whatever that the fellas on Jersey Shore discover fashionable. This features enormous sunglasses. Splurge on a pair of vintage sunglasses in muted shades that fit your deal with just correct. Remember, sunglasses should not cover much more than your eyes when you’re sporting them. Belts and Shoes If you are ever before gone from your house in an all-white ensemble wanting like Chef Hogg from your Dukes of Hazzard movie, you then ought to be ashamed of on your own. Happily, it is not too late to learn out of your mode faults. So toss out individuals white colored shoes and belts, and opt for suede or leather-based footwear in basic tones. Jeans If you are to the hefty facet, skinny jeans might not be flattering in any respect; you may even look like you woke up and chose to paint some pants on. You’re not a teen anymore; you are a grown-up male now. So when you are out procuring for mens significant and tall pants, why not think about a pair of boot-cut jeans? They not just sense good but could also make you search handsomely rugged. Equipment As pointed out on top of, whatever worn by Jersey Shore forged members is often a significant no-no. So say goodbye to these Mr. T golden chains or those people blingy watches particularly when they never include on your style quotient. Any pro on major and tall menswear will also let you know that when it comes to accessories, considerably less is a lot more. So decide for understated accessories, or put on no components in the slightest degree. Also, when you’re out buying for large tall gentlemen attire, persist with solid-colored V-neck T-shirts. This silhouette can accentuate your neckline and make you appear trimmer.

WATCH: Man accused of fatally stabbing woman, her daughter, takes the stand in his own defense - Milwaukee Times Weekly Newspaper
Fowler faces two counts of first degree intentional homicide in the deaths of a young mother and her child. The bodies of 28-year-old Jessica Ellenberger and her daughter, four-year-old Madyson Marshel were discovered inside their home near 68th and Stevenson in Milwaukee on March 19, 2016.
Prosecutors say Fowler admitted he and Ellenberger were arguing, and Fowler “felt as if he was being disrespected.”
At some point, Fowler grabbed Ellenberger by the hair and “asked her to just talk with him.” When she demanded Fowler back off, Fowler told police “the knife slid across her chest.” She was stabbed 26 times and her throat was slit. Fowler then proceeded to stab Madyson twice, according to the complaint.
The complaint indicates Fowler then walked out of the front door, taking Easter candy from the home. The bodies of Jessica Ellenberger and Madyson Marshel were later found in a bedroom in the home.

Storytellers love character archetypes. They feel ancient and symbolic, and they’re just fun to play with. A while back, we mentioned some archetypes we think stories are usually better without. To banish the rain on our archetype parade, here’s five we want to see more often.
In MTV’s Teen Wolf, Peter Hale is the power-hungry werewolf who bites the unwitting Scott. Peter offers to teach Scott what he knows, but Scott can’t trust him.
Because a hero often starts the story as a powerless underdog, the mentor exists to level them up. The mentor teaches the hero important skills and gives the hero equipment they’ll need to save the day. But there’s a problem with mentors: they’re likely to steal the spotlight. They have the skills and equipment necessary to save the world, so why don’t they do it themselves?
Traditionally, storytellers have removed mentors from the story once they’re done training the hero. Killing off the mentor is the classic, but overused, method. Regardless of how the mentor is sidelined, any time spent developing the mentor as a character is wasted once the mentor is gone.
Enter the mentor antagonist. This mentor doesn’t have to go anywhere because they have goals that conflict with the hero’s. To save the world, the hero will have to go through them. Since the mentor always has some level of power, that adds lots of juicy conflict.
Why is an antagonist teaching the hero? In most cases, they look like a friend at first. Later, the hero may discover that their mentor is planning on using them for evil ends, or they might conclude that the mentor’s methods are unacceptably brutal. However, the mentor doesn’t have to look benign on introduction. Your protagonist can learn from them even if they’re overtly villainous. Perhaps it’s the only way to gain important skills that can be used for good, or maybe your protagonist has little choice. Make your hero struggle to resist evil while they learn. That makes for great scenes.
In Blue Exorcist, Rin and Yukio are twin brothers. Rin considers himself Yukio’s protector until the day their father is killed by a demon. Rin discovers that not only has Yukio been fighting demons for years but also that Rin has to learn from him to become an exorcist.
Allies are a necessity in many stories, but if you’re not careful, they can get dull. Having too many scenes with characters getting along will put people to sleep. On the other hand, scenes with characters at odds are usually entertaining. That means, more often than not, you’ll be looking for reasons to get your protagonists fighting.
Take a tip from your favorite anime, and introduce a rival ally. The rival is another character on Team Good with a lot of superficial similarities to the protagonist. Generally they are the same age and gender, and they should have the same general skills/profession. But instead of being besties, the hero and the rival are embroiled in an unfriendly competition. Usually this starts when the rival talks down to the protagonist.
Not only do rivals add fun conflict to scenes full of Team Good, but they also grant a wonderful opportunity to develop your hero. Near the beginning, showing how the rival outstrips the hero will provide some great spinach, making your hero an underdog. Near the end, your hero can finally beat the rival, bestowing some rewarding candy and showing how much the hero has grown.
In the Harry Potter books, Harry often visits Hagrid to voice his troubles and get emotional support.
All too often, our stories – and culture in general – neglect the emotional for the physical. The hero is tortured, and then they walk away and never suffer from PTSD. Mental health problems are depicted as belonging to a specific, stigmatized group of people and not as something that everyone has to watch out for. Having a character that provides emotional support allows you to write scenes where the hero recovers from psychological trauma, just like you might show them waking up in a hospital and talking to a doctor.
When it comes to being supportive, we could all use more positive role models. Too many characters show “support” with “tough love” – being pushy, judgmental, and even manipulative. The power of a character who accepts, trusts, and listens to the hero shouldn’t be underestimated.
It’s especially powerful if the support character is a man. Men are stereotyped as being unsupportive. By using a male supporter, you can break that harmful stereotype and make your character stand out. If the character has underprivileged characteristics, make sure you give the supporter their own life, agency, and goals; those characters often feel like they only live to serve the hero.
Supporters also make great love interests. After the hero shares their feelings, the supporter love interest can share some of their own experiences. That’ll make the sparks fly.
In Heir to the Empire, we see Thrawn, the main villain, through Captain Pellaeon’s eyes. This keeps Thrawn threatening while letting us know what he’s up to.
Recently I wrote about the problems with writing from a villain’s point of view. Really, the problem is that too many writers are doing it. More than any other character, the villain needs their secrets. But the audience may also need to see what’s happening in places out of Team Good’s reach. In the right situation, revealing a villain’s plans can add tension to the story, and explaining their motivations early can avoid burdening the end.
The sympathetic minion is the perfect solution to this problem. As a servant of the big bad, they have access to information Team Good doesn’t. At the same time, a minion often won’t be in their master’s confidence, making it easy to conceal anything you don’t want the audience to know. From the minion’s point of view, the big bad could still be scary.
Plus, minions get short-shrifted in too many of our stories. The heroes will agonize over the morality of killing the villain while dealing fatal injuries to minions left and right. Sure, the villain is usually one of the most important characters, so it’s natural they get more of the spotlight. Even so, continually focusing on powerful villains while dehumanizing their underlings sends a classist message. Showing minions as sympathetic beings helps fight this trend.
In Disney’s Tangled, the steed Maximus is the unofficial captain of the guard. He makes a great antagonist and a great ally.
Sometimes it’s difficult to get characters involved in the plot. Most of them would probably rather relax with a glass of wine and a good movie. On top of that, we often need a reason for characters who dislike each other to interact without coming to blows. This not only adds some of that fun interpersonal conflict I mentioned earlier, but it’s also a great start for a romance. In the good old days, we could just trap characters in an elevator together. But the kids these days want events that haven’t been done a million times before.
The investigator takes care of these problems beautifully. An investigator is any character whose job it is to find out what’s happening and who has an interest in solving problems. They could be a police officer, government agent, private investigator, or a journalist. Yes, investigators do make good protagonists, but that’s not all. What our stories could really use is more side characters that are investigators.
Protagonists aren’t known for following rules. Even if they aren’t a beloved ruffian or charming cat burglar, they have a weird habit of breaking the law whenever it might save a life. On top of that, they’re always right where all the suspicious activity is happening. An investigator who also has an interest in saving the day but rigorously follows the law is the perfect accompaniment to such a hero.
The investigator will probably suspect the hero at first, creating some great conflict. Depending on the needs of the story, they can remain an antagonist, reluctantly join forces with the hero, or even go back and forth. You’ll never struggle to explain why they’re around.
Characters that don’t serve the story end up dragging it down. The next time you think of a cool character while you’re drafting, consider the role that character will play in your story. Choose a good role, and your story will be stronger for it.
One nice example for the sympathetic minion (more or less sympathetic, in this case) is Colonel Sebastian Moran in Kim Newman’s Moriarty stories. (They’re gathered in “The Hound of the D’Urbervilles.”) Moran essentially plays ‘Watson’ to Moriarty’s ‘Holmes’ (which is a little weird to write, considering the actual characters). Moran’s voice is rougher and sometimes more direct than Watson’s (he was an army colonel in the colonies, after all, and is #2 in Moriarty’s organisation). I love the stories for Moran’s voice as much as for the references to a lot of other stories (especially ‘The Adventure of the Six Maledictions,’ ‘The Greek Invertebrate,’ and ‘The Red Planet League’). It’s also notable that Sherlock Holmes only appears in the last story and is only referred to as ‘the thin man from Baker Street.’ Despite not being a nice man, Moran makes for a good viewpoint character. He never fully understands his master’s plans, of course (he almost gets himself hanged in the first and mummified in the fifth story), but he comes through as a human being you can understand. I doubt the same would be possible, were Moriarty himself the viewpoint character.
.5 made me think that we could also use more protagonists who follow the rules without question, sidestepping them with wit and cleverness each time they interfiere with their righterous agendas. Because we all know that rules aren’t always good, but they’re there for a reasson, and having characters (specially protagonists) break them left and right without taking into account why they exist gets boring at best, and insufferable at worst. I can’t count how many times I’ve seen the main character jump into action when they were explicitely told they couldn’t, only for them to come victorius because of course the protagonist was right, even if they endagered their team in doing so. I hate this trope so much.
When I saw Okoye in Black Panther, I was awed with her loyalty to her country and culture. We need more characters like her
And Javert from Les Mis is a good example of the inspector archetype as an antagonist who nonetheless remains a noble-hearted character.
Ah, good ole protagonist centered morality. Often rides tandem with “torture is the quickest way to get reliable information”, which also needs to die in a fire. Like, several years ago.
I am especially intrigued by the Mentor Antagonst, and would love to see a full article on it. Ra’s al Ghul and Sauron are great examples of the Mentor Antagonist. Would you consider Tyler from Fight Club to be a subtle twist on the archetype?
There is another whole variation of the Mentor Antagonist, which is when a particular Mentor and Mentee BOTH start out as antagonists in the story’s throughline, but only one of them joins with the protagonist. The Fire Lord (as Zuko’s father and former mentor) and Tywin Lannister (as Tyrion’s father and former mentor) are examples. When I’ve seen this variation it is usually complicated by abuse from the mentor (as is typical for full-fledged antagonists the author doesn’t want you to root for).
There are also characters who should be mentors but never really are, because they are antagonistic from the very beginning. Severus Snape is a great example. One could also argue that the Fire Lord and Tywin were always antagonists to Zuko and Tyrion, but it took their sons years to realize it.
Would you consider the Misguided Mentor to be a variation of the Mentor Antagonist? Examples could be Dumbledore, who withheld information from Harry for far too long; the Guru in TLAB, whose honest advice would have been catastrophic if Aang followed it; or Luke in TLJ, whose fear and apathy could have killed Rey’s drive to help the Resistance.
My experience with mentor antagonists is actually from a game I ran where each player had their own mentor antagonist; it worked very well. I had a lot of trouble coming up with notable examples I thought were sufficient for this post – Peter is actually less than ideal. Ideally the character would both do the kind of intense mentoring that a traditional mentor does, and be antagonistic enough to cause the hero serious problems. I like your example of Tyler from the Fight Club. Haven’t read enough comic books to know Ra’s al Ghul. You don’t mean Sauron in LotR do you? He’s barely present in those books.
It sounds like a misguided mentor could be a mentor antagonist, but I wouldn’t give them that title unless they succeed in teaching the hero useful skills, and their goals actually conflict with the hero’s in a large way. If you have a mentor that is a well-intentioned extremist anti-villain, that could qualify as both.
I think Jade Fox from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good example of a Mentor Antagonist (Spoiler Alert!):
She teaches Jen but wants to use her for revenge, she resents Jen when she realizes her apprentice was hiding her higher level of skill from her, and she tries to kill her apprentice in the end.
A lot of the best mentor antagonists are also spoilers, unfortunately. But an example I will suggest is Harrison Wells from the first season of The Flash, in large part because his role as mentor becomes more and more important to him without preventing his antagonism.
About #1: Do you think it would work to have a protagonist know that their mentor is evil, but still look to them for guidance? The MC would never trust the mentor, but learn magic from them. My plot is that the villain kidnaps the MC and tries to show her magic and she reluctantly accepts learning by him.
And about #2: I have seen many times a new person join a group of heroes and there’s ALWAYS that one annoying person. They’re rude, judgemental, have little background behind why they act this way, and are usually used to show how much better the MC is than them. This is usually two girls.
I think a great example of a Mentor Antagonist is Kreia from Knights of the Old Republic II. She’s also a surprise villain, but she honestly tries her best to mentor the protagonist and she doesn’t see herself as evil – though she understands that the protagonist probably will, eventually, so she tries to sell them her own ideology during the mentoring.
When the final confrontation comes, there are good emotional stakes because both characters still feel a sort of attachment to each other from their time spent together, but their principles force them to clash.
Since Kreia is one of my favourite villains (I still think the twist beats the one from the original KotOR by far, fight me ), I certainly wouldn’t mind seeing more characters of this archetype.
I keep thinking of Stick in Daredevil as a rival mentor. He is not a villain but he tries forcing the character onto a path he refuses to follow and they fight often.
Seems strange to me that men aren’t consisered supportive and caring. Almost every important hero I can think of, from Batman to Achilles, cares for and supports somebody. And then you have the master/apprentice relationship (i dont know about you but i would want to be sure my apprentices head was right).

We were into our full second week of school and I can say that life here in the Turner household was kicking along as it does- regular routines were back in swing, lunches were being packed, and I was… well- “struggling well” to quote my good internet friend Emily Thomas.
As in many areas of this great country, ice cream socials are a great way to celebrate and kick off really anything. My family was lucky enough to have two of these within a week of each other to get us going in school and scouts. I need to confess here that I am not a good Ice Cream Social participant. Every year at the kids’ school there are mass amounts of incredible homemade ice cream that has been slaved over for hours…and then there are people like me who run to Baskin Robbins the morning of said event to buy as many containers of ice cream that my nine year old can carry to send along to the school. Most likely my ice cream will only to be pulled out in a desperate measure to appease those poor children whose parents never get them to the social before the “good stuff” runs out. (I hope my kids liked the mint chocolate chip- it was on sale.) Kudos to all of those wonderful parents who make this such a wonderful and blessed event of organized chaos each year. And an even greater thanks to those folks who have to clean up the mess. You are really the unsung heroes of my life.
Another fun fact of these first two weeks was that the littlest darling had already gotten to do his first project! When one reaches the fourth grade at my kids’ school there is a blog that we all must check daily for school updates, homework, and such. It is such a big deal, this blog, that we (I use that term loosely here) had to spend time on it each week over the summer to as to not be lost or get behind once school started even if it meant pulling him away from the twelve plus hours of Mine Crafting that seemed to occupy his ever waking hour. Well, it took me one week and I got behind-I know, big shocker. So, one of those first Sunday afternoons I get an email saying the blog has been updated and decided I should go check it out. Apparently the kids had a choice between taking a test over the first chapter in social studies over Native Americans OR they could build a house that was used by one of the tribes and write a three paragraph paper on it for a test grade. I thought to myself surely he choose to take the test?! Then I prayed, “Dear God, please tell me he choose to take the test!!” As previously mentioned, it was a Sunday afternoon and having already looked over the calendar for the week I wasn’t sure where I could pencil in constructing a Wigwam in a shoe box. As luck would (or would not) have it- he had chosen the Igloo. Do you know how hard it is to find sugar cubes in my town on a Sunday night?
Then…we embarked on the college applications. Y ‘all, this is not the first time I have made this statement in my adult life and I doubt will be the last- but I am really glad I am not in high school anymore. In my senior year of high school, applying to college meant swinging by Dr. Wood’s office and flipping through the college brochures neatly displayed on a magazine stand and picking one, maybe two if you were ambitious, that looked like a good fit. You would then go home and neatly fill them out, print out your resume, get a check from mom or dad for twenty-five dollars made out to the school’s admission department, hunt down a stamp in the junk drawer in the kitchen and stick that puppy in the mail box. After which you would wait several weeks or months for the (hopefully) large package from the school of your choice to come in the mail. Kids, for you guys facing this now- the big packages meant you were in and the smaller envelopes meant “we don’t feel you fit the type of student we are looking for at ACME University”. #biggerwasbetter
I got lucky. I applied to one school- Presbyterian College in Clinton, SC and got in. It was an incredible four years and I have no regrets. (At this point I would like to thank my mom and dad for paying for me to go to college. I have never in my life appreciated you more than I did when we started looking at the cost of college for our senior.) The eldest darling has applied to eight schools. To say things are different now is a bit of an understatement. All applications are done online and all acceptances or rejections come via an email. And the cost of applying has doubled in the last twenty plus years. (Yes, we’ve spent a small fortune just applying to the schools, not to mention the cost to take SATs which go ahead and count on your child taking it at least three times unless you have spawn little standardized test taking geniuses.) Add to all of this, there is a college visit movement. Last spring we spent two days each taking her all over the Carolinas, Virginia and into Tennessee to visit eight schools. Both were whirlwind tours and they all started to run together…and minus the varying locations…they all encourage international travel and research. I don’t know why but this is the one thing that stuck with me after my forty-eight hour road trip. Like I stated before, they all started to run together and the whole experience is a blur for all of us.
Y’all it’s overwhelming and I am not sure we did the right thing by going all over and showing her multitudes of dorms, quads, university libraries and student centers. Did we give her too many choices? It’s a huge decision they have to make. And this is the decision- “where do I fit?” It’s stressful. I have watched mine as well as her friends, study for SAT/ACT tests, poor over essays and online applications -making sure everything was done right as they try to prove to people they don’t even know- “I am a fit for your school and this is why.” “I want to be an architect and this is why.” “I belong on your campus and this is why.” They are being asked to set a career course as seventeen and eighteen years old to spend the next four plus years somewhere based on what? A one hour tour of the campus, it’s where one of their parents went, they have a good football team? I am forty-three and I haven’t gotten this figured out. I don’t necessarily think this is much different than when I applied to school but looking back as the older and wiser person I am now (who still doesn’t know what she wants to do when she grows up) I think the level of stress is much greater on these kids to figure out what they want to be when they grow up pretty early on. I won’t even get into the cost of school these days which someone told me just this week has gone up two-hundred percent in the past 20 years. I haven’t followed- up on this number but that sounds about right. People, this is insane.
So, now we wait for the other five emails to roll in between now and the middle of February. So far she has three good choices should the rest fall through. We are approaching the holidays and the level of “college stress” has simmered down and we are settling in for a time of thankfulness. Thankful that we are all together and well. Thankful to be surrounded by loving and supportive families and friends. Thankful for the chill in the air to let us know that seasons are always changing- not just the weather kind but the seasons of our life. This is the season we are in now- ice cream socials, igloos and college applications. There will be other seasons that come with other challenges, but what I am learning is it’s just best to settle in where you are and just let it wash over you.

A once original idea is now on target to become, quite literally, the future of the internet. Airborne Wireless Network is a company working hard to introduce a Wholesale Carrier Network – a virtual “airborne worldwide web” – that will work by utilizing commercial aircraft as “mini-satellites.”
Not only will the Network open up an entirely new way to communicate, but the advantages that will be given to the world are also what will make it a highly cost-efficient system. As far as global services are concerned, the Network will be the first and only true airborne broadband pipeline, providing connectivity for worldwide broadband carrier services.
This outstanding technology was patented during the pioneering days of wireless data connectivity. In fact, it was in 1998 that the Network’s inventor submitted a patent application, which was granted on September 4th, 2001. Unfortunately, as we all know, a tragedy then struck the U.S. which altered the airline industry and delayed the development of this technology for a number of years. Thankfully, days improved, allowing Airborne Wireless to further their development of this monumental idea.
Although the need to improve internet technology is always there, there is also a need to get superior quality at lower costs, which is a formula (usually) highly difficult to attain. However, this “world wide web” that will be installed in the skies will not only provide superior service but better quality and the ability to save money all at the same time. Costs are lowered because upgrades and advancements can be made to the Network that cannot be made to the technology that currently exists.
Being a meshed network means that there are multiple links to the system. With traditional single-link systems (i.e., most cell-tower and satellite systems), they can and do suffer from what professionals call “single points of failure.” Put simply, anything from mechanical difficulties to a heavy rainstorm in the area can disturb and shut down the system. Whereas, with the fully meshed Network by Airborne Wireless, real-time connectivity is always kept no matter what the situation may be. By having multiple links, if a disturbance occurs, the signal will simply be re-routed around the obstruction to another aircraft, ship or earth-station in the chain.
When it comes to saving money, it is also important to note how easy the Network will be to update, upgrade or service. As new software becomes available, the system can be easily updated on the planes, themselves. When new and more efficient data-transmission technologies emerge, upgrading ABWN’s system can be as easy as replacing a single module, and the system is immediately ready for “the future.” This will ensure that the Network is never obsolete, which makes it completely different than current satellite technology. In most cases, when it comes to satellites, the technology has been surpassed by the time the satellite is even launched. And, once launched, they cannot be upgraded or serviced, making them yet another piece of space junk.
As you can see, the quality, the ability to not further turn space into a trash receptacle, and the ability to upgrade and improve the Network as technology continues to advance rapidly, are just some of the reasons why Airborne Wireless Network’s superior “Superhighway” will save money while bringing connectivity to one and all.

Have not you observe that our technology today is fast evolving and growing ? Especially in printing organisation, there are lots of changes from equipment to materials. They can even print now into a canvas. Yes you read it. Nowadays, it is possible to print into a canvas. They state that canvas printing is ideal for recreating many different image types and providing included value.
Due to the improvement in printing innovation, canvas documents for printing have actually been established. The Legion Premium Canvas Paper it is a matte completed, water-resistant inkjet canvas that can catches the look and feel of an oil painting. This Premium Canvas paper is also created as for printing photographs that, when framed, will enable the photographer to communicate a timeless appeal typically connected with classic paintings. The Archival Inkjet Canvas with a neutral pH is another paper canvas kind it is compatible with both dye-based and pigments based inks.

Turning to the other side or shall I state to the artist side, we all understand that canvas is used by many fine art artists as their medium to create a sensational art work masterpiece. Additionally, canvas serves as a support for oil painting, and is the name for the mesh material on which embroidery and needlepoint are done.
Nevertheless, canvas printing is not the like canvas painting; the reason is that they utilized different canvas. In canvas printing, the canvas utilized has a unique responsive finishing to accept right here the inks of the printer, which is not present in canvas painting. Artists generally utilize small pieces or often much bigger of canvas as a base for their works of art. This canvas is extended across a wood frame called a stretcher, and is covered with gesso before it is to be used.

That woman knew that by touching Jesus’ clothes, she would make him unclean, but she thought that no one would notice.
How did such a person ever qualify as a professor, when her knowledge of history is so abysmally poor? Her hateful prejudice further disqualifies her. She is ignorant of what she vainly professes to know.
It brings to mind the young, naive Italian who believed that the Palestinian cause was just. His dedication finally culminated by a visit to Gaza or some such place occupied by Palestinians. His efforts in supporting the Palestinians were rewarded by his being assassinated there and then by them or their allies.

This morning Steve and I took a jog along the beach while Yumi babysat the kids. Seeing so many empty firepits along the way, as chilly as it was, we were inspired to have a bonfire before sunset to end the year 2010. We quickly bought fixings for dinner and dessert and drove to Huntington Beach. Anna was a bit cold but fortunately Yumi came all bundled up and lent Anna one of her many jackets. Steve did a great job starting up the flames, and we enjoyed hotdogs and smores. Sam declared it to be the "best day ever", hopefully he has just as much fun tomorrow, his 6th birthday. Cheers to a memorable year!
We went to the Getty Museum with Mari's family, and Rob's sister Sue's family. It was a picturesque day! (I predated this blog entry to fit in the rest of the year's photos.) Enjoy!
On Christmas morning, the kids did not get up until 7am, which is late especially for Sam. Anna immediately heard a "purr" from one of the wrapped packages and knew it was her Fur Real Cat, which she named Snowball. The cat is quite lifelike and entranced baby Julia.
The family had two rounds of opening presents, the first included gifts from our family up north. The second round came along with Yumi, Mari, Rob, Julia, and my parents. At one point the room was consumed with gifts but surprisingly we were able to make space afterwards for Wii Fit Plus. We enjoyed a Honeybaked ham brunch which included a baked potato bar, pasta salad, and cupcakes. We managed to get a group shot which included camera-shy Sam but he was a good sport about it.
We collected a lot of xxx clips for every taste. Teen, Amateur, BDSM, Cumshot, Voyeur, Femdom and much more.
By knowing how much mortgage you can handle, you can ensure that homeownership will fit in your budget.
Homeownership should make you feel safe and secure, and that includes financially. Be sure you can afford your home by calculating how much of a mortgage you can safely fit into your budget.
Why not just take out the biggest mortgage a lender says you can have? Because your lender bases that number on a formula that doesn’t consider your current and future financial and personal goals.
Think ahead to major life events and consider how those might influence your budget. Do you want to return to school for an advanced degree? Will a new child add day care to your monthly expenses? Does a relative plan to eventually live with you and contribute to the mortgage?
Consider those lifestyle issues as you check out these four methods for estimating the amount of mortgage you can afford.
The oldest rule of thumb says you can typically afford a home priced two to three times your gross income. So, if you earn $100,000, you can typically afford a home between $200,000 and $300,000.
But that’s not the best method because it doesn’t take into account your monthly expenses and debts. Those costs greatly influence how much you can afford. Let’s say you earn $100,000 a year but have $1,000 in monthly payments for student debt, car loans, and credit card minimum payments. You don’t have as much money to pay your mortgage as someone earning the same income with no debts.
Better option: Prepare a family budget that tallies your ongoing monthly bills for everything — credit cards, car and student loans, lunch at work, day care, date night, vacations, and savings.
See what’s left over to spend on homeownership costs, like your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, and community association fees, if applicable.
How much money do you have for a downpayment? The higher your downpayment, the lower your monthly payments will be. If you put down at least 20% of the home’s cost, you may not have to get private mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if you default and costs hundreds each month. That leaves more money for your mortgage payment.
The lower your downpayment, the higher the loan amount you’ll need to qualify for and the higher your monthly mortgage payment.
But, if interest rates and/or home prices are rising and you wait to buy until you accumulate a bigger downpayment, you may end up paying more for your home.
Lenders generally follow the 43% rule. Your monthly mortgage payments covering your home loan principal, interest, taxes and insurance, plus all your other bills, like car loans, utilities, and credit cards, shouldn’t exceed 43% of your gross annual income.
Here’s an example of how the 43% calculation works for a homebuyer making $100,000 a year before taxes:
You might find a lender willing to give you a mortgage with a payment that goes above the 43% line, but consider carefully before you take it. Evidence from studies of mortgage loans suggest that borrowers who go over the limit are more likely to run into trouble making monthly payments, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau warns.
The tax benefits of homeownership generally allow you to afford a mortgage payment — including taxes and insurance — of about one-third more than your current rent payment without changing your lifestyle. So you can multiply your current rent by 1.33 to arrive at a rough estimate of a mortgage payment.
Here’s an example: If you currently pay $1,500 per month in rent, you should be able to comfortably afford a $2,000 monthly mortgage payment after factoring in the tax benefits of homeownership.
However, if you’re struggling to keep up with your rent, buy a home that will give you the same payment rather than going up to a higher monthly payment. You’ll have additional costs for homeownership that your landlord now covers, like property taxes and repairs. If there’s no room in your budget for those extras, you could become financially stressed.
Also consider whether or not you’ll itemize your deductions. If you take the standard deduction, you can’t also deduct mortgage interest payments. Talking to a tax adviser, or using a tax software program to do a “what if” tax return, can help you see your tax situation more clearly.

One of the great joys of Easter is the message of hope it brings to the world. The hope that one day our trials and tribulations will cease and we will be in a place of eternal peace. That despite our all-too-human wrongdoings we have forgiveness through the death and resurrection of Jesus. That in his life and death he showed us a glimpse of a new kingdom with different rules. Christians around the world instinctively understand this and are called to live their lives to offer a glimpse of that hope to those around us.
For many people today this faith might seem a bit strange, even a bit abstract. You might wonder how an account of a miraculous event over 2,000 years ago can support us in our everyday struggles. It doesn’t bring a wage packet in or provide food for the table. It doesn’t end the austerity, fix the NHS, or instantly solve the numerous injustices of society. It’s a nice story, harsher than the Christmas story but with a happy ending, which is fine. But: is it irrelevant?
No. As leaders of the local Anglican and Roman Catholic churches we strongly believe that living in understanding of the hope of the resurrection gives a real purpose to our lives and the lives of the tens of thousands of Christians in our city and our region. In gratitude to Jesus Christ who sacrificed so much we are called to offer ourselves in service to others. Through a living relationship with a God who opposes injustice we are called to speak up for those on the edge of society so they may inherit a share of the true wealth that this country has to offer.
We are called to do this not because we have privilege but because we ourselves are poor, because we know failure as all people do, because in the midst of poverty and failure we have a new hope.
This country is calling for that new hope; for a new start; for, as the Anglican House of Bishops said, a 'fresh moral vision' – a new order for the country which puts care and compassion at its heart. And as the Roman Catholic Bishops have said, we are called 'to build a world in which respect, dignity, equality, justice and peace are our primary concerns'; where people are paid a decent wage for the work they do; where the vulnerable are cared for and respected; where government institutions treat people as people, not numbers on a balance sheet; where humanity and human dignity is placed at the centre of all our lives.
This is a glimpse of the new kingdom and the new hope that the Easter story offers: real and relevant. It drives and motivates many of our unsung heroes to volunteer time in food banks, debt advice centres; with the lonely, the asylum seekers, the disadvantaged and the lost. It is the hope that drives the Church to make a bigger difference to society week in, week out.
But it is also a glimpse of the hope that Christians feel as individuals. The hope that can turn round an addict or reform a criminal. The hope that can support the ill and comfort the bereaved. The hope that can bring us through adversity. The hope that can change your life.

The first phase of a comprehensive refurbishment at the historic Royal Kings Arms hotel in Lancaster has been completed with the opening of its ground-floor restaurant and bar.
The Brasserie, as it’s now known, was unveiled during a grand re-opening on June 22 following significant refurbishment project designed by Harrison Pitt Architects.
The next two phases of development will see an exciting champagne and cocktail bar, known as The Crypt, created in the basement of the building and the opening of new first floor Business Centre facilities.
Hayley Dufton, architect on the project for Harrison Pitt Architects, said: “After a long period of under-investment prior to having new owners, it’s great to see this iconic hotel being sympathetically transformed, and to see it so busy again.
“This project has been all about making the history and architecture of the building its focal point again, reinstating it as a prestigious destination hotel in Lancaster city centre.”
Harrison Pitt Architects was initially appointed by the new management Artisan Hotels in 2017 to draw up plans to renovate the ground floor and basement of the 400-year-old, grade-two-listed building.
The Royal Kings Arms was originally built in 1625 during the reign of King Charles I and was rebuilt in 1879.
heads of Europe became its guests around the time of the French Napoleonic Wars. The hotel was granted royal patronage from the visits of King Edward VII of England and of Queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.
It is also the place where Charles Dickens stayed when he wrote ‘Tale of the Bridal Chamber’. The hotel also features in the Dickens story ‘The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices’.
Wherever there are people, there are subjects for my artwork. I have a lifelong fascination with the figure and never miss an opportunity to draw or paint from life. In the case of dancers and other "fast movers", I usually do quick gestures, then paint final versions from memory. Some of my best gesture drawings have been done on napkins in restaurants, bars and other places where people gather. My drawings have appeared in several of the North Light books, "Strokes of Genius, The Best of Drawing" including the issue scheduled for publication early in 2018; one of my portrait drawings appeared in the book, "Art Journey: Portraits and Figures". "The Artisan", a charcoal drawing from life, was a finalist in the cover competition of Drawing magazine in 2010. Another of my portraits was featured in the Drawing Portfolio in Southwest Art magazine in 2012. My artwork has won major awards in several regional and national shows and is included in private collections in the United States and many other countries.

THERE is a certain spot near Lisburn where rabbits are invariably seen. So we went to look at the rabbits recently, and guess what! There were no rabbits. So humans or dogs had scared them away.
So we checked out some other places where rabbits are normally seen, and again, no rabbits. Having spoken to a number of folk about declining rabbit numbers, it is unclear whether the bunnies have disappeared from the places we normally see them, whether they are becoming scarce all over, or whether the dreaded myxomatosis has returned to haunt the furry creatures.
It is a year short of half a century since this dreaded disease was introduced to our rabbits. Porton Downs, or some such hellhole, conjured up this ghastly disease, perhaps to accommodate Australian farmers, because at one time it was believed that an importation of rabbits could help the farmers there. Moral, don't mess too much with Nature.
Some folk here took to myxomotosis , spread it round the countryside, killed enormous numbers of rabbits. The rabbits kept coming back A golf course I know, not near Lisburn, decided to reintroduce myxomotosis a few years ago. In the intervening years, I have never seen a rabbit there, where once they were common.
The occasional rabbit scrape appeared, which would lead me to believe that the odd rabbit passes through. But it does not stay.
We all know what the bunny looks like. But did you ever remark the variety of colouring? The wild rabbit can have a coat of silver-grey, it can be fawn, but partially black varieties are not unknown.
A small creature I have seen more of recently is the field mouse. At the risk of appearing sexist, if a mouse is seen in a house the ladies jump onto chairs and scream. The macho male goes big game hunting, puffing out his chest as a mark of male superiority. Sometimes he even gets the mouse.
The house mouse originated in the East, gradually spread, and took the boat to Britain and Ireland. Blame boats for mice. Mostly, they are unwanted , and unloved, likewise the occasional fieldmouse and shrew who find their way into our homes. And I have seen both indoors.
See a field mouse in the wild, and that is a very different matter. How handsome they look. How agile they look. (Did you ever see them jump off a wall?) How intelligent they look. So field mice I have seen lately are wonderful creatures.
On the subject of animals, the hedgehogs are lying low these days. I have seen one live one, and one dead one, while driving around the countryside of late. Normally I see hedgehogs roaming the streets around the area where I live, or the neighbours tell me about the animal in their gardens. More frequently, we see them in our garden, a spot seemingly attractive to this animal. But not a one this year.
So are the hedgehogs less common this year? Are the field mice more common this year? Are the rabbits more scarce this year? Are the otters more common this year?
I forgot to mention that Joe saw an otter last week, at dusk. He does not want me to reveal where, but the place is not a million miles from Lisburn. Recent reports showed more otters in the Lagan.
This was in the Shaw's Bridge area, but other reports revealed that otters had moved further up the Lagan.
I have spoken to folk who saw otters in the tributaries. This is all very good otter news, and would appear to show that the animal is thriving, his range even expanding slowly. So the field mice and otters are OK. Lets hope the rabbits and hedgehogs do likewise!

My first oil painting was on a piece of cardboard. My father was a traveling salesman and left his paints where I could get my hands on them. Today, I still paint on paper. Most of my life I had quiet ambitions to be a full time artist but circumstances always seemed to keep art an avocation.
I studies art in Germany for over two years with Heinrich Kreutzfeldt, a well-known artist from Bad Kreutznach. I taught children's art classes, photography classes, and designed and built sets for a theater group at the Air Base in Sembach, Germany.
I moved to France for a year, then in Athens, Greece before moving to Teheran, Iran for another year. Life imitates life; I had become a "traveling salesman" with a territory stretching from Morocco to India. The six day Arab-Israeli War of 1967 forced my eventual return to the states to work in downtown Manhattan. Circumstances still kept fine art an avocation.
After a number of years as a designer and builder in Florida, I moved to Greenville, SC and again found some of my father's brushes in my hand. All of his art "stuff" was passed on to me.
I went to a watercolor class at Furman University, took workshops with several professionals including Carl Blair, Jeanette Dreskin and Mary White and my art found a new beginning.
Circumstances have changed. Art is now my full time profession. For the last 6 years, I have been teaching classes three days a week in my studios, occasional classes at Furman and participate in 16 to 18 juried Art Fairs throughout the Southeast every year.

The day was sort of gray and the colours weren't that dramatic, so I took that opportunity to do a complete set of black and whites for these shots.
The Tasman Valley in the Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand, is an amazing place to visit by day, but once night falls, I can honestly say it’s one of the most amazing night skies you will ever see. I recently spend a night under the stars there above the glacier lake. It was a spectacular view looking down the valley, especially when the Aurora Australis lit up the sky to the south. The bright band of the Milky Way spanned overhead from east to west, and there were so many shooting stars that night, I lost count - it was certainly one incredible night under the stars to remember!

Deep spring water. Water from the red sandstone strata of the northern Black Forest in Germany. It is obtained from our own well at a depth of 165 meters, and is unchlorinated and naturally pure. Its function is to moisturize the surface of the skin and to act as a solvent for water-soluble ingredients and plant extracts.
Squalane. An oil component of plant origin similar to the squalene in the skin and therefore particularly well absorbed. Makes the skin feel soft, silky, but not greasy, and is very skin-compatible.
A fatty acid ester. From plant fatty acids. Can be spread easily and well. Does not leave the skin feeling greasy.
Meadowfoam oil. This oil is derived from the seeds of the American meadowfoam. It is extremely resistant to oxidation and cares for the skin. The high concentration of long-chain fatty acids it contains makes the skin feel extremely silky, without leaving behind an unpleasantly oily film.
Jojoba oil. A liquid wax from the seeds of the jojoba shrub. Cares for the skin, smooths, protects, and maintains the skin’s moisture. It is rapidly absorbed without making the skin look greasy. It is also very resistant to oxidation and offers a slight level of natural protection against light.
Glycerin. A component of all fats and oils. Glycerin has a moisturizing effect. For BÖRLIND, it is derived solely from vegetable oil.
Sorbitol. A natural sugar alcohol of plant origin that occurs naturally in many fruits. Also used in foodstuffs. Has a moisturizing and moisture-retaining effect.
Aluminum/magnesium hydroxide stearate. A reaction product of aluminum/magnesium hydroxide (used in pharmacy as a remedy for heartburn) with stearic acid (from vegetable oils). It is an auxiliary substance that helps to stabilize water-in-oil emulsions.
An emulsifier from regrowing raw materials: a compound of sorbitol (a natural sugar alcohol of plant origin with a moisturizing and moisture-retaining effect) and plant fatty acids from vegetable oil. Binds oil and water. Cares for and moisturizes the skin.
Lecithin. A substance similar to fat, with emulsifying properties. Can be found in vegetable oils from which it is derived. It cares for the skin and hair, and improves combability. Special lecithins can be made into liposomes in which active ingredients can be encapsulated and protected, improving their bioavailability when applied to the skin.
Shea butter. A solid plant fat obtained from the seeds of an African tree. It has very good care properties and is ideal for dry, irritated skin. A thickening agent in emulsions.
Extract from a green alga. This alga extract helps to protect the skin and has an anti-aging effect.
Essential oils, distillates, perfume, fragrances, and aromatic substances. The collective term for everything that contains fragrances: from an individual essential oil through to perfume compositions made up of many different fragrances.
Vitamin A palmitate. Has a regenerating, anti-aging, anti-acne, wound-healing and skin-refining effect. In contrast to other forms of vitamin A (e.g. retinol), it is very skin-compatible.
Panthenol and ethanol. An oil-soluble form of panthenol that is used in lipsticks, for example. Converts to pantothenic acid/vitamin B5 on the skin. It binds moisture and has a regenerating effect, and therefore wound-healing properties.
Aloe vera from organic farming. 100 kg of juice yields 0.5 kg of spray-dried aloe powder. The powder does not need to be preserved. Moisturizes and soothes the skin.
Betaine. Obtained from sugar beet. Betaine attaches itself to the keratin (a structural protein) of the hair and skin, and has a moisturizing effect. It also reduces static in the hair.
Sunflower oil from organic farming. A carrier oil with good skin-compatibility. Smooths and cares for the skin and hair.
Macadamia nut oil. The fatty acid makeup of this oil is very similar to that of human sebum. Ideal for dry and sensitive skin. Has a caring, smoothing and regenerating effect, and is rapidly absorbed.
Tara gum. A polysaccharide from the seeds of the tara tree. Used in cosmetics as a natural gelling agent with moisturizing properties and as a reservoir for active ingredients.
Sodium salt of hyaluronic acid. Sodium hyaluronate has an outstanding ability to bind water. It moisturizes and smooths. For BÖRLIND, it comes solely from superior, sustainable, vegan and GMO-free (GMO = genetically modified organisms) biotechnological production, in which plant material and ethanol are fermented with the aid of lactic acid bacteria.
Pure, undenatured ethyl alcohol, potable alcohol. Obtained by fermenting plants containing starch or sugar. Alcohol is deployed as a solvent for extracts and various active ingredients. It also has a refreshing, astringent, toning and preservative effect, and stimulates the circulation.
Mica. Mica is a natural mineral which has been used for cosmetic purposes for centuries. It gives a subtle shine to cosmetics. When coated with titanium dioxide, it is known as “pearlescent pigments”.
Vitamin E. Can be found in many vegetable oils. As an antioxidant it prevents these from becoming rancid. It also stabilizes cosmetics and protects the skin against free radicals induced by UV radiation, for example, thus forestalling premature, environment-related skin aging.
Sodium salt of benzoic acid/sodium benzoate. A preservative for foodstuffs and cosmetics. It is often used to preserve plant extracts as well.
Fat-soluble form of vitamin C. This fat-soluble form of vitamin C is more light- and temperature-resistant, and is converted into free vitamin C in the skin. It has an antioxidant effect, counteracts skin aging caused by free radicals and prevents emulsions from becoming rancid.
An emulsifier from regrowing raw materials: plant glycerin and vegetable fat plus citric acid. Binds oil and water. Cares for the skin.

After 30 years of service, the Los Angeles Class fast attack submarine is still a mainstay of America's fast attack submarine fleet. In November 2009 the lead ship of the class, SSN-688 USS Los Angeles, was retired from the fleet. On January 23, 2010 the USS Los Angeles was decommissioned during a cerimony held in San Pedro, CA.
The ship will be broken up at the Peuget Sound Naval Ship Yard in Bremerton, Washington. At the time of her decommissioning, the USS Los Angeles was the oldest boat in the fleet.
We are pleased to offer this print to commemorate the service of "the First and The Finest". The scene shows the sub passing over the drop-off of the continental shelf and headed for deep water.

It is down-pouring out – torrential rains and 42 mph winds. The news has already reported accidents all over the place, flooding and fallen trees. I should probably cancel my appointments and work from home today but I don’t.
I called the garage to confirm that my car would be ready at 8:30. I left at 8:15 am to give myself plenty of time to get to my 10:00 appointment in Westchester. My umbrella was blown inside-out and I was soaking wet by the time I walked the 4 blocks to my garage. My car was being pulled up just as I arrived. The normally friendly garage guy got out of my car, waved hello and quickly left to get the next car. They must be extremely busy today, I thought to myself, because this guy always hangs around for his $1 tip. It’s going to be a great day – I’ve already saved a dollar and this canceled out the fact that I was completely drenched. I got into my car only to discover that the reason he left so quickly was because he had just left the biggest, smelliest most disgusting man-fart ever – in my car! There were already several cars waiting for me to pull out so that they could enter the garage and I had no choice to get into the fart filled car and get out of the way.
The FDR Drive was flooded and traffic was not moving at all. I had to keep my window opened because the smell was so foul. The rain was streaming in sideways and the fart seemed to linger in the wet air and would not leave my car. I sat in my wet clothing in the fart-filled air for two and a half hours on the Major Deegan. Either there was a terrible accident or a massive flood, but for whatever reason I was not moving at all. Eventually I was able to make it to an exit. It was 11:00 and I had already missed my 10:00 appointment and doubtful that I could have made it to my 12:00. I turned the car around, drug myself through the winds and rain, up five flights of stairs and peeled off my stinky, wet suit and began to re-plan my day.
First on my list was to get the to the dry cleaners. Ivan kept going over to the fart-infested suit, which was sitting in a pile on the floor and smelling it – and that was freaking me out. It’s already 12:00 and I have not done anything yet. I will begin to get some work done as soon as I get back from the cleaners. Maybe I should tip more.

McLean is located between the George Washington Parkway to the east and the rapidly growing business center of Tysons Corner to the west. It stretches almost 10 miles southeast to northeast along Old Dominion Road. A century ago, the strip of land known as Old Dominion Road was an electric railroad line on the Great Falls and Old Dominion (GF&OD) service running from Georgetown to Great Falls. One stop on the Railroad was at Ingleside, a crossroads midway between Langley and Lewinsville, where the McLean Post Office was established in 1910. McLean was named in honor of John R. McLean, publisher of The Washington Post and stockholder of the railway.
McLean is steeped in history dating back almost 400 years to the time of the sixth Lord Fairfax. One of the more notable estates was known as Salona. It was built on part of the 2,862 acre grant known as Langley. During the war of 1812, the estate’s owner, the Reverend William Maffit, reportedly gave refuge to President James Madison as the British troops burned Washington D.C. During the Civil War, Salona served as the headquarters for Union General William “Baldy” Smith. Salona remained a working farm until the late 1940’s when the current owners began selling acreage. State Representative Clive and Susan DuVal began purchasing Salona in stages beginning in 1953. The DuVal family later generously arranged for the preservation of the house and property. Fairfax County is currently in negotiations to transform the remaining acreage into a park with open space and playing fields.
McLean is home to many diplomats, members of Congress and high ranking federal government officials. While McLean may be better known for its upscale residences and famous politicians, it is offers a variety of homes for several different income levels. Prices begin in the low $200,000’s for modest garden and high rise apartments, shift upward to the $400,000-$700,000 price range for typical townhouses and modest detached homes, and skyrocket to over $5 Million for custom, one-of-a-kind private residences that overlook the Potomac River.
The McLean community is bustling with active community organizations, established to allow residents and visitors the experience of area cultural opportunities. Original, high-quality theatrical productions, professional classical music presentations, and art exhibits are available year-round at the McLean Community Center. The recently renovated Dolly Madison Library is an oasis of quiet tucked into a corner of McLean Central Park. Clemijontri Park is a fabulous new ADA accessible children’s park complete with a beautiful, old fashioned Merry-Go-Round. McEnearney Associates is proud to Sponsor Mac’s Mercury, a handsome stallion that calls the Carousel home. McLean Hardware, a local institution since 1948 is a wonderful alternative the Big Box Hardware store. They have plenty of young staff ready to help you find just the right tool the moment you walk through their doors. Another classic McLean experience is dinner at the McLean Family Restaurant. Don’t be surprised if you see a former Speaker of the House enjoying an old fashioned dinner in the booth next door. McLean Family has been serving up hot meals since 1955. And if your car needs repair, the friendly and honest mechanics at McLean Service Center will take care of that too. They have been fixing cars since the time of the 1953 Chevy Bel-Air.
Two very secret, but well recognized entities have world headquarters located in McLean, the Mars Candy Company and the Central Intelligence Agency. Neither discloses the number of employees working on site, claiming that information is strictly “need to know.”
McLean is conveniently located near three major highways, the Beltway, Rt. 495, Rt. 66, and The G.W. Parkway. The main local thoroughfares are Rt. 123, named after Dolly Madison and Old Dominion Drive. Since the completion of the Silver Line, McLean now has its' own Metro station located at Tyson's Corner.

“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner, and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes, and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.
“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.”
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground.
“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”
“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.
Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”
“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”
For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes.

Check out the top moments from LeBron James' visit to Shanghai where he gave an inspirational speech and did some drills with young fans. (2:09)
SHANGHAI -- The energy inside Shanghai's Rucker Park -- an indoor basketball gym -- is so high that it stands in defiance to the rain showers falling on the city. To the hundreds of fans who braved the weather to make a pilgrimage here to see LeBron James, this place at the moment is nothing less than a hoops mecca.
However, surrounded by deafening chants of "Lakers for championship," longtime purple-and-gold supporter Yang Kun is finding himself in a cloud of dilemma.
A devout follower of Kobe Bryant since 2004, Yang is wearing a brand-new No. 23 Lakers jersey -- one of only a few in the crowd. James is a man who many Black Mamba fans in China once viewed as their idol's archenemy.
"I'm not used to it yet," Yang said while gazing at James, who's in town as part of his China tour sponsored by Nike.
"At first, we were not so enthusiastic about LeBron coming to L.A." Yang said as James stands some 50 feet away at center court. "But I'm learning to accept it."
To Yang and many who grew up watching Bryant through his prime, getting used to seeing James in a Lakers jersey is a twisting experience, fraught with internal conflict and an inescapable sense of self-betrayal.
In a nation that arguably hosts the largest number of Lakers fans in the world, the Kobe vs. LeBron battle is still being waged. Rather than a turf war between two camps of fans, it is a clash between two schools of thought, or tastes for aesthetics.
While many gravitate toward Bryant's delicate touch to the game, as well as his intense personality, others find James' presence as an omnipotent physical specimen more appealing. That strong appreciation for each means you may only get to pick one.
With James joining Los Angeles as a free agent this summer, many longtime fans of Bryant have a choice to make: to continue reminiscing about the days of No. 8/No. 24, or to welcome the opening of a new era led by No. 23.
"There are several camps of Kobe fans in China," said Sway Huang, executive editor overseeing NBA coverage at Tencent, ESPN's digital partner in China. "There are those who are loyal exclusively to Kobe, but they might not be the majority."
Huang, a veteran NBA insider and author of a book documenting the Lakers' history, said to those who fell for the Lakers because of Bryant, his retirement means there's now no place to entrust their love for the game.
But for other Lakers fans, Huang said, it shouldn't be difficult to accept James since there is no grudge necessarily held between King James and his new franchise.
"If LeBron can deliver a title to the Lakers, he will not only solidify his historic status, but also revive the glory of purple and gold. At the end, this will be a happy place for all Lakers fans." Huang said.
Warm Springs Nation Little League Junior Softball all stars are playing for the state championship today at 3:30 in Clackamas at Riverside Park.
The Warm Springs Land Buy Back workers mailed the second wave of offers back in May and those offers are good through July 16. Through the Buy Back program, fractional interests in allotments are purchased from the tribal member owner, on behalf of the Confederated Tribes. The first wave of offers, earlier this year, saw a benefit to the tribes, and to the individual owners of the fractional interests. The Spilyay Tymoo reports he first wave allowed for the purchase of a total of 529 fractional interests from 161 separate owners, covering 1,260 acres of tribal land. These interests are now with the tribes. The total amount expended on these purchases was $723,000. And, there is still close to $3 million reported to be available for the second wave.
The 31st Waterfront Blues Festival kicked off yesterday at Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland, as did KWSO’s live-fed broadcast from the festival. The four-day-long concert series is filled with blues, soul, funk and r&b through Saturday evening with a headlining performance by George Thorogood and the Destroyers to wrap things up. The waterfront Blues Festival began in 1987. Though the Oregon Food bank, which was historically the festival’s organizer, stepped away from the role this year, ticket sales still benefit the food bank. You can hear music from the festival here on KWSO – we are airing it from noon until 10pm each day through Saturday.

HEY YOU! Yes, you, sitting behind your screen reading this. I don't know you and you certainly don't know me. But I want to tell you something. Everyone has their own story. Yours might be filled with joy and happiness, or it might be clouded with pain and misfortune. I want you to know that you're a beautiful, wonderful, talented person. Even if your life isn't going the way you want it to right now, I know that you'll be able to make it out alright. I want you to do me a favor. I know I'm just a stranger, but just trust me, okay? Every time you see your reflection, be it in the mirror in the bathroom, in a window somewhere, or in a puddle on the street, I want you to look at yourself and give yourself a hug. Because even if you aren't the prettiest or the smartest or the funniest, you're something that no one else can be: you. And you are the greatest thing you can be. Smile at strangers. Be confident in yourself. Cry when you feel like crying, laugh when you feel like laughing. Hold your head up and keep your heart open. You're worth everything and then some. And always remember that no matter what, even if it doesn't seem like it, you're everything to someone.

So far, most of the classic cocktails we've posted are from the pre-prohibition era, which represented the first cocktail boom. In the 1950s and '60s, there was a second cocktail boom in America, which was brought on by the tiki culture craze. Tiki cocktails are usually made with rum but often with split bases; a mixture of aged and white rum is common. Tiki drinks are often served in special tiki mugs with a number of garnishes.
The Mai Tai is considered by many to be the quintessential tiki drink. The invention of the drink is a contentious issue; both of the men considered to be the founders of the tiki movement, Trader Vic and Don the Beachcomber, claim to have come up with the Mai Tai.
Tiki drinks tend to be fairly sweet and usually have lots of citrus, making them fairly easy-drinking summer cocktails. They often also contain overproof rums so that the booze cuts through the other flavours. The Mai Tai uses lime juice as the acid and almond-flavoured orgeat syrup as the sweetener, with curaçao adding sweetness and subtle orange flavour. While we recommend triple sec for most of our cocktails, the Mai Tai is one where a sweeter curaçao is also quite nice.
Combine the ingredients in a shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a rocks glass full of ice. Garnish with the lime wheel.
We haven't yet found a recipe for homemade orgeat that we like, but if you buy some from a specialty grocery store or from the internet it will keep for a while in the fridge.

 Vaginal bleeding that is not related to Menses, occurring frequently between menses mentrorrhagia or post menopausally
 In women over 50 years, post menopausal bleeding after 6 months after the last normal menses should be evaluated.
Total menstrual blood loss is usually less than 80mL. Prolonged or excessive blood loss, regardless of the cause may result in iron deficiency and anemia.
Most abnormal vaginal bleeding results from hormonal abnormalities in the hyothalmic-pitutary-ovarian axis, but bleeding may also result from structural gynecologic disorders. With hormonal causes, ovulation does not occur or occurs infrequently; as a result estrogen, unopposed by progesterone, stimulates endometrial growth. As a result, the endometrial sloughs and bleeds irregularly, incompletely, and sometimes excessively or for a long time.
In children common causes—- Trauma, foreign bodies with vaginitis, prolapsed urethral meatus, precocious puberty with premature menses
Women of reproductive age with syncope or hemorrhagic shock—- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Women of reproductive age with positive pregnancy test—- Spontaneous complete or incomplete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, gestational trophoblastic disease, endomentritis secondary to retained products of conception
Structural: Vaginal disorders (eg. Cancers, adenosis, trauma, granulomas secondary to previous surgery) Cervical (eg. Cancer, polyps, myomas, condylomata acuminate). Uterine (eg. cancers, adenomyosis such as benign invasion of myometrium by the myometrium by the endometrium, endometrial polyps, submucosa and pedunculated fibroids; occasional, delayed endometeritis secondary to retained products of conception). Ovarian (eg. Tumors)
 Lowered estrogen levels in peri-menopausal or post menopausal women may cause the lining of the vagina to become thinned and easily inflamed or infected, and these changes can be associated with vaginal bleeding after intercourse.
 Anatomical lesions, such as tumors or polyps on the cervix or vaginal wall may lead to vaginal bleeding during or after intercourse.
Women who experience vaginal bleeding during or following sexual intercourse should always visit their doctor to determine the cause of the bleeding.
Many women have some amount of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. Some studies show that up to 30% of pregnant women will experience some degree of vaginal bleeding while they are pregnant. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is more common with twins and other multiple gestations than with singleton pregnancies (pregnancy with one fetus). Sometimes woman experience a very scant amount of bleeding in the first two weeks of pregnancy, usually around the time of the expected menstrual period. This slight bleeding is sometimes referred to as “Implantation bleeding.” Doctors do not know for certain what causes this bleeding, but it may occur as a result of the fertilized egg implanting in the uterine wall.
The amount of bleeding, the stage of pregnancy, and any associated symptoms can all help determine the cause of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy. While vaginal bleeding in pregnancy does not signify a problem with the pregnancy, women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should always be evaluated by a doctor.
Causes of bleeding in pregnancy include MISCARRIAGE, an abnormal location of the planceta, ectopic pregnancy, cervical infection or polyp and premature labor. Chronic medical conditions and medication use can also be related to vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.

“You’re on fire, Kevin… these girls think you’re a babe, Kevin” a supportive heckler calls out as Kevin Morby and his band dip into the the gradual build-up of “Singing Saw”.
Bolo-ties, blazers and safari attire played its part, but it was the musical performances that grabbed you by the horns. Big Thief began the night with stellar musicianship consisting of Adrianne Lenker’s slow, haunting melodic estrogen— her dominant vocals cut through the music like butter, demanding your attention— and lead-guitarist, Buck Meek’s earth worm maneuvering casted a spell upon the crowded Casbah. Their 90’s fuzzy-grunge essence paralleled a Mazzy Star, which charmed right into Kevin Morby’s crispy folk-rock. Morby’s latest album has picked up quite a bit of steam with flourishing feed-back, which brought in new curiosity, as the frontman himself admitted he had not played in front of so many people in San Diego. The songs were played to perfection, nobody on stage doing too much, even lead-guitarist Meg Duffy’s shredding was like porridge; tasteful and just right. Mr. Morby and co. mentioned being a little worn-out from the extensive tour, but that didn’t seem apparent as more shout-outs of pleasure spilled from crowd, “You’re insane right now, Kevin… you’re the man, Kevin”. Comments like these added comic relief to the downtime, allowing a sense of innocence to set in.
From Kevin Morby’s calm solo rendition of Townes Van Zandt’s “No Place to Fall” to the dancing bass and guitar groove that put hair in your beard in “I Have Been to the Mountain”, the Texas native spewed variety. Big Thief’s ghostly demeanor added to the ambiance as well, offering a nice night cap to a long summer week.

The final cause, end, or design of men (who naturally love liberty, and dominion over others) in the introduction of that restraint upon themselves, in which we see them live in Commonwealths, is the foresight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life thereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable condition of war which is necessarily consequent, as hath been shown, to the natural passions of men when there is no visible power to keep them in awe, and tie them by fear of punishment to the performance of their covenants, and observation of those laws of nature set down in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters.
For the laws of nature, as justice, equity, modesty, mercy, and, in sum, doing to others as we would be done to, of themselves, without the terror of some power to cause them to be observed, are contrary to our natural passions, that carry us to partiality, pride, revenge, and the like. And covenants, without the sword, are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all. Therefore, notwithstanding the laws of nature (which every one hath then kept, when he has the will to keep them, when he can do it safely), if there be no power erected, or not great enough for our security, every man will and may lawfully rely on his own strength and art for caution against all other men. And in all places, where men have lived by small families, to rob and spoil one another has been a trade, and so far from being reputed against the law of nature that the greater spoils they gained, the greater was their honour; and men observed no other laws therein but the laws of honour; that is, to abstain from cruelty, leaving to men their lives and instruments of husbandry. And as small families did then; so now do cities and kingdoms, which are but greater families (for their own security), enlarge their dominions upon all pretences of danger, and fear of invasion, or assistance that may be given to invaders; endeavour as much as they can to subdue or weaken their neighbours by open force, and secret arts, for want of other caution, justly; and are remembered for it in after ages with honour.
Nor is it the joining together of a small number of men that gives them this security; because in small numbers, small additions on the one side or the other make the advantage of strength so great as is sufficient to carry the victory, and therefore gives encouragement to an invasion. The multitude sufficient to confide in for our security is not determined by any certain number, but by comparison with the enemy we fear; and is then sufficient when the odds of the enemy is not of so visible and conspicuous moment to determine the event of war, as to move him to attempt.
And be there never so great a multitude; yet if their actions be directed according to their particular judgements, and particular appetites, they can expect thereby no defence, nor protection, neither against a common enemy, nor against the injuries of one another. For being distracted in opinions concerning the best use and application of their strength, they do not help, but hinder one another, and reduce their strength by mutual opposition to nothing: whereby they are easily, not only subdued by a very few that agree together, but also, when there is no common enemy, they make war upon each other for their particular interests. For if we could suppose a great multitude of men to consent in the observation of justice, and other laws of nature, without a common power to keep them all in awe, we might as well suppose all mankind to do the same; and then there neither would be, nor need to be, any civil government or Commonwealth at all, because there would be peace without subjection.
Nor is it enough for the security, which men desire should last all the time of their life, that they be governed and directed by one judgement for a limited time; as in one battle, or one war. For though they obtain a victory by their unanimous endeavour against a foreign enemy, yet afterwards, when either they have no common enemy, or he that by one part is held for an enemy is by another part held for a friend, they must needs by the difference of their interests dissolve, and fall again into a war amongst themselves.
It is true that certain living creatures, as bees and ants, live sociably one with another (which are therefore by Aristotle numbered amongst political creatures), and yet have no other direction than their particular judgements and appetites; nor speech, whereby one of them can signify to another what he thinks expedient for the common benefit: and therefore some man may perhaps desire to know why mankind cannot do the same. To which I answer,
First, that men are continually in competition for honour and dignity, which these creatures are not; and consequently amongst men there ariseth on that ground, envy, and hatred, and finally war; but amongst these not so.
Secondly, that amongst these creatures the common good differeth not from the private; and being by nature inclined to their private, they procure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose joy consisteth in comparing himself with other men, can relish nothing but what is eminent.
Thirdly, that these creatures, having not, as man, the use of reason, do not see, nor think they see, any fault in the administration of their common business: whereas amongst men there are very many that think themselves wiser and abler to govern the public better than the rest, and these strive to reform and innovate, one this way, another that way; and thereby bring it into distraction and civil war.
Fourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice in making known to one another their desires and other affections, yet they want that art of words by which some men can represent to others that which is good in the likeness of evil; and evil, in the likeness of good; and augment or diminish the apparent greatness of good and evil, discontenting men and troubling their peace at their pleasure.
Fifthly, irrational creatures cannot distinguish between injury and damage; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended with their fellows: whereas man is then most troublesome when he is most at ease; for then it is that he loves to show his wisdom, and control the actions of them that govern the Commonwealth.
Lastly, the agreement of these creatures is natural; that of men is by covenant only, which is artificial: and therefore it is no wonder if there be somewhat else required, besides covenant, to make their agreement constant and lasting; which is a common power to keep them in awe and to direct their actions to the common benefit.
The only way to erect such a common power, as may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them in such sort as that by their own industry and by the fruits of the earth they may nourish themselves and live contentedly, is to confer all their power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one will: which is as much as to say, to appoint one man, or assembly of men, to bear their person; and every one to own and acknowledge himself to be author of whatsoever he that so beareth their person shall act, or cause to be acted, in those things which concern the common peace and safety; and therein to submit their wills, every one to his will, and their judgements to his judgement. This is more than consent, or concord; it is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner. This done, the multitude so united in one person is called a COMMONWEALTH; in Latin, CIVITAS. This is the generation of that great LEVIATHAN, or rather, to speak more reverently, of that mortal god to which we owe, under the immortal God, our peace and defence. For by this authority, given him by every particular man in the Commonwealth, he hath the use of so much power and strength conferred on him that, by terror thereof, he is enabled to form the wills of them all, to peace at home, and mutual aid against their enemies abroad. And in him consisteth the essence of the Commonwealth; which, to define it, is: one person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual covenants one with another, have made themselves every one the author, to the end he may use the strength and means of them all as he shall think expedient for their peace and common defence.
And he that carryeth this person is called sovereign, and said to have sovereign power; and every one besides, his subject.
The attaining to this sovereign power is by two ways. One, by natural force: as when a man maketh his children to submit themselves, and their children, to his government, as being able to destroy them if they refuse; or by war subdueth his enemies to his will, giving them their lives on that condition. The other, is when men agree amongst themselves to submit to some man, or assembly of men, voluntarily, on confidence to be protected by him against all others. This latter may be called a political Commonwealth, or Commonwealth by Institution; and the former, a Commonwealth by acquisition.

This is something I've seen a lot and have commented on as well.  Zooming in can make content get smaller as other regions of the page expand in fluid design.
The wheel of the mouse can be taken over so control+wheel no longer scrolls but does some other action.  While this can be worked around with the keyboard this seems problematic.

Things like that should really be tested for. Text on bitmap graphics is often problematic anyway but making the image show in a hover that doesn't respond to standard Ctrl-+ as expected is really bad.
My restoration work can go in degrees. I can take liberties with reality or try to stick with the original intent as much as possible.
A friend of mine let me restore and old photo of her father (on the far right). And yes that is Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos. My friend was very happy with this but I really don’t like how the shirt looks on the man in the foreground. I will get better at this.
This week I haven’t been working, so I decided to work on a little photo restoration. This is my maternal grandmother as a young woman in 1926. This is at 135 Indian Church Road, the home of her adoptive parents. Her birth name was Bryan, but she was adopted by the Stumpffs before she was five. I love the purse she is holding. She looks quite fashionable for the day. My uncle tells me she was raised in a polite upper middle class home, well cared for, with nice clothes and piano lessons. She reunited with her birth parents after she was married.
There were stains that I removed and played with the contrast. Actually I jacked the contrast, but I like the effect. The image was tilted so I decided to straighten it. I added the deckled frame. If I could I would add the frame to every image. I love deckled edges. The before and after is here so you can see the changes.
I was able to go to Photoshop World in 2010. It takes place in Las Vegas. Since I have never been there before, I enjoyed playing the tourist. I spent part of my time snapping random photos. In front of the MGM Grand Hotel is a big golden lion. Of course I couldn’t resist photographing it. When I got home I could help but to notice that there were a thousand distracting elements in the photo. Ah… but what a great photo to practice content aware on.

At HealthPointe Veterinary Clinic, we believe in the importance of spaying and neutering puppies and kittens to provide them with a long and healthy life.
A pyometra, or uterine infection, is a potentially life-threatening condition which can cost thousands of dollars to treat. Occurrence is 100% preventable if your pet is spayed.
Over one half of all mammary tumors are malignant and can spread to other areas of the body. Early spaying, prior to your pet beginning its heat cycles, significantly reduces the incidence of tumor formation.
There are more puppies and kittens overpopulating shelters than there are people willing to provide them with love and care. Sadly, many are euthanized.
Testicular cancer can be eliminated and prostatitis, an infection causing malignant or benign swelling of the prostate, can be greatly reduced with early neutering.
Unwanted behavioral problems such as dominance aggression, marking territory and wandering can be avoided with early spaying/neutering.

The Light Elf Coshwood walked briskly. The corridor was long and narrow, and poorly lit. There was a steely determination on his face and he was clearly lost in thought. There was a small noise behind him and he froze instantly. He seemed suddenly aware of his surroundings and suddenly aware of the darkness. His eyes scanned the void of black in front of him, and then moved to check over his shoulder, his head twisting only a few inches. He also became aware that he had not brought any weapons, and his shield was not on his arm either.
He took a deep breath, then instantly illuminated the corridor with a Flash of light. Almost as quickly as it appeared, the light was consumed by darkness. But Flash had seen enough. There was nobody there. He continued along the corridor.
Eventually, the exit appeared out of the gloom. A High Elf stood waiting outside a wooden door which looked slightly too big for the hallway. The Elf smiled when he saw Flash approaching and when the Coshwood extended a hand, he instead bowed.
“Yes, my Lord. And what should I call you? Your letter was… Well, not very specific. I can hardly call you ‘The Coshwood of Light’, can I?”
The High Elf made a small noise, and turned around to face the door. Flash heard the him mutter a few words, before a hearing a bolt slide across the door from the other side. This was followed by the jangle of keys, and a satisfying clicking sound as the lock was released.
“Here we are” Tebastian beamed. He tried to push the door open, but the frame was jammed. He leant on it, gave it a quick barge with his shoulder and eventually forced it open, causing a small amount of wood to splinter and sprinkle onto the floor. Flash noticed a fresh coating of dust on the floor.
Tebastian stepped through first, and waved his hand over an orb on the wall, which lit up quickly and allowed both elves to survey the room. They were in a library, of sorts. The shelves were stacked haphazardly with scrolls and ancient tomes, all of which seemed to have been stuffed in. There were scribbled labels peeling off the walls, and in the centre of the room there were three desks, each with an oil lamp stationed to them. Everything was covered in dust and cobwebs.
“Wh… When was the last time you… Anyone came in here?” Flash asked with curiosity, before springing into action and riffling through papers. He located one and brought it over to the desk, before blowing the dust off it and lighting the lamp.
“We haven’t really had anyone needed to… benefit from our facilities in… years, actually.” Tebastian said. “And even though we have a very, very high standard of customers, I don’t think we’ve ever had any royalty before…” He looked carefully at Flash’s face to gauge his reaction. The Light Elf didn’t look up from his papers.
There was quite a long pause. Flash continued reading intently, although he was always aware of Tebastian standing over him. Occasionally the Light Elf would replace papers and retrieve new ones, books and scrolls. Eventually, Tebastian excused himself to prepare some drinks, and Flash thought that he might just get some time to himself, but the High Elf returned almost instantaneously with two full goblets.
Tebastian raised a toast, and Flash clinked goblets with him, unnoticeably pouring a little of the amber liquid into Tebastian’s cup. The Light Elf raised the Goblet to his lips, but paused for long enough to check that Tebastian drunk his, and no “unknown side-effects” cropped up. Once he was sure it was safe, Flash took a sip. Although technically not poison, the drink was certainly alcoholic. Very alcoholic.
“Well, I was… I was dead for a long time… A very long time.” He replied. “I just want to fill in some of the blanks. And… there are a lot of blanks…” Tebastian made a sound which Flash took as a confused chuckle.
“But surely Era… Your brother has these facilities?” He said. Flash looked up, but didn’t respond. He went back to pouring over the tome that was open in front of him. He absent-mindedly took another sip of his drink. Then he read something which made him frown. He lifted his head, and then jumped up, quickly and ran over to one of the book shelves.
“F… Fountain of Youth… Felines… ah, here we are. Fort Drake…” He muttered to himself, before removing a scroll. He brought it over to the table, tingling with apprehension. Tebastian, meanwhile, had been reading a letter that had appeared out of nowhere.
“They’re doing what?” He looked up a Flash. “Excuse me a moment.” He then hurried out of the room, but Flash took no notice. He was reading intently. He finished the scroll, and looked up slowly, a look of fear and confusion on his face.
He looked over his shoulder and saw that Tebastian had gone. Quickly he packed up the loose papers and scrolls and shoved them into an open book, which he stuffed onto a shelf. He then walked slowly back to the desk, lost in thought…
Garathon was a kind of bodyguard, although he had thought to himself many times that Flash would probably be more effective in a combat situation. He had watched the Coshwood’s training at the hands of the King’s finest, and seen him flourish from an amateur to a swordsman. He also knew too well of Flash’s skill with magic. There was also the fact that most of the cities criminals were too frightened to come within ten paces of the Elf for fear of being ripped to pieces by his brothers. This essentially made Garathon’s job a formality.
But he did not resent this. In fact, the fact that his job was quite simple was a blessing. Ever since the Light Elf’s return to life, Garathon was charged with keeping him safe in the Heartlands. He had also worked with a lot of High elves, and they had been, well, a lot less friendly. Although initially taken aback by Flash’s almost child-like enthusiasm and curiosity, he had soon grown accustomed to it, and even considered the Elf a friend.
It was as the Light Elf walked over to him that he realised that this was not the same Flash that had emerged from the Hopewastes some months earlier. There were dark circles under his eyes, and after the week he spent with the Heroes fighting glooms, he returned with a prominent scar on his face, etched down both cheeks and curling under his chin. Now that Garathon thought about it, it was that week that changed Flash most. Although his cheeky, heart-warming grin still frequented his face, it was not plastered permanently to it anymore. He was also often lost in deep, considered thought. And he had aged. In the last few months Flash had aged several years. He looked older and wiser, but he had also lost something, Garathon thought.
“… Yes. I think so,” said Flash. He glanced at a piece of paper in his hand, which was slightly crumpled and burnt at the edges.
It was hastily written and the ink was blotchy in places. Flash folded it up and placed it into a pouch on his belt. They began to walk through the streets. The Light Elf had a troubled expression and was deep in thought. Very deep.
“Remind me that I need to learn how to teleport when we get back would you?” Flash said, eventually.
“It is now. Officially.” Garathon smiled inwardly. Whatever was troubling the Light Elf, it wasn’t troubling enough to stop Flash being Flash.
“Again, that’s not really how it works. Normally, people just talk. I’ll start us off: How has your day been, Garathon?”
Tebastian knelt in front of a figure bathed in shadow. The High Elf appeared to be kneeling out of respect, but in reality he was bleeding. The hand that seemed to be clasped to his chest in a salute was actually keeping pressure on a stab wound. The figure pushed Tebastian backwards with a vicious kick. The blade of a sword emerged from the shadow into the light.
They were in a bare room, somewhere in the Heartlands. There was no light in the room except that which was streaming in through the window, which was nearly entirely covered in wood. Barricaded. The blade hovered above the High Elf’s chest.
“What was he doing?” The figure spoke not with the calm ferocity of the villains Tebastian had heard about. It spoke with a primal anger. A deep growl, a growl which echoed around the room and struck fear into Tebastian’s heart. This creature, whatever it was, was a killer. Not just something which killed for a living, which only killed when killing was the only option, but a killer. A murderer. Tebastian knew that he would not survive. Once the information had been extracted from him, this monster would tear him apart. And the creature would enjoy it.
“We respect our clients’ confidentiality,” the Elf managed to say. The sword withdrew for a second, before plunging back into Tebastian’s shoulder. With a sharp upward jerk, the Elf found himself suspended above the floor, screaming in pain.
A piece of paper appeared in front of Flash and Garathon with a pronounced pop. Flash caught it as it floated towards the floor. He read it, frowned, and then read it again.
Everything’s fine, but could you Leave the keys outside the abandoned house on the outskirts of town Please? This would be Most convEnient for my staff.

So I was reading Oprah Magazine, which I love and found some great excerpts from an article about Decisions by Martha Beck.
Martha writes about Claire and her intention to have the perfect man, home, and career and said “I can’t commit to the wrong thing!” Martha then shares that Claire’s life was devoted to obsessively avoiding something economists call ‘opportunity cost’. Whenever we choose one course of action, we rule others out. Giving up those other options is the opportunity cost of any decision. Claire couldn’t bear the thought of losing any opportunity by making a clear choice. She was an opportunity miser.
Just as money misers hoard their wealth, living as if they were poor even when they’re rich, opportunity misers hoard their freedom to choose — and end up becoming prisoners of indecision.
I see this happen so often when people are evaluating getting started with us. Thankfully not as often as people who see what there is to offer and just get started. But it does come up. And if you look deeper into that person’s life, it shows up all over.
Some people are so afraid to make this truly simple decision that they miss out on something great. “What if?”, they say. “What if it doesn’t work out?” And I say, “What if?” “What if it’s the absolute greatest decision for your life?”
Andy Andrews said “We don’t always have the ability to make right decisions, but we do have the ability to make our decisions right.” So just do it. If you see the opportunity and it all looks good – move. It’s tortuous otherwise. You can start and always quit if that’s what you decide, but at least you’ll know and won’t always wonder “What if?
Another great passage from Martha Beck’s article: People who trust their gut over their brain often take flying leaps with little information — risky, but at least they get somewhere. Folks with no faith in either their intellect or their instincts generally follow the path of least resistance; again, not an optimal strategy, but not paralyzing, either. Great strategists trust both intellect and instinct; they gather information until they feel they can make a good decision. But people who try to decide with the mind alone, who place no faith in their heart’s desires, are doomed to stall and fuss, compare and contrast, forever insisting that just a little more knowledge will make the choice clear. It won’t.
Eventually, people who practice this talk themselves out of even the best situations. What you have to ask yourself is, “are the people who are offering this to me having success and do I trust them?” If so, move…. take action.
More from Martha: Check in with yourself: Does your life feel meaningful and on-purpose at this moment? If the answer is yes, your energy is invested in living your best life. But to the extent that you feel misery, your energy is asking to be reinvested. Misery literally means “the feeling of being a miser.” If you’re miserable, stop harding your life energy. Spend it now! Make a choice, any choice. If you’re still miserable, you can choose again. Eventually, you’ll see that all misery is simply life asking you to trade your current course of action–or inaction–for something purposeful and true.
From Faust, “Seize this very minute. What you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.” This doesn’t mean you’ll never misstep. It means that when you trade indecision for choice, you’ll be rewarded with either success or education. Guaranteed.
You have the opportunity to discover that for yourself. Feed your mind, but feel your heart. Trust in your truth. It will be the best investment you ever make.
You and Kevin always have great insights. I never miss an opportunity to listen to or read what your have to say. I run in to many people that just can’t seem to make a decision, no matter how much information they have.
GREAT post, and so true…the answers we seek are always inside of us, if we would just take the time to listen and trust our gut as we evaluate with our mind. Love the layout and look of your blog as well, thanks for sharing!
Outstanding post on how to make powerful decisions. Paralysis by analysis is a big one for many wanting to get involved with our profession and unfortunately keeps them stuck. So agree that it’s best to take risks as long as you’ve gathered information and are trusting your gut because any action is better than none or better than being miserable. So happy we made the decision to step out in faith and go for our dreams of being entrepreneurs. Yes, there have been many lessons along the way,but wouldn’t trade it for anything! Just DO IT! 😉 Thank you for sharing such value to help others! You guys are awesome and we appreciate your leadership!

“Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.”
The planning application for Phase 2 of the Imperial West development was approved by Hammersmith & Fulham Council on July 25th 2012. Details of the application remain at this link:
We are now concentrating our efforts on Boris Johnson, Mayor of London. The Borough Council’s decision remains subject to ‘no contrary direction’ by Boris Johnson, who has the power to intervene and to require to proposals to be changed.
To make your views known to the GLA and the Mayor of London, please email any or all of the following:
You can also give your views to Dame Eliza Manningham Buller, chairman of the Imperial College council (c/o John Anderson, Chief Executive of the College Fund) at j.anderson@imperial.ac.uk
The overall scale, massing, and heights of the development are wholly/entirely inappropriate to the site, given its close proximity to a low-rise Conservation Area.
There is no evidence of any public support for a ‘cluster’ of towers, or even a single ‘landmark’ tower in this part of London. This is a concept devised by developers for their own commercial ends.
The land and skyline to the west of Wood Lane is currently free from very tall buildings. Approval to a first tall tower will set a precedent for others, ruining the views of this part of London.
The cumulative impact of this and other proposed developments along Wood Lane has not been adequately assessed. Whatever traffic studies may say, the reality is that Wood Lane, and the junction with North Pole Road are already very heavily congested by those visiting Westfield. Public transport is also under pressure.
The application should be halted until a proper strategic plan for the White City area is consulted on and finalised (consultation is not due to start until late September 2012).
The Imperial College buildings are to be financed by a residential tower (with no element of affordable housing other than for Imperial staff). This will contribute little to the area’s housing needs. There is a real risk of such apartments being sold to offshore buyers and standing vacant or under-occupied while existing local residents suffer the consequences of an ill-conceived project.
More information on the discussions held within the Imperial College Council, at the early stages of these proposals, are available under Imperial College. These pages include information on how the development is being financed. These minutes of College Council meetings make clear the extent to which the proposals are commercially driven.
Once again the councils decision to approve a development of this scale is completely unsympathetic to wishes of the local residents. Expanding in height means a blatant milking of this land by selling £400+ rabbit huts to offshore buyers thus out pricing poor people further out of London. Furthermore, Westfields plans to create this commercial/residential sarcophagus to the north of Ariel Way will only add to the ballardian vision of decay in which our future generations will be wallowing in. Let’s stop this before it’s too late.
The disappointing aspect of Imperial college’s planning application is, that despite numerous meetings with Imperial and them apparently listening to our concerns, the final plans are worse (taller tower, bigger “wall” of buildings) then initially proposed by Imperial. Sadly Imperial’s plans would set a precedent allowing for tall buildings and towers to be built along the Westway in any spot a developer could find to squeeze one in.
These proposals are utterly insensitive to the residential environment that has been stable for a century in this part of west London. Commercial gain should not be the criterion by which our society lives.
What should happen to a coil's resistance as it gets hot? Should it increase, decrease or stay the same? Also, a 6 volt coil should have a resistance around 1.5 ohms and a 12 volt coil around 3 ohms, is this correct?
1.2 and 1.5 for non internally ballasted aprox. depending on primary windings? There are different specs.
Resistance might increase slightly as coil warms never tested myself? You would need to have a very high quality meter to notice if things are good. Coils do fail at temp. due to internal connections.
My car runs okay for about 15-20 minutes (after choke off) until it really warms up, then it misses and sputters at lower revs, and gets worse the longer it runs. I thought it may be the coil but I want to make sure I get the correct 6 volt coil for my ballasted ignition.
2 things. What year and model car are we talking about thats running 6V? Could you toss a first name out for yourself.
The 2 originals as known are HA12 early and 15C6. Most have been replaced by many variations made for the car? Internally ballasted or external. Sports coils, super coils etc.
Fuel starvation problem?? Open the gas tank cap and try. Your vent system may be faulty. Vaccum builds in tank.
Your carbs have a bowl drain. May screw out or wiggle out under each. Drain in a clean glass jar. The ones your wife uses for preserves are great unless you get caught. Look for any junk.
Replace your fuel filter. If your tank is full of scum or rust particles the filter will clog in a very short time.
Vacuum leak. If the car is EGR equipped . You likely have a thermal vac. valve. in the emissions system. Could be on the rad hose whatever since I don't know car or year. From your description thats the place to start. The device opens only when engine is warm.
Sounds as if when engine comes to running temp. and TVR opens you have a Vaccum fault to atmosphere. Usually consistant time frame. Bad hose or EGR. Easy to test just block them.
Thanks for all the input. My name's Chris. I have a '76 TR6. The coil it has(had) is a Lucas 15C6. I measured the resistance in the car as 4.4 ohms, I read somewhere it should be around 1.3 (later out of the car it measured at 1.9!?).
I bought a coil from a local parts store that said "do not use with external balast" I asked the guy if it was a 6 volt coil and he didn't know (their book listed the same coil for 69-76). Its made by Niehof. It resistance was 3.3 ohms. The car ran the same (poorly). I jumped the resister wire to give it 12 volts and the car still ran poorly. After the car was hot the resistance on this coil was 11 ohms.
I feel strongly it's something on the ignition side; however, everything (except the coil) has been replaced or checks out fine.
Nice to meet you. Daughter is home for summer attends U/Vic for last 3 years. Brought home husband to be for summer also attends U/Vic but resident of Pender Island BC. Now that we have covered reasons for tearing hair out :)
The coil should be for a 12 volt system. Coils are really simple just HV spark providers. Your 76 has an external ballast wire. You get 12+ on ignition and about 8.5 at run. I don't think using it with the external ballast should harm it but I can't be positive. The output of spark would of course drop with both in line at run?
Do not rule out a bad part from your parts store. If they are any good they should replace for free. Thats the way the system works.
Hook up new coil to full 12 volts ignition run. Bypass resistor wire. Replace the little wire to distributor if not done. Can cause problems.
From experience a coil will either work or not. They do get old but don't usually cause your problem.
Have you removed the plugs after a period of bad run. You want to look for any plug fouled or a different color from nice even grey brown?
I am still betting on fuel problems or a vaccum leak. Try the carb cleaner sprayed around manifold when the problem occurs.
I will try a new fuel filter, check for vacuum leaks again and check the carbon canister to see if too much air is coming that way.
Chris, Sorry to hear about your problem. Are you going to attend The car show this weekend At the Van Dussen Gardens?
I'll jump in here, my 75 had an intemittant problem with the engine quitting without notice, only to start a couple hours later. It finally happen once for all and I was stranded 100km from home. The problem was a dying resistor wire and when it fully burned out I needed a tow back.
Best modification that I did was to by-pass that terrible resistor wire burried deep in the wiring harness which will only become a source of problems in the future due to age and heat. I attached a direct voltage wire right from the fuse box, piggy-backed a ballast resistor to the coil and keep a spare one in the glove box. A Ford/Mercury (for pick-up trucks) ballast resistor for years 1959-1969 provides the right Ohms and the mounting makes a very neat job. 5 years later and over 10,000miles it has yet to fail.
Steven, Thanks for the advice. I've already jumped the resistor wire to rule that out. There was no change in how it ran.
Don, I hear the Van Dusen show is a real good one. I've never been to one and again will miss this year's. It's sometimes difficult to go the shows on the mainland (I'm on Van. Island). One year I'll make it though! And I'm not going anywhere until I can fix my car :(
Chris pick up your coil power from the white on the fuse box. Remove the others do not add on. Heres a sight with actual wiring for each car. Go to bottom of page TR wiring.
I went through this with someone else awhile ago. A coil can also be a resistive ground? Due to the windings a faulty coil wiring coating can cause problems as they warm up. What you suspected with HV coil. HV is not down in hot exhaust area though?
Looking at wiring diagram. It may be your starter solenoid coil connection White/yellow bleeding current to ground if you just added on testing to that circuit? Doing the above should bypass that?
When I jumped the resistor wire I disconected all other power wires to the coil and attached a full 12 volts from a white wire at the fuse block.
I have finally procured a proper coil that requires an external resister. I will let you know how that goes when I get a few minutes to pop it in and try it.
Well, I got a new coil. Didn't change much. But on the test drive a noticed the choke nob would always come out a few millimeters and cause a slight fast idle. Since pulling the nob out while running made the car run worse, I decided to hold the nob all the way in while driving.
The voltage at the resistor coil end of the resistor wire Pink/white should be 6.5V aprox.? That # is not written in stone!! I have seen 8.5 and just below 6. When the cars ignition switch is in the run position. That wire is bonded in to the white wire system from ignition. After 27 years who knows what it will be now but it should not go up. Heat usually increases resistance.
The white yellow wire should have full battery voltage 12+ hopefully at ignition starter turning only.
Shut the car off and then turn ign. to run read that coil end voltage. You should only have resistive wire at that point? somewhere around 6v?
If those 2 wires are still connected together at coil seperate them however is best for you so you can remove the white/Yellow while running. And check voltage.
Restart the car if the coil input goes high right away or stays high remove the white yellow while running and check. If the voltage dropped back you have a starter solenoid problem maybe ignition switch?
If it stays high white/yellow off its coming through resistive wire. My bet would be wire covers have somewhat melted together due to heat from resistor wire over time? Heat will build in wire and then shorting to next wire in harness you have 12 volts as the car and resistive wire warms up?
If the current is bleeding through from another source within the harness, the only solution is an external resistor.
I fixed my choke and the car runs so much better but still will miss after about 30 minutes running.
Maybe this resistor wire thing is the culprit. I may also try to advance the timing a couple of degrees and see what happens.

Here is how it all came about. I was chatting with Doug Blumer of Gamut Productions. We are both long time fans of Dennis McMurrin, and we both bemoaned the fact that there are no acceptable videos available of him performing.

This seemingly innocuous question is just one of the carefully crafted subtleties in the strategic plan that rocketed Sleep America into the largest mattress retailer in Arizona.
“We weren’t selling mattresses; we were helping customers improve their quality of life through sleep,” explains Len Gaby ’67, MBA ’71. Beginning with one location in a strip mall in Phoenix, Len and his wife, Debbie, realized their dream of dominating the mattress retail market in the state in less than nine years.
The company flourished with Len and Debbie each bringing unique talents to the table. A realtor and designer, Texas native Debbie is energetic and enthusiastic, making her a natural spokesperson for the company. Len was a seasoned retailer yearning to start his own business. Painstaking national research led them to choose the growing community of Phoenix as the place to put down their retail roots. They visited store after store in the state, observing and absorbing the good, the bad and the ugly of the mattress business.
The Gabys recognized early on that branding would be the key to their success because they wouldn’t be selling a low priced commodity. The dynamic couple vowed to change the way mattresses were sold. They chose the name “Sleep America” because it sounded bigger than a one-store company in Arizona—a crucial element to the budding entrepreneurs who planned to expand and one day sell to a larger national organization. The company logo, created by a professional graphic designer, incorporates a friendly man in the moon on one side and a solid dark blue hue on the other. Len is quick to point out that the man in the moon is smiling and facing out, creating an instant connection with the viewer. The shadowed side of the moon intimates sleep through its restful blue tone.
No stone was left unturned, no avenue unresearched in the Gaby’s quest to create the ultimate mattress shopping experience and environment. With tasteful attention to detail, they incorporated the five senses into their store. Upon entering, customers are greeted by a pristine environment, and lulled by soft playing music; scented candles and fragrant florals delight their noses and soft beds await their touch. Admiral blue, a color symbolizing trust and relaxation, adorns the walls. They even offered branded water bottles to thirsty customers seeking oasis from the arid Arizona climate.
Giving back to the community was an integral part of the Gaby’s philosophy. Over the years, the couple gave mattresses away to homeless shelters and supported numerous charitable fund drives and events. In 2004, Len co-founded Sleep America Charities, which provides resources to local organizations in need. Debbie has been honored with several awards and accolades for her volunteer work and community involvement.
Sleep America had grown to 45 stores nationwide in 2009 when the Gabys sold it to Sleep Country Canada. Debbie stayed on as president and still pitches the company in her Texan drawl to the Arizona television and radio market.
Len has retired from the mattress business, but continues to showcase his business and marketing acumen through consulting work. He also has started an automated vending machine DVD rental business with his son, James, called PressPlay Kiosks, which offers new film releases 28 days sooner than their competitor.
The fragile business climate has prompted Len to unearth some sage advice from a somewhat unlikely source, Charles Darwin. Over a century ago the naturalist declared “It is not the strongest or the smartest of the species that survive. But the one that is most adaptable to change."
I've decided it's time to set some goals for myself. I still don't know if I'm moving to North Carolina (I have a "probably, but maybe, but we'll see... probably know by July 1st. Maybe." Nice, right?) This has been going on since February, and I think I've gone insane at least four times over. I don't do well with my life out of my own hands. I suppose I am a control freak, now that I really think it over.
But then, I suppose if I look at how I approach my art, that probably makes sense. I think, if I were to come up with a word or two I want applied to my art I would say they are Striking and Whimsical. (If you create, what words do you want to describe your work?)
Anyway in order to let my control freak fly her little flag (it's rainbow, with swirls and sparkles on it) once again, I am setting some goals and starting something new!
First: I'm going to post a blog post every Monday. So, I won't update this as often as I once thought I would, but Monday seems like a good idea and will be more than I am pulling together now. Hopefully the posts won't be so long winded, but that's also a part of who I am. Believe me, if you knew me in person you would probably carry a roll of duct tape around with you just to get me to stop.
Secondly: I am starting a new exercise that will help me both creatively and technically. I am going to do a "sketch a day". This is different to when I tried to do my Daily Art, which quickly turned into a time consuming obsessive project because I wanted to make it perfect. Suddenly, what should have taken maybe an hour was taking six, and that just wasn't acceptable. I quit that shortly after I started it. *cringe*
SO! I am going to be doing a sketch a day, but I am going to be using my iPad to do it. I have played around with the idea of digital art for a while, but again I went to the obsessive side of things and then had to set it down because it started looking like I was trying to launch another art career - and I hadn't even started anything. *head*desk*
However, I realized that I have my iPad and a really cool pressure sensitive stylus, and some good art programs. I have figured out a way to let myself play by doing illustration rather than painting or creating a whole piece. Literally, more of a daily sketch, but digital. AND with a set character in mind!
Now, he was supposed to be a dragon. However, the more I look at him, the more I see a Griffin. So, what about a cute little griffin? Maybe with a bunny friend (the bunny is gonna be there, I'm telling you. Also, a duckling... I can see it!)
I settled on the griffon, and started in on trying to learn the digital program on my ipad (I have ArtRage, but I also have ArtStudio. I think I like ArtStudio better at this point. It lets me smear stuff. I bet you can do that on ArtRage too, but I haven't figured out how.) My plan is to actually read through the manual and some of the tutorials, and in the meantime start creating a daily illustration and sharing them on my Facebook Page - Starting today, if I can make it happen! I spent a good portion of the morning drawing a bunny before I went this direction.
So those are my goals I'm putting into place, along with working on my other "deeper" paintings (like my queen of hearts.) I'm hoping it'll be like exercise; get me better in shape to complete the things I really want to do! I'll share my drawings on my Monday posts, too.
This is the cake I made. It's chocolate inside too. SOOOO good! Except for the KitKats. Turns out, I hate KitKats.
And I started working on another Whimsical Misfit, as well as another on an ultra smooth board - I'm having problems with that. it has NO tooth at all, and I'm not sure how to work with it. I thought I wanted no tooth, but now I'm realizing I need some of it. Maybe just a tiny bit. Eeek! All the paint just slides off this thing!
And that's where I am at. Next post will be coming on Monday, because I will MAKE it happen. Oh, yes I will!
Whether you decide your little hatchling is a dragon or a Griffin, I will always think that it's adorable.
That birthday cake looks incredible. I can't say as I hate Kit Kat bars as I believe I've only had one (came in my daughter's bag of Halloween treats - shh don't tell her), guess it didn't impress me as I never bothered to buy any. I'm sure the cake would have been splendid with Hershey's milk chocolate bars instead. Can't go wrong with Hershey's . . . if they're good enough for making S'mores, they're good enough for just about anything. :D
Oh my gosh Kyra, you are so talented and you have a cute bunny! I love the griffon, the Queen is coming along absolutely awesome AND you can create a cake that looks like a decoration. I wouldn't even know it was edible until I read it was a cake.
Let us know how the "Setting Goals" works out. I will look forward to you arriving in my inbox next Monday! You are definitely an inspiration to me. Hugs, Rasz
I've been following your digital art on FB and cannot get over how quickly you've learned to achieve those image! I always knew you'd be good at it but really, this is exciting - can't wait to see what level you take this to!
You've got a lot going on, as always ;o) LOL! Good for you setting goals ;o) I know you will do it ;o) You made that cake? Wow, are you a bakery too? That cake looks stunning, as well as looking so yummy ;o) You don't like kit cats? You are crazy! LOL! Happy Birthday to your daughter ;o) You art is coming along so beautifully ;o) They sure are striking and whimsical ;o) I know one word for me would be magical, for my art. And, I don't know how to say it, but I want people to feel something ;o)

Are you worried about controlling pest infestations in your home? Learn tips for working with professional pest control specialists.
Hi there, I'm Margery. Welcome to my site about pest control. Cockroaches, house centipedes and ants all make home life a true disaster upon entering the living space. These creatures can crawl through the food and appear above people trying to sleep in their beds. Many people dislike even thinking about the possibility of pests crawling through the walls or under the floors. I will use this site to talk about how professional pest exterminators control the population of these creatures. I hope you can use the information on my site to keep your home pest-free as well. Thanks for visiting.
Ants are one type of pest that can do far more than ruin a picnic. Not only do ants get into your food, but they can also cause painful bites that are a serious issue for people with allergies. Unfortunately, ant problems tend to escalate, as these insects tend to also move indoors. For this reason, you must prioritize ant control by using these strategies to eliminate an infestation:
The discovery of ants in your house means that an outdoor infestation has begun to spread. While you can exterminate the ones inside, you can expect more to arrive if you do not close off their entrances. Follow the trail back to where it came from. Often, you will find that a window, door or wall needs to be sealed. Repair any small holes or cracks around your house to stop the ants from coming inside. This is also an effective method of pest control that stops other critters from getting indoors.
Ants tend to invade properties out of the need for food and water. Check both indoors and outdoors for potential attractants and take steps to clean them up. For instance, you may need to sweep out food crumbs from your kitchen floor and pantry shelves. Outside, you may need to repair water leaks and put away pet food that the ants are using to stay alive. You should also know that ants leave pheromones that attract other ants to their trail, so clean along any obvious trails with detergent to remove the scent.
People tend to call for an exterminator once they notice pests inside. However, you should be aware that removing ants from outdoor areas is one of the most effective ways to address indoor infestations. Make sure to arrange for professional pest control services at the first sign of ants in your yard. This helps to reduce the ant population so that it is less likely to expand to the inside of your house. Once you have fully addressed the ant problem, make sure to create a pest service schedule that keeps your house ant-free.
There is nothing more frustrating than realizing that an ant problem is beginning to take over every part of your property. While these insects are known for being hard to control, the truth is that taking a multi-step approach reduces their populations. Keep your property pest-free by focusing on maintaining both the outdoor and indoor areas where ants tend to thrive.
This platform is also preferred by most webmasters due to their technical requirements. Most webmasters outsource their e-commerce solutions, and therefore don't need to configure complex database systems on their pay Web sites. UNIX servers also provide a wider degree of flexibility due to their shell environment. Shell environments are interactive, text-based systems that allow webmasters to interact and customize their services in real-time from any computer system worldwide. Unlike NT systems, UNIX is not limited to special remote administration programs. A typical UNIX system can be accessed from any computer connected to Internet without special or expensive software.
But most favored reason that most webmasters choose UNIX platform is because of its uptime. Most UNIX systems with heavy traffic can provide 99 per cent uptime. NT servers with heavy traffic usually cannot make this same claim, unless specially configured. For this reason, average webmasters should select UNIX as their OS.
If you don't know which platform you need, then most likely you do not require NT hosting and you should select one of our UNIX hosting plans. The only time you would need to use NT hosting is when you are using specific NT applications noted above. Microsoft FrontPage may be used on both UNIX and NT platforms as since most hosting firms support Microsoft FrontPage server extensions on both.

There are a number of aspects to heavy self-confidence. One aspect that can undermine confidence can be stress and anxiety.
People who carry excessive stress or anxiety or who become stressed very quickly and easily are unlikely to feel confident during those moments. The person who has ability to remain calm and relaxed will be in a better position to feel more confident. With calmness comes a feeling of being in control and on top of matters. Therefore an important part of foundation of healthy self confidence is being able to remain calm and relaxed in appropriate situations.
Many people look after their physical body but do not give enough thought to mental and emotional relaxation. Self-hypnosis, a process you can drive yourself or experience whilst listening to self-hypnosis cd, can really help. Self-hypnosis helps to release stress and replace it with a sense of calm. A specifically focussed self hypnosis cd, such as for self confidence can then add to specific area of your life that you would like to change or enhance.
Intraperitoneal Hyperthermic Chemotherapy (IPHC) with Mitomycin C after Cytoreductive Surgery for Patients with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis - a long, technical term for modern medicine in fight against cancer.
I had rare opportunity to speak with Dr. Perry Shen of Wake Forest University. As I listened, he explained how this groundbreaking treatment is extending lives of patients suffering from Peritoneal Carcinomatosis. *(Peritoneal membrane surrounds and lubricates surface of organs within abdomen; eg., colon, gallbladder, spleen, ovaries, intestines, liver, etc..) Because Advanced-stage Peritoneal carcinomatosis (cancer) and disseminated peritoneal lymphomas are often resistant to current chemotherapy treatment, medical researchers out of Wake Forest University have engaged in study and treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis since 1991.
Dr. John Spratt first began describing using interdominal heated therapy in 1980, and found that this particular method worked well in conjunction with chemotherapy. By giving chemotherapy interdominally with much higher concentrated heat, (41 degrees Celcius - or around 105 degrees Fahrenheit) through tumor-removal surgery, heated medicine showed an increase in its effectiveness; thus, decreasing tumors. (1. Cytoreductive surgery consists of removal of all gross tumors and involved organs, peritoneum, or tissue deemed technically feasible and safe for patient. Any tumors adherent or invasive to vital structures that could not be removes were cytoreduces using cavitational ultrasonic surgical aspirator.)
Overall survival rates were improved of 109 Patients (with peritoneal carcinomatosis) treated between December 1991 and November 1997. (2. Clinicopathologic factors that independently predicted improved overall survival rates.)
A one-time treatment, IHPC lasts approximately 1-2 hours, but standardly, a 2-hour treatment is utilized by Wake Forest University. Initially, patients are cooled to a core temperature of approximately 34 Degrees C to 35 Degrees C. Once cooled, peritoneal perfusion inflow and outflow catheters are placed peroutaneously into abdominal cavity. With temperature probes acting as moderators, abdomen is gently massaged throughout perfusion to enhance drug distribution to all peritoneal areas. Because tumor tissue is more responsive to heat than normal tissue (due to intrinsic thermosensitivity) IHPC improves chemosensitivity of tumor cells to Mytomycin C(MMC).
With an average life expectancy of 3-6 months after diagnosis of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis, patients are gaining new hope as IHPC treatment is extending life by as much as 15 months; and a few selected patients' lives have even been extended to 28-30 months.
Almost 40 percent of human population will suffer from allergies at some point in their lives. Itchy eyes, stuffy nose, coughing and sneezing are among most common allergy symptoms and they can make any individual feel tired and weak. Many people often wonder if they can avoid allergies by doing things differently in their day-to-day routines. The answer is yes. However, before you change your schedule to avoid allergies you may want to find out cause of your allergy. It is a good idea to determine if it is worth hassle. The following is a list of things which may trigger allergies in your system to act up:
These substances are well-known for causing allergies. Different factors determine levels of these substances on a regular basis. If pollen levels are high, you will be more likely to suffer from allergies. The best way to avoid these substances is to stay indoors and to dust and clean often. If you go outside, make sure you shower or bathe as soon as you return home. This will wash off any unwanted substances like pollen or dust which may be on your clothing or your body.
Regardless of how much you are exposed to pollen or other allergy-triggering substances, you may suffer from allergies purely due to genetics. If two people are in exact same conditions at exact same time, one person may suffer more than other because it is in their blood. You can thank your parents for that and there is nothing you can do to prevent this from happening.
On average, 20 percent of individuals in United States suffer from hayfever. Hayfever is caused by an allergic reaction mainly to different forms of pollen and ragweed. Hayfever has different effects on every individual depending on how severely they suffer from allergies. Some individuals may experience slight discomfort whereas pain can be practically unbearable for others. So how do you know if you have hayfever? The following is a list of categories to consider in order to determine whether or not you are suffering from hayfever:
Hayfever is a seasonal reaction which often starts in early June and continues through to middle of July. Whenever pollen and ragweed season begins (usually near beginning of seasons) is when you are most likely to start experiencing symptoms.
There are many symptoms which may indicate you are suffering from hayfever. The most common symptoms are listed in categories below:
1.Eyes – An individual suffering from hayfever will experience many difficulties with their eyes. Itchy, watery eyes are an indication of hayfever as well as swollen red eyes. The best way to prevent yourself from scratching your eyes is to use Visine or some other form of eye drops. These drops will also reduce redness your eyes may be experiencing.
From philanthropy workshops to glow-in-the-dark yoga, planners are moving to more meaningful ways to interact.

and why did not he take a homosexual as Pope Francis would advise him? African priest suspended for cohabitation A Catholic priest in Benin has been 'notoriously cohabiting' with a woman with whom he has two children
For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information.
The story of Gianni Agnelli, the legendary Italian industrialist and playboy, as told by family, lovers, professional confidants, and rivals.
The cover depicts the colors of the rainbow, the entire spectrum of those who are drawn to Rebbe Nachman's teachings.
The words are from a popular song "Uman, Uman Rosh Hashanah" showing the Breslover Chasid's fervent desire to be in Uman for Rosh HaShanah.
It was his last Rosh HaShanah in this world. He knew it, but no one wanted to believe it. It was too soon ... He wasn't even 40 years old. Normally, he would begin preparing for his Rosh HaShanah talk the first morning of the holiday. He would start speaking late in the afternoon and go on well into the evening of the second day. But this Rosh HaShanah the tuberculosis he had struggled against for nearly three years began to get the upper hand. just as his preparations should have begun, he began coughing up blood. The attack was extremely violent. Night came, and still it continued. Hundreds and hundreds of people were waiting in the synagogue, hoping and praying that he would come to give his lesson. "What can I tell you?" he had said earlier, "nothing is greater than to be with me for Rosh HaShanah."
At last, he came. He was extremely weak. He sat for some time, and then he started in a very low voice. It was against all the laws of nature that he would be able to finish. The crush from the crowd was tremendous. Several people fainted. Still, somehow, he continued. He spoke about the future: how the whole world will be filled with the knowledge of G-d, and all will see that everything is under His Providence, everything is miraculous. The whole of creation will sing a new song of love and kindness... It was his last Rosh HaShanah lesson, his last lesson ever. Near the end of his talk, he stated to everyone there: "No matter from what city you come, my followers should return home and say: "Whoever believes in G-d should come to Rebbe Nachman for Rosh HaShanah"."
Two weeks later he lay in bed, dressed in his best robe. Someone arranged his clothing and washed the blood from his beard. He rolled a ball of wax between his fingers with the utmost delicacy, composing his thoughts. An unusually strong gale ripped through the town of Uman, tearing out rocks from the hillside. The sukkah outside the house blew down. Somewhere else, a fire suddenly broke out. They thought he was gone. Someone cried out, "Rebbe! Rebbe! To whom have you left us?" But he heard, he was still with them. He lifted his head with an expression that said, "I am not leaving you, G-d forbid!"
Soon after that he breathed his last. Some of the people there said they had seen people die peacefully but they'd never seen anything quite like this. There was a great commotion in the room. People began sobbing loudly. The following day, thousands of mourners attended the funeral. Rebbe Nachman was buried, on October 17, 1810, in the place he had chosen: the old cemetery in Uman, amidst the 20,000 Jewish martyrs who had been massacred in the town at the hands of the Haidemacks some forty years earlier.
September 1991. In the space of just a few days, over ten loaded charters have flown into Kiev International Airport from Israel alone. Other groups have flown in via Moscow from Britain, France, Belgium, the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Australia... Still others have taken different routes: by train from Warsaw, in buses from Bucharest... All are converging on... UMAN!
The eve of Rosh HaShanah. No one with even the most elementary grasp of history could fail to be amazed at the sight of hundreds uponhundreds of observantjewishmen walking through the streets of this backward provincial Ukrainian town some three hours drive south of Kiev. The locals stare in amazement. The "Iron Curtain" has crumbled. The focus of everyone's interest is a most unlikely looking spot in the middle of a drab residential area overlooked by some gray high-rise apartment blocks. A few locals hurryby on their way to work or to the market. Children play, oblivious to the significance of the spot. Outside a pair of wooden gates to the yard of what could be any old ivy-covered suburban house, quite a crowd is gathered, with animated conversations taking place in Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French, Russian... A variety of local types try to change currency, peddle trinkets, offer trips in private cars, etc. Two policemen placidly look on.
You move through the crowd into the back yard of the house. It is dense with a throng of souls of every description, buzzing with spiritual energy. Many are in black hats and coats, others in executive suits, some in shirtsleeves, jeans and Reeboks or other garb. There are old and young, down to small boys with long, flowing payos (sidecurls). Every single person present has brought his own history - his own unique story - of what drew him here to Uman for Rosh HaShanah at Rebbe Nachman's gravesite. The crowd is thickest near the grave itself, a simple marble structure next to the outer wall of the house. It is the only remaining sign that this was once a cemetery. The intensity is gripping. Everyone is either praying or reciting psalms or studying or pouring out his heart in his own words - the approach to G-d that Rebbe Nachman favored the most. It is impossible to remain unmoved.
Dozens of apartments have been rented in nearby buildings to house the visitors. Down the road from the gravesite, less than two hundred and fifty yards away, stands a large factory that has been made over to house the Breslover Chassidim for Rosh HaShanah. Only five years before the whole idea would have been unthinkable! In Soviet Russia? A huge production hall has been converted into a synagogue accommodating over two thousand daveners. Other halls have been turned into dormitories full of army bunk beds. In the kitchen area, a team of plastic aproned chassidim busily prepares plentiful quantities of kosher food specially flown in from Israel, including challahs, fish, salads, soup, chicken... even the Rosh HaShanah specialties, the simonim - apple and honey, pomegranate, beetroot, black-eye beans, etc. The pride of the site is a tiled, heated mikveh, built in the space of a few days by local workmen.
6.00 p.m. The golden afternoon sun fades away and dusk descends. The preparations for Yom Tov are complete. Many are dressed in their kitels - the traditional white robe. The synagogue is packed to overflowing. At last the moment has arrived. The chazzan sings out the awesome, joyous call to bless the Creator of the World: Bor'chu... And the entire congregation bursts into a fervent, resonating response that lasts and lasts. The Rebbe's Rosh HaShanah has begun.
The whole idea sounds a little strange at first - leaving home to spend one of the most important days in the Jewish calendar near a gravesite in a small town somewhere in the Ukraine. What is it about Uman that attracts over two and a half thousand men from literally all over the world to spend Rosh HaShanah a way from wives, children, family, regular synagogue, home-cooked Yom Tov meals ... ? The answer perhaps lies in a rather simple yet often misunderstood concept - the Tzaddik. Outside of chassidic circles, when asked "What exactly is a Tzaddik?" some might answer, "A saintly individual," "a very good person," "someone very religious," etc. Yet this still doesn't explain the force that propels not only life-long chassidim, but Jews from all backgrounds and ways of life, to a place like Uman, where Rebbe Nachman chose to spend the last six months of his life.
There is a common misconception that the idea of the Tzaddik was introduced by the founders of the chassidic movement. While there are certain aspects of the Tzaddik's role which had their beginnings with the Baal Shem Tov and his followers (though many of them, such as dynasties, dress codes and the like have no place in Rebbe Nachman's teachings), the concept of the righteous individual and his greatness has always been a part of Judaism. From Moses, Joshua and the Judges onward, each generation has had its own Tzaddikim, spiritual giants, men who would lead, teach and guide the people. It would take literally a whole book just to quote from the Talmud, Midrash and Zohar about the greatness of the Tzaddikim. However, just as our understanding of the Torah has diminished through history, so too has our appreciation of the role of the Tzaddik, ironically just when we need it the most.
The Tzaddik is one who attains such a level of self-mastery and spirituality that all his thoughts, feelings and actions - his very being are in total consonance with G-d's will. This gives him a uniquely close relationship with G-d. In essence, what distinguishes the Tzaddik from anyone else is that he has an unparalleled mastery of the spiritual, which gives him the ability to bridge the physical and spiritual worlds. Yet for all his spirituality, he is, and remains, a human being. This indeed is his strength. He is able to channel Torah spirituality into this world, and guide others as to how to serve G-d.
Does this mean that the Tzaddik is an intermediary? Well, yes and no. First of all G-d forbid that anyone should think he needs a medium between the Almighty and himself; not from his side and certainly not from G-d's. Furthermore, G-d forbid that anyone should think he needs someone else to carry out some form of devotion on his behalf so as to somehow absolve him from fulfilling his own religious duties. We are- all able, and indeed required, to accept responsibility for our own lives and deeds and to take practical steps to develop our own personal relationship with G-d. If the Tzaddik is an intermediary, it is only in the sense that, having succeeded in conquering the physicality of this world, he is able to be an agent or catalyst for bringing spirituality down into it Through his efforts and attainments, a Tzaddik knows what is necessary in order to serve G-d in a true and proper manner. The average individual generally does not have a strong enough grasp of the spiritual to be able to perceive G-d's will clearly and know how to serve him in practice. He must therefore turn to someone who can guide him.
Do we always know what to do? Can we on our own know what direction to take? And what happens when we have estranged ourselves from G-d by our misdeeds? Even the Torah, as the instrument that conveys G-d's infinite wisdom to man, can actually mislead a person who tries to follow it without the benefit of true guidance and leadership! Which of us can honestly say that he is wise enough to look into the Torah and grasp exactly what is required of him? The Talmud, Midrash and Shulchan Arukh stress the importance of receiving from a teacher, so that one's understanding of Torah be clear. As the Talmud teaches: "Even one who has studied, as long as he has not received from a Talmid Chakham, a qualified teacher, is still considered an ignoramus" (Berachot 47a). The true Tzaddik can take the most elevated aspects of Godliness and bring them down to a level at which the simplest person can relate to them. The Tzaddik gives direction.
But how does Rebbe Nachman fit into all this? Rebbe Nachman has always been different things to different people. To his followers, the Breslover Chassidim, he is simply "The Rebbe," their prime source of spiritual guidance in the quest for G-d. Some know him as a master storyteller: his tales are counted among the great classics of Jewish literature. To countless others, Rebbe Nachman is an outstanding chassidic teacher, the great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, an ever-fresh source of inspiration, whose lessons, conversations, parables and epigrams continue to electrify and inspire until today, expressing the wisdom of the Torah in a totally original way, opening up whole new vistas in every area of life. Rebbe Nachman's optimistic message - serve G-d with simplicity and joy - strikes a deep chord in many who have found themselves on the fringes of the Jewish people, as well as "lifers" born and raised in observant homes.
Born in 1772, Rebbe Nachman was only eighteen when he first began to attract a following. Many of his chassidim were outstanding scholars and kabbalists in their own right, some of them far older than he. Rebbe Nachman was only thirty-eight when he passed away in 1810, but even afterwards his influence remained potent. His teachings spread by word of mouth, and especially with the printing of his writings. Today his ideas are studied by both Jews and non-Jews, and have been the subject of a growing body of literature, academic and popular, in English, French, Russian, Yiddish, and of course - Hebrew.
The name of the Breslover Chassidim comes from the town of Breslov, where Rebbe Nachman spent most of the last eight years of his life. That being the case, where does Uman come in? Why did he particularly want to be buried there? Nobody can claim to know exactly what was in Rebbe Nachman's mind. Still, if we transport ourselves about two hundred years back in time and take a look at what Uman stood for then, a coherent picture begins to emerge. In a certain sense, Uman was a place of opposites. In 1768, forty-two years before Rebbe Nachman passed away, Uman, then under Polish rule, was a garrison town. With the advance of an army of rebellious Haidemacks, thousands upon thousands of Jews from all the surrounding areas fled to the town for safety. When the Haidemacks arrived at the gates, the governor gave them access if they would agree to spare all the gentiles in exchange for the Jews. The Haidemacks entered, set up a cross, and offered the Jews a choice between conversion and death. Without exception they chose death. In the space of three days some 20,000 were slain. Their martyrdom brought about a great sanctification of G-d's name.
When Rebbe Nachman once passed through Uman - eight years before he died he took special note of its cemetery, praising it in the most glowing terms. "How beautiful it would be to buried in this cemetery," he said. But by then Uman was notorious for a new kind of Jew, one whose outlook was almost diametrically opposed to that of the 20,000 martyrs. Paradoxically, Uman had become one of the first centers of the Haskalah, or "Enlightenment" movement, in Russia.
Although it was in Germany that the Haskalah had first developed, it was now beginning to spread eastward to what had for centuries been the bastion of Ashkenazic jewry: Poland, the Ukraine and Russia. This was a time of unprecedented philosophical explosion in which many of the ideas that had previously defined man's place in the world were shattered. Leading intellectuals resented the notion that man is subservient to G-d; they wanted to sever all links with the Divine. This took its toll on the Jewish world. Traditionally, religious debates had centered on how to fulfill the mitzvos of the Torah - for instance, the Shema: at what hour is it to be recited, sitting or standing, etc. Now however, this changed, and people started questioning the very necessity of reciting the Shema as well as praying the other mitzvos.
Unlike today, there was no such thing then as an "Orthodox" Jew - one was either a Jew or not. Owing to outside hostility, most Jews had little choice but to live in their own closed communities. But in the new political climate in Europe, "equality" was now being offered to all, even the Jews. For the first time they could gain admission to non-Jewish society and culture! But, the price was high: the tallis and tefillin had to be discarded at the gate. It was the ultimate challenge to that generation's leaders, who fought to innovate ways to preserve Torah-observance against the sweeping tide of assimilation. But for many, the promise of "full equality" proved too enticing to resist and they pursued it with all their might. Rebbe Nachman made a chilling statement to his followers: "We are now at the end of the Jewish people, their outer limit. This is the point where the boundary of the Jewish people ends... When the jewish people reaches this point they are very far from G-d" (Tzaddik #92).
The assimilationists in Uman were led by a clique of three. Rebbe Nachman was the only chassidic leader who was able to communicate with them, and they themselves invited him to move to Uman. He told them that now was not the time, but when he finally came to the town to die eight years later, he would spend hours with them - playing chess, etc., much to the wonderment of his followers. He used to talk to them about every subject under the sun ... except Torah. Yet one of them, Hirsch Ber, said that each conversation with the Rebbe was as if he were telling him, "There is a G-d." Later, after the Rebbe's death, Hirsch Ber told the Rebbe's foremost disciple, Reb Noson, "You have lost the Rebbe? We have lost the Rebbe! If the Rebbe had lived, we would have repented completely and become Tzaddildm" (Until the Meshiach, p.206).
Rebbe Nachman's lifetime came at a crossroads in history. just beginning was the industrial revolution that has so totally transformed our material life, unleashing the most amazing, hitherto undreamed of possibilities for both good and evil. Perhaps even more fateful was the burgeoning ideological revolution, which was to shake the entire framework of beliefs and assumptions on which people had based their lives. Standing on the threshold of the modem age, Rebbe Nachman said: "I'll tell you a secret. A great wave of atheism is about to enter the world" (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #220).
One of Rebbe Nachman's main purposes was to throw out life rafts to those who would become engulfed in the massive impending ideological torrent. Rebbe Nachman had a profound grasp of the alienation, the anguish and the despair so characteristic of the modem age. Hero after hero in his stories spends years wandering through vast forests, deserts, wildernesses and the like, searching and searching... Again and again Rebbe Nachman addresses such contemporary issues as anxiety, frustration, depression, disease ... He saw clearly that further sophistication was no answer. "The greatest wisdom of all," he said, "is to be simple." He stressed faith, joy and looking for the good. "Gevalt!" he cried. "Don't give up!!!"
Rebbe Nachman wanted the fire of his Torah to keep burning brightly. For eight years he nurtured his disciple, Reb Noson, imbuing him with his spirit and guiding him as to how to spread it in the world. Reb Noson later printed all of Rebbe Nachman's teachings. He established regular gatherings of the Breslover Chassidim. He built the first Breslover synagogues. And through his own voluminous writings he encouraged, and continues to encourage, countless Jews to follow Rebbe Nachman's pathways with strength and joy.
Yes, Rebbe Nachman certainly wanted his influence to remain alive in the world. But when he said to his followers, "I want to stay among you," he meant something more specific. From the time he first became sick with tuberculosis, he started talking more and more about his gravesite. He spoke about the possibility of going to die in the holy Land, or of traveling to Lemberg (Lvov), where many other great Rabbis were buried. When he finally settled on Uman, one of the reasons he gave his followers was that it would be easy for them to travel to his gravesite.
The Talmud states that the Tzaddikim are greater after their passing than during their lifetime (Chullin 7b). Personally the Tzaddik has no need for this material world. His only mission is to bring people back to G-d. But during his physical lifetime the Tzaddik is limited, by his body: though he constantly strives to negate his being in G-d's infinity in order to accomplish his mission, he can only do so intermittently, because he cannot leave his physical body. After his physical death, however, his soul remains permanently absorbed in G-d's infinity, making him all the more capable of rectifying the world.
The practice of visiting the graves of the Tzaddikim is an ancient one. When the spies entered the Land of Israel, we are told, "And they ascended from the south, and he came to Hebron" (Numbers 13:22). Since there were twelve spies, why does the verse say "he came to Hebron"? Rashi (ad loc.) explains that this refers to Caleb. "He wanted to be saved from the counsel of the spies, so he went there alone to prostrate himself at the graves of the Patriarchs." Even before this, we find that Jacob explained to Joseph why he buried Rachel at the roadside instead of taking her to Bethlehem. "This way she will be of help to her children when Nevuzaradan takes them into exile. They will pass by her grave, and Rachel will come forth and weep and entreat for mercy on their behalf" (Rashi, Genesis 48:7).
Rebbe Nachman made a promise that no other Tzaddik in the whole of Jewish history has ever made. Taking two of his closest followers as witnesses, he said: "When my days are ended and I leave this world, I will intercede for anyone who comes to my grave, recites the Ten Psalms of the General Remedy - the Tikkun HaKlali (The 10 specific chapters in the book of Psalms are: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150. For further details, see Rabbi Nachman's Tikkun, Breslov Research Institute, 1984.) - and gives some charity. No matter how serious his sins and transgressions, I will do everything in my power to save him and cleanse him. I will span the length and breadth of the Creation for him. By his payos I will pull him out of Hell!" (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #141). "It makes no difference what he did until that day, as long as he undertakes not to return to his foolish ways from now on" (Tzaddik #122).
We are still trying to stay afloat today as we are being deluged with the ideological descendants of the haskalah. The seeds Rebbe Nachman planted are only now, 200 years later, beginning to show their full bloom. This is one of the reasons why to Breslovers, Rebbe Nachman is very much alive today. In a world with an over abundance of questions and too few answers, we can all profit from the veritable treasure that the Rebbe wants to give us. His ideas are addressed to all seeking generations, but in many ways they resonate clearest in this generation of intense spiritual searching. Although his wide appeal is attested to by the range of Jews who overcome all obstacles to spend Rosh HaShanah with him in Uman, his message is nonetheless felt as a deeply personal one. Now, having some idea of the awesomeness of what a tzaddik is and what he can accomplish, we begin to view the journey to Uman on Rosh HaShanah from a completely different perspective.
Rosh HaShanah is an extraordinary day. When you add Rebbe Nachman's unique flavor to it, the picture comes into sharp focus, enabling us to view the day with a new clarity. We suddenly realize that a Rosh HaShanah with the Rebbe is not one to be missed: it gives us a chance to tap into the intrinsic power of the day itself. And, with the Tzaddik's help, we can get the most possible benefit - opportunity awaits us. To help put this in perspective, traveling to the tzaddikim is hardly a new idea - our Sages allude to it in the Talmud. "In the time of the Holy Temple, the shofar was not heard on Shabbos except in the Temple [where the Sanhedrin sat]. When the Temple was destroyed, Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted the custom of sounding the shofar wherever a bet din (rabbinical court - the tzaddikim) convened" (Rosh HaShanah 29b). Thus the custom of traveling to spend Rosh HaShanah with the tzaddikim goes back thousands of years.
That his followers should travel to him for Rosh HaShanah was one of the things Rebbe Nachman was most emphatic about. "Although many other chassidim traveled to the Tzaddikim for Rosh HaShanah, there was no one who was as insistent about the matter as Rebbe Nachman" (Tzaddik #23). He said, "My Rosh HaShanah is completely new. G-d gave me the gift of knowing what Rosh HaShanah is" (ibid. #406). Rebbe Nachman said that on Rosh HaShanah he was able to help people in certain ways that he simply was not able to the rest of the year (Tzaddik #406). He put so much stress on the importance of his Rosh HaShanah that he exclaimed, "My very essence is Rosh HaShanah!" (ibid. #403).
Yet before we can fully appreciate the meaning of Rosh HaShanah with the Tzaddik, we first have to understand a little of what Rosh HaShanah itself is all about what sets this day apart from the rest of the year. Rosh HaShanah literally means the "head of the year." The year is like an organic entity, with a head, a heart, arms, legs and so on. The head is at the top - the first day of the year. Just as the head directs the body, so too, one's Rosh HaShanah will determine the outcome of the rest of the year. Thus, our Sages teach: "On Rosh HaShanah it is decreed what will be at the end of the year" (Rosh HaShanah 8b). Whatever takes place up till the very end of Elul, the last month in the Jewish calendar, was already decreed at its "head," at the very beginning of the year.
Rosh HaShanah has an entirely different character than Pesach, Shavuos or Sukkos. It is the "Day of Judgment." Our health, our wealth, indeed our very lives are at stake. In a sense, Rosh HaShanah is a repeat of Creation. In order to create anything new, there is always an element of judgment. What form should this new creation take? What will be best, taking all the different factors into account? Should we go ahead at all? Rosh HaShanah is no different. It requires, from G-d's side, a new creation: a New Year. The year to come has not yet been, and needs to be brought into existence. Creation. just as construction of a building requires a blueprint, so too, the construction of the year needs a specific plan. just as an architect draws up the blueprints for the building, so is G-d the architect for the year. His plans are prepared and drafted on Rosh HaShanah.
So Rosh HaShanah is not merely the first day of the Jewish calendar. It is the outline for the entire year. Aside from his many other considerations, Rebbe Nachman places paramount importance on Rosh HaShanah because he wants to impress upon us the significance of the "head" - what we can accomplish if we attempt to begin the year properly and have our "heads" - our thoughts - in the right place. Therefore, Rebbe Nachman teaches: We must be wise on Rosh HaShanah - we should only think good, positive thoughts: that G-d will be good to us and give us a good year, and that we will do our best to live the way we know we should. And, because Rosh HaShanah is associated with thought rather than speech, the Rebbe also counsels us to be very careful to speak as little as possible on the first day of Rosh HaShanah (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #21).
The Torah commands us to sound the ram's horn on Rosh HaShanah. The Talmud, Midrash, Zohar, as well as all the later writings, offer numerous insights to explain the connection. Among those upon which Rebbe Nachman puts particular emphasis are that the shofar blasts sweeten the severity of G-d's judgment (Likutey Moharan I:42), and that they arouse people from their spiritual sleep, preventing them from idling away their days (ibid. I:60). Hearing the shofar sounded by a man of true piety evokes awe of Heaven in the heart, putting extraneous fears and worries to flight and moving us to rejoice (ibid. I:5,3). Thus, when we include the blowing of the shofar by a pious person in the blueprint of our year, we can look forward to fear of Heaven and a joyous heart throughout the entire year.
We can see now that Rosh HaShanah is the day that the rest of the year depends on -even the rest of the world. As the Rebbe said: "The entire world is dependent upon my Rosh HaShanah" (Tzaddik #405). So what is it that Rebbe Nachman wants us to gain from this day? Rosh HaShanah is actually a marvelous goodness to the world, and as the Rebbe teaches/ "G-d gave Rosh HaShanah out of great kindness" (Likutey Moharan 11, 1:14). When we begin to fathom the remarkable role that the tzaddik can play on this day, we realize why it is considered such a goodness and, in fact, presents us with a unique opportunity.
On Rosh HaShanah, all of creation comes before G-d to be judged (Rosh HaShanah 16a). We are judged for every act, every word, even every thought. If we truly believe this, we know that we have cause for concern. Rabbi Levi Yitzchok of Berdichov used to say, "When Elul comes around, I feel the fear in My shoulders" (Rabbi Eliyahu Chaim Rosen).
So what are we to do? Repent! Yes. But if things are as bad as we think they are, what chance do we have? The charge sheet may be pages long. The credit sheet is at best so-so. Rebbe Nachman teaches that people should travel to the Tzaddik for Rosh HaShanah. Why? Since decrees pertaining to the entire year am issued on Rosh HaShanah, this is the best time to mitigate and "sweeten" any decree. But how can this be done? Each individual decree has a precise and specific way of its own to be mitigated. A decree can only be sweetened at its source - found in a specific place in G-d's "thought" (the "Upper Wisdom"). If we want to turn every judgment into compassion and kindness, we need to rise to each one of these sources individually.
This is quite an undertaking for anyone, but Rebbe Nachman tells us that there is a level of Divine Wisdom where all individual wisdoms are merged in unity - an all-inclusive Wisdom so exalted that it encompasses the sources of all individual judgments. Since all individual decrees ultimately emanate from this all-inclusive Wisdom, someone who is able to rise to this level actually has the ability to sweeten all decrees without having to mitigate each and every one individually. Certain outstanding Tzaddikim have this power, and this is why people go to them for Rosh HaShanah. Each person comes with his individual problems, his personal limitations, his own good and bad. Because the Tzaddik can rise to the highest source, he can take each constriction, each judgment and decree, and sweeten it, and thus kindness and compassion are aroused for the entire year (Likutey Moharan I, 61:6,7).
Rosh HaShanah is a day of judgment, when dire decrees can be issued against a person or his family, G-d forbid. But it also contains its own antidote against strict judgment. Therefore, even if a person fell short of what he should have been during the year, he has a chance, a good chance, to make amends and begin afresh. The New Year brings with it an opportunity for a new start, so that even if the charge sheet is indeed long, the seemingly impossible task of setting everything right can be made much easier by traveling to the Tzaddik.
"Anyone who has the privilege of being with the Rebbe on Rosh HaShanah is entitled to be very, very happy" (Tzaddik #403). * * *
We have been witnessing remarkable events lately. "History" has suddenly come alive, and is no longer confined to school texts and dust-covered history books. The drama is continuing to unfold before our eyes in Eastern Europe and what was once the Soviet Union. Newspapers have been filled with pictures of one massive statue after another being toppled by a crowd that has had enough. We can't keep up with the dizzying pace of events that has put books, maps and even newspapers out of date before they are printed. In Uman - a tiny dot on the map - a gate has creaked open.
According to the normal scheme of things it should only have been a matter of time before the Breslov movement disappeared after Rebbe Nachman's passing. He did not leave a successor" as such. In most chassidic groups, when one Rebbe dies, a new one is chosen to succeed him, often his son or another close relative. Rebbe Nachman had two sons, but both died in infancy. There was no other candidate for Rebbe that his followers felt to be on anything like the same outstanding level as he was. One might have expected that the Rebbe followers would have eventually drifted apart and gone their separate paths.
Which indeed they could well have done had it not been for Reb Noson, only thirty at the time of the Rebbe's passing. After the Rebbe's burial that Sukkos of 1810, all the chassidim who had been with him in Uman journeyed back to their respective home towns to confront their private thoughts as the harsh Ukrainian winter set in. Although not the most senior of his chassidim, Reb Noson had been closest to the Rebbe during his lifetime, and was of course devastated by his early passing. He could not accept that this was the end of the story. As the weeks passed, all kinds of statements the Rebbe had made over the years kept running through his mind - especially about the power of visiting his gravesite. Within a few months, with the snow still thick on the ground, Reb Noson hired a carriage and journeyed from village to village picking up those who had been Rebbe Nachman's followers for their first pilgrimage to Uman to pray at the Rebbe's Tzion (grave) on Rosh Chodesh Shevat (January), 1811.
When Rebbe Nachman first became sick, he told his followers that if they would continue to follow his pathways and work to develop and purify themselves, even people who had not known him in his lifetime would become attached to them, and they in turn would make more followers "...for I have accomplished and I will accomplish." In the years after his passing, the Rebbe's promise began to come true. Ms leading followers all had many disciples of their own, and so the Breslov movement began to grow. Because of the draw of the Rebbe's Tzion, it was natural for Uman to become more and more of a focus. This was especially so after 1866, when Reb Noson's leading pupil, Reb Nachman of Tulchin, moved there. The Breslov community in Uman became a vibrant center of spirituality and devotion. Seeking Jews would travel to Uman from all over the Ukraine, White Russia, Lithuania and even as far away as Poland in search of the living Torah of Rebbe Nachman.
Then the darkness descended. The Russian Revolution in 1917 made it ever more difficult to get to Uman. In 1919 successive waves of troops passing through the town perpetrated a series of pogroms in which hundreds of Jews lost their lives. The new Soviet regime made every effort to repress Jewish religious life, and in 1937, after years of persecution, the authorities finally closed the Breslover synagogue in Uman, converting it into a metalwork factory. When the Nazis marched into Uman in 1941, they deported the entire Jewish community, murdering some 17,000. They also made it their business to do as much damage as possible to the cemetery, attempting to blot out any memory of Jews, alive or dead. After the war, the Soviets announced that since the cemetery had been devastated the entire area would be given over for suburban housing.
That should have been it. But it wasn't. Under Stalin you did not put in an appeal to preserve a Jewish cemetery if you valued your life. Still, in the rubble left after the Nazi desecration, Reb Zavel Lubarski was able to find traces of two poles which had stood at the head and foot of the grave to support a rail. The plot of land containing Rebbe's grave was then acquired by a Breslover Chassid, Reb Daniel, the ger (convert). The exact position of the grave having been located, the house was designed in such a way that its exterior wall would run alongside it, and the grave was thus inconspicuously protected in the private yard of the house. After Reb Daniel emigrated to Israel, the house came into the hands of a non-Jewish couple, who have lived there ever since.
The successive ravages of the Bolsheviks and the Nazis and the rigors of Stalinism forced the remnants of the Breslover Chassidim in the Ukraine to go underground. Any visits they made to the Tzion had to be covert. But in the meantime those who had emigrated had established new Breslov centers in Israel and America, and these were expanding rapidly. Until the 1960s all access to Uman was completely barred to Jews from outside Russia, but that did not prevent people from studying and practicing Rebbe Nachman's teachings, and hearing from their elders about what Uman stood for.
The first little chink in the "Iron Curtain" opened up in the summer of 1963, when a student of the late Rabbi Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld met with Reb Michal Dorfman in Moscow and told him of his wish to travel to Uman, an impossibility at that time. Reb Michal agreed to meet him in Kiev and accompany him to Uman. Being caught would have meant immediate exile to Siberia, but the trip came off, opening a door to Uman for the first time in over thirty years.
The following winter a group of eleven people from the United States traveled to Uman under the leadership of Rabbi Zvi Aryeh Rosenfeld. More trips followed, but owing to the presence of military installations nearby, the Soviets circumscribed the visitors in every conceivable way. You had to travel all the way to Kiev just to apply for the special visa required to visit Uman, and visas were as often as not refused. Even when they were granted, it was forbidden to visit Uman unaccompanied, and certainly not to stay in the town overnight.
Reb Noson once said, "Even if the road to Uman were paved with knives, I would crawl there just so I could be at Rebbe Nachman's grave." For the most devoted Breslovers, visiting Rebbe Nachman's Tzion was the dream of a lifetime. People resorted to all kinds of stratagems to get around the Soviet obstinacy, sometimes putting themselves at considerable risk to travel to Uman even without a visa. One of the main principles of Breslov teaching is that the obstacles to any holy goal are only sent in order to increase one's yearning and determination to achieve it. How many prayers flowed forth in the endeavor to get to Uman! And they were answered. One way or another, there was a steady trickle of visitors to the Tzion. No where was this more evident than in the desire of the Breslover Chassidim to be by the Rebbe for Rosh HaShanah kibutz.
Every year Rebbe Nachman's followers used to travel to be with him for Rosh HaShanah. Hundreds came for his last Rosh HaShanah in 1810. It was then that he made his strongest statements ever about the importance of coming to him for Rosh HaShanah. "No one should be missing," he said, "Rosh HaShanah is my whole mission" (Tzaddik #403). Eighteen days later Rebbe Nachman passed away - leaving his chassidim to ponder, among other things, why he had spoken so much that year about the importance of coming to him for Rosh HaShanah since he must have known it was going to be his last one in this world.
It was Reb Noson who spelled out what the Rebbe meant. just as his chassidim had come to him for Rosh HaShanah during his lifetime, so they should in the future come to his gravesite. When Reb Noson arranged the first pilgrimage to the Rebbe's Tzion in the winter of 1811, one of his main intentions was to impress this on the other chassidim. But out of the hundreds that had come for the Rebbe's last Rosh HaShanah, only about sixty traveled to Uman the following year. Even so, this was enough to encourage Reb Noson to feel that the Rosh HaShanah gathering could continue, and indeed with each year the numbers grew.
At first the Breslover Chassidim would pray in the local synagogue. Within ten years, however, there were so many visitors that they could not all be accommodated there. Each year somewhere else had to be found to hold the services. Reb Noson used to make the arrangements, and it soon became clear to him that the only practical solution was to build a Breslover shul in Uman. The enormous costs involved made this an awesome undertaking, but by Rosh HaShanah 1829 Reb Noson realized he had no alternative. He feared that if Rosh HaShanah came and he was unable to secure a large enough place, the overcrowding would discourage people from coming, which might put an end to the annual Rosh HaShanah gatherings.
The next few years brought many trials: a succession of bitter winters, several serious epidemics which took a heavy toll on many Breslover families, and an armed conflict between Poland and Russia which made life precarious and travel for fund-raising nearly impossible. Yet despite the difficulties, Reb Noson managed to secure a suitable property, gained planning permission, purchased the necessary timber and other materials, and started building. By the summer of 1834 the Breslov shul - it was known as the "kloyz" was sufficiently advanced that it could be used for the coming Rosh HaShanah. Reb Noson purchased a beautiful Sefer Torah, books and everything else needed in a shul. He was overjoyed...
But the joy was short-lived. With uncanny timing, the forces of hatred against Breslov Chassidus, which had for years been simmering and fermenting more or less underground, finally ruptured into open warfare (For a detailed account of this period, see "Through Fire and Water, Breslov Research Institute 1992"). Antagonism to Rebbe Nachman's teachings had always existed among those who found them too much of an assault on their own complacent attitudes. After the Rebbe's passing, the opposition was directed against the Breslov Chassidim in general, but especially against Reb Noson, who was doing more than anyone to spread the Rebbe's teachings. It was now unleashed with unmitigated fury. What followed was, unfortunately, not one of the finer moments in Jewish history. Reb Noson's opponents denounced him to the Russian authorities as a "false prophet" whose activities were against the interests of the Czar and therefore treasonable. Reb Noson was promptly arrested, exiled to Nemirov, the town of his birth, and placed under house arrest.
A week before Rosh HaShanah 1835, Reb Noson secretly left Nemirov in the middle of the night to go to Uman. His hope was that if he was already there, his opponents might at least leave him in peace for the "Days of Awe." Undeterred, they reported him to the authorities, and the night before Rosh HaShanah, the police arrived with drawn weapons in order to "capture" Reb Noson, who was led through the streets like a common criminal. However, due to the intervention of Uman's leading maskilim, whom the authorities knew and trusted, and with whom Reb Noson had always maintained a relationship, a deal was struck permitting him to remain in Uman for Rosh HaShanah. Later, whenever Reb Noson would recall the suffering he endured to spend that Rosh HaShanah in Uman, he would say that it was more meaningful than any other Rosh HaShanah he had ever experienced. With the steady spread of Rebbe Nachman's teachings, the annual Rosh HaShanah gatherings attracted visitors from further afield. By the early 1900s people were coming from Poland and even from Israel, where the beginnings of a Breslov community were forming. Despite the hardships of pre-modern travel, Uman remained fairly accessible until 1917, when the Russian border was closed. The chassidim in Poland then started holding their own Rosh HaShanah gathering in Lublin, while the Breslovers in Jerusalem established another. In the 1940s Rabbi Avraham Sternhartz, a grandson of Reb Noson who had moved to Israel shortly before the war, started an annual gathering in Meron at the gravesite of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, author of the Zohar.
The violent repression of Jewish religious activity in Russia forced the Rosh HaShanah gatherings in Uman underground. Nevertheless, even after the Second World War, the few remaining Breslover Chassidim in Russia continued holding a secret Rosh HaShanah minyan in Uman despite the risk of imprisonment. However, with the shift of the Breslov movement to Israel and the U.S., the main Rosh HaShanah gatherings were those held in Israel. By the 1970s and 1980s the gatherings held in Meron and Jerusalem were each attracting many thousands, while smaller gatherings were held in New York, and later in Manchester, England.
The gatherings in Meron and Jerusalem were major events, involving a whole organizational infrastructure to arrange accommodation, meals and so on. The two days of intense prayer, communal eating, chassidic study sessions, song and dance created a unique atmosphere that made a deep impression on many who had never been in Uman nor ever dreamed that they would ever go. From time to time during the Rosh HaShanah dancing, a few people would sing the traditional Breslover song, "Uman, Uman, Rosh HaShanah..." But the idea of actually being in Uman for Rosh HaShanah was as laughable as Avraham and Sarah having a baby in their old age.
Yet they did! And so too the Breslovers came back to Uman - in spite of the "Iron Curtain"! The draw of Rebbe Nachman's s hold over the imagination Tzion never lost it of the Breslover Chassidim. By the early 1980s more and more organized groups were traveling to Uman from the U.S., Britain and even Israel. The Russian authorities turned down all requests to arrange a tour to coincide with Rosh HaShanah they still wouldn't even allow visitors to stay in Uman overnight - but the Breslovers kept on asking... and praying...
And in 1988 it happened. After protracted negotiations, the Soviet facade began to crack, and the authorities finally gave permission for two hundred-fifty people to spend Rosh HaShanah in Uman. Even after agreeing, they kept on changing their minds, creating innumerable difficulties along the way. Nevertheless, by a miracle, it came off. Uman's one and only hotel - an old, shabby, dilapidated building more like an army barracks - was inundated with chassidim, who sang, danced and poured out their hearts in prayer, leaving the bemused locals to stare at the strange specter in total wonderment.
The following year, over a thousand people came. A large, empty factory site was rented some ten minutes walk from the gravesite. The production halls were hastily converted into a synagogue, dining hall and dormitories, and food was flown in from Israel. Elderly Jews who had lived their entire lives in Uman began stepping forward out of nowhere to join the festivities. The sight of so many of their emancipated brethren literally dancing in the streets finally convinced them that they could at last drop the paranoid attitudes which had perforce become second nature during the long years of Stalinist, Nazi and post-Stalinist persecution. By Rosh HaShanah 1990, the number of visitors had doubled to two thousand, and an even larger factory site was acquired two minutes from the gravesite. As Rebbe Nachman once said: "Every year people say that previous years were better and times are not as good as they were before. But the opposite is true. G-d now directs the world better than ever" (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #307).
Rebbe Nachman's Rosh HaShanah starts long before the first of Tishri. The Rebbe himself said that as soon as one Rosh HaShanah is over, he already started waiting for next year's (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #215). But for most people today, serious practical preparations start in the early summer. The first thing almost everyone has to confront is obstacles of one kind or another, whether from within themselves or the world outside. This has been true from Rebbe Nachman's time until today. Reb Noson wrote: "We learned how determined we have to be to break the obstacles that stand in the way of any holy action, especially the barriers against being with the Rebbe for Rosh HaShanah" (Tzaddik #406). it seems that the only way to receive the unique spiritual uplift that comes from being in Uman for Rosh HaShanah is through first having had to fight for it a bit.
This applies even to those who have already had a taste of an Uman Rosh HaShanah and who normally find it hard to imagine ever going anywhere else - how much more does it apply to those who are contemplating going for the first time. Today the trip to Uman ought to be almost as easy as booking your tickets and packing a suitcase. But while the collapse of the Soviet Union has eliminated many of the obstacles that used to exist, others still have a way of coming up.
Few people are in the happy position of not having to wonder how to finance such a trip. One of the first things to do is to pray for the necessary funds... and then start saving! The Breslover Chassidim of old used to put aside a special savings box at the beginning of the year and add at least a few coins every so often. For those whose yearning to go is very strong, the necessary funds often have a way of appearing at the very moment when things seem most hopeless. Rebbe Nachman explicitly stated: "I have already made it my business to take care of the expenses of those who come to me for Rosh HaShanah" (Siach Sarfei Kodesh 1-27. Many today can testify to this as an actuality!
Another obstacle most people come up against is their sense of responsibility to their families, their home community and the like. Understandably, wives have always had great difficulties with the idea of being left at home with the children on this holiday. Yet it is important to point out that the husband, as in many other realms of Jewish life, is considered the family's representative - in the long term, the benefits from the trip to Uman are enjoyed by the rest of the family as well. As for the short term, Reb Noson once remarked: "It is one of G-d's miracles that Yom Kippur comes right after Rosh HaShanah. This way, the members of the family have to for-give each other!" (Rabbi Eliyahu Chaim Rosen; Siach Sarfei Kodesh 1-665). Some people feel tom about the idea of leaving Israel in order to travel to the Ukraine for Rosh HaShanah. From America, England, France or any of the other places in the Diaspora where there are Breslover Chassidim, this might seem logical enough. But to leave the Holy Land? Yet Rebbe Nachman taught that the holiness of the graves of the Tzaddikim is in the same category as the holiness of the Land of Israel (Likutey Moharan II, 109). Thus, "those who travel (from Israel) to the graves of Tzaddikim are actually traveling from the Holy Land... to the Holy Land!" (Rabbi Shmuel Shapiro).
Even after dealing with all the other issues, there may well still be a nagging voice inside that keeps saying, "I can only get a good night's sleep in my own bed... I won't be able to eat the kind of food I'm used to... the davening will be so crowded... wouldn't it be just as good to stay at home? Surely my kavanah in davening will be much better - I won't have the distractions of an unfamiliar place!" These were exactly the points one of his followers put to Rebbe Nachman, saying he much preferred being with him when things were quieter. The Rebbe responded: "Whether you eat or don't eat; whether you sleep or don't sleep; whether you concentrate on your prayers or you don't concentrate properly.. just make sure you are with me for Rosh HaShanah." Reb Noson adds: "All the distractions the man mentioned were purely imaginary. They were the promptings of the evil inclination - because thank G-d it was perfectly evident that in the main people prayed with deeper concentration among the assembled chassidim on Rosh HaShanah than they would have done if they had prayed in their own home towns" (Tzaddik 404).
Every effort and sacrifice, large or small, that we make in our journey to the Tzaddik is precious. Two of Rebbe Nachman's closest followers Reb Yudel and Reb Shmuel Isaac, used to travel long distances to get from their homes to the Rebbe. Atone point they wanted to move to the same region so as to be close to him all the time, and so they did. The Rebbe then told them he greatly missed their journeys to him. With every single step they would take on their way an angel was created. They said, "But what about all our efforts and running before we finally hired the coach to bring us?" "They are also included," replied the Rebbe. "Every one of those steps also creates an angel." Just before his last Rosh HaShanah in Uman, the Rebbe spoke about this again and said: "Oh to have the merit to see the clear, radiant light of the roads you travel to be with me" (Tzaddik #291).
Practically everybody traveling to Uman for Rosh HaShanah today, especially from Europe, the U.S. and further afield, faces a lengthy journey by night and day. If there is anything positive to be said about the disorientation this causes, it could be that it helps prepare one for the intensity of the Uman experience, which is very much about waking up, quite literally as well as in the spiritual sense. After the various delays that can crop up on the way, many finally get into Uman in the wee hours of the night, only to find the area near the Rebbe's Tzion surprisingly alive with a bustle of activity (the hours after midnight are a favored time for Breslovers to pray and meditate.) It is an interesting fact that many people who at home find themselves unable to manage without their seven to eight hours of sleep each night discover that they can do very well with much less while in Uman.
Representatives of the Vaad (organizing committee) are available day and night to direct people to their accommodations. Normally the first thing most people want to do after depositing their bags is to go to the Rebbe's Tzion to pray, a deeply moving experience both for those coming for the first time and for those returning. With more and more people arriving by the hour, the excitement and awesomeness of Rosh HaShanah can be felt ever more strongly. In the present economic crisis in the Ukraine there is practically nothing to buy in Uman, and all the sights worth seeing in the town can be "done" more than adequately in the space of less than half an hour. The only place really worth visiting is the elegant Sofiefka park, of which Rebbe Nachman himself said, "To be in Uman and not go there?" The absence of distractions is probably just as well, since it leaves one free to rest, and then take advantage of every available moment before Rosh HaShanah to be at the Tzion to pray, study, meditate and contemplate. (Those with a spare day or two before or after the festival may wish to go to visit the graves of the Baal Shem Tov in Medzeboz, Rabbi Levi Yitzchok in Berdichev, Reb Noson in Breslov, etc.)
On Rosh HaShanah eve the Selichos start quite early. The shul is packed, the atmosphere electric, the davening full of fervor. As Rebbe Nachman said: "Other Tzaddikim wish themselves a Rosh HaShanah as good as our Erev Rosh HaShanah" (Imros Tehoros). At last Rosh HaShanah itself arrives. The Breslov davening is slow, which is fine for those who are accustomed to it. As for those who are not, there is nothing to prevent them taking a break whenever necessary in order to take some air, relax, offer their own private prayers, etc. (Sefardim, please note: for those who feel out of place in the main minyan, some of the Sefardim who come to Uman have chosen to pray in their own minyan following their own customs.) In any case, the traditional Breslover nusach is never tedious. At those moments of great solemnity, when the words of the machzor confront us with the ultimate facts of our mortal existence, the melodies are hauntingly moving, followed by a rapturous burst of the most infectiously lebedik singing that forces you to clap your hands with everybody else and literally jump for joy.
"Eat rich foods and drink sweet drinks, and send portions to those who are without, for the day is holy to our Lord; and do not be somber, for the joy of HaShem is your strength" (Nechemiah 8:10). The Vaad has put special care into catering the festive Yom Tov meals, making sure to provide ample food for all. Sitting and enjoying together with everyone else gives one a chance to appreciate the amazing variety of Rebbe Nachman's followers and the wonder of the Godly unity that has been made out of such diversity. Perhaps this is one of the things Rebbe Nachman meant when he compared the Tzaddik to the Even Shesiyah, the "Foundation Stone" in the Holy Temple, which was one single stone formed out of the twelve separate stones Jacob took to lay his head upon (Genesis 28:11). The true Tzaddik has the power to reconcile opposites and make peace. One of the high points of Rosh HaShanah in Uman is Tashlikh, on the afternoon of the first day. This is held at what is now a reservoir a few minutes away from the Tzion. The sight of over two thousand chassidim clad in white advancing through the streets of Uman and gathering at the water's edge is impressive enough. It is even more moving to those who are aware that this was one of the spots where in 1941 the Nazis rounded up hundreds of Jews and then started pushing them into the water - with plenty of local collaborators looking on to make sure that no one escaped being drowned. "Those who sow in tears will reap in joyous song..." (Psalms 126:5). The return from Tashlikh is a triumphant dance through the streets: "And you shall draw water with joy from the springs of salvation" (Isaiah 12,3). Just try to picture the scene - where the Nazis once slaughtered Jews with the local collaborators looking on, the police now Stop the traffic to allow over two thousand chassidim to dance joyously in the streets!
After Tashlikh was when Rebbe Nachman would give his Rosh HaShanah lesson. Today this is the time for study sessions with leading scholars of the Breslov movement, with a wide variety of shiurim at all levels, in Yiddish, Hebrew, English, French, Russian... The various Rosh HaShanah teachings in the writings of Rebbe Nachman and Reb Noson are not only a commentary on and explanation of today's Rosh HaShanah. The manifold facets of Rosh HaShanah as it actually is in Uman today are themselves a teaching - a vivid, living commentary on the practical meaning of Rebbe Nachman's teachings - on the vital importance of putting all our strength into prayer and joyous service of G-d... on being prepared to confront ourselves and ask ourselves the deepest questions about the purpose of our lives and how we are measuring up in fulfilling our potential... on valuing the spiritual over and above the material... on loving and appreciating our fellow Jews when they can be so exasperatingly different from ourselves....
People who have never been in Uman for Rosh HaShanah may wonder what it means to go to the Tzaddik if he isn't actually there in the flesh. But for those who have had the experience, the Rebbe's spirit can be felt at every turn: at the Tzion, where somehow one finds oneself expressing one's deepest personal needs and issues so naturally; in the shul, where "intensity" is too tame a word to describe the rapturous joy and profound awe that inspire the entire gathering; in the singing and dancing accompanying the Yom Tov meals; at Tashlikh; and in the words of Torah that flow forth, whether at the organized shiurim or in informal study sessions and conversations with old friends and new.. Each person comes away with a wealth of new insights and chizuk - encouragement, to start the new year off on the right footing.
The practical business of getting to Uman can involve a great deal of thought and preparation, yet this should not allow us to neglect the spiritual preparations necessary for the Day of Judgment. Elul, the last month of the Jewish year, has an intrinsic quality that makes it particularly conducive to repentance, and the spiritual advances we make in this period prepare us beautifully for the Day of Judgment.
Getting ready for Rosh HaShanah is much like preparing to meet the "King." Few of us today have had any exposure to true royalty, nor have we grown up with that sense of respect and reverence for kings and powerful rulers that previous generations had. Today our impressions of those who rule are all too often colored by the widespread scandals surrounding so many leading figures and our awareness of their true nature. This may make it difficult for us to imagine the awe evoked in a person who comes before a king. Yet we a re not, of course, even talking about being brought before an earthly ruler. On Rosh HaShanah, we are brought before the King of the Universe, who will scrutinize us in profound and uncomfortable detail. We have to be ready!
One goes before a king dressed appropriately. The clothes a person wears and the way he wears them are among the greatest indicators of his personality and what he has made of himself. just as we have physical clothes, so too we have spiritual "clothes." These are made up of our thoughts, words and actions, which literally envelop our soul, giving exact expression to who and what we really are. Coming before the Almighty, our spiritual "garments" must be scrubbed as clean as they can be. The month of Elul is specifically the time when we concentrate our energies on cleansing our spiritual selves.
There is no more effective way to cleanse ourselves than through taking care about the way we speak. What we say, and the way we say it, accurately reflects our inner essence, because it is speech that expresses our daat our mind and inner consciousness. Speech is the mother of action, since the way we articulate our inner thoughts and desires has a decisive influence over the things we do. Speech is the intermediary between thought and action. Thus the way we speak is an indication of the degree to which our lives are devoted to the holy. There are people who have made themselves a world where not a word they say concerns G-d. Their mouths are full of criticism, ridicule, cynicism and sarcasm, and they only have ears for similar talk from others. The exquisite Godliness which exists in all things remains hidden and unrevealed.
The one truth is the existence of G-d. If we can stick to the truth, and use our language to assert and reveal His presence, we thereby have an awesome power to channel Godliness directly into the mundane world we live in. Godliness can then "dwell" in the world. As a start, this can be as simple as making it a point, when something good happens to you, to acknowledge where it came from!
Thanking G-d for the good in our lives is one of the best ways to start a session of Hisbodedus - the private prayer and meditation in one's native tongue, that Rebbe Nachman advocated as the highest level of devotion. It is particularly important to set aside time for this practice during Elul. It can be a very rewarding experience to make a detailed list of all the things we have to be grateful for, from our health, strength, faculties, family, home, livelihood... to the mitzvos we have the privilege of performing every day.. and the very fact that we are Jews, with a holy soul that will endure for ever. By focusing on the good and developing a positive outlook we put ourselves in a far stronger position to grapple with the evil within us.
Hisbodedus is the time to take a calm, honest look at ourselves to see where we need to improve. Changing entrenched habits can be difficult. The first step is to ask G-d to help. The essence of hisbodedus is simplicity - to express ourselves to G-d in simple, straightforward language the way we would talk to an intimate friend. Shortly before Rebbe Nachman passed away, when he was seriously ill, his grandson, Yisroel, came into him. The Rebbe said: "Pray to G-d that I should become well again." The little boy went aside and said: "G-d! G-d! Let my zeida be well!" The adults in the room started smiling, but Rebbe Nachman said: "This is how we have to ask things of G-d. What other way is there to pray?" (Tzaddik #439). Hisbodedus is the key to repentance: each session is a practical workshop in self-cleansing.
Rebbe Nachman suggested to some of his followers to read through the entire TaNaKh (Bible) during the period from the beginning of Elul up till the end of Sukkos (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #251). The study of the Zohar and Tikkuney Zohar is also extremely beneficial during this period: the very language used in these works is so holy that it has the power to motivate us to serve G-d. The same holds true of the teachings of Rebbe Nachman in his Likutey Moharan, The Aleph-Bet Book, Rabbi Nachman's Stories and Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom (see Kokhavey Or, p. 77f #26,27). Some Breslover Chassidim try to go through all of these works during this period. Another important aid to repentance is reciting Psalms (Likutey Moharan II, 73).
The day before Rosh HaShanah is a very good time for presenting a pidyon - charity money given to the Tzaddik in order to redeem oneself in the eyes of Heaven and cleanse one's Soul (Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #214). Nowadays, Breslover Chassidim give this redemption money to an elder of the community.
Our sages teach: On Rosh HaShanah, three books are opened; one for Tzaddikim, one for the completely wicked, and one for those in between. Tzaddikim are inscribed immediately for a good life, and the completely wicked for a bad life, while those in between are given time to repent until Yom Kippur (Rosh HaShanah 16b). Reb Noson writes: "Those who are attached to the Tzaddikim are inscribed together with the Tzaddikim" (Likutey Halakhot, Nezikin 5:17). May we all be granted this year - and every year - to be inscribed and sealed in the Book of the Righteous, Amen.
How can we characterize the average per son who is drawn to Uman for Rosh HaShanah? An impossible task - not one is typical. What follows is a small sampling of personal experiences from a few who were in Uman for Rosh HaShanah 1991. We point out that three of the four people interviewed were never in Uman before Rosh HaShanah, 5752 (1991).
My decision to travel to Uman was as difficult as my decision to become a Breslover Chassid. I attended, and was successful in, the finest Lithuanian style Yeshivos, where chassidus was labeled an "off-shoot" of "authentic" Judaism. The Baal Shem Tov and all of the other Chassidic Masters were never mentioned and none of their works studied. Despite my continual progress in learning, I felt an emptiness - something was always missing. I felt a bit like the son in Rabbi Nachman's Story "The Rabbi's Son" - externally "having it all," but aching inside. A baal teshuvah persuaded me to attend a lecture in Rebbe Nachman's teachings and it far eclipsed anything I had ever heard or learned in all my years in Yeshivot. A "seed" took root and I began studying Rebbe Nachman's works despite the opposition I faced. I had to make a large scale intellectual "overhaul" to integrate the Rebbe's ideas and change my mindset. But to take the Rebbe into my heart, to make the pact and go to Uman, I had to over-come a different set of obstacles, including the fact that I felt that Breslover Chassidim "weren't my type." It ultimately became a matter of "surrendering" to the Rebbe's suggestions. When I finally "surrendered," it was a most awesome feeling. Now, having found Rebbe Nachman, going to Uman for Rosh HaShanah is an integral part of me.
Since my childhood in Brooklyn, I knew of the benefits to be derived from visiting the grave of Rabbi Nachman in Uman and had always wanted to make the trip. I learned of the annual Rosh HaShanah pilgrimage from a friend and given the relaxation of tensions in Russia, I decided to go.
The Rebbe says in Tzaddik that there is nothing greater than being with him for Rosh HaShanah and that he is able to help us then in a way which is not possible during the rest of the year.
The decision to go to Uman was a very difficult My wife wanted me to go very much, but one we recently moved to Israel from Minnesota and I wanted to postpone it for a year or even two. I saw merit in going for the sake of my personal "tikkun," but I had my rationalization why postponing the trip would be better. I went this year partly for "shalom bayit" peace at home - but mainly I had an account to settle. As with all Baal Teshuvas, I had to correct a few past "wrongs" which were in need of major repair - you know, the type of repair you need a specialist for. I would not go to a small-town plumber to replace all the plumbing in the Empire State Building. Also, the opportunity to see the area where my grandfather and his family lived played a part in my decision.
What were your expectations upon arriving in Uman? How did your expectations compare to your actual experience?
I grouped them into two divisions. One was the material, the conditions of the city of Uman, which I imagined as an early 20th century or even late 19th century city. I wasn't "disappointed." Regarding the spiritual, I learned that, one cannot expect to become inspired when "looking over one's own shoulder." l again " surrendered" myself to just traveling there, hoping that the moment of inspiration would come. And it did!
My only fear was not being accepted by the chassidic Jews of Breslov and other sects who make up the overwhelming majority of attendees -since I am not a practicing Jew. But to the contrary, not only were my fears not realized, but I was warmly accepted by everyone. Perhaps because of my background, I was treated as a special guest whose journey to Uman was a real sacrifice, and everything was done to make me feel comfortable and at home.
The first time I went for Rosh HaShanah was in 1989 (I have since been in 1990 and 1991). 1 was apprehensive as to what I might find. But in fact, it was a homecoming. The first night of Rosh HaShanah tears poured down my face at the joy of being with the Rebbe for Rosh HaShanah. One could sense his presence amongst his chassidim - many of whom had experienced many problems and difficulties in getting to Uman.
I somehow managed to keep my expectations rather small. I just wanted to get there and back in one piece (the "Gorbachev coup" had occurred only weeks before). But if the Rebbe could help correct my "account", it would be well worth the trip. The experience at Rebbe Nachman's Tzion, as well as at Reb Noson's and the Berdichover's, was more than I expected. The old mikvah in the Kiev synagogue was also very uplifting. I did not expect to daven at all those different places. Afterwards, I even felt bad that I didn't have the strength to go to the kever of the Baal Shem Tov. I definitely plan on going back, though next time with a little more insight, a little more kavanah (intention) and a lot less weighing me down.
The Friday evening davening, after Lekho Dodi. The entire congregation - over 2,000 people - continued singing a most gripping melody. The congregation then broke out in an incredibly inspiring dance - an awesome sight. To me it meant, "G-d! You have raised me out of the dirt, poor and wretched soul that I am. You have brought me here to be with princes - the princes of Your people." I stood entranced, helpless, unable to move, tears rolling down my cheeks. I wouldn't trade those moments for anything. Surprisingly, my most difficult moment was actually at Rebbe Nachman's gravesite. It was very crowded. And though I saw many people very deeply involved in their thoughts and prayers, I felt too self-conscious to have hisbodedus. In short, I felt numbed by all that was happening around me.
Hearing the passionate davening of the Breslovers is something I had never experienced. It was an overwhelming and uplifting feeling. Of course I could not keep up with the group, but I still felt there was a place for me there and that I was a part of the prayers.
Last year our baggage was lost by the airline. But I found that I didn't need it. Even without a change of clothes, it was enough just being there (and we got our baggage back after the trip!).
Being sick with a high fever was by far the most difficult part of the trip for me. I really missed out on the Rosh HaShanah davening. But the most inspiring aspect of the trip, even while lying there with fever, was knowing that some major adjustments were being made on High in my favor! I was finally able to do something that had a major positive impact in my life, and possibly even for my family - both in this world and in the next. Usually, I feel like all my efforts are barely enough, if even that. But there in Uman I felt as though mountains were moved on my behalf.
What changes in your personal life did you notice when you returned from Uman (davening, belief, spiritual, physical)?
The differences were not very dramatic, but one thing is for sure: I can now see the issues that I struggle with in a much clearer light. And when the struggles seem a bit too unbearable and I feel I'm about to break, I hang onto having been in Uman for Rosh HaShanah with the Rebbe.
I am certainly a better person for the experience and I plan to return to Uman next year. I wish I could say it had changed me more, but this just would not be true. Three days, no matter how potent, cannot overturn 49 years.
Changes take place slowly and experiences are assimilated slowly. My trips to Uman have had a cumulative effect and have helped me understand what the Rebbe wanted from us. J.L.: After coming back, my davening was radically different in the sense that there is now a connection that wasn't there before, and life in general does not feel as weighed down. Also, the relationship with my wife vastly improved.
So there's a lot each one of us can get out of Rosh HaShanah. "Nu, if I can't get there this year, I'll go next year. My presence or absence won't make much of a difference to anybody else." Or will it? The fact is, it is not only what we can gain from Rosh HaShanah that counts, but what we can contribute by our presence. In fact, it might count even more. To paraphrase: "Ask not what Rosh HaShanah can do for me, but what I can do for Rosh HaShanah!" Thus in his last ever lesson, on Rosh HaShanah of 1810, Rebbe Nachman taught:
The Sefer Yetzira tells us that two stones build two houses, three stones build six houses and four stones build twenty-four houses... That is, with two stones, A and B, one can make two combinations (AB and BA), with three stones, A, B and C, one can make six combinations; with four stones, A, B, C and D, one can make twenty-four combinations, and so on. Each additional stone increases the product factorially.
The "stones" are the Souls (Lamentations 4:1). Thus a simple quorum of 10 people yields a product of 3,628,800 combinations! Imagine the increase in the number of combinations with every single "stone" every soul - added to the minyan. Imagine the number of combinations produced by 100 people... or by 1,000... or by 2,500 people... and more! The permutations are staggering!
Every one of these "stones" - these Jewish souls - is a part of the "building of holiness. Each and every Jew, by joining in this "building," increases the "community" of holiness around the world (Likutey Moharan 11, 8:6; see also Tzaddik #169).
So, "Why me?" Because the benefits I gain by joining this "community," together with the benefits countless others gain because of my presence, are the best start to "building" the New Year.
Excerpts from a Prayer to come to Rebbe Nachman's gravesite by R. Yitzchak Breiter (1886-1943), a leader of the Breslov Chassidim in pre-war Poland.
Master of all the worlds and all the souls: help us fulfill all the teachings of the true Tzaddikim and carry out everything they have taught us so that we can make amends for all our sins and return to You wholeheartedly.
As we stand on the threshold of Mashiach, You have lovingly sent us a true leader of the Jewish People - the "flowing stream, the source of wisdom," Rebbe Nachman, son of Feiga, may his merit protect us. He has taught us the path to follow so as not to lose all our precious days and years in sleep. His teachings have the power to arouse us from our sleep, release us from the insensitivity of our hearts, and strengthen and encourage us.
Master of the world, loving G-d: You know the innermost secrets of all hearts. You know all the obstacles and barriers we face and the trials we go through. Visiting the holy grave of Rebbe Nachman has the power to elevate and restore everything to You.
Grant that all of us should have the privilege of coming there joyfully and praying at his grave. Help us wake up quickly from our spiritual sleep and rise from the places we have fallen to. Bring us back to You with all our hearts, and from now on let us always live in accordance with Your will. Let the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts find favor before You, HaShem our Rock and Redeemer. Amen.
The city of Uman today might aptly be compared with a city in medieval Europe. There are no convention halls or modem hotels with the conveniences known to those in the West. This has necessitated many improvisations in order to cater to the visiting chassidim during the week of Rosh HaShanah. It is a bit like having to prepare for an army battalion out in the field for a week of maneuvers. Special arrangements are necessary to provide food, accommodation and synagogue facilities for the thousands who descend upon Uman. (Though many women travel to Uman during the year, the logistics are such that it would be impossible to cater to both men and women for Rosh HaShanah.)
To make the Rosh HaShanah in Uman as successful as possible and to enable participants to spend their time usefully and profitably in Torah and prayer, the Breslov community has set up an international Vaad (committee) to help coordinate the arrangements. Fish, chicken and meat are prepared, cooked and vacuum packed in Jerusalem under strictest hygienic guidelines. An advance team of dedicated workers travels to Uman weeks before Rosh HaShanah to prepare the accommodations and to see that the synagogue facilities-benches, chairs, Ark etc. are being readied. They also oversee the preparation of the mikvah and make the necessary arrangements with city officials to reserve the vanya (public bathhouse) for the exclusive use of the chassidim on Erev Shabbos and Erev Yom Tov. They also prepare the "field kitchen," purchase vegetables (e.g. potatoes, beets), Pepsi Cola and anything else that might available in the Ukraine at that time.
Even so, it is not possible to cater for everyone's private needs, so we have prepared a suggested list of items you may wish to bring for your own use, some of them necessary, others optional. Bring enough to make your stay comfortable but not too much to make traveling unbearable. As yet the Ukrainian economy is not geared for the capitalist market. This means that there are very few stores, and those that do exist have very few items. In other words, bring what you need do not expect to buy it there. Although it will make things much easier to travel as light as possible, it should be remembered that items Westerners take for granted are considered luxuries in the Ukraine.
Since your tickets, room and board will have been pre-paid, do not bring too much extra cash. There are many locals who would be happy to "lighten your load," so please be careful. In Uman itself the only times you are likely to need local currency is at a store or to pay the entrance fee to the Sofiefka Park or the municipal bathhouse. In other words, you may only need a few coins - do not convert large amounts. There is also ample opportunity to bargain and barter. For this purpose, small bills, such as single dollar bills, can come in handy, and as a supplement, cigarettes and chewing gum are also a valuable bargaining commodity. If you do want to purchase something, it would be wise to find out what others have paid before you approach a "vendor." Do not be afraid to bargain. On Rosh HaShanah 1991, the average Ukrainian's monthly salary was about 500 rubles, which is roughly equivalent to $15-20.
At least five languages are common currency at the Rosh HaShanah gathering in Uman: Hebrew, English, Yiddish, French and Russian. Fluency in any one is sufficient to get you through, though you might want to brush up on a few phrases in one or more of the others - who knows, you might find yourself sitting next to someone extraordinary! People from many different backgrounds come to the Rebbe's Tzion for Rosh HaShanah, so the variety of different minhagim (customs) is tremendous. Don't be afraid to ask people why they are doing what they are doing. Most will be happy to explain both the simple and esoteric reasons.
As on any foreign trip, it is best to avoid drinking tap water. Bottled drinks or boiled water are preferable. The meals provided by the Vaad are quite plentiful and wholesome. However they are provided only upon arrival in Uman, so bring enough food for 2-3 meals/snacks per day prior to your arrival in Uman as well as sufficient food for your return trip. Any tasty morsel that might increase your Yom Tov and Shabbos enjoyment should also be brought. Bring a little extra to share with your friends as they will undoubtedly do the same. Please realize that to seat and serve some 2,500 people at one time is not very easy! The "kitchen staff" and "waiters" are very dedicated - but only human - even if they are chassidim. Therefore, you might want to bring your own food and eat in your lodgings.
The Vaad always has hot water in the kitchen area for tea and coffee but you might wish to make your own where you sleep. So you might add a small water cooker, hot cups, tea, coffee and sugar (or substitute). (Make sure electrical appliances are adapted for 220v.)
The Ukraine is a northern country and the weather in Uman during September can be cold and wet. You'll be thankful you brought rain and winter gear. Don't expect central heating - you can always take layers off.
Tikkun HaKlali and other prayers that can be recited at different gravesites (many Tzaddikim are buried in the area - don't pass them by!)
It's a good idea to make your own detailed list, so you can check off each item as you pack. Some miscellaneous items also helpful are:
Don't hesitate to bring any other items that will add to your comfort on the trip - just remember to keep it light. Stay focused on the purpose of your trip and you will be able to get the very most out of it!
Perhaps the most important accomplishment of the Vaad has been to keep costs to an absolute minimum. Realizing the financial stresses on almost everyone's pockets, the Vaad has for the past few years made arrangements with travel agents for unbelievably low prices. For example, for Rosh HaShanah 1991, the round trip to Uman from Israel - including air-fare, visas, transfer to and from Kiev airport, accommodation and board for the week - was only $600! From New York, the price was $1,100. For those who wished to travel via Medzeboz (gravesite of the Baal Shem Tov) and other cities, there was no extra charge.
The Ukraine declared independence in January, 1992, and have announced their plans to introduce their own currency by April of 1992. Many changes are rapidly occurring and one who wishes to register for Rosh HaShanah should inquire in the early summer, preferably 2-3 months before Rosh HaShanah. The Vaad will then be in a position to give you up-to-date information.
In addition, the Vaad is hoping to introduce many improvements and is seeking to lower prices by Rosh HaShanah 1992. In 1991, those coming from North America were able to fly direct from Moscow to the Uman military airfield, bypassing Kiev and eliminating a four-hour bus ride. This year rights to fly direct to Uman are being sought for all arrivals, but arrangements have yet to be finalized. At the time of writing, the Vaad is engaged in negotiations with the Ukrainian state and Uman city authorities to obtain permission to build a complex near the Tzion to accommodate the ever-increasing numbers of visitors to Uman.
For those wishing to travel to Uman for Rosh HaShanah, registering with the Vaad is highly recommended as they will take care of all necessary arrangements - from travel arrangements and visas to accommodation and board - for the lowest possible cost. For those whose trips necessitate individual arrangements, it is still possible to register with the Vaad for accommodation so as to be assured of a place on arrival (though accommodation is always available even at the last minute.)
As of this time, both Russia and the Ukraine require entry visas. Because of their shift to capitalism, applying for visas is not the lengthy ordeal it once was. Any travel agent can generally secure the necessary visa within a few days, and it is recommended that you obtain your visa prior to travel in order to speed up your entry. You need to fill in a form, or the agent will do it for you. Three passport photos are required. Nevertheless it is no problem to get a visa even at the last minute: it is possible to apply for a visa on arrival at Kiev or moscow airport. Entering through Moscow, however, necessitates an additional visa (time and money). Therefore, it is advisable for those who can to fly directly to Kiev. But be prepared for a slow moving line - it can take an hour or more for the authorities to complete all the formalities (in triplicate, by hand! How else?!).
Please note: Those planning to enter the Ukraine on Erev Shabbos or Erev Yom Tov should make certain to obtain their visa in advance. Between airport formalities and travel time to Uman, there is no time to waste. Obviously, one's flight arrival time must be carefully checked before setting out on one's journey, and allowance should be made for unforeseen delays en route. The fact that one is traveling to Uman is no justification for desecrating Shabbos. One possibility would be to plan to arrive in Kiev on Erev Shabbos, stay in Kiev for Shabbos and then proceed to Uman after Shabbos.
Those from the diaspora who wish to combine their trip to Uman with a visit to Israel either before or after Rosh HaShanah should be aware that all Vaad flights from Israel to the Ukraine and back are chartered, and there is no guarantee that space will be available for those flying only one way. Prices and available space on flights should be verified before making travel arrangements. Those wishing to include Israel in their trip would be advised to consider booking regular flights. Check with your Vaad representative.
Those arriving in Kiev on their own can take a taxi directly from the airport to Uman (about three hours by cab). Ukrainian taxis seat four only and their baggage compartments are small, so be forewarned about the difficulties involved in transporting large suitcases. Although in 1991 the price for the trip from Kiev to Uman was $30 (!) fluctuations in the value of the ruble have brought increases in prices, and one might even be charged as much as $100 for the trip (though this is still inexpensive for a 150 mile journey). Things could easily have changed again by Rosh HaShanah time. Be wary of the "socialist-turned-capitalist" taxi drivers who know of our desire to get to Uman and wish to capitalize on it. Do not be afraid to bargain and please do not simply accept their stated price as they will then overcharge everyone else who follows. It sometimes pays to travel from the airport into Kiev, where one can pick up a taxi for less.
On arrival in Uman one should ask for either: 1) Ulitza Belinskogo (Belinskogo street); 2) Ulitza Pushkina; 3) Rebbe Nachman, or 4) chassidim. By Rosh HaShanah time, the residents of Uman will be fully aware of the presence of the Breslover Chassidim and will direct the driver accordingly. A small street map of some major streets in Uman is provided for your convenience, to help you orient yourself. Remember that the local alphabet is Cyrillic and most Ukrainians do not understand English. Be prepared for blank stares.
In the next section we have provided a registration form to enable the Vaad to apply for your visa, make flight reservations and arrange the necessary accommodations. Please be sure to copy your family name, passport number and all the necessary information directly from your passport, so that all the information is accurate. This will help in expediting your application. Also, please ascertain when the flights are scheduled to leave and return, so you can make your preference known when registering.
The deposit requested in 1991 was $100.00 and is most likely to remain the same. Prices will be kept to an absolute minimum but the final price will not be known until midsummer. Please check with the person you register for up-to-date information.
We point out that a cut-off date is necessary to enable the Vaad to finalize the prices for the charter flights. Those registering after that date might find themselves with extra expenses for regularly scheduled flights and/or other charges (e.g. rush visas, etc.). So for your own benefit, try to register early. Even so, last minute arrangements can often be made.
Many people bring their young sons to Uman because of Rebbe Nachman's promise that any boy coming to him before the age of seven would be protected from impurity. The Vaad makes arrangements for children to be accommodated with their fathers. Parents should make sure to bring suitable clothing, snacks and some toys etc. Be advised that in some countries (e.g. Israel, England) you can register your children on your passport, thereby saving additional visa fees. Include any children traveling with you in your registration form. Other countries (e.g. USA) require a separate passport for each child, necessitating separate applications, registration and visas. Important reminder. If you are bringing children, be sure your reservations are all for the same flight. at just wouldn't do to return home without the children, no matter how tempting!)
The following are either representatives of the Vaad or will be able to assist you in contacting the Vaad and in other ways.
The Breslov Research Institute is truly honored to have Presented the what and whys of Rosh HaShanah in Uman, hoping that this short yet large- booklet will encourage many others to join us. Though we are not the Vaad, we are prepared - and pleased - to act as an information center for those who have any questions. For those who seek updated information, we suggest you make your inquiries about ten weeks before Rosh HaShanah (during July and August). Our addresses and telephones are:
May HaShem inscribe us this year, and every year, in the Book of the Righteous, for good health and success in all our endeavors. And, may we all merit to see the Coming of the Mashiach, the Ingathering of the Exiles and the Rebuilding of the Holy Temple, Amen.
Two first half goals from Cameroon star Vincent Aboubakar helped Porto grab a place in the last 16 of the European Champions League with victory over Monaco.
Their 5-2 win in the final group game, coupled with RB Leipzig’s defeat by Besiktas, was enough to see them through.
Aboubakar’s opener came in the 9th minute, he doubled the lead just after the half-hour mark and Algeria’s Yacine Brahimi added a third before half time.
By that stage both teams had been reduced to 10 men, because Porto’s Felipe and Monaco’s Rachid Ghezzal were sent off after a clash between the two.
Monaco looked like they might make a game of it when Kamil Glik scored a penalty on the hour, but the lead was back to three just minutes later, when Alex Telles scored a fine goal.
A late strike from Radamel Falcao against his old club was not enough to get Monaco back into the game and Tiquinho Soares completed the rout with a couple of minutes to go.
Aboubakar has now scored 17 goals in all competitions this season, but he described the win as a “great collective performance” after the game.

Preview : When initially published in 2005, the two-volume Encyclopedia of Public Relations was the first and most authoritative compilation of the subject. It remains the sole reference source for any library serving patrons in business, communication, and journalism as it explores the evolution of the field with examples describing the events, changing practices, and key figures who developed and expanded the profession. Reader’s Guide topics include Crisis Communications & Management, Cyberspace, Ethics, Global Public Relations, Groups, History, Jargon, Management, Media, News, Organizations, Relations, Reports, Research, and Theories & Models. Led by renowned editor Robert L. Heath, with advisory editors and contributors from around the world, the set is designed to reach a wide array of student readers who will go on to serve as opinion leaders for improving the image and ethics of the practice.
The Second Edition continues to explore key challenges facing the profession, such as earning the trust and respect of critics and the general public. Much greater emphasis and space will be placed on a theme that was just emerging when the First Edition appeared: the Internet and social media as public relations tools. International coverage and representation has been greatly expanded, as well. Finally, biographies (which are now widely available on the Web) have been deleted to give room to areas of enhanced coverage, and biographical material are included where appropriate within the context of topical entries. However, a long entry on women pioneers in public relations has been included as an appendix.

So, it's no surprise to any long time readers that I LOVE to pick up furniture off the side of the road. Okay, well truth be told I hate to actually do it, but I am really goo at convincing my husband to do it for me! I have gotten quite a few signature pieces around my house from another man's trash.
The latest addition to the trash to treasures stash was a dresser for our coming baby's nursery. I had been searching garage sales ALL week long, and low and behold my husband happened to drive by the perfect project right around the corner from our house. My favorite thing about it, it was FREE!
To keep with the 'free' theme, I used some leftover 'Manhattan Mist' paint from our living room makeover last summer. It is the perfect gray/ blue hue to tie the other nursery elements together.
It was a slight bummer that the dresser didn't come with knobs, but who am I to complain? I found just what I was looking for at Hobby Lobby, and wouldn't you know, knobs were 50% off that week. So, for a grand total of $23.00, I purchased 17 new knobs for my dresser. (Yes, I need 18, so I am on the search for just one more!)
While this dresser is old, all of the drawers are in working condition, it is the perfect size, and it was just the right price. I love thrifty finds! And with all the other money we are putting into another nursery, I am sure my husband doesn't mind either. check out the sweet detail on the base of the dresser below, it might just be my favorite part!
Next week begins July, and a new weekly layout for us here at LTC. We hope that you will join us for our first ever LINK party next Thursday! I cannot wait to see what you have to share with us then!
1.) Visit Cutting Edge Stencils and then leave a comment letting us know what your very favorite stencil is and where you want to use it.
I shared my son's stenciled closet with you a few weeks ago. I was so excited to find that it made the Top 10 on The CSI Project. It was among some absolutely amazing painted walls and I couldn't believe it.
When I discovered that Cutting Edge Stencils had a new polka-dot stencil, I knew that would be my next choice. I love polka-dots. Really though, who doesn't?
Last summer, I made over the girls room to accomodate both new baby and big girl which I shared here, it instantly became my favorite room in the house. It filled up quick with all their "stuff" and when we had to make room for a dollhouse, it only made sense to take the closet doors off. It makes the room appear larger and it is pretty fun to look at all the sweet dresses hanging there in the closet. And after seeing the finished product in my son's room, I am now a huge fan of stenciled closets. It was the girls turn now and their closet needed some polka-dots, of course.
So I got my husband to help me this time because it was a bigger closet and there was more shelving to mess with. I convinced him it would be a great way to spend our Saturday! : )
Now it was time for the fun to begin. I purchased 2 half pint Valspar samples. I wanted a light and subtle pink. My big girl and I chose the color Utterly Pink and it was just right for this project. And at $3 a pop, this was the perfect amount of paint at the perfect price.
I was kind of wishing I didn't have to put anything back in the closet because the polka-dots were so fun and pretty to look at. But in the spirit of functionality and organization, everything had to be put back in its place.
They make the perfect backdrop for cute little dresses and fun girly things that fill up their closet.
Also, I have fun news for YOU...tomorrow will be another chance to win a Cutting Edge Stencil of your choice!
Hope you've been enjoying all of the fun guest posts that we've had every Monday this month! I'm so grateful to these talented ladies for sharing some great things with all of us, and giving me a bit of a break to get adjusted to my new sweet girl and her addition to our family.
Speaking of, I figured that since I have been talking about our new little lady so much for the past several months, that you just might like to meet her.
I finally got to try out a few of my photo props this weekend as well, so this is 2 1/2 week old newborn gorgeousness. Isn't she lovely?
Also, the baby bowl and baby cocoon are from this shop, which is currently running a 20% off discount for Lemon Tree Creations readers until the end of June, which is this Thursday!
Well, I need to get back to baby duty, but I'm looking forward to sharing more projects with you all soon, including the rest of the nursery reveal, which I've been able to get back to a bit now that I'm not on bed rest any longer! Happy Monday!!
Every 2nd and 3rd Thursday of the month we will be having a featured Guest Poster. We have such talented and creative followers and we would love for you to showcase yourself and your blog here on Lemon Tree!!
Projects should not have been posted previously on your own personal blog, and we ask you wait one week before re-posting. If you are interested, email your project ideas and some fun information about yourself to ltc.guestposting@gmail.com to apply. I know we are going to have too much fun looking through all of your fun projects!
Well today I have some of her lovely baby goodies, courtesy of her Etsy shop, OED & me, to share with you!!
Amanda's shop hasn't been open for too long, but as soon as I caught wind of it I was emailing her about making a few goodies for our little one. I received my package a few weeks ago and was SO excited. A few of my items were custom made, so I wasn't sure exactly what they would look like until I opened them up. They were all wrapped up like little Christmas gifts, (or baby gifts, I guess), and I really had to restrain myself from tearing them open as soon as the package arrived. But my strong urge to photo-document everything forced a tiny bit of patience and then I was free to tear away.
First up, Amanda has a shop full of these adorable little Claire cloches, and can do other colors if you want something that isn't pictured. Isn't it sweet?! Mine is a 0-3 month size and I just love the colors. I can't wait to pop it onto baby's little noggin.
A fun thing about Amanda's shop is that she has a few custom crochet listings, so if you have a pattern for something, but don't knit or crochet yourself, or have the time too, you can send her the pattern and she will make the item for you. Pretty great right? I thought so, especially since I had been eyeing a few patterns on Etsy that I desperately wanted someone to make for me. I just bought the pattern, forwarded it to her with some details about yarn preference, she made them and sent them to me! Which is how I got this fun little tasseled hat. It's a newborn size and perfect.
Among these knitted and crocheted beauties, Amanda also has prints and notecards of some of her photographs in her shop. She included one with my package and I was thrilled.
Little details like these are one of the reasons that I love Etsy so much! Cute packaging and attention to details makes it feel like you are receiving a special gift, not just something you ordered. Here are a few other goodies from her shop.
**In honor of our new little bundle of joy, you can receive 20% off of your order from OED & Me from now until June 30. You simply enter the code LEMON at checkout.**
If you have a baby on the way, or know someone else who does, head on over to OED & Me now and see what goodies you can have sent their way!!
I knew exactly how I wanted to design our new nursery if we were having girl. I had a vision of everything I didn't do in my first little girl's nursery, and I wanted to do just that. It was going to be modern, fresh, and unexpected...
So naturally we went to the doctor for our big ultrasound to discover we were having a sweet little...boy! Don't get me wrong, I was very, very excited! I have definitely always wanted one of each, and thought having a baby boy was the perfect addition to our family. I did not, however, have a clear version of the nursery or what I really wanted. So naturally I went searching for inspiration. And let me tell you, I found it in a little known treasure...Restoration Hardware Baby & Child. I mean do you know how fabulous there nurseries are? It seems to me Pottery Barn gets a ton of hype in the blogosphere these days, (and don't get me wrong, I love it too), but Rh Baby & Child is amazing!
I can't wait to share with you the nursery we have designed from it's inspiration, including the bedding we chose, but for now I have a simple project to share that jumped right off it's pages to me: These vintage clipboards...
If you look really close, you can see where I got my idea from this great page taken from the RH Baby & Child Catalog.
There are many ideas I used from this room, but I particularly love how the clipboards serve as a great and unexpected display space. For some reason it just screams little boy! Seeing as how I was fresh out of old, vintage clipboards, I decided I would just have to make my own. Here are a few quick and easy steps I used:
1) I purchased memo sized clipboards from Staples. I wanted something that could easily hold flashcards or pictures in the future. A traditional sized board seemed like it would overpower smaller displays, so I decided I could just add some larger ones later when we actually had some art work to display.
2) After some trial and error, I combined two antiquing mediums to get the look I was going for. I followed the directions from the back of the bottles for applying with a sponge brush, rubbing off, and rinsing while wet to get just the right look.
3) I wanted to add something to the boards to dress them up just incase I had nothing to display. I decided I wanted to add some simple numbers, so while the clipboard was drying, I turned to my Silhouette studio to look for the right font. I then cut them out in silhouette vinyl to create a super quick and easy stencil. This was the first time I have used the silhouette to create a stencil with vinyl, and I have to say it has revolutionized the way I stencil from now on! The pictures will show you just what you need to finish off this project!
Once I finished the first one, it was easy sailing from then on! I did all three in a matter of minutes.
(This picture really shows how the antiquing medium addeed some depth and texture to the very new clipboards.)
I decided to prop the clipboards up on the board and batten ledge just above the dresser, securing the stops with a very small 3M poster strip 'just in case.' I am loving the result (though I would love to find a quick and easy way to take the edge off those silver Staples clips?)
It's our third {Link Up} with Lemon Tree and you all have already outdone yourselves! I am loving going through all of these great links and finding tons of inspiration. It's not too late to stop by and link up your favorite projects from this month as well.
I just wanted to let you know that I featured your Nursery subway art on my blog from my part Show and Share. come and check it out and grab my button
My husband saw your comment on my blog, clicked through to your site, and when he got home he said that y'all look like you would be my friends. :)
Before I continue with the LG 1800 I'll try a manipulation of an LG 3390. Hopefully my CCG has made no mistake, because getting it open with two identical numbers would really be a disappointment.
Regarding the manipulation ... I can only recommend to make a hole into back cover at the position where the lever nose comes down into the cam gate. That is partly covered by the fence lever control device, but it is possible to look below the FLCD to the lever nose. With this hole you can really have a look and understand how the FLCD works. There are variations in the locks which determine when the lever is lowered and raised. There are different contact points depending on the lowering and raising. The variations are not as big as in a 3330, but I believe they are exploitable when the reading is more precise. I hope a 1/16th of a number will be sufficient.
Not easy at all. After nearly four hours dialing I mostly know the low areas of each wheel, have some good positions, but I still can't identify for sure any gate. Graphs are also changing depending on dialing a single combination or making a scan. Btw. the left CP is not really helpful and the right CP is in the range of 7 6/8th to 8 0/8th. In the last halve hour of dialing I have changed my method of reading the CP. Maybe that will help with future dialing. I wonder if a should increase the resolution from reading each 2.5th number.
Open in 353 minutes. 92/16/47. I will look for more colors so that the multiple graphs are not confusing me. Btw. the 6630 is IMHO more difficult to manipulate than the 3390.
Did you find any obvious weakness in the 3390 mechanism that could lead to malfunction? My local safe tech have a strong dislike to the 3390, as it is used on ATMs here and give him a lot of trouble as they malfunction. He will not disclose if there are any common faults or if they are different from time to time, suffice to say they are of bad quality and that he does'nt recommend them for my own private safes. Obviously, ATM locks see much use, and they will eventually wear out...
The obvious weakness is the construction of the fence lever control device and drive cam from zamak cast. When the pin on the cam or lever is worn or broken of there is no chance to open the lock. This provides a lot of business to safe men. The reliability of the 3330 was much better, but AFAIK it isn't produced anymore and the 3390 should take its place. The more high end LG locks (1985, 1947, 3332) are much more robust due to to better quality. If you are stuck with 3390 check regularly the condition of the cam, lever and control device (aka tomahawk). I can't give you a recommendation on what "regularly" should be. Spontaneous inspections should always be done when the behavior of the lock changes. (Needs suddenly more force for turning the dial, needs multiple tries to open the lock, and so on.) If you see any worrying wear or defects, the parts should be replaced. As for normal people parts are not so easily available that means probably a replacement of the complete lock. The high end locks can also break, much more seldom. There e.g. the pin mounted on the cam can get stuck and stops to rotate. This increases the likelihood of a malfunction. So a more seldom inspection can't hurt there either.
Photo of the 3390. Problematic points circled. All thin, moving, sliding Zamak parts. If anything breaks or is worn to much the lock probably won't open because the lever stays where it is.
Thanks! My sample has the "fence lever control device" made out of plastic. Hmmm could it be better than all Zamak? Somehow I doubt it...
On cover is "3330" and "Group 2". On the side is a sticker with "Group 2M". It looks like a 3330, but has an additional black part. Does someone know what this is?
That almost looks like it is set up to work with an alarm. Like you dial the combination off by 10 numbers and that black piece drops in and loses contact setting off the alarm.
Weird... that is interesting. Looks like it's attached to wheel 3, and seems to be blocking a second gate on that wheel... from the open gap on the side of the casing there, I'd expect some other mechanism (time lock maybe?) would block that arm from pivoting and allowing the fence to fall into that second gate. Looks like it pivots in about the middle of that black piece, so there'd need to be room for the back end of it to pivot outward. Just a guess, tho. Not sure how that plays to increase manipulation resistance, and whether it's a custom job or factory. My 3330 doesn't have anything like that, and the 3332 2M has the more traditional tomahawk-style lifter arm. Curious...
@mdc5150, yeah, I was also thinking maybe switches, going on the second cutout on the other side. I have seen a few locks with switches in those positions, one will alert if the wheel is turned and one will alert if the lock is opened, I believe.
My 3390s have a thin wall opposing the bolt which can be cut out to form the same space as in this lock. My 3330 doesn't have this. If the lock can be used as it is, then I assume manipulation is easier, because the high point of the lever can be easily detected and next to it must be the real gate.
I have no lock with a cut out near the bolt or the possibility to do this in any LG I have, but I have one with a pin blocking the bolt which must be retracted electrically.
That cutout is for an alarm contact and the black part is part of the "misdial by 10" mechanism to set it off. I can get pictures later of a similar lock I have.

Would you please attach me cc to those pictures you speak of please? I am intrigued by the 'combo plus ten' arrangement of which you speak...
How would you go about manipulation of such a lock, without using the words 4amp drill,carbide,or drill bits....?
crossing paths with people who have spent all day panicking and FRANTIC, desperately trying to recall the combination of a key operated lock
Confused with how working your way around the dial to get contact point readings wouldn't activate the alarm feature?

The alarm is not monitoring for someone manipulating, you can spin the dial all you want it wont go off.
If the combination to the lock is 20-40-60 and you dial 20-40-60 and then back to wherever the drop in is, the lock will open and no alarm.
If a robber has a gun to your head and you are "under duress", you would instead dial 20-40-50 and then back to the drop in, the lock will still open, but a silent duress alarm will be triggered when the fence goes into the gates and that black plastic piece pushes against a switch which in your photos is missing. I have one of these locks and will try to post some photos.
The 3rd wheel has 2 gates in it, 10 numbers apart. No matter what you set the combination to, the "duress combination" is always 10 numbers less on the 3rd number. if you used a change key and made the new combination 10-20-66 then the duress combo would be 10-20-55
Manipulation wise, I do not know off hand if this feature makes the LG any easier to manipulate, other than you have a better chance to find a gate on the 3rd wheels, the other wheels you have to map out manually like on a normal lock without any additional gates or alarm features.
From the photo on ebay the alarm lever should be very visible on an AWx graph - unless the lever is moving really easily.
TIP! Give freebies. This gives the customer a feeling like they got more than they paid for and will entice them to purchase from you again.
Increasing the traffic to your website can be beneficial to your business. One really effective way to do this is through article promotion. This article provides valuable guidance that will show you exactly how you can increase the success of your business with article marketing.
TIP! Make your own original logo! Logos are not only for huge, major corporations. Having a eye-catching and rememberable logo will help your readers find your work and encourage return visits when your logo is spotted elsewhere on the web.
Free stuff is the best way to attract people! Freebies make customers like you. When these freebies are branded with your logo, it will act as free advertising when your client publicly uses it. Choose a logo that is relevant to your business and focus on making it visible.
TIP! Let readers comment or ask them to send you feedback. People generally like to provide feedback and have a voice.
If readers can comment on your articles, you need to use the link attribute “no follow”. When users leave comments that are spam, web crawlers can be alerted that such links should not be followed. Doing so will allow you to ensure that your site’s reputation is not compromised by spam sites.
TIP! Use a mixed level of writing in your articles. When working to promote something that involves technical intricacies, be sure you do not neglect to discuss them.
Your email communications should include a great deal of content. You don’t want to be branded as a spammer. This will lose you present and future customers and may actually get you into legal trouble. Make sure your emails have relevant content and help attract customers to your site rather than annoy them with junk. If you don’t put appropriate content in your emails, people will unsubscribe from your mailing list and you will lose potential and actual customers.
TIP! Make sure you’re submitting a lot of articles. When submitting your articles to blogs, make sure that you do so regularly.
Ask the people you email if they can give you some feedback. Your readers will feel useful if you allow them to tell you what they like and dislike. Letting them give you feedback lets them give you their ideas. They will like this, and you will get some valuable insight into what they are looking for.
TIP! Forget about using automatic writing services. While you can generate many articles quickly this way, it doesn’t mean they will be of high quality.
Make your paragraphs short, like this tip. Popular opinion supports the theory that people stand a higher chance of becoming distracted when reading their material online, rather than from a book or paper. Make each section as concise as possible, while maintaining quality, in regards to content.
TIP! You still need to know about SEO and internet marketing as a whole if you expect to be a great article marketer. Search engine optimization needs to be learned because it helps your articles rank higher on search engines.
Write articles that are informative. These articles should be relevant to your business and show you as a valid expert in the niche, thereby creating trust with visitors. As original content, these articles will also boost your rank in search engine results, since they favor sites with plenty of unique content.
TIP! Unless sites delete your articles for some reason, they will be forever viewed by readers, and will always serve to drive visitors to your site. It is also possible to write articles that in turn will promote other articles that you’ve written.
In the most successful article marketing campaigns, the articles will be shared all over the Internet. This is positive since articles will have working links that go back to the original author’s site. When those links are retained, search engine indexing is improved and new readers can be drawn in. Broken or missing links negatively affect the benefits of posting articles.
TIP! You can use new articles to promote older content. All you need to do is add links to related content in the body of your article.
There are many tools to help you with visibility. Many tools and tricks can be utilized to get your articles greater exposure and readership, such as article directories. While some do have a small cost, others are free. Look for these as a cheap way to build audience.
TIP! Do you need article ideas? Changing the view point of your writing can be an interesting way to generate new article ideas. For example, if you are writing travel articles, try to target a subgroup in this niche topic.
Article marketing, as you can see, may be the most effective way to grow your business. When used correctly, article promotion is one of the best ways to drive traffic to your site.

Because of much persecution, suffering and affliction, Paul had to battle against the accusations by false teachers that he was not a true apostle of Christ. These men tried to prejudice the minds of the people against Paul and his friends. In this chapter he declares his uncompromising zeal and integrity in preaching the gospel, so that if any did not see the glory and truth of it, it was because they were blinded by Satan and the hardness of their own hearts, not from want of a true minister and is a true message.
(Vs. 1.) 'Therefore, seeing we have this "ministry of the Spirit and life (written on the heart, not in letter but spirit) of justification and a perfect righteousness through Christ, this ministry of the redemptive glory of God in the person and work of Christ, we do not get discouraged nor faint in our spirit because of difficulties and trials (John 16:33; 2 Tim. 3:12; Phil. 1:29). Our call to the ministry is by the mercy and grace of God, as is our strength and power to persevere through many hardships" (2 Cor. 12:9; Acts 18:9, 10). The best man would faint under the work and perish under trial and burdens without the mercy and grace of God (1 Cor. 15:10).
(Vs. 2.) "We renounce the hidden things of dishonesty" - that is, they were the same men in private as they were in public. In regard to conduct, conversation and doctrine, they were open and above board (Matt. 7:15). The false teachers have much to hide in motive, manners and methods; they speak one thing in secret and another in the congregation. "We do not walk in craftiness, practising trickery and cunning, using people to further our gain and glory, disguising our true goals." There are many hucksters and merchandisers of souls who use religion and the gospel to promote themselves and not the glory of God (2 Peter 2:1-3). "We do not handle the Word of God deceitfully," corrupting it with human work, tradition and philosophy. "We do not keep back a part of it, twist it to suit the flesh, and cry "peace" when there is no peace (Gal. 2:21; Acts 20:20, 27). We commend ourselves (in the presence and sight of God) to every man's conscience by preaching with plainness and boldness the truth of the gospel as it is revealed in the Lord Jesus" (Heb. 13:17). An upright way of life and a true message of Christ crucified are all the recommendations a minister needs before men and women who know God.
(Vs. 3.) The apostle calls the gospel "our gospel" because he was saved by it, he was an instrument of God called to preach it, he was in love with and obsessed by it and he was entrusted with it (1 Tim. 1:11, 12). If that blessed gospel of the grace of God be hidden so that men do not understand, receive and believe it, the fault is not in the gospel nor in the preaching of it, but in the men themselves. For they are lost, blind, dead, natural men who have no spiritual perception nor taste for the things of God (1 Cor. 2:14,15). All mankind are in a lost condition by birth and because of sin. God has purposed to save the lost through Christ (Luke 19:10). Ho chose some, Christ redeemed them and the Spirit calls them by the gospel. However, many will be lost for ever, left in blindness and sin under the dominion of Satan. Some writers believe these who will be lost for ever are the people referred to in verses 3 and 4.
(Vs. 4.) "The god of this world" (because of the context and the work of deception and blinding man's eyes to the gospel) can only refer to Satan. Nowhere else do we find him called by this name, but our Lord twice referred to him as "the prince of this world" (John 12:31; 14:30). What he blinds is "the mind" - the understanding. Those who believe not are under the influence of Satan (Eph. 2:1-3), who penetrates hearts and minds with prejudice, pride, error and ignorance. By divine permission, he bears great power in the world and in the hearts of men. His design is to keep men in darkness and ignorance and, while he cannot keep the gospel out of this world, his business is to keep it out of men's hearts. The glorious gospel is the gospel of God's glory (Exod. 33:18, 19) in Christ. Christ, who is the express image and revelation of God, is the sum and substance of the gospel (Rom. 1:1-3) and salvation is having Christ revealed to and in us (Gal. 1:15),
(Vs. 5.) We preach not ourselves, our opinions, our philosophies, nor do we preach to promote ourselves nor supply ourselves with life's necessities. We preach Christ Jesus, the Lord (1 Cor. 2:2). We preach Christ, the Messiah, Prophet, Priest and King, fulfilment of every Old Testament type and promise; Jesus, Son of man, Man of sorrows, numbered with the transgressions, tempted in all points; the Lord, very God of very God, King of kings and Lord of lords. We are your servants for his sake' (Matt. 20:26, 27).
(Vs. 6.) In the creation of the world, God made something out of nothing. He commanded light to shine in darkness (Gen. 1:3). So in the new creation in Christ, God makes something out of nothing and commands the light (Christ is the light) to shine into our darkened hearts to give us the true knowledge of God and his glory (1 John 5:20). As light was the tint production in creation, so the light of Christ is the first thing in the new creation. Conviction of sin (John 16:8-10), the honouring of the law (Rom. 5:19), the satisfaction of God's justice (Rom. 3:25,26), and faith (Gal. 2:20) are all accomplished in the sinner in relation to Christ Jesus. Even our spiritual growth is in the grace and knowledge of Christ (2 Peter 3:18). So from the new birth to perfect conformity to Christ, the whole of the work of redemption is relative to Christ.
The Hyundai Equus promises to be a dark horse in the large luxury class with its competitive performance, extensive equipment roster, world-class quality and extraordinary value pricing. Lexus and Infiniti took a similar approach back in the day, and now it's Hyundai's turn. For about $60,000 when new, the Hyundai Equus offers the space, comfort and amenities of fully optioned high-end sedans costing close to $90,000 or more.
Even if the Equus isn't quite as performance-oriented as more athletic European thoroughbreds, Hyundai is betting most drivers won't notice or care as they happily pocket a price difference equal to the value of a small sport sedan. Not only that, but the Hyundai Equus appears capable of shaking up the segment with its remarkably quiet and limousine-like cabin, top-drawer amenities, long warranty and unique dealer service program.
Hyundai aims to break down the barriers of owning a luxury car with the introduction of its all-new flagship, the Hyundai Equus. Equus will compete with the best luxury sedans in the world on all levels including amenities, performance, advanced technologies, design and ownership experience when it arrives at select Hyundai dealerships in the late summer of 2010.
In 1999, Hyundai Motors and Mitsubishi Motors presented their full-size sedan. Hyundai said that it was making a full-size sedan to compete with Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series in the Korean market. The first generation was designed by Mitsubishi Motors who had their own version called the Proudia. It was jointly manufactured by both companies.

What began as a way to describe misinformation was quickly diverted into a propaganda tool. The BBC's Dave Lee examines how "fake news"...
On Wednesday, Representative Peter King (R-NY) held his second round of anti-Muslim congressional hearings. He held the first round back in March, which I critiqued at the time in a Harrisonburg Daily News-Record column. Stephen Prothero, who teaches religion at Boston University, wrote a good piece for CNN criticizing the second round by connecting it to past examples of religious bigotry. Prothero correctly noted that the hearings "betray American values." Similarly, Representative Michael Honda (D-CA) penned a CNN piece comparing the attitude leading to these hearings to the attitude that resulted in his family being put in an internment camp during World War II when he was a kid. Honda wrote:
This time, instead of creating an ethnic enemy, Rep. King is creating a religious enemy. Because of prejudice, war hysteria and a failure of Republican leadership, King is targeting the entire Muslim-American community. Similar to my experience, they are become increasingly marginalized and isolated by our policies.
He added that the hearings are "morally and strategically wrong-headed," "counterproductive," and "un-American." Unfortunately, the King hearings are not the only effort to disenfranchise an entire group of citizens. Republican presidential hopeful and former pizza chain head Herman Cain, who has made several anti-Muslim comments (see post here), recently told Glenn Beck that he would require Muslims--and only Muslims--to take a special loyalty oath to serve in his presidential administration. During the Republican presidential debate on Monday, Cain repeated his attacks on Muslims. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich also jumped in to offer his attacks on Muslims, as he has done in the past (see post here). As I noted in my new book (Presidential Campaign Rhetoric in an Age of Confessional Politics ), Muslims are one of the main disenfranchised classes in our age of confessional politics.
Efforts are growing across the nation to ban Sharia (Islamic law) from being used in American courts, even though this is not a credible threat. In essence, politicians are using exaggerated fear appeals to gain votes. A study by the ACLU shows that U.S. courts are not implementing Sharia. Unfortunately, many of the efforts to get people concerned about this supposed Muslim threat are led by Christians. For instance, the Missouri Baptist newsletter The Pathway claimed there is a threat of Sharia in Missouri. Even worse, The Pathway attacked Muslims for daring to use their rights as citizens to show up at the State Capitol to speak out against anti-Muslim bigotry. Warning that "[d]ozens of Muslim women in head scarves came to the State Capitol," the piece turned to the Missouri Baptist Convention's lobbyist to paint a highly inaccurate account of the lobbying effort:
There is a visual impact of seeing dozens and dozens of women in [head scarves]. What I want to know is, will they bring a bloody wife? Will they bring a wife with a black eye? Will they bring a wife with her arm in a sling? Will they bring those wives to the State Capitol and lobby for Sharia Law? I doubt it.
Rather than arguing for Sharia, the day was actually a time to merely argue against the unnecessarily anti-Sharia legislation for demonizing Muslims (see Columbia Missourian article here). Messer's comment is not only inaccurate but clearly shows that the legislation is poisoning public discourse with harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric (by the way, an anti-Sharia bill passed the State House but died in the State Senate so it looks like Missouri is still in danger until next year!). Later in the article, Messer even argued that the mere fact that Muslims would use their rights as citizens to come to the State Capitol to lobby is proof that there is a Sharia threat:
The Muslim community coming into the State Capitol en masse with the specific political agenda of articulating their desire to apply Sharia Law in Missouri changes the discussion in Missouri from a discussion about what could happen in the future to a debate over a real war of worldviews in our culture in Midwest Missouri.
Such a comment gives credence to the claim that Muslims are being reduced to second-class citizens. Demonstrating the fact that the anti-Muslim movement if full of exaggerated fear appeals is a claim in the article:
The Sharia Law worldview, believe it or not, would build on a lobbying day like April 13 and morph it into several Muslim candidates getting elected, targeting and swaying public opinion, and ultimately convincing the Missouri Supreme Court to be "fair" and "tolerant" as they advance the cause of Sharia. There is no end to the non-assimilating follower of Islam working to subdue every corner of the world—a world which most definitely does include a place called Missouri.
So apparently, Muslims are about to not only take over the courts in Missouri but also suddenly win lots of elections and then make Missouri an Islamic state (which seems even less likely than Harold Camping's claim with his new and improved math that the world will now end in October!). Baptists used to be for religious liberty for all people. Now, many Baptists are sadly making stuff up to demonize and marginalize religious minorities.
The Sharia Law worldview, believe it or not, would build on a lobbying day like April 13 and morph it into several Muslim candidates getting elected, targeting and swaying public opinion, and ultimately convincing the Missouri Supreme Court to be "fair" and "tolerant" as they advance the cause of Sharia.
Classic case of projection, given this is exactly the political tactics taken by the Baptists since I can remember (I'm in my 50's and was raised Baptist). Nevertheless, they might be onto something, since it seems to have worked so well for them. I think they fear the competition. Perhaps we would all do well to remember the admonition from Matthew 7 about being judged by the standards by which we judge others.
A couple of examples from this week's news of people abusing authority to inappropriately impose their (Christian) religious beliefs publicly on others:
two gay males with developmental and intellectual disabilities were discriminated against by the staff of The Pavilion based on their sexual orientation
"The Pavilion staff immediately entered the pool area and asked my clients and their staff to leave the Pavilion," stated Shirlyn Perkins, Executive Director of Mending Hearts, Inc. "My staff asked The Pavilion staff why they were being asked to leave, and they were informed that 'gay people' weren't allowed to swim there. My staff told this man that what he was trying to do was discrimination. The man stated that what he was doing was in the Bible and he could do it. My staff continued to argue with this man, but was ultimately forced to leave. My clients, whom already feel ridiculed and different, left the city owned facility crying and embarrassed for trying to participate in 'normal' activities that everyday 'normal' people do."
Campione and Culpepper showed up to the game a little late. Culpepper stopped to use the restroom, giving Campione a quick kiss on the lips as she departed.
Immediately after, a middle-aged, mustached security guard in a Twins hat walked toward her, shaking his head.
When Culpepper came out of the bathroom, Campione told her what happened, and Culpepper decided to confront the security guard.
Sounds a lot like "the Sharia Law worldview" to me. These two groups have more in common (socially, if not theologically) than either one seems to realize. I pray they never join forces.
Your point about "projection" is a good one. Along those lines, I found it quite ironic that the main critic of the Muslim lobby day was the Baptist lobbyist.

It wasn’t easy, but I finally got OpenFTS-0.3.2-tcl to compile on Mac OS X (10.2.8). I started by reading the excellent Mac OS X porting guides from Fink and Apple. Unfortunately, the OpenFTS Makefile and configure scripts aren’t standard, so I had to muck around with things alot. Here’s the diff:
Your fix for makefile doesn’t seem to be working on Panther. Configure script goes through but when compiling I get the following error:
I’ll keep on searching for what should be changed and will keep you posted. Otherwise thanks for spending your time on OS X issues.
In GCC 2, generates shared liibraries. In GCC 3, this option is not supported, so you should use libtool (or use ld directly) instead. Shared libraries in Mac OS X may be different from those you are accustomed to on other platforms. See “Dynamic Libraries and Plug-ins”.
I think you’re trying to compile all of OpenFTS and that doesn’t work (at least I haven’t tried to get it to work). I just wanted to compile the nsfts.so module, which is all that you need for OpenACS. So, instead of doing make in the Search-OpenFTS-tcl-0.3.2 directory, cd aolserver and do the make there.
You’re right. I actually thought I was running the make in aolserver dir, but now that I retried it there, it went through smoothly :o)

We choose to stop playing victim and rise to the occasion. We choose to use our knowledge, skills and information to empower the women, children, men and leaders of the Lebanon and the world at large. A Lebanese teacher, student, migrant and political activist share their Lebanese dreams below.

I chose to rise above all these and have taught love and coexistence to my students and the online community as an editor.

As a writer and political analyst, I share the daily experiences in my field of work, and delve into the loopholes in our society and government, in a bid to shed more light on them. The more we talk about such pressing issues, the more we expose the wrongdoers and continue to change the world one article at a time.

I will not hide the fact that it was a struggle at first, but here I am now, enjoying my golden years, all because I took a risk.' I cannot imagine how my life would have been had I not taken the chance, and I am happy that I took all the hurdles by their horns.
Our contributing writers have shared very empowering messages. If nothing else, I hope we take home the fact that we don't need millions of dollars in order to make our community or the world a better place. Change starts with me and you. Take the first step today in the journey of a better world. What is your Lebanese dream? Write to us.

wal dryl liquid âThe concept of âletâs go out and kill themâ is an archaic approach to a shark attack problem, and its opportunities for success are generally slim-to-none,â Burgess said. âItâs mostly a feel-good revenge â like an âeye for an eyeâ approach â when in fact youâre not likely to catch the shark that was involved in the situation. The shark that was involved in the situation also isnât necessarily likely to do it again.â
Painless weight loss? If you’re desperately trying to squeeze in workouts and avoid your favorite high-calorie treats, it can seem like there’s nothing pain-free about it.
Yet while eating healthier and slipping in exercise does take some work, it really doesn’t have to require heroic effort. Making just a few simple lifestyle changes can pack a big weight loss punch over time.
WebMD spoke to weight loss experts and everyday people who’ve figured out a few painless ways to lose weight — and keep it off. Here are their top tips on how to lose weight without sweating it too much.
Add in healthy goodies you really love, like deep-red cherries, juicy grapes, or crunchy snow peas. Slip those favorite fruits into your bag lunch and breakfast cereal; add the veggies into soups, stews, and sauces.
“Adding in really works, taking away never does,” says registered dietitian David Grotto, RD, LDN, author of 101 Optimal Life Foods, but do remember to keep an eye on overall calories. And don’t forget to add in something physical, too, whether it’s doing a few dance moves before dinner, shooting hoops, or taking a quick stroll.
If the word “exercise” inspires you to creative avoidance, then avoid it. Maybe the trick to enjoying a workout may be to never call it working out.
“There’s some truth to that,” Grotto tells WebMD, and once you start your not-calling-it-exercise plan, Grotto says you’ll discover “the way good health feels knocks down the roadblocks that were preventing you from exercising in the first place.”
So burn calories and invigorate muscles by beachcombing, riding bikes, grass skiing, making snow angels, hiking, washing the car, playing Frisbee, chasing the dog around the yard, or even enjoying great sex. After all, a rose by any other name …
Walking when the weather’s nice is a super-easy way to keep fit, says Diane Virginias, a certified nursing assistant from New York. “I enjoy the seasons,” she says, adding that even when she’s short on time she’ll go out for a few minutes. “Even a five minute walk is a five minute walk.”
It all adds up. If you walk twice a day for 10 minutes and try a few of these tips, you may find yourself with a low-impact, 30-minute workout easily tucked under your belt.
One of the easiest ways to cut back without feeling denied is to switch to lower-calorie versions of the foods you crave. A pizza tastes just as good with reduced-fat cheese, and when you garnish low-fat ice cream with your favorite toppers, who notices those missing calories?
And while you’re trimming fat calories, keep an eye on boosting fiber, suggests registered dietitian Elaine Magee, RD, MPH, author of Tell Me What to Eat If I Suffer From Heart Disease and Food Synergy.
Fiber helps you feel satisfied longer, so while you lighten family favorites, you can easily amp up the fiber by adding a cup of whole wheat flour to your pizza dough, or toss a handful of red bell peppers on the pie.
Don’t forget to lighten the drinks going with that meal. Try switching from high-calorie favorites to diet soda or light beer, or maybe add a spritz of seltzer to your wine.
Hate low-cal drinks? Mix your preferred drinks with a splash of the low-cal option, then increase the ratio as your taste buds adjust. And don’t forget to keep pouring that ultimate beverage, says Magee: water!
Down some water before a meal and you won’t feel so famished, says David Anthony, an information technology consultant from Atlanta. “Drinking a glass of water before a meal helps me watch what I eat. … I don’t just hog everything, since I’m not so hungry.”
Magee, who also writes the “Healthy Recipe Doctor” blog for WebMD, adds that for the compulsive snacker it’s a great idea to keep no-calorie beverages at hand “as a way to keep your mouth busy and less likely to snack on junk food.”
Going to a party? Grab a low-cal drink in one hand and keep it there. Not only does it make it harder to graze the buffet, but you’ll also be less tempted to sip endless cocktails, too.
Finally, keeping your body refreshed with plenty of water may also help your workout, says Anthony. Staying hydrated means “I can exercise more, and longer, than if I don’t drink water.”
With the massive meals served at so many American restaurants, it’s easy to go Dutch — with the dinner plate.
“When we go out, I often share a meal with my wife,” Anthony tells WebMD. “We’ve been known to split a dessert, even a pint of beer. That way, we don’t feel stuffed, and we save some money.”
You can share more than just a meal out. Why not double up on a bicycle built for two? Go halves on the cost of a personal trainer? Maybe split a gym membership?
“When you’re trying to eat better or get more exercise, you can be more successful if you do it with a partner or group,” says Grotto. “The community, the partnership, whether online or in person, it really helps.”
The American Heart Association knows what we love: television. And they also know we need to get more exercise. So why not combine the two, they ask?
Try dancing to the music when you tune into your favorite music show, or practice some stress-relieving cardio boxing when your least favorite reality contestant is on camera.
During commercials pedal your stationery bike, walk the treadmill, or slip in a little strength training doing bicep curls with cans of your favorite fizzy beverage as weights. Or get inspired to really focus: Put in a high-energy exercise DVD and get motivated by the pros onscreen.
It doesn’t matter exactly what you do, so long as you’re up and active. Aim for at least 15 minutes, says the AHA. But who knows? If you get really engrossed, you just might outlast the last survivor.
That’s because while a small portion served on a large plate can leave you craving more, a smaller plate gives the visual signal that you already have more.
“People go by physical cues,” when they eat, Grotto tells WebMD. We know we’ve had enough because we see the bottom of our bowl or plate. “A smaller plate full of food just feels more satisfying than a large plate with that same amount of food on it.”
And don’t forget smaller bowls, cups, and spoons. For example, try savoring a bowl of ice cream with a baby spoon. Not only does the pleasure last longer, but your body has time to register the food you’ve eaten.
When your weight loss efforts lead to boredom or too much self-focus, get occupied with something else. “I eat more if I’m bored,” says Virginias, “especially if I’m eating in front of the TV.”
So take a break from the siren-call of the tube, and get occupied with things that have nothing to do with food.
For some, that might mean becoming involved with local politics, discovering yoga, or enjoying painting. Or maybe you want to help a child with a science project, repaint the bedroom, or take a class. The key: Have a life outside of weight loss.
Already busy enough? Then at least eat your meals at the table. “The TV is distracting, and I’m just not conscious of eating,” Virginias tells WebMD. “Once I’m at the table, with a place setting, I’m much more aware of what I’m eating.”
Finally, be patient. While cultivating that virtue isn’t exactly painless, it may help to know that keeping weight off generally gets easier over time.
That’s the result of a study published in Obesity Research, where researchers found that for people who had lost at least 30 pounds — and kept it off for at least two years — maintaining that weight loss required less effort as time went on.
So if you crave the results reported by successful “losers” like these — improved self-confidence, a boost in mood, and better health — cultivate patience. You may find your way to sweet (and nearly painless) weight loss success.
