Looks like I may get my chance in April. Just gotta figure out how to swing the price of a ticket (prices don't seem to be listed yet), arrange transportation, etc.
I don't get out to shows very often. The last "big one I had to buy a ticket for" that I can remember would have been Joe Jackson at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, circa 2004. Great show. I did make it down to the "free concert" series on the levee in St. Louis to see Sonic Youth, somewhat more recently. Good show there, too.
Hey, if you really want 15 minutes of listening to me this week, head on over to the Friday, February 13th episode of the Outright Libertarians podcast.
One thing I love about ChromeOS devices (Chromebooks and Chromeboxes) is how easy it is to keep up with the latest version of the operating system. What happens is, I see a little arrow at the bottom right hand side of my screen, and when I click on it it notifies me "restart to update." Like so:
When I restart and log in to my Google account, the machine seems to take a second or three longer to get into "OK, ready for you to use now" mode, but that may just be my imagination since we're talking single-digit numbers of seconds in any case.
Why does it occur to me to mention this, other than that I was trying to think of things for a short Friday blog post? Because I got the little arrow thingie this morning, and I've been wondering all day whether the guys at Google weren't thinking about what day it is, or whether they thought it would be really fun to tempt fate by issuing an OS update on Friday the 13th.
Weren't blister packs supposed to make it EASIER to take over-the-counter medications? Single pack equal single dose (instead of pouring a bunch of pills into your hand and having to count them), just pop the friendly little aluminum foil backing out and bam, drugs?
These days they rank highly on the "banes of my existence" list. They're harder to get into than "child-proof" bottles. Hell, they're harder to get into than the panties under a nun's habit, or your favorite New York nightclub on a Saturday night if your name doesn't have "Diddy" in it.
Three this week, as per the schedule I posited in an earlier post -- Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. All of them by yours truly:
US vice-president Joe Biden put American exceptionalism on display in a big way Saturday (February 7), laying down a tough line of patter to the 2015 Munich Security Conference. Biden called on Russian president Vladimir Putin to "get out of Ukraine," doubling down on US threats to escalate conflict in the Russia-Ukraine border region by arming Kiev's forces.
"Too many times, President Putin has promised peace and delivered tanks, troops and weapons," quoth Biden, by way of promising peace and simultaneously promising to deliver tanks, weapons and possibly US troops.
Last May, the European Union Court of Justice asserted a "right to be forgotten," ordering Google and other search engines to remove "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive" personal information from search results on demand.
Glossing over the difficulty of objectively deciding what kind of information might be "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive," Google promptly complied. The web search giant created an application process through which individuals could quickly and easily register their demands that EU web users be forcibly made a little dumber. Maybe even as dumb as European Union Court of Justice judges.
Under "hate crimes" laws, if a victim belongs to any of various "protected classes," and if the criminal's motive is demonstrably connected to the victim's status as a member of such a class, additional charges may be laid and additional penalties or punishments levied.
Those conditions are repugnant to the 14th Amendment's requirement that all Americans enjoy equal protection of the law. They designate some victims as more valuable than others, and some criminals as more culpable than others, with respect to the same crimes.
"Hate crimes" laws also do damage to the 1st Amendment's enshrinement of our rights to think, speak and worship as we please.
So far this week's Garrison Center op-eds have been picked up by other mainstream or popular publications five times (you'll find such pickups listed and linked at the bottom of each story) and I'm expecting a few more.
The Garrison Center neither seeks nor accepts financial contributions. But I do. Check out the top of the sidebar for ways to support my work at Garrison and elsewhere.
I don't do it very often, but this seems like a worthy cause. Let's see if I can get this to reproduce on the blog exactly as it's formatted in the email I just got. If not, you can see it here (yeah, that didn't work, so click the link).
Short version if you need one before you click: Please call "your" congresscritter and say no to the "Authorization for Use of Military Force" request v. the Islamic State that president Barack Obama just requested. If I need to explain why, let me know in comments and I will.
I'll be joining Mikester on the Outright Libertarians Podcast at 6:30pm 5:45pm (time changed!) Eastern this Friday (February 13). Topic? I'm not really sure, except that it involves "a 69-A-Thon ... to promote our Pride season outreach." So, sounds interesting. Click that link in the first sentence to listen!
I'm usually skeptical of "identity politics," but Outright is a major exception. Why? Because they don't make exceptions to their libertarianism for issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity, etc. See here for what I mean by that.
Outright's mission is as follows: "To present libertarianism, The Libertarian Party and its Candidates to the GLBTQ community. To monitor the Libertarian Party's continuing support for Equal Rights for everyone including GLBTQ individuals. To support each other in this work." I support that mission, and not just because at least two of the letters in that acronym describe me.
Update: I just got a more detailed description from Mikester, as follows: "Outright Libertarians is bringing back the Spirit of '69 for Pride season 2015!! Tune in on Friday, February 13th from 3 to 6pm Mountain time for our 69-A-Thon and hear 12 guests in three hours -- Monica Jones, Thomas Knapp, Starchild, Marcel Fontaine, and more!! -- and don't forget to pick up your FREE rainbow heart lapel pin by donating to our outreach fund at http://GoFundMe.com/SpiritOf69."
Hey, I got the Q&A thread up on time for once (because I went ahead and set it up on Saturday while I was thinking about it)!
This week's Thanks For Asking! questions, of course, are brought by you, to me, in the comments thread of this post. I'll answer in the comments, on the podcast, or both. Here's some music for while you're trying to think of a question.
I don't consider myself poorly informed with respect to the daily news (hint: I've served as publisher of the freedom movement's daily newspaper for more than 12 years and have worked around that publication since the mid-1990s), but I've mostly used the web as my news source for a couple of decades now. When the Brian Williams scandal broke last week my first reaction was "who the f--k is Brian Williams?"
Walter Cronkite, David Brinkley, John Chancellor, Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Bob Simon, Irving R. Levine, Tom Brokaw, yeah, I recognize all those guys. Williams? I guess I must have heard of him, but if so he didn't make much of an impression.
The "net neutrality" emails have been coming fast and thick for oh, a year or so, but even more so these last few weeks. Apparently the Internet needs to be "saved" from the guys who made it cheap, ubiquitous and pretty darn free (free as in free speech, not as in free beer). Who's doing the saving? The gang that historically has always, every time, without exception made anything and everything it touches more expensive, less reliable and less friendly to freedom of expression.
So color me skeptical. And write down my prediction that two years from now, the same idiots calling for "Title II" regulation of the Internet by the FCC today will be flooding my inbox with crocodile tears over the coming disaster ... and suggesting that the way out of it is yet ANOTHER round of FCC regulation.
Last May, we bought our "new" car -- a 1994 Isuzu Rodeo. Yeah, it was 20 years old and would obviously need TLC to be kept in good operating condition, but our calculation ran like this:
If it lasted six months without requiring major repairs, it would be a better deal than putting the same amount of money ($1500) down and making financing payments of $200-300 per month plus higher insurance rates (full coverage instead of just liability) for a new or nearly-new vehicle. And if it didn't make it that long, well, roll the dice again -- it will average out.
Nine months later, the thing is still running (meaning it has more than "paid for itself" per the calculation above), but it's at the point of really needing some of that TLC. The power windows aren't working. The problem seems to be a weird relay (instead of a regular fuse) that AutoZone can't find in its parts catalogs, meaning I can't do this myself, and it would be a minimum $100-$200 to get them fixed (because the shop would want to do electrical tests, etc. instead of just plugging in a new relay). It will need new -- big, expensive, SUV-size -- tires soon. The oil pressure runs low, which probably means the engine is nearing the end of its life (no surprise -- it's got about 250,000 miles on it), and so forth.
By way of preparedness, Tamara started watching Craigslist for a good deal several months ago. She pulled the trigger this weekend: $1350 for an even older vehicle with only slightly less mileage. But this one is a 1989 Volvo sedan that's obviously and visibly been well cared for. Same owner for the last 17 years. It served as first car for two high school kids, then became a "spare daily driver." The couple recently decided that two cars were enough and priced it slightly below "blue book" value.
I expect this one to serve us well for far longer than six months. And we're already ahead of the "pays for itself" curve. But mostly I'm happy to see Tamara in a Volvo. Kind of expensive to repair when they break down, but they don't break down very often and they usually top the lists of cars that protect passengers well in accident situations. And they're comfortable.
Christopher Cantwell may or may not be the first to make the comparison, but he's the first one I've noticed making it:
There is no question that some number of vaccines have had negative impacts on individuals. These may range from some temporary discomfort, to permanent disorders, to death. When people say vaccines are 'safe' I thus have to look at them like they are either ignorant or dishonest. Until vaccines are as safe as say, marijuana, calling them 'safe' as a blanket statement is just plain false. Vaccines do, in a small minority of cases, cause harm.
So far, two of them have been picked up to run in "mainstream media" publications (I link pickups at the bottom of each piece) and I've been interviewed by a Colombian newspaper (presumably as an "expert" or "opinion leader" of sorts) on the politics of Keystone XL.
Not a half-bad outing for a capital investment of less than $20 and a few hours of my time. The site has all the basic functionality, including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr presences. I'll be building it out a little more as time goes on, but it has the basics and they work.
My goal is to publish three op-eds each week, probably on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday. I picked those days for reasons having to do with my own evaluation of how "the news cycle" works; if that evaluation doesn't pan out, I'll recombobulate the posting schedule.
I've already heard from two editors that they'll be running today's op-ed (Joe Biden's Dangerous Game), so I'm expecting an even better second week.
The William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism doesn't seek or accept contributions. In setting it up, I decided it would just be easier to keep it free of various state entanglements like 501(c)(3) paperwork and so forth so I can just concentrate on the work. If you want to support the Center, you can do so by supporting its authors as individuals. I'll eventually get some kind of "tip jar" set up over at the Center's site, but of course you can always support me from the sidebar right here at KN@PPSTER.
Do you financially support people "engaged in violent activities overseas, including conspiring to murder and maim persons?"
Note: As with last week's podcast, this one cuts out a little early. Strange -- I don't press the "stop recording" button until I've actually stopped talking, so I guess it's a Soundcloud issue. I'll try to remember to add a few minutes of silence, or hum "Flight of the Valkyries" or something at the end of next week's episode.
So, as you will probably notice -- because it's very much designed to be notice, that's the whole point -- I've gone from having a network ad in the sidebar to having a network ad that pops up at the bottom of your screen.
Hey, ads are always a work in progress. According to the service I use (Qadabra), these "rich media ads" can be "up to 500 times as profitable as regular display ads" (or something like that). Which sounds pretty good. Hey, I could go from pennies a day to five dollarses a day in ad revenues!
But of course I'm cool with input on user experience. Let me know if you love'em, hate'em, don't care ...
Per most any ad network's terms of service, I'm prohibited from artificially driving clicks to the ads, to include asking my readers to click on them. So of course I won't do that, and of course I discourage you from clicking on any ad that doesn't interest you.
Yeah, I know. Never punch down. But I can't help myself. He's just so fascinating! Also, I got myself sort of implicitly challenged to an SEO duel and it sounds like fun.
I've come across a number of theories about Christopher Cantwell, but they tend to fall within the range bounded at one end by "well, what do you expect, he's an asshole?" to "perhaps he's a government saboteur/provocateur on a secret mission to discredit the libertarian movement." Personally, I think that range is far too limited and that other possibilities should be considered.
One is the possibility that Chris Kyle got tired of the SEALebritarian lifestyle and decided to fake his own death, change his name, lose the family baggage and make an ... interesting ... career move. Same temperament. Same lack of introspection concerning said temperament. Same grandiose, self-promoting style. And think about it. Have you ever seen them together?
I guess that one could dovetail with the provocateur thing. But I have to discount it based on Cantwell's publicly displayed (on The Colbert Report) complete lack of safe firearms handling skills. That stuff gets so ground into you in the military that it's hard to even fake messing it up.
Another possibility is that he's a graduate student in gender studies at City University of New York, working undercover to collect data for his doctoral thesis (and possible Salon book of the month contender): "Gullible is Written on the Ceiling: How to Build a Cult Following of White Cisgender Male Libertarians and Get Them to Believe Anything."
For example, it would make sense of his recent decision to purge non-believers (including little ol' me) from commenting on his site. It's hard to keep a cult following together and cheering each other on. You can't get that ol' Joe Stalin "everyone's afraid to be the first one to stop clapping" effect going if there's anyone around spouting sense right into the middle of Dear Leader's nonsense.
It would also explain his occasional descent into the self-pitying (and revealing) "I became a crack-smoking car thief because my mom was a Catholic and my dad was an abusive alcoholic government employee -- nothing bad I've ever done was my fault!" routine that makes -- to cite Cantwell's own current SEO punching bag -- Brad Spangler look like the very model of mental health and moral rectitude by comparison. After all, inside every Social Justice Warrior (even a secret one working on his doctoral thesis) there's an excuse for the insanity trying to get out, right?
And of course it would explain his ongoing fascination with "celebritarianism" -- a word I've heard floating around lately, usually as snark. "Celebritarian" seems to be a portmanteau of "celebrity" and "libertarian," two words that just don't seem to go together very well (also, I'm not sure if current users realize that Marilyn Manson got to it first). Cantwell seems to take celebritarianism very seriously, right down to pursuing an SEO strategy (I did a little meta tag research on his site; he's got some interesting tricks going, but they don't seem to be panning out too well). Most roads to Salon book of the month run through first establishing a certain degree of prior fame, or at least notoriety. So it fits.
But nah. I'm thinking that "well, what do you expect, he's an asshole?" is the most likely explanation.
Well, I forgot to post the weekly AMA (now titled "Thanks For Asking!") thread on Wednesday. This is it, brought to you as usual by Darryl W. Perry:
The way it works, as usual, is that you ask me questions in the comment thread, and I answer them in the comment thread, on the podcast, or both. So, whaddayawannaknow?
If you listen to The KN@PP Stir Podcast, you know that I'm just now getting to where the phrase "Peace Love Liberty Radio on the Road tour" rolls off my lips without any major stumbles. And of course when you see the podcast post here on the blog, you see our sponsor banner:
So, you know that the podcast sponsor is Darryl W. Perry, and you know that the Peace Love Liberty Radio on the Road tour is what I've been promoting for him.
Well, the tour is off and people who donated to support it are being reimbursed. I'm personally sorry to hear that, as I had suggested Darryl as a potential speaker at this year's Libertarian Party of Florida convention.
Free Press Publications: An independent alternative media and publishig company, founded in June 2009, with the mission of "ensuring a FREE PRESS for the FREEDOM MOVEMENT" and committed to spreading the message of peace, freedom, love and liberty. FPP also gives new authors an avenue for publishing freedom-oriented material. FPP brings you daily news and commentary as well as the monthly newspaper FPPNews, books and more.
The above, of course, is sort of boilerplate that you'll hear me yammering at the beginning of each KN@PP Stir Podcast this year. And since I'll only have limited time to talk up my sponsor in each podcast, let me spill a little ink here praising Darryl and his projects. Not because he's my sponsor. Or at least not only because he's my sponsor.
These days, "journalists" -- especially those who cover politics -- are expected to function as the status quo's stenographers. Not "just the facts, ma'am," but "just the facts that don't rustle anyone's jimmies."
Darryl isn't that kind of journalist. He's the kind of journalist that Joseph Pulitzer pined for in a letter to the editor of the New York World (a paper he owned):
Every issue of the paper presents an opportunity and a duty to say something courageous and true; to rise above the mediocre and conventional; to say something that will command the respect of the intelligent, the educated, the independent part of the community; to rise above fear of partisanship and fear of popular prejudice. I would rather have one article a day of this sort; and these ten or twenty lines might readily represent a whole day's hard work in the way of concentrated, intense thinking and revision, polish of style, weighing of words.
Darryl puts out a damn sight more than ten or twenty lines a day of exactly that kind of content. He does so in multiple media. And that's before he goes to work helping others do likewise.
A freedom movement with 51 Darryl W. Perrys, one in each state and one consigned to the purgatory of the District of Columbia, would probably be unstoppable. So: Pay attention. And emulate. Just sayin' ...
The first item under "highlights" on Florida state legislator Matt Gaetz's (R-Fort Walton Beach) official web page is "American Conservative Union, Defender of Liberty, 2013."
He's really big on liberty, apparently. And low taxes. Except for women who work for a living, or people who like to watch women working for a living, or people who roll their own cigarettes instead of paying Florida's exorbitant taxes on pre-manufactured smokes. Liberty and low taxes for them? Not so much.
Gaetz wants to impose a $10 head tax on entry into strip clubs. While he throws around some nonsense about fighting "human trafficking," he makes it clear what his real goal is. As paraphrased in WPTV News Channel 5's report on the proposal, it's to "discourage people from frequenting the businesses." Oh, and he also wants to require strip clubs to keep records of their customers, just in case the government might want to know who they are.
Representative Charles Van Zant (R-Keystone Heights), whose legislative web page touts his "Florida Chamber of Commerce Honor Roll" and "ABC Friend of Free Enterprise" awards, takes it even further: He wants a $10 entry tax on all night clubs and a $25 tax on nightclubs featuring human nudity. Why? Because "[l]ap dancing is not buying a loaf of bread at a grocery store."
Gaetz is also behind a proposal to charge people who buy pipe tobacco and paper/filters at "roll your own" shops the same taxes as are currently levied on actual cigarettes. And he also makes it clear that his goal is to put shops that cater to that customer base out of business.
I'm shocked -- shocked! -- to learn that Republicans hate business, hate working women and hate smokers. Unfortunately, they generally get away with this kind of stuff throughout their legislative sessions before coming home to campaign by eating apple pie in front of American flags and pretending they're your friends.
They're not. If you want freedom, low taxes and respect for people who work for a living from Florida's politicians, your only real option within the system is to vote Libertarian.
I don't want to clutter up The Garrison Center's front page with "omigodomigodomigod" posts, but I feel the need to brag somewhere, so ... three days old and already we have the first newspaper pickup of a TGC op-ed (that I know of, anyway).
"Capital Punishment Means Unlimited Government" ran on page 4 of today's University of New Mexico Daily Lobo.
Circulation 15,000, presumably mostly students whose minds have hopefully not yet nodded off into life-long authoritarian slumber.
So over here I get to brag. Over there, it's just a subtle note at the bottom of the piece. Hopefully the first of many. Sort of like ...
[O]ur masters mostly expect "educated" Americans to sit down and shut up (apart from perhaps expressing gratitude for whatever bread and circuses the ruling class might care to bestow upon them to produce a contented state).
That's the program for most of us. But there are always some who don't do well in the combination day care centers, minimum security prisons and bureaucratic money sinks sold to us as "schools." And an increasingly high-tech economy requires new layers of workers with skill sets that require more cultivation than such "public" institutions can provide.
Enter "school choice" programs, through which students (via their parents) can take "their" government funding to institutions other than the one-size-fits-all schools laid out by geographic districts.
Anyone who doesn't live under a rock (or whose rock gets bombed periodically) knows that the US government spends more on its military than any other nation-state. A useful way of understanding how MUCH more: If the US "defense" budget was cut by 90%, it would remain the first or second largest military spender in the world (depending on fluctuations in China's military expenditures).
That 90% -- and then some -- is the single largest welfare entitlement program in the US government's budget, even omitting "emergency supplementals" for the military misadventure of the week and military spending snuck into other budget lines.
Capital punishment is incompatible with "limited government" in any meaningful sense of the word. If the state may kill its subjects -- not in the heat of the moment when life and death decisions must be made instantly, nor in actual defense of life, liberty or property, but merely in leisurely pursuit of revenge and "deterrence" -- what may the state NOT do to those subjects?
How can we plausibly dispute lesser state impositions like gun control schemes or the "individual mandate" requiring us to buy health insurance, having already cheerfully ceded power over life and death to the same authorities?
Obama's public justification for the veto is that the State Department should be allowed to complete its review in its own good time. That's bureaucratic window-dressing. The real constituents for Obama's regulatory foot-dragging are environmentalists concerned about the pipeline's potential for disastrous leaks and spills, aquifer damage, etc.
But any excuse for the Keystone veto will satisfy the environmentalists. They don't care how Obama justifies it; they'll happily chalk it up as a victory for Mother Earth, move on, and continue to vote Democrat. So why not address the elephant in the room (pun very much intended) and openly side with libertarians against this GOP boondoggle on property rights grounds?
I am student from TAR College. I am a Christian. The Feng Shui of my house was done by Master Tham. Last time, my father was just a worker but now after Feng Shui was done, he has his own factory and my mum is the top selling insurance agent in her company. I frequently visit Master Tham to ask for advices about my astrology chart. There was this day when he told me that a black star arrived at my chart and a serious accident will happen to me. He blessed me and even gave an Amulet to me. Although I’m a Christian, I took his advices seriously and carried the amulet everywhere I go. One day one the way back to my hometown, I was speeding. Suddenly an iron rod fell of from a lorry in front of my car thrust into the iron bonnet of my car, passing through the car body and passing through the iron water tank and finally entered the car dashboard. What was extremely lucky was that the rod was only an inch away from my chest. I was extremely shocked that night. If I wouldn’t be the amulet that I was carrying, I’d be dead. I called my father and Master Tham. I got help from Master Tham’s friend from Bidor to repair and replace a new water tank before I continued my journey. There’s another time when I was on my way fetching my father’s worker back home from the factory. I went pass this road near the graveyard. It was around 4.30am that day when suddenly I saw this huge spirit flew in front of me and then it tried to avoid my car. It really gave me a shock but I was very thankful that it didn’t harass me, instead it tried avoiding me. It must be the power of the amulets that I wore and placed in my car. I was really thankful to have known Master Tham as my Master that had given me so much useful advices and saved my live. My family and I trust him as our only Master!! Thank you so much Master Tham! You’re truly the genuine one!
I knew Master Tham through a friend of mine who had also greatly benefited by his services. Before the Feng Shui of my house was remedied by Master Tham, my life was very troubled. I couldn’t get the contracts and often can’t receive my debts. My children’s studies were not satisfying either. After receiving Feng Shui service from Master Tham, I get the contracts that I wanted and my children’s studies have improved!!!! My relationship with my family and clients had had also improved and we’re all very happy and satisfied with the outcome! A grateful thanks to my genuine Master Tham!
I was wearing Master Tham’s personal takrut. I’ll wear it where ever I go. One day around 6am, I was travelling back home. Just a second after I over took a lorry, a car from behind crashed on to a lorry. Other drivers from behind had not noticed that there’s a car behind them or over taking them nor hearing any sound of braking. They only saw the car when it crashed directly on the lorry with family of 5 persons all killed! I was very lucky that I had taken over the lorry or the fated car would crash onto my car and I could lost my life. Thanks so much Master Tham and his powerful takrut.
My girlfriend is a very close friend to Master Tham’s daughter. One night, Master Tham’s daughter dreamt of me involved in a fatal accident. She narrated the dream to Master Tham in full details, its colour, action and scene in the dream. Master Tham immediately astral blessed me to avoid the fatal accident and send a takrut to me as well as advising me not to go out for at least one week. My girlfriend told me that Master Tham’s daughter has some kind of sixth senses power and my girlfriend made me to stay at home and not going out for any event no matter how important it was. After a week, I was travelling in motorbike when a car knocked onto my bike. I was not injured at all. I believed that without his advises and immediately sending me the takrut, I may have really facing a fatal accident. Later my girlfriend and I expressed our most sincere thanks to Master Tham and his daughter at his house! My girlfriend and I have never failed in wearing Master Thams’s takrut wherever we go.
Before I know Master Tham, my family and I lived a very hard life without any prospect. I have consulted other Feng Shui masters but it was useless. I am a wage earner and the meager income was not enough to support my family. My children’s health and studies were poor. After Feng Shui had been done and blessed by Master Tham, about one year later, unexpectedly we owned a fish head mee stall inside a restaurant, doing a very brisk business. Due to good Feng Shui and less stress, my wife and my features look very good. Our children become healthy and excel in their studies. If there’s anyone looking for a Feng Shui master, there is no one I could recommend other than our Master Tham!

We believe that feedback is an essential part of learning experiences for children. It helps a child understand what they're learning and also gives clear guidance on how to improve. We're interested in children being able to both give and receive feedback throughout the year and across the curriculum. We wanted to streamline the feedback process and language so we might see it being more readily used and transferred.
Present children with a choice of realistic photographs and had them select a picture to biologically illustrate.
Group them in random cohorts of four with the instruction to take turns providing feedback on how to make the illustration more realistic.
Watch “Austin’s Butterfly,” and share their observations on how the kids in the video communicated with each other and what they noticed. Click here to watch the video Austin's Butterfly
Our students were able to quickly note the three essentials to quality feedback: KIND, SPECIFIC and USEFUL.
Group with their original cohorts and tried to give advice on the second draft of the drawing keeping the feedback framework in mind.
Oftentimes the sketches initially deteriorated as they tried to make adjustments and incorporate feedback.
It was noticeable that all students were able to have a voice in the feedback conversations and that most students were receptive to the feedback. Our hunch is that they valued the task and genuinely wanted to improve. Additionally, for some quieter students, knowing they had guideline for how to share increased their confidence in speaking. For the most part, both parties in the conversation were highly invested. When students had an opportunity to improve their work by doing a subsequent draft, they were incredibly focused and everyone persisted. Not a single kid said, “No way, I can’t do this!” Doing this activity helped the students understand how feedback works and the three key terms resonated with them.
This year we followed the flow of our original lesson plan from last year but added a few significant tweaks.
After the students did their second round of feedback, each cohort member collected info from the group on how they might alter their sketch. We then asked the students to capture on a small sticky note the piece of feedback that they thought would be most useful and the one that they planned to focus in on for their next draft.
Last year we discovered that when young children first work with feedback, it can be overwhelming. We wanted them to be cognisant of and focused on the improvement process so we had them do a quick jot to make their thinking visible.
We also asked them to use this same protocol before they did their final sketch. Due to time constraints and energy levels, we made a responsive teaching decision midstream to finish the final sketch on the following morning. Serendipitously, their captured thinking notes really helped them the next day to tune in quickly to the task at hand and work with intention based on feedback.
This task was one of our initial feedback experiments last year and since then we’ve grown immensely in developing our thinking about how to close an activity with a meaningful reflection piece. Building on our work with success lines and following our interest in making students more aware of the process, we broke our reflection into essential task components. We’re quite interested in making our students more aware of how thinking and emotions are often linked and have the potential to cultivate a growth mindset or a fixed mindset depending on how the pieces weave together for each individual. We wanted to make this connection more explicit for students when involved in the reflection process so we added an emoticon scale creating a simple graph design.
For each task, students used a dot to indicate how they felt when they were involved in this doing this aspect of the activity. All of our students were independently able to accomplish this so we believe that this tool is an effective way to help young explorers visually represent the complicated map of a learning experience.
For some it was evident right away where their stamina or attitude started to erode. For others, the map gave us a talking point to dig further into their experience through conversation. (i.e. “Oh, I noticed you put your dot for the second biological drawing with an unhappy face, can you tell me more about that?”)
We were also interested in finding out what the students thought they had learned by doing this activity. We left it open-ended but placed three empty boxes after the prompt in order to encourage multiple ideas and implicitly send the message that there is always more than one thing to learn. When you do this type of work you are always immersed in your teacher observations and sometimes you find yourself making assumptions about what students have learned. This simple reflection box really helped us get our heads around what the kids really thought without putting words in their mouths. Truthfully, their words always capture the essence much more succinctly than ours!

Will you put your mouth where the money is? Do your personal ethics come into play when negotiating a job?
I’m grateful this isn’t something I have to consider very often as a voiceover. Generally my clients are radio stations or production houses, and the bulk of my work is mainstream radio and tv commercials, corporate narrations, phone messaging and e-learning. But just once in a while I get something a little tricky.
A recent case in point, a referral from a colleague I admire and respect. Thrilled to be recommended, a little anxious that I shouldn’t let them down, I opened the email enthusiastically. And as I read the script, my heart sank.
“you’ve won a (ahem) free holiday, just stand by, oh, and make sure your credit card details are to hand”
variety. And to be absolutely honest, I was a little shocked. Of course, I’ve had the automated PPI calls, and the wadda-you-know-you’re-owed-compensation-for-the-accident-you-never-had calls, but never anything so horribly, obviously exploitive.
There was no question of me recording it, but I did need to summon up all my best email writing skills to ensure that the client wasn’t offended, my colleague’s reputation wasn’t damaged in any way, and that I came out of it looking professional.
And of course, I know I’m not indispensable, I’m sure there are plenty of other people that would be happy to record this kind of phone message (although I know far more that wouldn’t touch it with a barge pole).
My personal NO list includes unsolicited out-bound calling systems which can be anything from mildly annoying to downright intimidating, and anything promoting smoking or e-cigarettes. I’m undecided about political material (should it fit with my personal beliefs, or am I ok believing I’m voicing but not endorsing?). And I’ve voiced the promotional video for a range of sex toys, but decided I was comfortable recording it since the script was very clearly educational rather than salacious. The “what would my mother think” test was quite useful in that situation.
So, do you know where you would you draw the line? Or would you just take the money and run? And do you think it matters when you’re simply a disembodied voiceover, rather than a celebrity or well-known figure? Is it just a job for you?

I’ve had a handful of enquiries of this nature before, and it’s also on my personal ‘not a chance, ever, in this lifetime’ list.
I’ve also had to decline a politically-related one a couple of years ago – the script just didn’t feel right at all, it was overtly ‘isn’t this person amazing, all he’s done for the local community’ – very much overboard, to the point of out-and-out propaganda. I jest not.
It turns out, about 12 months later, this person (no names, naturally) got into some VERY hot water, and was nationally outed, having been involved in some very insalubrious activities. So thankfully, gut instinct worked, and I was very glad to not be involved in that particular production.

Taken from a Wall Street Journal article by Bradley R. Schiller. The article in it's entirety may be read here: [link]
"....our current economic woes don't come close to those of the 1930s. At worst, a comparison to the 1981-82 recession might be appropriate. Consider the job losses that Mr. Obama always cites. In the last year, the U.S. economy shed 3.4 million jobs. That's a grim statistic for sure, but represents just 2.2% of the labor force. From November 1981 to October 1982, 2.4 million jobs were lost -- fewer in number than today, but the labor force was smaller. So 1981-82 job losses totaled 2.2% of the labor force, the same as now.
Job losses in the Great Depression were of an entirely different magnitude. In 1930, the economy shed 4.8% of the labor force. In 1931, 6.5%. And then in 1932, another 7.1%. Jobs were being lost at double or triple the rate of 2008-09 or 1981-82.
This was reflected in unemployment rates. The latest survey pegs U.S. unemployment at 7.6%. That's more than three percentage points below the 1982 peak (10.8%) and not even a third of the peak in 1932 (25.2%). You simply can't equate 7.6% unemployment with the Great Depression.Other economic statistics also dispel any analogy between today's economic woes and the Great Depression.
Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose in 2008, despite a bad fourth quarter. The Congressional Budget Office projects a GDP decline of 2% in 2009. That's comparable to 1982, when GDP contracted by 1.9%. It is nothing like 1930, when GDP fell by 9%, or 1931, when GDP contracted by another 8%, or 1932, when it fell yet another 13%.
Auto production last year declined by roughly 25%. That looks good compared to 1932, when production shriveled by 90%. The failure of a couple of dozen banks in 2008 just doesn't compare to over 10,000 bank failures in 1933, or even the 3,000-plus bank (Savings & Loan) failures in 1987-88. Stockholders can take some solace from the fact that the recent stock market debacle doesn't come close to the 90% devaluation of the early 1930s."
So I wish our "great" leaders would stop trying to push their bloated agenda and pet projects by trying to scare the hell out of everyone by drumming up the Great Depression. Get down to actually doing something that can get this economy humming again.

there are about a zillion different interpretations of this song by about a million different artists. there are compilations only with this song but by different artists. and i got two of them.
my favourite version is on the album "the composer of desafinado plays". of course arranged by claus ogerman. he did also the arrangement for "the wave" which is i think the best album by antonio carlos jobim. an album packed full with classics.
he made the strings sound so cool and you really get the feeling of what for a lifestyle bossa nova seems to have been those days. (as i think and hope it has been...)
21 Oct 03 ·delicado: Totally digging those Ogerman strings. Ogerman is a genius arranger; I particularly like the work he did with Astrud Gilberto ('funny world' and 'non-stop to brazil' are two great ones) and Joao Gilberto.
This is a jazzy, haunting track from an LP I bought in Brazil last year. I've tried hard to find information about Jean Kelson, but the only mention I've found (other than those I've made myself) is in one of Ed Motta's excellent archived radio shows at his official site (http://www2.uol.com.br/edmotta/sala.htm). Ed plays a different track from this album, Munganga.
Catolé sounds musically like a variation of Baden Powell's classic 'Berimbau', and opens with an incredibly catchy refrain featuring piano, percussion and trumpet. Gentle male voices then come in and flesh out the melody. The entire album is great. I wonder what the chances are of it coming out on CD...
The girl from Ipanema is the greatest song in this planet. I got (belive!) 320 versions of it. And wht I guess so cool is that it has been recorded in all styles of music: Jazz, blues, Reggae, Techno, Rock, Salsa... Its very nice. My favouritte version is played by the brazilian singer "GAl Costa" in album "Gal Canta Tom Jobim". Its a swinger jazz. Very nice!!!
When I heard this album by the Brazilian organist Ed Lincoln, I really wasn't expecting a tune like this. It's a beautiful, tender vocal, sounding like something from a Francis Lai soundtrack, with lovely male-female alternating vocals and an exquisite Morricone style trumpet blending well with the guitar/organ/percussion instrumentation. An absolutely stunning track - playful but slightly sad at the same time, with some spooky laughter/sighing from the female singer towards the end.
24 Feb 04 ·n-jeff: Thats the thing with Lincoln, its not just the cheese, he played alongside the best Jazz musicians in Brazil. He could cut a pretty funk when the occasion demanded, and his "Seu piano eletrico" album ranges from african tinged stompers to mid sixties style vocal cuts. IMHO opinion underrated as a producer as well, he seems to have been active on the cutting edge of Brazilain music from the late fifties right through to the late seventies. I intended to use this track as the payoff for a compilation I did for a cd trading ring, but I don't think I had the space. He was in hospital just before Christmas (2003), not sure how he's doing now.
28 Feb 04 ·delicado: I have to say, I'm pretty blown away by his work. I know you've been harping on about him for years, so I wish I had listened earlier!
05 May 04 ·sodapop650: Ed Lincolns best work is the recordings he did with Orlann Divo becasue he is a little more low-key and the arrangements are just plain better. I love O Ganso cause its so damn crazy and his recordings under the name Claudio Marcelo are pretty good too. A rcord seller in Brazil actually got me his autograph as a present because I bought so many of Ed Lincolns LPs. But I gotta tell you, someone like Sergio Carvalho or Eumir Deodato are much more powerful on the Hammond and Ely Arcoverde, Juarez Sant'ana Ze Maria I think are all more mature organists. I put Ed Lincoln with Walter Wanderley a little heavy on the cheese.
28 Feb 04 ·executiveslacks: Great song, although I have to say I like Gilberto Gil's version the best.

The premier's chief of staff, his cousin Nader Hariri, "resigned from all his functions", according to a statement late Saturday, without specifying a reason. The movement said its coordinator, who was also in charge of the party's election campaign, had been relieved of his duties following a review. It said another unnamed cabinet official had also been dismissed.
Despite seeing his movement lose its status as the largest party in parliament, Lebanon's delicate sectarian balance of power means Hariri is likely to remain prime minister once a deal on a new government is reached.
Hariri blamed some of the movement's losses on Lebanon's new electoral law, but admitted he and his party had "betted on a better result".
In Pakistan the tax gap has been estimated to be our percent of GDP. The huge gap of tax in Pakistan is due to the fact that the size of informal economy is larger than formal economy. Actually the tax net is extremely narrow with 1.26 million tax return filers for the tax year 2017. It views that the taxes rates have created problem to live through the fear of informal taxes. The tax administrators don’t have human resources to catch and penalize every tax evader. Thus, in Pakistan, tax compliance costs are higher as compared with regional countries.

For the 2020 NPT Review Conference, the preparatory committee is scheduled to hold its second session from April 23 to May 4 at the United Nations Office in Geneva. The prospects for the next review conference do not look particularly bright owing to the fact that Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) member states' fail to reach to a consensus point on how to progress on non-proliferation and disarmament measures individually or institutionally. Similarly the fear about the future of the regime is a continual dilemma globally.
Even though, the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 apparently represents the strong will of the majority of signatory states to work on creating a non-proliferation regime that makes the cost of non-compliance high enough to deter potential violators. In the last Review Conference of 2015, the Signatories met to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, but could not come to an agreement. The question of why the 2015 RevCon could not produce a workable concrete document for the adherence to nuclear non-proliferation regime should be taken into account critically.
Andrey Baklitsky narrates the reasons for the NPT Rev Con’s failure to produce any final document in his article titled “The 2015 NPT Review Conference and the Future of the Nonproliferation Regime.” First, concluding the NPT RevCon without an agreement is nothing unusual. Since 1970, when the treaty entered into force, the parties could not reach a multilateral consensus at four of the last nine RevCons: 1980, 1990, 2005, and 2015. Indeed, this is a poor record for a treaty that is considered to be a universal treaty.
The conclusion of 2015 NPT RevCon is assessed to be disappointing because it could not wrap-up into a final document especially in the field of non-proliferation. On the other hand, even though the implementation is still debatable, the 2000 and 2010 review conferences are considered to be successful as they agreed on two concrete documents: 13 “practical steps” and the 64-point action plan RevCon in 2000 and 2010 NPT respectively. Secondly, since 1985, the outcome of NPT review conferences has not been changed much. The world order changed from the bipolar world and also a few countries got nuclearized by conducting their nuclear weapon tests, that is, Pakistan, India and North Korea, but the focus of attention of the NPT RevCon remained on the Article VI of the treaty related to disarmament. On the other hand the blazing issue of the creation of a Nuclear Weapons Free Zone free (NWFZ) in the Middle East that was debated a lot in the 2015 NPT review Conference remained a subject of concern since 1974. Third, it is evaluated in the NPT RevCon that both countries, Russia and the US still criticize each other over the suspected disobedience of the international agreements despite implementing few arms control agreements, e.g., the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. There is another positive sign that Moscow and Washington also continue to work together in the P5 process.
Talking about the disarmament initiative, the contemporary situation of Russia and the US initiatives is assessed as follows. The point of concern is Russia’s apprehensions on the reduction of nuclear warheads from their countries (the US and Russia) to 1000 warheads (as announced in international reports) apiece. Since with regards to strategic stability between both countries, a precondition to reduce or cut down the number of nuclear warheads, Russia apprehends that the US is violating or undermining it’s commitment of reducing nukes by developing prompt global-strike systems, expanding its ballistic missile defense and opposing the draft treaty banning weapons in outer space. So, for initiating the disarmament talks again whether bilateral or multilateral, one needs to employ new inter-governmental dynamics or make use of creative diplomacy; this would positively be an add on from the non-proliferation perspective too.
The international non-proliferation regime has not only been inadequate in dealing with instances of proliferation, but also undermined the objectives of the Article IV of the NPT on transfer of nuclear technology for exclusively peaceful purposes. Lack of consensus at the NPT review conference is hardly new, but the willingness to cooperate or reconcile differences and find consensus is fading. As a result, states that cannot find satisfaction from this forum are beginning to look towards other alternatives to fulfill their disarmament and non-proliferation demands.
There have been suggestions to shift non-proliferation discussions that make decisions by majority instead of consensus reached by the United Nation General Assembly or other ad hoc body. Leaving the outcome aside whether such a move would result in the desired change or not, it would definitely weaken the NPT review process and consequently the nonproliferation regime itself. Despite any short-comings of the 2015 review conference, no other nuclear disarmament arrangement has made substantial progress in restraining the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
The Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was drafted in 2017 but unfortunately it too could not gain much momentum in this regard. It too is in the need of recognition by all the nuclear weapons states but the chances of that are quite bleak for at least in the near future. However, progress over the next NPT RevCon will be crucial for the permanence of this treaty.

E.W. Harris is a singer/songwriter who is based in Brooklyn and performs internationally. This interview speaks to the logistics, realities and significance of touring and playing live, both at home and abroad, from a North American perspective.
This blog post is based on an email interview with Emma Webster on 29 November 2017, which was part of the UK Live Music Census project. The report and executive summary, published on 16 February 2018, are available here.
I’d say that these days I gravitate towards archetypical singer/songwriter, but that comes from necessity and convenience really. I’m kind of a sci-fi fantasy writer that sings, the musical part is basically whatever I can manage given the situation. As it happens, what I do has been most embraced by the folk singer/songwriter community, so I guess…as much as it pains me in the abstract…I am a folk singer/songwriter.
Tell me about your first ever gig: in what type of venue was it, how did it come about, and what are some of your memories of the gig.
Ha! I don’t know if I can remember my first gig, I’ve been at this since I was about 12 years old, in various forms. My first gig as a grownup though (where being a songwriting kid is no longer cute) was at the Georgia Bar, in Athens Georgia. The GA bar (as the sign reads) isn’t a venue per se, it’s a decrepit watering hole across the street from the rather famous Georgia Theatre. At the time I had just got a job at Wal-Mart, had moved out of my van and into a real apartment, and was busking for change when a guy (my now friend Mark, who co-produced and financed Re-Entry) wanted me to open for a band he played in at this place. I remember the “stage” was just a cleared area in the corner of the bar just before the bathrooms, and the PA system was one of those ludicrously heavy Peavy things from the 80’s, encrusted with years of dust, tobacco tar, and who knows what else. I also remember I got dressed up for the the thing, I bought some slacks at the thrift store and an awful chenille sweater that I thought was really slick at the time. I also had a beat up purple bowler-type hat, that matched the beat up purple ovation guitar I bought with my paperboy money in the 90’s. As I recall the gig was good, and I was paid a percentage of the bar. The thing I remember most though was alternately being mildly electrocuted by the the microphone, and dodging mystery liquids that would drip down from above directly above the stage.
How important to you as a musician is live music (economically, socially, etc.)? How important is live music to your musical career compared, say, to recorded music?
I’d say live music is very important to me as a musician in every way. Economically, it is my principal source of income. It’s an event in a way that listening to a recording is not, and it can be sold that way. Socially, it is important as well. My entire social life is made up of musicians, and people I’ve met through some kind of music related social vector. I wouldn’t have ever even met any of these people were live music not a thing. Live music, particularly showcases and song club type events (though proper gigs do this too), is a bit of a moving marketplace for me where I go for recreation, to meet people, and to do business.
There’s a few I’d say, and I keep trying to add more. Nice & Sleazy in Glasgow was the nexus by which I solidified all of my Glaswegian connections. The people at The Speculative Bookshop (and Dale & Anna McMullen and Sam Small in particular) have been hugely helpful to me career-wise. They keep close tabs on projects I’m doing and always write about them in tandem with their own activities. We typically do gigs elsewhere (at The Old Hairdressers), but Nice & Sleazy was the launch point (and typically the venue for the afterparty) The Bluebird Cafe in Edinburgh is another one. Kylie McGregor is the proprietor and she puts on incredible shows all the time in that space and others around town. Oporto in Leeds has also been very important for me. The guy who runs that gig Nick Simcock (Dead Young Records) has kind of been the nexus by which I have been able to access the rest of the north of England. Really it’s about the people behind these things rather than the venues that have been important. The people who run the Music Inn house concerts in Oxford, for example, have been consistently been giving me an excuse to come over for years now.
I try and do one US tour, and one international tour per year if I can manage it. Ideally, I would like to be in a position to tour one month on, three months off consistently. Here is the rubric I use when deciding where to begin. I try to do 60% low risk 30% medium risk and 10% high risk gigs in a given tour. Low risk are things like pub gigs with a negotiated guarantee, established concert series like The Music Inn or the Gaslight Club in Leeds, familiar territory with active fan engagement and dependable local support. Medium risk are ticket gigs with a known quality promoter, somewhat familiar territory, a new venue with a known territory/promoter, an unknown house concert situation (like sofar sounds). Pretty much gigs that are probably going to be good, but could be wrecked by the weather or an surprise Ed Sheeran concert. High risk gigs are anything totally new. Someone’s first house concert, a ticket gig in a new town with an unknown promoter. These are easily the most work for the least immediate gain, but if I didn’t include them I probably wouldn’t be touring at all, let alone expanding my touring area. That distribution is then applied to the route. Low risk gigs can be very far apart, but proximity is the key to loss control as the risk goes up. This last tour for example, our highest risk was a Tuesday ticket gig in Manchester. We got bounced around to various promoters, people kept being added to the bill, and the final promoter got sick on the day of. If it weren’t between two low risk gigs (Oporto in Leeds, and a pub gig in Halifax), we probably wouldn’t have done it. Or if it were even as far as York it probably wouldn’t have made sense. It’s a bit different in the US as the distances are greater, and a car is required, but the principle is pretty much the same.
I’d say very important, as I’m based in the US. In many ways it is much more convenient to tour at home (particularly on the east coast) and I have been doing groundwork here for many years. It is also fairly important to me to tour in Europe as people in many places (like Germany & Ireland) have money they like to spend on minimalist songwriter music. There also seems to be a pretty established circuit of folk clubs and house concerts that is specifically looking for English language indie songwriters.
For me as a folk music outsider the UK is much better than Europe. The UK seems to have a far more liberal idea of what “Americana” is than Europe does. If played bluegrass, country, jazz, blues, or even Irish Trad, Europe would likely be better. These are all established formats, and (in my experience) European audiences respond better to that, especially coupled with the “myth of authenticity.” I don’t know how many times I’ve been advertised as a bluegrass/jazz/country act much to the disappointment of a German crowd. For me the UK is better, because I just do what I do and people seem to like it. My friend Richard Young is a touring songwriter in the UK, but he loves American songwriters. He says it’s because “American songwriters are writing about the same things but it’s wacked out and mad somehow…I mean we’ve got David Bowie, Richard Thompson and Robin Hitchcock, but that’s about it.” I don’t know how this connects exactly to the question, but it seems to. All in all, I seem to connect to UK audiences/promoters/event organizers better, and with that connection it’s easier to sell records and tickets, so that makes it a better touring destination for me.
Pretty much not at all. The only ones I’ve regularly participated in are those in which I had a hand in running. In addition to this I am a notorious “genre jumper” and most intro level festivals are organized around a given genre/community. These things combined with my reticence to pay application fees means my festival experience is limited. When I toured with a rock band, this was much more important, but as a singer/songwriter I have played no festivals of note.
Have your gigs been negatively affected by any external factors such as noise complaints or venue closures (in the UK)?
Most definitely, in the US too. It is most obvious with promoters. They get very nervous about time frames, and as they usually want to load the bill with local support show logistics becomes very complicated very quickly. Luckily none of my favorite venues has closed, and in my current acoustic format getting too loud is rarely a problem, but it does cause the back end people to be more wary about taking risks. It makes sense, the owners feel like they might get fined at any time, which makes them come down on the talent buyers and staff, which makes them come down on the promoters, and then on the artists. My only real complaint is the after gig time (which is the ripest time for sales and networking) almost always gets cut short as people are hustled out due to noise curfews. We try to post up at exits to catch people on the way out, but that doesn’t always work well. Unlike dance acts or heavy metal I don’t really feel the full force of this as acoustic guitars and singing are usually a bit more yuppie friendly.
Lack of communication/understanding between venues, and the same thing amongst promoters. They seem to be unwilling to cooperate with one another, get overly cliquish and generally uninterested in maintaining the scene that gives rise to their existence. Without a strong group of promoters and talent buyers working together, going to see live music seems less like a cool event, and more like a thing you do to become a hipster, or to support your boy/girlfriend’s rock and roll fantasy. Unless you’re already a convert, going to live music just doesn’t seem that fun or accessible, so you save up to go to a Coldplay show, kinda hate it, and just listen to the same music you’ve been listening to since high school on spotify.
That seems to be the long term threat. Live music seems rarefied and boutique somehow, even when it’s poppy love songs and that, so people just recycle the hits at home or go see a cover band so long as the gig is at a place they already frequent. I can do the live jukebox with the best of em, but it’s not the most rewarding work and the pay has steadily declined since I started doing it in the late 90’s. Gentrification is a problem as well. Noise complaints and city ordinances are a threat to live music, particularly loud live music in neighborhoods that were made cool by the presence of venues. As ironic as this is, it seems to me that it would sort itself out, the story would continue, another part of town would become cool, new venues would open…if there were more money to go around, but promoters aren’t creating a fertile ground for that. I don’t think live music is ever going to be a profession that Grandma tells you to go into (like computers), but I do think a more consumer accessible, cooperative environment would be better for everyone. Musicians do try this themselves from time to time, but it often feels like an “Artist only club” and falls apart as soon as someone has a kid. That (long windedly) said, the basic problem is the lack of moving capital, money goes in but doesn’t come out, people try something else to make a buck. Folks love music, but they’ve got 500 years of it to choose from and nearly 100 years of that recorded in real time, pretty much all for free, whenever they want it. Only the devotees know how much cooler new, in person, in your face live music actually is.
What do you think government (city council, national and/or UK) could do to improve the live music scene in your hometown or more widely?
As an American, I can’t really shake my first idea (or my distaste for it) which is protective cultural legislation (and of course the funding that accompanies it). This is fine for the more academic ends of music, many interesting musical forms should go into the undead state that the work of Shoenburg finds itself. The thing is that I feel like what would ultimately happen is the same as what has happened to the visual arts in Scandinavia, still clinging to mid 20th century abstract expressionism. I’m really not trying to see a “piece” by Nirvana performed by the Horance Mann middle school grunge band at the Civic Arts Center…not yet anyway. What I think governments should do instead is take a page out of the book of South Street Studios in Ipswich. As I understand it, South Street Studios is an outreach charity organization that is home to recording studios, a full on small venue, and a bar. The place provides low cost resources to musicians (rehearsal space, recording), training for sound engineers, training for lighting techs, training in venue management, and a low cost venue space for would be promoters to try to put on events. When I played there the door was run by a young guy involved in the program who had his own radio station, and he also assisted with the sound setup supervised by an experienced engineer. The lighting tech was a kid who couldn’t have been 17, and the whole thing was kind of passively managed by the one of the guys that started the thing. In addition to that they recorded our performance (unmixed) to be used as a resource for people learning to mix a live show. It was really cool. The engineers got paid, the bands/promoters keep the door, the place keeps the bar sales. I feel like something like this sustains itself, gives kids something to do in the community, creates a familiarity with music and music adjacent professions that makes it accessible, and is creating a foundational environment in which live music can thrive without mucking around with the art form.

Bed alarms and sensor pads are the best method of getting an early alert that your patient is trying to get out of bed. Place the pad under your patient's back or buttock area (beneath the fitted sheet). The pad has a cord which runs along the side of the mattress. When the patient starts to sit up, taking their weight off the pad, the pad sends a signal to the bed alarm monitor and the monitor will start to alarm and let you know they need assistance. By having an alarm in the room with the patient, you will not only hear the alert from an adjacent room, but the patient may slow down and wait for you once they hear the alarm sound, giving you valuable time to come to their aid. Manufactured by Smart Caregiver.

I wasn’t around during the Panther’s reign, nor have I met anyone who was a Black Panther, nevertheless i have come to my own conclusion about the subject through documentaries and look for. I think that if they had been given the opportunity, they could’ve created strong, political leaders for today. Former Panthers have been interviewed maintain said men and women listened for and communities rallied around them. Young black and white kids became unified in frustration and anger over the Vietnam Showdown. Poor individuals were hurting for an alteration and Simply that the Panthers gave them some comfort. Today, we might be a recession, people nonetheless hurting and oppressed. Can be going to comfort anyone?
Don’t put your money into someone else’s bank account or put your name on an individual’s account. A lot of people put their name of their elderly parent’s account “just in the event that.” This is usually a bad understanding. If you want to be in a position to help mom or dad in case of disability or illness, a power of attorney is probably a more sensible choice. Remember: any asset with your business on it is YOURS, even if you never use it (Car title) or promote it (bank account).
If you are here you most likely read my post on Insta, where I shared about our long break of shooting weddings. Since we left the states at the beginning of 2016 we had not had any weddings come up, but we are glad to finally break the long wait with this precious couple. It was probably the hottest day of the year thus far and Josabeth had not eaten a proper breakfast or lunch, yet that did not break her spirit. Throughout the day she kept that smile high; she knew that no matter what, she was marrying her best friend. She loves that boy. After the ceremony we went to a quiet place, a place that might not have seemed much to them, but to me it was everything. It was my salvation. There was poor lighting everywhere, and quite frankly I wasn't sure if I had the creativity to pull it off. We sometimes (photographers) tend to doubt our intuition. But this alley that I magically found was where everything happened. It reminded me of why I constantly chase light. It reminded me that I have the privilege to capture love. It reminded me of all the good things a wedding holds despite all that could go wrong during that special day. In the end, the bride and the groom trust me, and they can look back with certainty that there was no hungry bride, that there was no stress; they can go back and see that everything went well, and that after all the trouble, everything turned out okay.

I’m going to take a risk that another paper about Marmorkrebs is not going to come to my attention in the next three days.
I admit to being a little disappointed, because I thought around this time last year that the line would be continuing an upward trend, rather than staying flat.
A new journal is a tricky thing to get up and running, so I am pleased to plug Invertebrate Rearing. Editor Ed Baker is getting the first issue ready to go, and you can still get something in for the first issue if you submit by 10 January 2010.
This journal may have in an unfilled niche in the realm of animal care professionals. My impression is that most of the journals in this field tend to focus mammals or fish, with those working on fish usually having a strong aquaculture emphasis rather than research.
There has been plenty of reason to discuss the pet trade on this blog, mainly in the context of accidental release of unwanted pets like crayfish. It is just as important to realize, however, that there are also problems at the other end of the pet trade pipeline. For that reason, I wanted to put in a quick pointer to a new article on invertebrate collection for the pet trade. You can also find a brief summary at the Conservation Maven blog.
One of my students informed me that she’d seen a crayfish in a recent issue of news stand favourite, Cosmopolitan.* This got me thinking about the kind of articles that might be accompanying the photo...
* I was unable to get a copy of the original picture, because I was not comfortable reading through every page of Cosmo while standing in the line at Wal-Mart.
Just a quick pointer to the Wild Muse blog, which has a nifty story about Native American legends about crayfish in Crater Lake, and the real species living there.
I’ve updated the web page listing North American laws on crayfish to include all the Canadian provinces. It appears that Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Ontario have laws concerning crayfish use, with Manitoba and Saskatchewan having fairly broad prohibitions.
While I’m here, I’ll note that I’ve moved the files for the main websites, Marmorkrebs.org and MarbledCrayfish.org, from a commercial server to one provided by my academic institution. This change should be unnoticeable, but there’s always the possibility that things will get confused in the transition. If you want to make sure you’re seeing the most recent files, the direct link is:
Okay, I’ll admit that isn’t strictly a bad idea. But it certainly leaves something to be desired, given that a news article in Science characterized this plan as, “No genome left behind.” But of course, it leaves a tremendous number of genomes behind, namely, every single invertebrate. What are the current estimates for number of vertebrate species? Maybe 60,000 or so? The crustaceans alone probably have about the same number of species. The number of vertebrate species is not even close to the number of beetle species.
The paper provides no rationale for doing such a massive scan of the vertebrate genomes alone as opposed to a project that would include the invertebrates. Indeed, the word “invertebrates” appears only once, in reference to fisheries.
In fairness, I actually do think it’s great that these researchers are working together and suggesting a big, bold scheme. I’ve made no secret that I want a crayfish genome project. With this 10K genome paper, maybe it’s time to start thinking about a larger scale invertebrate genome sequencing project that will cover the rest of the animal kingdom, even though it’s obviously not possible to do the same level of coverage as the small vertebrate sub-phylum.
This is a sick crayfish. As readers may know, I am not a pathologist or parasitologist, so I have little idea what these black spots may be or how to combat them. We’ve definitely had some animals die prematurely due to whatever these are. Any information would be most welcome!
Today is the 150th anniversary of the publication of On the Origin of Species. I’ve talked before about the monograph on crayfish by Darwin’s close friend, Thomas Henry Huxley, but Darwin himself did significant work with crustaceans, notably barnacles. But because this is a crayfish blog, I went looking through the massive online database of Darwin’s writing for references to crayfish.
In the Variation of Plants and Animals Under Domestication:, Darwin considers something near and dear to the heart of this blog, crustacean development:
We are led to the same conclusion, namely, the independence of parts successively developed, by another and quite distinct group of facts. It is well known that many animals belonging to the same class, and therefore not differing widely from each other, pass through an extremely different course of development. Thus certain beetles, not in any way remarkably different from others of the same order, undergo what has been called a hyper-metamorphosis—that is, they pass through an early stage wholly different from the ordinary grub-like larva. In the same sub-order of crabs, namely, the Macroura, as Fritz Müller remarks, the river cray-fish is hatched under the same form which it ever afterwards retains; the young lobster has divided legs, like a Mysis; the Palæmon appears under the form of a Zoea, and Peneus under the Nauplius-form; and how wonderfully these larval forms differ from each other, is known to every naturalist. Some other crustaceans, as the same author observes, start from the same point and arrive at nearly the same end, but in the middle of their development are widely different from each other.
In other words, Darwin has twigged to the important idea that each stage of the life-cycle of an organisms is under different selective pressures, and thus one stage can diverge while the others remain quite similar.
Crayfish are also mentioned in one of Darwin’s transmutation notebooks. In it, Darwin shows his admiration for the natural world (“beautiful adaptations”), and interest in explaining the non-adaptive features (“unintelligible structures”):
The question if creative power acted at Galapagos it so acted that birds with plumage and tone of voice purely American, North and South; so permanent a breath cannot reside in space before island existed. Such an influence must exist in such spots. We know birds do arrive, and seeds. (And geographical divisions are arbitrary and not permanent. This might be made very strong, if we believe the Creator created by any laws, which I think is shown by the very facts of the Zoological character of these islands.)
The same remarks applicable to fossil animals same type; armadillo-like cray [i.e., crayfish?] created; passage for vertebrae in neck same cause. Such beautiful adaptations, yet other animals live so well. This view of propagation gives a hiding place for many unintelligible structures; it might have been of use in progenitor, or it may be of use,—like mammae on man's breast.
In the Voyage of the Beagle, crayfish feature in a segment that shows the less enlightened aspect of Darwin’s cultural background, with the sort of references to “savages” that interested colonial powers.
The little stream, besides its cool water, produced eels and cray-fish. I did indeed admire this scene, when I compared it with an uncultivated one in the temperate zones. I felt the force of the observation, that man, at least savage man, with his reasoning powers only partly developed, is the child of the tropics.
The nomination deadline for The Open Laboratory anthology, the annual collection of science writing on blogs, is in two weeks. If there’s a post from this blog that you liked, I’d like to ask that you consider nominating it for the anthology. Posts from 1 December 2008 to 30 November 2009 are eligible.
Click here to submit an entry. A Blog Around the Clock regularly updates the list of entries; here’s a recent one (probably out of date by the time you read this).
In case you’re wondering why I don’t just nominate myself, I think it’s better for readers to decide what’s good than writers. And because it feels gauche to nominate a bunch of your own stuff.
The September 2009 issue of Genesis features a gorgeous array of animals early in their development, taken by students at the Woods Hole embryology course. The journal says that one of the images is of marbled crayfish, but doesn’t exactly provide a key.
I should say that after looking again, it would be best to say that it is definitely a decapod crustacean, but it might actually be a crab larvae instead. I say this because the student who did the staining was working with a number of decapods (multiple crayfish and crab species) at the time and I am not certain that this image is actually Marmokrebs.
And, for the record, the crustacean is immediately under the words “Genetics and” in the subtitle, and is purple and green. Even if it isn’t Marmorkrebs... it’s still a superb cover.
Welcome to the 44th and latest edition of Circus of the Spineless, the monthly celebration of animal diversity. Although this blog is devoted to just one invertebrate species, I’m pleased to host this carnival and showcase all the other wonderful forms that invertebrates take. Please take a moment to visit the home page and have look around.
I find the biggest problem is always how to sort the posts. Sadly, I am not imaginative, so I broke it down into the nicknames that I often hear my colleagues who study invertebrates: “crunchies” (things with exoskeletons) and “squishies” (things with soft bodies).
Because this is a crustacean blog, please forgive a little double favouritism by me starting off with a post from NeuroDojo (a sibling blog that I also author). In it, I take serious ethological research on hermit crabs, and turn it into a fairy tale.
Adrian at The Bug Whisperer also tries to take photos, but seems to cause a crime rather than preventing one, as a fight breaks out between his ant subjects. Models can be such divas.
Staying with ants for the moment, the Wild About Ants blog shows ants visiting extrafloral nectaries on cacti. Roberta Gibson want to know if you’ve seen ants visiting nectaries; go help her out.
At Hill-Stead’s Nature Blog, Diane Tucker features dragonflies and envies their ability to rise above it all.
Marcia Bonta looks at charismatic invertebrates. And I guess if you’re an invertebrate and want to be charismatic, it helps to have long legs, since she focuses in on daddy long legs and stick insects.
But if you want beautiful, Ted MacRae at Beetles in the Bush reckons he’s got the most beautiful beetle on the North American continent. I took the liberty of including a picture at right; isn’t it a beauty?
At The DC Birding Blog, John discusses and documents several insects lured by the promise of cheap beer. I am not making this up. If that’s a little to crazy for you, just look at the nice butterflies.
Dave Ingram, writing on the modestly titled Dave Ingram’s Natural History Blog, rounds out the crunchy section of our program with some pictures and note on millipedes.
While I would never claim to have saved the best for last, I do think you’ll admit this last post is worth the wait. Hill-Stead’s Nature Blog brings us... slug poetry!
That concludes this installment of Circus of the Spineless! Please join us again in about 30 days over at Greg Laden’s Blog. Email your submissions to Greg. (And come on, squishy lovers, show your colours!)
Vogt G. 2009. Research on aging and longevity in the parthenogenetic marbled crayfish, with special emphasis on stochastic developmental variation, allocation of metabolic resources, regeneration,
This article presents first results on aging and longevity in the marbled crayfish, an isogenic invertebrate with indeterminate growth. The marbled crayfish is the only known parthenogenetic species of more than 10.000 decapod crustaceans and has a maximal life span of roughly 3.5 years. Its main advantages, aside from genetically identical offspring and lifelong growth, are the alternation of growth and reproduction phases, a high regeneration capacity and easy handling in the laboratory. In a group of seven genetically identical batch-mates life span varied from 437 to 910 days although the sibs were communally reared and fed ad libitum with the same pellet food. In the same group there was no clear-cut relationship between longevity and growth or reproduction frequency. However, the specimen with the lowest life span showed fast growth, early onset of reproduction, and short time intervals between reproduction cycles. Damages like loss of appendages were repaired and did not negatively affect longevity. Social stress, in contrast, shortened life expectancy. The biological peculiarities of the marbled crayfish and the data obtained so far argue for a more intense use of this animal in research on aging and longevity.
While this manuscript was being prepared, Jones et al. (2008) (sic) published an account of a molecular study identifying crayfish specimens collected in Madagascar as Marmorkrebs.
Kawai and colleagues are pleasant about it in the paper, but the bottom line is that they got scooped. While they were themselves scooped, they unwittingly also scooped another author, namely me.
I’d been doing some preliminary work on a morphological description of Marmorkrebs, for the same reason presented in the new paper: to aid identification. While I wasn’t terribly far along in the process, I did have data recorded. It was more than just an idle, “Oh, I’ll do it some day.”
Crustacean biology has both the blessing and curse of usually being a slow-moving field. Progress is measured in years and decades rather than months. This means that scoops are rarely an issue. The Marmorkrebs story is one that has moved unusually fast, and those of us working with this organism probably need to take account of that.
I’ve also conducted and published research on ascidians, and I was impressed me by how that research community seemed organized and generally cohesive. At their meeting, they would arrange informal “working groups” to cooperatively plot out some of the research plans so that the projects in different labs were complementing rather than competing. The ascidian community realized there are benefits to community and communication.
There is more than enough research on Marmorkrebs to do that there should be some way to ensure that we don’t waste time duplicating our efforts.
Sadly, an invasive crayfish species is currently a very small problem for researchers and others concerned with the island. The country is in turmoil politically.
Half a year hasn’t improved matters much. A new piece in New Scientist says political instability is continues to threaten Madagascar’s biological treasures.
Since a military coup forced the president to resign in March, conservationists and biologists have watched as loggers have stripped the country’s forests and killed its animals for bushmeat. ...
(A)t the very least, 120 rosewood and ebony trees, worth an estimated $480,000, are being taken out of Masoala, Madagascar's largest national park, each day. At least thirteen illegal traders, known locally as the “rosewood Mafia,” buy the wood and export it, mostly to China. Conservationists say the logging is destroying the island’s national parks and having knock-on effects on the forest's animals.
Next month, I am pleased to host the Circus of the Spineless carnival on this blog. Submit your squishy and / or crunchy blog links to me throughout October, so we’ll be ready to roll at the start of November!
Invasion of an alien freshwater crayfish is newly confirmed in Madagascar. The invasive crayfish is determined as the parthenogenetic Marmorkrebs (marbled crayfish) (Cambaridae: Decapoda) on the basis of morphological features and the fact that all collected specimens were females regardless of their size. As this is a worrisome finding, the public should be alerted so that spread on the island can be prevented before it affects the vulnerable native crayfish biodiversity and the rice field business in Madagascar.
(Note: What the abstract does not mention is that this paper contains the first detailed description of Marmorkrebs morphology. This should greatly aid identifications, since many species of Procambarus superficially resemble Marmorkrebs, particularly in the marbled colouration.)
A day driving, a day talking, a day driving. That pretty much sums up a recent visit to Texas A&M University last week, where I had been invited to give a talk to the Applied Biodiversity Sciences program.
This was fun and interesting in a few ways. At the suggestion of the organizer, my student Stephanie and I gave a joint talk, which isn’t all that common. I did the first third, she did the middle, and I returned to handle the last third.
We also left the audience wondering how we got PowerPoint to do all the zooming. The answer was that we didn’t use PowerPoint for our visual aids. Instead, we were experimenting with some new software called Prezi. If you do presentations, you probably have a few months where it’ll be really cool before everyone else discovers it.
The biggest surprise was that a couple of audience members had direct ties to Marmorkrebs. One sold them in Switzerland back in the 1990s. Another confirmed something that I’ve only heard as a rumour, namely that Marmorkrebs are being aquacultured in China. More to follow on these leads, no doubt.
I was re-reading the recent paper on the introduction of Marmorkrebs in Italy (Marzano et al., 2009), and noticed this:
In their publication on (sic) Nature, the authors even raised the hypothesis that Procambarus sp. is a transgenic species created by laboratories in Hong Kong.
The only Nature paper featuring Marmorkrebs to date is the first one (Scholtz et al., 2003). I freely admit that I miss things, and do not remember everything. But the paper is only one page, so a statement like that would be hard to miss. And I’d like to think I would have remembered a claim that Marmorkrebs were the result of a scientific experiment gone wrong.
I re-read the Nature paper. The words, “Hong Kong” do not appear in it. There is a brief mention of transgenics, but it is in a comment saying that Marmorkrebs would be good for transgenic experiments in the future, not that they were the result of transgenic experiments in the past. For a moment, I wondered in the reference cited (Nam et al., 2000) next to the comment about Marmorkrebs’ potential was from a Hong Kong lab, but the authors of that paper all gave South Korea as their country of origin.
Marmorkrebs already sound like they’ve stepped straight out from a science fiction potboiler. You cannot work with an invasive species of female clones (which Marmorkrebs is) without at least thinking of old monster movies or pulp magazines. If they were truly an escaped science experiment? And “made in Hong Kong” to boot? Forget my next grant proposal... I’m going to work on my screenplay.
The always articulate Olivia Judson looks at genome projects in her recent New York Times column, and asks what organisms should be on the list to have their genome sequenced. She makes a persuasive case for the famous “living fossil,” the deep sea coelacanth.
The reader comments contain many good nominees (whales, naked mole rats, potato blight, and more), but I’m afraid I was not selfless. I wrote in the comments:
Coelacanth is an excellent choice. It could be difficult to get enough tissue, given that they are such elusive creatures.
Crayfish (and their relatives, lobsters and other decapod crustaceans) are commercially important. They are harvested for food and cause ecological and economic damages as invasive species to name just two reasons.
Crayfish are important model organisms for research, particularly neurobiology. Discoveries made in crayfish include electrical synapses, presynaptic inhibition, and neuromodulation of aggression.
There is only one crustacean genome (a small freshwater one, Daphnia pulex). In comparison, about a dozen insect genomes are complete and more are on the way.
Probably the best choice of species would be Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), because it is common, spread across the globe, and well studied.
The mysterious crayfish Marmorkrebs could be an interesting second choice, because their origins are unknown, and they are the only known decapod crustacean where all the individuals are female.
Just in case there is any confusion, I have nothing to do with the Marmorkrebs Twitter feed. I post as DoctorZen there.
Stephanie Jimenez presenting her latest poster at the Ecology Society of America meeting in Albuquerque recently.
Today’s post is a bit of a cheat, because the research is not as well known as the researcher who performed it. Nevertheless, it’s fun to look back into the history of crayfish research and find none other than Sigmund Freud, he of psychoanalysis, dream interpretation, and much more.
In his 20s, Freud was a comparative neurobiologist. His doctoral dissertation was on fish spinal cords. Freud later worked in the lab of Ernst Brücke. There, Freud studied crayfish and freshwater crabs.
Freud’s contribution was apparently quite significant... although it’s sometimes hard to work out exactly what that contribution was. Those of us who do not read German can’t read the original paper, and must rely on the translations of others to get an appreciation of the context and significance of the work. I’ve read Freud’s crayfish described in various ways, ranging from showing that the axons were connected to cell bodies to showing that neurons contained a cytoskeleton.
Unfortunately, Freud found that research didn’t pay enough for him to get married, so he went into medical practice. And that was the start of the twisting road leading to the work that Freud is best known for.
Given the controversies over Freud’s later work in psychology, however, one could make the case that both biology and psychology might have been better off if Freud stayed a neurobiologist.
Interestingly, Freud was far from alone in starting a research career in invertebrates before becoming famous in psychology.
Jean Piaget worked on snail behaviour, publishing papers while he was still in high school, before his studies on how children think made him the premiere developmental psychologist.
Alfred Binet did his doctoral work on insect nervous systems, which was later overshadowed by his development of one of the first intelligence tests.
This blog makes a brief cameo appearance in the “Members in the News” section of the new issue of American Scientist. I guess they used the subtitle because “Marmorkrebs” alone was too cryptic...
The Ecological Society of America conference is now on. Remember to visit the Marmorkrebs poster on Friday morning, poster PS 88-134.
The question of whether conferences are worth it is worth revisiting. The Byte-Size Biology takes a look at several online science tools, including virtual conferences, and concludes that the virtual conference is not ready yet.
First: virtual conferencing technology sucks. It doesn’t matter if you use a free Skype on a $150 netbook, or a state-of-the art teleconferencing equipment with a 52″ screen and Dolby Surround, piped through at hundreds of Gigabits per second. You will get interruptions, cuts, lags, annoyances and embarrassing moments. Second: social reasons. The important parts of a conference take place in the hallways, poster sessions, meals, banquets and, of course, the pub across the street. Incipient collaborations, exchange of ideas, brainstorming: all those take place around the dinner table and in the halls. With food, coffee and alcohol providing the social lubrication, and the talks and posters the intellectual one. A conference is much more than a series of talks.
(Low resolution picture because this was snapped with my phone. Sorry, but these gals are hard to catch in the act.)
The Eighteenth Symposium of the International Association of Astacology (IAA) is being held about one year from now at the University of Missouri. It will be running 18-23 July in 2010.
The main conference page is here. I am hoping to have some Marmorkrebs research to show at that conference.
How can you resist a meeting that guarantees attendees “expansion of your mental, physical, and spiritual being” and, I quote, “plenty of nuisance insects”?
Some artists create with paint. Some artists create with sound. Some artists create with words. Jerzy Stanislaw Alexandrowicz was an artist who created with methylene blue.
Methylene blue is a straightforward vital stain, and many kids school use it today to see cells under a microscope. But Alexandrowicz took the simple stain to new scientific heights. An obituary gives some idea of his mastery, describing his technique as “legendary,” and his skills so renown that scientists from all over came to visit his lab to learn his methods. (The obituary, incidentally, is well worth reading and paints a picture of a rather remarkable man.)
Alexandrowicz first noted small sensory organs in the tail of crustaceans in the 1930s, but didn’t get to finish the work until after World War II, and published the discovery until 1951. He termed these “muscle receptor organs” (MROs) because the neurons were indeed sitting along a very fine strip of muscle. I doubt the PDF does justice to the pictures in the original paper, but one can get a sense of just how detailed he was. The attentive may object to this being called a “Great moment in crayfish research,” because Alexandrowicz worked with lobsters. Although the muscle receptor organs weren’t originally described in crayfish, almost all of the work that followed was done in crayfish.
From the outset, there was interest in these little sense organs because they were readily accessible, sitting just underneath the exoskeleton and on top of the large fast flexor muscles. In contrast, similar looking organs in mammals, muscle spindle organs, were buried deep in muscles and very difficult to work with. There has been much work on them because of that, and I can only hope to hit a few highlights here.
Cornelius “Kees” Wiersma and colleagues (1953) quickly started doing physiology on these little sense organs, and explicitly drew parallels between them and vertebrate sense organs. They found that the two sensory neurons in the muscle receptor organs had very different properties. One was tonic, responding to slow and small changes, and tended to fire all the time. The other one was phasic, responding only to very hard flexions of the abdomen, and then only for one or two spikes. Wiersma and colleagues continued to do the basic legwork of tracking down the basics of the circuit (Hughes and Wiersma 1960).
Because of the neuronal connections, and the responses of isolated neurons in the dish, Larry Fields (1966) proposed that the muscle receptor organs acted in load compensation (pictured below is Figure 8 from his paper). That is, the muscle receptor organs appeared to be wired so as to detect the difference between how much bending of the tail the animal was trying to do, and how much was actually occurring. If there was a difference between those two, a reflex would kick in, activating extensor muscles to compensate for the impeded movement.
Unfortunately, when the muscle receptor organs were recorded from live animals performing load compensation, it seemed that the muscle receptor organs didn’t actually work that way (McCarthy and Macmillan 1999). So the function of the muscle receptor organs in intact animals, even after 50 years of work in many labs, still remains to be fully understood.
The muscle receptor organs are an “evergreen” scientific preparation, and I’ve hit on only a very, very small number of papers on them here. That I can only touch on these few highlights in a blog post is a nice example of how often, science is not about breakthroughs, but inch by inch progress.
The red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii, is the most abundant invasive crustacean decapod in Italy. Evidence is however emerging for the presence of other Cambaridae that are erroneously assigned to the P. clarkii taxon. The marbled crayfish, belonging to a still uncertain species of the genus Procambarus, has been found for the first time in Italy in the Canale Maestro della Chiana (Tuscany, Central Italy), where it lives in sympatry with a large P. clarkii population. Although a single specimen was found, this record is particularly relevant due to the parthenogenetic reproductive habit of the marbled crayfish. However, molecular analyses based on COI barcoding did not reveal any differentiation within the P. clarkii population and excluded any form of hybridization between the two species. We will shortly discuss new pathways of invasive species and the threats posed by parthenogenetic species, even though they seem to be still sporadic.
Last week, I mentioned that Marmorkrebs have been found in the Netherlands. This newsletter has more details (PDF format; I had problems getting it to open automatically, but was able to save it from my web browser). You may find it useful, particularly if your Dutch is better than mine.
Natural habitat habitat unknown. The species is only known from the aquarium trade (where the species probably also created).
Dissemination in The Netherlands in 2004 for the first found in an old Griend in Dordrecht (the lay).
Received an email today pointing out a few references that show Marmorkrebs have been showing up in the waters of the Netherlands for some time now. The one below is a starting point:
The annulus ventralis of Marmorkrebs. This feature is on the underside of the animal near the most posterior legs, and is sometimes found in crayfish species descriptions.
There will be a Marmorkrebs poster in the late-breaking poster session of this year’s annual Ecological Society of American meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This will be presented by Stephanie A. Jimenez. This poster is her third presentation this year, all on different aspects of Marmorkrebs (she’s been busy!).
The main Marmorkrebs.org page lists an in-press paper describing a case of Marmorkrebs being found in a natural ecosystem. I’ve mentioned Madagascar before, and now Italy has been added to the list. The Italy article hasn't been posted in the blog yet, because I like to include articles here only once they have final pagination and so on.
It seems reasonable to expect more such reports in the future. I’ve created a Google map to start documenting where Marmorkrebs are reported. I will update it as often as I get information.
A new report described in the Telegraph lists marbled crayfish as posing “high risk” to British wildlife if they are released into the wild.
This news story comes on the heels of two letters in the most recent issue of Science that offer a back and forth on the issue of introduced species. The first, by Gozan and Newton, talks about potential benefits of introduced species, like “aquaculture, sport fishing, forestry, horticulture, and game hunting.” The reply by Hulme and colleagues mentions crayfish as an example:
Major aquaculture species such as the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and Pacific cupped oyster Crassostrea gigas threaten endemic species through predation, competition, and/or the spread of diseases, and these two specific examples are widely recognized as some of the worst invasive species in the region(.) ... The history of biological invasions in Europe has too many examples of shortsighted decisions targeting perceived economic gains that have resulted in much larger (and often irreversible) costs to society. Thus, such “balance sheet” decision-making promoted by Gozlan and Newton, rather than a precautionary approach, is not only naïve but potentially dangerous.
This article on the National Science Foundation website has an related take on invasive species. It tracks students who were examining the impact of Louisiana red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) into China.
(W)e were surprised by how welcome this exotic crayfish was in the Chinese community, even among rice farmers whose crops were being destroyed. ...
Another rice farmer explained that if he had the necessary resources, he said he would sell only crayfish and eliminate rice farming all together.
Emphasis added. This is particularly relevant to Marmorkrebs, as it has been rumoured that they are being investigated for aquaculture purposes in China. Plus, asexual species in theory can generate double the number of reproductive offspring every generation compared to sexual species.
Thus, people could be extremely tempted to introduce Marmorkrebs into natural ecosystems deliberately. The problem is that such introductions have ended in tears as often, if not more often, than they have ended in triumph. (Two words: Cane toads.)
Harvested crayfish in Chinese fish market. Difficult to recognize, except for escapee in upper left!
In 2007 an unusual crayfish found in food markets in the capital of Madagascar was preliminarily identified as Procambarus ‘Marmorkrebs’: a new world taxa and the only decapod known to reproduce by parthenogenesis. We present information on the identity, distribution and ecology of this recent invader and attempt to evaluate the threat it poses to Madagascar’s biodiversity and to livelihoods. The species appears to be currently limited to the area close to Antananarivo, but is being sold alive on major transport routes. We present molecular evidence of its taxonomic relationships and confirm that the Procambarus present in Madagascar is indeed the parthenogenic taxa. We investigate its reproductive ecology and find Procambarus ‘Marmorkrebs’ to have an extremely high fecundity; more than six times that of the native crayfish Astacoides. The limited evidence we have suggests that this species poses a serious threat to freshwater biodiversity and that it is likely to damage human livelihoods (through its impact on fishing and possibly rice agriculture). More research is urgently needed but in the meantime action is needed to reduce the rate of spread before it is too late.
Marmorkrebs.org makes a brief cameo appearance in the latest Crayfish News newsletter with an article called, “Crayfish Blogging and Citizen Science.” The newsletter is a publication of the International Association of Astacology (password protected for members).
In the new issue of Science, Smith and colleagues present some interesting information on import of wild animals.
Over half a million shipments of wildlife containing >1.48 billion live animals have been imported by the United States since 2000. ... The majority (92%) of imports were designated for commercial purposes, largely the pet trade.
In its current form, H.R. 669 does not consider the economic benefits of wildlife trade. We argue that it should. H.R. 669 requires evaluation of the threat imported wildlife species pose as invasive species or carriers of known pathogens before importation. It proposes creation of lists of species “approved” or “unapproved” for import. Although the Act recognizes that there are species for which adequate scientific and commercial evidence is not yet available to make an evaluation of import risk, it does not stipulate how such species should be handled. For these species, we propose that H.R 669 should require their temporary placement on a “gray list.” These gray-listed species should receive priority funding for risk analysis.
At least, I can only assume that says either “Marmorkrebs” or “marbled crayfish.” I have no idea how that would be pronounced phonetically. I found it at the top of a gallery of Marmorkrebs pictures can be found here. Many useful links are embedded with the pictures.
HR669 hasn’t exactly been making national headlines, but in certain circles, has been the topic of much discussion. Sponsored by Guam delegate Madeleine Bordallo (pictured), it’s going to be the subject of an American congressional subcommittee hearing this week (23 April 2009).
The summary of the bill indicates that much is expected in determining whether a species would be allowed in the country or not, including the identity of the organism to the species level and the native range of the species.
Of course, Marmorkrebs would pose a potentially interesting enforcement conundrum. It has no formal species description. It has no known native range – but its closets relative appear to be southern U.S. species. Are Marmorkrebs nonnative?
There are literally tens of thousands of species of non-native birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates that are kept and bred in the United States (for example, there are more than 2,500 species of non-native freshwater and marine fish species in the aquarium trade alone).
In particular, she is asking researchers for information about whether this would impact their research.
I was listening to an interview with Sarah Pryke on The Science Show. She works with beautiful Gouldian finches (a gallery of them is here). It came up in the conversation that she has about 2,000 of these birds. She estimates that this may well be equal to the number of these birds left in the wild. Which is one of those astonishing thoughts. We forget how many species have most, if not all, of their populations essentially reliant on humans keeping them.
What do you call an animal with no known original wild population? “Extirpated”? No, that’s not quite right. “Extinct in the wild”? That assumes that there is an identified wild population. Regardless, an organism that had known no endemic territory left would be surely be worthy of a conservation effort, wouldn’t it?
Of course, Marmorkrebs fall into such category. We don’t know if they have a home besides our aquaria, or whether it’s under threat or how many Marmorkrebs there might be.
I’ve written a fair amount about Marmorkrebs’ potential to be an invasive species. And while they’ve been introduced into the wild, in Madagascar and elsewhere, but it is far too early to tell what the outcome there will be. If anything, there should probably be some efforts to try to control them in places like Madagascar, because they so obviously don’t belong there.
Nevertheless, it is worth considering the idea that Marmorkrebs might actually be rare, in the global sense. Unless we find a wild population – and there are some reasons to suspect that one might not exist – their future might depend on humans.
I find it fascinating how the picture I uploaded for Wikipedia makes its way elsewhere around the web.
Science magazine last week featured a book review of the first volume of Emerging Model Organisms. Since this is what I hope Marmorkrebs to be, I looked at this with great interest. And luckily, author Jonathan Slack did make some instructive comments on what makes for a successful model organism.
A model organism must exemplify some key general biological problem that can be solved relatively easily with it and that will turn out to have the same answer for more important but experimentally less tractable organisms, namely human beings or economically important domestic animals and crop plants.
Because I’m a neurobiologist, my opinion may be skewed, but it seems to me that crayfish serve well for general biological problems related to nervous system organization and function, as I hope I show my irregular series, “Great Moments in Crayfish Research.” So, in a sense, Marmorkrebs is not entirely a new model organism, but a variation that can take advantage of new questions (e.g., evo-devo) and methodologies (e.g., transgenics). Marmorkrebs do also serve as a model for “economically important animals,” namely other large decapod crustaceans like lobsters and crayfish, whose rearing is less convenient.
The book's protocols reveal that not all the aspirant models are capable of being bred in the lab—something I would consider a basic requirement.
And that’s a point in Marmorkrebs favour, though I’ll be the first to admit that the fairly long generation time and a few related concerns are issues.
For those who manage science funding, the book should pose the question: How many model organisms do we need? That issue is all the more urgent because there is a second volume of this series looming, so there will soon be another 20 or so organisms wanting to get their snouts, tentacles, probosci, or roots into the trough. We practitioners of academic life sciences feel we require a doubling of total expenditure about every five years to remain reasonably comfortable. Funding bodies have found this a difficult target to meet, and it will become even harder with so many more model organisms to feed.
I added the emphasis, because the statement is one that I have never seen before. It’s not clear to me if he’s talking about individual researchers, a research lab, a research field, or something else. But I’ll take a stab at replying to Slack’s rhetorical question with one of my own.
Now, I am not criticizing anyone who works on those organisms. I know a lot of those people, and I like a lot of those people, and appreciate the science that they do. But the recruitment of researchers to existing model organisms resembles what Jorge Cham called a “Profzi scheme,” where more and more people are working on fewer and fewer organisms.
Perhaps a lesson can be taken from ecology rather than economy. In ecology, it’s often the case that there are advantages to being rare.

Last time before I met Master Tham, someone put a black spell on me. After being blessed by Master Tham, I was cured from the spell. I am also wearing Master Tham’s takrut. Months later while wearing his takrut, I feel that something was poking me for a few days. Days after when the poking stopped, I found out a person who was jealous of me was very sick. And then I knew that he was the one behind all the black spell. I’m now very safe thanks to Master Tham.
After the Feng Shui of my house had been done, everything goes on very smoothly the way I wanted. It was amazing. My eldest son is now a boss, running a transportation business and has a very stable income and he got married and gave birth to my wonderful grandson! I get double happiness after meeting Master Tham! I present him a board of testimonial to show my appreciation. Thank you so much Master Tham!
I was living my life in a very hard way. My luck was extremely bad and everything doesn’t seem to be going the way I wanted it to be. I went to consult Master Tham for some advice and guidance to improve my life better. He studied my astrology chart in detail and he told me that in a period of 6 months I will be facing serious mishaps and accidents. He recommended me some good amulets and I bought a Jatukam Statue from him. As advised by him, I wore my amulets everywhere I go and be cautious. That date finally arrived. I was robbed. The robber warned me not to scream but I was too scared and I lost control of my emotions and I screamed non-stop. No matter how he warned me not to scream with a knife on my throat, I still couldn’t control myself from screaming. The robber slashed my throat without me noticing as I was screaming frantically. I was very surprised that I wasn’t injured at all. I was very extremely lucky to have worn my amulet that day or else I had probably been dead. After that incident, I went to see Master Tham to tell him about it and to thank him. My life was saved because of him. Thank you so much again Master Tham. You’re the best!
Before we could consult a truth Feng Shui master like Master Tham, everything seems to be not right in the family. I was very poor in health and therefore facing some obstacles in my work. My father could not find a good employer in terms of pays and benefits as well. Life for us is monotonous. With the help of Master Tham’s fantastic Feng Shui, not only that my health had improved but my pay has increased too. Our lives have become full of happiness and excitements. The surprise is especially for my father who often complains that he could not find a good employer during all those years, had finally found a very good employer who offered him with higher salaries and better benefits, as well as a brand new car for him! Wow! I hereby not only express my most sincere thanks to Master Tham for his truth Feng Shui done for us but also expressing my most sincere thanks to my current boss (who has consulted Master Tham for his Feng Shui remedies at his residential and factory. His factory has expanded from one factory to five factories.) for recommending Master Tham to us to enable us to have better lifestyle in our family. I hope that the readers would seek Master Tham for his Feng Shui advises.
Before I met Grand Master Tham, things were quite bad that time. There are a lot of obstacles and misfortunes that I had to endure. However, after engaging Grand Master Tham for his extraordinary Feng Shui services, blessings, and wearing his amulets as well as takruts for the whole family, things started to change in my life. I managed to open up a new firm and able to have both free time and financial freedom. My business also developed well with many new ventures and opportunities. Above all, my relationship with my family improved tremendously. Because of all the fantastic Feng Shui remedies and amazing changes done by Grand Master Tham, my family and I are still enjoying the good Feng Shui done by him in the past. I really want to thank Grand Master Tham for being the best Feng Shui Master who had helped me and my family so much that practices only the “Truth” in Feng Shui.

It is forbidden the introduction in the European Union (EU) from non-EU countries of meat and its products for personal consumption, since these products can be a vehicle of animal diseases with devastating impact, such as African Swine Fever.
The DGAV has now available, in the English language, food safety rules that must be complied to import food of non-animal origin (FNAO) and food contact material (FCM).
Many European Union (EU) citizens left the Caribbean Islands due to hurricanes Irma and Maria and are on their way to the EU. A number of them may transport their pets, however not in accordance with the applicable Community legislation.
Considering that this is a situation of a natural disaster, these pet animals are allowed to enter, subject to certain specific conditions.
The recently detected case of avian influenza in a dead wild bird (Heron) found in the Algarve region does not change the country's health status for avian influenza.
We inform consumers that they are not affected with avian influenza by the consumption of poultry meat or eggs.
Today, the Commission adopted the creation of an expert group on animal welfare to be called the Platform on Animal Welfare.
The Platform on Animal Welfare will bring together all relevant actors in relation to animal welfare: business and professional organisations, organisations from civil society, independent experts from academic and research institutes, EU and European Economic Area Member States, the European Food Safety Authorities and relevant international intergovernmental organisations like the World Organisation for Animal Health.
It is compulsory to contact in writing the competent authority of the Travellers’ Point of Entry in Portugal, at least 48 hours before the arrival of the animals.
Feeling tired, but not ready for sleep. My mind won't shut down, spinning with all the info I have found and been given by the doctors. Finding out you have Type 2 Diabetes, dangerously high blood pressure, with a murmur and a thickening heart muscle, and basically a stroke waiting to happen, at 36, with 3 kids and a husband to take care of. I know that over thinking things will only add to my stress. But I need all the info I can find.
Finding out I had high blood pressure was an experience, for the last year, I have had debilitating migraines, bad enough I was in bed most of the time, and to the ER 4 times. The last time, Nov. 4 this year, I found out my blood pressure was 234/134!!! The doctor said that each time I had been in it was high, but not that high and they weren't sure if it was the pain causing the pressure spikes or the pressure causing the pain. He said "I am gonna be blunt, it is to damned high, your a stroke waiting to happen!" Well, thanks to hubbies job, I have insurance and I finally went to the doctor. On 6 meds and 5 supplements right now. And since the meds, no migraines, just small headaches. And not every day like before, just maybe once a week :) Very happy with that. I am glad I found this site, and I am joining a support group on Monday.
Hello Gardencricket. I am so glad to here that you are finally getting some releif for your pain. What a whirlwind of emotions you must have been on when you got the news. That is a lot to wrap your mind around. Congratulations on finding a supprot group. Hopefully you will be able to get even more helpful information and ideas of how to live a better, healthier lifestyle. Speaking of which, try not to overdo it. Yes, you should want to and try to get as much info as possible, but you cannot force yourself to take it all in at once. You will have brain overload and will not be able to fully comprehend or receive the much needed information. For now, take it one book, article, etc… at a time. Trust me, you do have time to get to know it all. So, breathe and take it one day at a time. Do it for yourself and your family. Be blessed.
Hi Sarah You are so young. You sound so much like me. One Big difference, I,m now almost 30 yrs older, but some things are quite similar. I had a dr tell me I was a walking stroke or heart attack back in 1986. Like a head strong workaholic, which I was, I didn't pay attention. I had headaches =stress. I got out of breath= going too far too fast. My BP scraped the roof once in a while= I was type A, wired for sound, with a quick wit and a quicker temper. I was at the top of my field. my husband was at the top of his field. We had 2 genius kids in private school. we were at the top of the food chain. That all only lasts so long. Very soon down the road your body starts presenting you with the long term bills for the upkeep. Guess where you are at now. Thank god you have good insurance 'cause this doesn't come cheap. I have one bit of advice. Listen to your Dr. he sounds like a good one, he doesn't, excuse the term, sugar coat what you need to know. Take all your meds, tests, and keep a note book, it's easier to remember what you need to ask or tell him if you have It in writing. You are going through so much right now. Do yourself, your family, and your condition a big favor. Learn how to relax. I had to teach myself a long time ago or I would not be sitting here typing. I taught myself how to find a space of deep calm. It takes practice. I lay as still as possible, clear my mind, shut out all the noises around me but one. Then I slowly take in one big breath of air, hold it just long enough to hear the beat of my heart. I concentrate on that beat, then slowly let the air back out of my lungs and count as I do this. I repeat. when I can count to ten as I slowly intake air and count to 12 or 15 slowly as I exhale, I realize that the beat of my heart has slowed, my headache is fading, and the BP is on it's way down. I hope this might help you. Good Luck! We are all here. Meowbat
Thanks for the reply, Meowbat! I am learning to relax more, and hubby is a huge help. Like this morning, he let me sleep and took the kids to town just to give me some peace and quiet :) Knew I married him for a reason ;)
I go tomorrow morning to a Diabetic Support Group locally. I went to a Diabetic Fair a few weeks back and got a ton of flyers to read. Also got a few samples, one was a full tube of glucose tablets, small thing of lotion and a small pill box. When I went to CVS to pick up my scripts, I was able to sign up for their card and their diabetic program. I have found one thing I enjoy is researching, so the info has been flowing. But understanding it is another thing. I am so glad I found this group.
I am going to be printing out a Medical ID Card for my purse, and I found a style of necklace that I can wear. I have had a few people tell me that I am going overboard when it comes to research and taking precautions. But, I now know what is wrong with me, and if something would happen around people that don't know me, how would they know what meds I have taken that day, what meds I am allergic to, what may be going on with my sugar or blood pressure? I can't afford to screw up anymore. Anyone else have people that act like it's no big deal?
Working on the diet issue now, I have to go shopping again tomorrow after the group. Luckily, I love veggies! Just have to make sure which ones to limit or cut all together.
I have one friend whose father is a diabetic, and when they found out, they changed all their favorite foods to healthier recipes. She is currently working on copying them for me!
as far as tge veggies go Cricket, stick with the non starchy ones and avoid potatoes (of course), corn, peas, and only use carrots occasionally. Boccoli, Cauliflower, cabbage, bok Choi, lettuces, radishes, brussell sprouts, and veggies like these. You may want to research the glycemic index (GI). I have seen some which have the veggies listed as high on the GI (starchy) medium on the GI and low on the GI. You may wish to eat as low on the GI as you can. (I use the GI as a general guideline)
One of the things you may wish to research is how your unique metabolism handles certain foods. I have developed a way of researching how my unique metabolism handles foods & drinks. Upon your request I'd be willing to share it with you.
Cricket I will send it to you in an inbox message since I don't want to make this whole discussion any longer than it is. Also that way if you like it you can keep it where it is readily able to be found. If not you can delete it, I have posted something like this dozens of times in the past year or 2. You should be getting something in your DC inbox momentarily
Hi, Sarah, sorry we had to meet this way. No wonder your mind is spinning, that is a lot of scary information to take in all at once. I'm glad you say your migraines are better. I know when I have one I just don't care about anything except getting over that pain. Hopefully, feeling less pain will allow you to seriously start working on the other serious issues: Type 2 diabetes, extremely high blood pressure, a heart murmur, thickening of the heart muscle, weight, and potential for a stroke. Wow. I'd be worried to.
I'm glad to hear you are now on medicines and suppliments. Hopefully, over the next few weeks, they will begin to help and you will see possitive change. In the meanwhile, the thing that may be most restorative for you is the thing that is eluding you tonight. Sleep is necessary for healing. Sleep is hard to accomplish when you are worried.
Most clinics will tell you that a sleep routine helps. Things like going to bed at the same time each night, listening to soft music for a half hour or so before bed, a relaxing warm, not hot, bath in lightly scented oil; no exposure to tv or computer at least an hours before bed; massage, a good book, or whatever. Of course, it takes time to build a routine and you need sleep tonight.
Something you could do in the short term is called progressive relaxation. When you lie down on your back and get comfortable, start by clenching then relaxing your toes. Move up your feet and legs making them tight, then letting them relax. Do the abdomon, buttocks, chest, arms, neck, head, and scalp. Let yourself begin to sink into the bed…and hopefully fall asleep. If I'm really troubled by something, I sometimes do this each time and wake up in the night. Eventually, my body gets the idea and quits fighting.
There will be lots more we can talk about tomorrow, but realize this journey will take time, it won't happen all at once. Self-care starts right now with you getting yourself ready to get a good night's sleep. Tomorrow is a new day and we can start talking about reducing your carbs and improving your diet, and all those good things.
Tonight, be thankful that you know what you are dealing with and let your body begin it's healing through sleep.
Thanks for the reply, Caroltoo! I am slowly getting there, got a few things written down. Did some downloading so I could print and read easier. Heading to bed after I post this, got a lot to do tomorrow, then a Christmas Party for the local Volunteer Fire Department and Aux. Ladies, of which I am a member. No drinking for me though. Not with my meds. Night and nice meeting ya!

Watch the SKillz video "Off The Wall" directed by Eric White. The track produced by Timbaland. Watch it now! The album: "Ain't Mad No More" coming soon! RealPlayer 56k 100k 300k
Since before the breakouts of his longtime friends—The Neptunes, Timbaland, Missy Elliott and the Clipse—the name Mad Skillz has been synonymous with quality wordfare from Virgi nia. Arriving onto the rap scene proper in 1994, Skillz stuck a flag in the ground and put the world on notice that Virginia was for as much for rhymers as for lovers.
The emcee now records under the moniker ‘Skillz’ because, as his album title states, “I ain’t mad no more.” I Ain’t Mad No More is not your typical hip-hop longplayer. It’s full of topics and textures, rhymes and rhythms, wit and wordplay, and guest shots from Missy ‘Misdemeanor’ Elliott, Musiq and Cee-Lo Green. Says Skillz, “I just wanted to bring something new to the table and give people something where they look at it and go ‘I can’t even believe this came out on Rawkus.’”
On the first single, “Crew Deep” Skillz borrows from KRS-One, noting, “Rap is like a setup/It’s a lot of games/A lot of suckers with colorful names/I’m so-and-so, I’m this, I’m that/But all y’all cats rap about is cars and crack.” Produ ced by Hi-Tek, “Crew Deep” is an outright bragfest tricked out with a blaxploitative gangsta lean featuring the incomparable Missy Elliott and former Xscape member Kandi Burruss.
“Wave Your Hands” is a cut of hip-hop soul, held down by Philly crooner Musiq. It’s backed by a track that’s current enough for new school fickleness and bouncy enough for the dance floor, while seeming like a throwback to earlier, more carefree times, especially when Musiq flows sublimely behind Skillz as he directs listeners to “Keep on to the break of dawn as we rock on y’all to the early morn.”
Similarly, “Y’all See Me,” featuring St. Louis rising star Pretty Willie, is an anthem loaded with playful string and key arrangements. There’s also “Skillz Vs. Shaquaan,” a self-produced conceptual coup, where Skillz battles a hater whose girlfriend likes Skillz’ music a little too much.
“Only Get One” is a poignant, mellow number featuring Philly soul scenesters Aaries. Written as a final conversation with his mother, the song is the result of years of self-introspection, with Skillz breaking into tears. Produced by the Neptunes, “Suzy Q” is a picture-perfect fable where Skillz ends up getting played like a video game by a smooth operator. Another standout tune is “Imagine,” a cinematic narrative of love, betrayal, loss and guilt. “When I got the beat I didn’t know what I was gonna write about, but I knew it had to be something,” says Skillz.
Despite the variety represented on I Ain’t Mad No More, there’s still no shortage of undiluted hip-hop boastfulness, best exemplified by the duets “PA to VA” and “It’s Like
That,” featuring Philly’s Pretty Ugly and Supafriend Danja Mowf, respectively. Cuts like these make it clear that the battle of MC in Skillz’ soul is alive and kicking. “He gon’ always be there and he always gonna be a part of me. I just gotta learn how to tone his ass down sometimes. But it’s always good to have him there, just in case.”
In 1994, Mad Skillz was living in Virginia, pursuing his rap dreams. He was born in Detroit, Michigan and relocated to Fayetteville, North Carolina before settling down and making Richmond his adopted home in 1987. He’d been bitten by the rap bug during hip-hop’s golden age—the years of enduring classics from Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One and Rakim, the legendary MCs whose words inspired him to create his own. “Hip-hop was more or less a way of life,” Skillz says with no pretense.
Displaying that he was worthy of the name Mad Skillz, the MC garnered a reputation as battling baron, a metaphor master and punchline professor, taking out more opppponents than most MCs can wave a rap book at. “If you were in a cipher with Skillz, you definitely walked away knowing who he was,” says Malice of up-and-coming Virginia rap duo the Clipse. “You didn’t want to go up against him.”
Skillz landed a well-deserved recording contract and in 1995 released the aptly-titled From Where???, a small-nod to the then undiscovered talent of Virginia. Filled with avant-garde beats from the Large Professor, the Beatnuts and Buckwild, and wide weaves of words and wit with Skillz “grinding on nouns, hitting verbs from the back,” the album became an underground favorite. From Where??? spawned the hit single “Nod Factor,” along with the underground thumper “Extra Abstract Skillz” featuring Large Professor and Q-Tip, and garnered a Hip-Hop Quotable in The Source.
During his off-season, Skillz also discovered ghostwriting, as depicted on his underground 12-inch classic, “Ghost Writer.” “When I fell into the ghostwriting, I was like, fuck rap,” he jokes. “But like I love rapping too much.” The ghostwriting jobs (for emcees he won’t name) kept food on the table, but for Skillz, rapping has always been more of a vocation than an occupation. “I’ve always been a person with a work ethic,” he says, “I don’t mind getting up in the morning and doing a 9-to-5.”

Welcome to the Lostenart Collaborations Gallery. After viewing this gallery you may wish to visit either Al's or Owen's galleries individually using the navigation bars directly above. Our collaborative images are digital originals, often combining elements from Al's masterful watercolor and acrylic paintings of exotic macaw feathers, buffaloe skulls, eagle feathers, and figure drawings with Owen's bold, colorful, and abstract digital art. There are also collaborations that do not contain elements from Al's paintings or drawings, but were executed and brain-stormed in the digital environment by father and son together. Many of these new collaborations have a certain fantastical edge, revealing alien sub-conscious landscapes populated by archetypes of the soul. Take time looking at the images, and allow your mind to wander over the landscape of the picture. You will find that even similar versions of a single image carry their own specific emphasis, their own unique voices. Think about the circle of life, and how death itself generates life. Think about the four Sacred Elements: fire, water, earth, and air. Think about geometry and the underlying form it breathes into everything. Think about duallity: symmetry and assymmetry, dark and light, circle and square, form and void.

This week's challenge at The Pink Elephant Challenge blog is to use this sketch by Carol Houghton (awesome sketch Carol!!). Here is my card using it:
I cut around the leaves on the branch, and pushed em up to give it more dimension. I also stamped and cut out around the monkey (what a task!), and I didn't even rip him lol. I then folded some of his limbs, etc. forward again, to add dimension. I had much fun creating this one :) Thanks for looking and have a fantastic day :D
What a fun card Dawn, it's so cute! I like how you cut out the leaves on the branch. Thanks for playing along with us this week at TPE!
Thank-you for your very sweet comment on my blog... Put a smile on my face!!!! I love this you did great with the sketch, and the little monkey is just too cute....
LOVE it Dawn, and so glad you like my sketch, your card is super cute and has inspired me to dig out my MZ set!!
This is adorable!! I love how you cut out the leaves...way cool! Thanks for joining us this week at TPE and congrats on your win last week!!!
Five years ago tonight was the last night my daughter had to sleep in a baby house with 90 other unclaimed souls - all under 5 years old. You can pretty it up all you want but the truth is, those 90 babies were orphans, living out a life sentence in a state run institution. And yes, they were feed and clothed and housed but they were still in prison....that's right - prison. Baby house is a nice term for orphanage and orphanage is a nice term for a children's prison. After all, these children can't just leave and must do what they are told without question or suffer the consequences, are feed whatever is put in front of them and won't get any more no matter how hungry they are, must wear whatever is sent to their room that day and never have anything that belongs only to them. And the longer they are in these institutions the better they learn their lesson. And they really only learn one lesson - that is to fight - fight for everything. Fight for the larger slice of bread (or take it from the weaker kid's plate sitting next to them,) the best toy (and I'm not talking about electronics or educational toys but blocks or stacking rings) or the warmest coat (passed from child to child year after year until you can't tell what color it was originally.) Sounds worse than any prison I've ever read about here in America. But prison is for adults who did something wrong, were found guilty in a court of law after having someone represent their case to a jury of their peers and can appeal their sentence or get out early for good behavior. The only thing good behavior will get you in an orphanage is the smaller piece of bread, the cot in the coldest corner of the room and when you are older.....abuse I don't even want to think about. All of this simply because these children where born...to parents that couldn't care for them or would have been turned out themselves or were not wanted for a million other excuses in a country that sees these orphans as blights on society. One parent was recently told by the judge while she was adopting a teenager that the boy she wanted "would not amount to anything and that he isn't a normal boy." So when they can finally leave when they turn 17, these orphans are literally put out on the streets with the used clothes on their backs. No social services waiting to give them a hand or hardship scholarship or any support system. Nothing. The boys can join the army but the girls....oh the girls really break my heart. And by the way, those 90 babies I had to leave behind in that institution 5 years ago where just 90 of the more than 147,000,000 orphans in this world today. Yes that is 147 million children, today, without a parent to care for them, fight for them as any parent would. So tonight on the eve of Lexie and my adoption day, I thank God for adoption - domestic, international, open, closed....however these children come to their forever families. I will always be grateful to God for His gift of adoption and especially my adoption of this amazing little soul I traveled around the world to find and cherish and nurture and love as my own because she is my own, now and forever....my sweet Lexie Lou.
Five years ago almost to the minute I walked down a long, dark hallway into a very small, very crowed, extremely hot room to see the face of my baby girl for the first time. When she was placed in my arms she looked at me and I looked at her....and she burst into tears just like any other birth. Of course my pregnancy was over 12 months long, I had false labors (I had three other travel dates before I finally got on the plane) and 116 long hours of labor (from the time I boarded the plane to Kazakhstan until I saw her face.) And it was all worth it. Adoption is an amazing way God creates a family. Thank you God for walking with me on this wonderful path of life to my baby girl. Here she is - the tiny (only 16 lbs at 1 year, 1 week and 1 day) scared baby girl in pink I fell in love with 5 years ago today.
And here is Lexie today. Healthy, happy and she can light up a room with her smile. This child is loved by me and everyone she meets.
May 17th Lexie turned 6!! Her birthday was on Thursday so she had a nice little party at school and then another at home with Mom and me (more on that another time.) The big party was yesterday, Sunday May 20th and what a special celebration it was. Here's the birthday girl ready to leave for her party. Can you guess what kind it was?
Nope! No dance party for Lexie this year. As much fun as she had at her previous parties this year she went for a Fantasy Pony Party and it was truly magical. We had to keep the numbers down this year so there was only 15 kids:-) We started with rain (it was more upsetting to the adults then the kids but what are you going to do?) and face painting....
Yup a peacock! It seems to be the creature of the year. I loved everything except the blue lips but Lexie loved it all!!
Here's the Wilson girls looking smashing as a butterfly and a dragon. Now my personal favorite was...
While all this adorable faces where being painted on the real event was going on....the horse back riding. Yeah haa!
Lexie got the first ride . Yes she's under the helmet (with a crown naturally), face paint and coat!
After about an hour and a half it was time for the last ride so the tuckered out horses could hit the hay. Here are some of them waiting...what a colorful and well mannered group!
They must go through the enchanted forest to find him so they can return him to the royal palace! Of course the birthday princess must lead the way.
Oh look! Chest of treasures are found along the path. The smallest prince Andrew has found a hidden pot of gold!
The children lead the way back to the royal palace as Princess Lexie leads the sweet mini pony home.
Grandma was there!! Lexie loved having her and so did I. More on her visit in another post but for now
Anyone that knows me, knows that sports aren't my thing. So when the "opportunity" came along to take Lexie to a Mariners game with her school, I passed....twice. But then Lexie said "Mommy can we PLEASE go to the baseball game for Grandpa Jake?" Well of course the answer was yes. See Grandpa Jake is my decease grandfather, Lexie's Great Grandfather. A few months ago, Lexie had seen a picture of him with his simi-pro baseball team and asked about him. I told her how Grandpa Jake had played a game a few hours after he married Grandma Speed and how he'd hit a home run for her that day. Well naturally my very romantic daughter loved hearing that story and wanted to go to a game.
So that is how Lexie and I ended up joining a lot of her schoolmates, teachers and their families at the opening weekend of the Mariners game. Luckily I went with Angela and her three boys. Angela and I were of the same minds regarding the event. We had a game plan and it had nothing to do with baseball. Step 1 - don't rush to get there. Whenever all the kids were ready to go we'd head out. Honestly it's a miracle we left at all since her boys are 5 1/2, just turned 3 and 10 months old.
The beauty of our plan work because we drove up to the stadium with no traffic and found a FREE parking space just a few steps from the stadium. We both looked at each other and were almost afraid to pull in because it was too easy. Did I mention it was free? All the lots we had driven past were between $10 and $20 and a real hike too. Lucky us! So we pulled in, got out and loaded the kids stuff into her stroller along with baby Tyler. We walked the 20 feet to the steps and we were getting ready to take the baby back out so I could haul the stroller up to street level and these wonderful gentlemen walked up and offered to carry it up the stairs for us. We just laughed and said thanks. We were beginning to think it was our lucky day.
We got in the stadium and I have to say the staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time and that everything was very easy for us. We were escorted through the VIP area to the elevator and stroller storage.
While there, they gave all the kids (including baby Tyler) a personalized certificate and baseball card in memory of their first game visit.
Then when we got to our seats we had barely sat down and the Mariners hit a home run with one man on base (do I sound like a real fan or what?) Go team!
It was a little colder than we'd hoped for but Tyler didn't seem to mind and the other kids didn't notice so it was all going as planned. Here's Mathew chatting up Lexie. Did I mention he has a little cruse on her? Too cute.
Step 2 - Relax until someone is unhappy or it rains or it's too boring - then go home. Step 2 was easier than we thought especially when we looked around and saw all kinds of delicious looking goodies. So a couple of innings later we head down to the amazing variety of food vendors.
Lexie and Mathew shared chocolate cover strawberries on a stick. You have to admire their choice. No hot dogs for our crew and this was way better for them....kinda. As we took the elevator back up, who do we run into but the Moose. How cool was that?
We didn't even have to go down to the field and stand in line. Sweet! Angela and I just laughed at this point. Of course we run into the moose (does he have a name?)
On our way back the kids talked me into some Dippin' Dots. Why not - right? That seems to be the real sport at the game - eating.
Then we headed back to our seats to watch some more baseball....naturally they hit another home run for us. Then what seemed like a few minutes later, they won the game and it was time to go home. And for all you Doubting Tomas' here is the final scoreboard.
Of course, more nice men stop to help us get the storler down the steps and no traffic on the way home.
I am sure Grandpa Jake was paving the way for us to have a great day at the ballpark with the hopes of turning one of us into a fan. I wouldn't go that far but I can say

I’m going to do a series on the sexual passages of the book Song of Solomon (which, if you didn’t know, is in the Bible). This post is about chapter 1. The book is commonly understood as a celebration of marital/sexual love and it contains a lot of rather graphic imagery. It’s an especially important book because it’s very sex-positive and provides a powerful illustration of the joy God takes in the sexual relationship between a husband and a wife.
The book is written in the form of a dialogue between the Lover and his Beloved, with occasionally interjections from the wife’s Friends. The language is dominated by agricultural metaphors that can make the book difficult to understand for modern readers who aren’t familiar with the context (which certainly includes me). I’m going to do my best to untangle the imagery, but some of it is guesswork.
The couple is not yet married at the beginning of the story and are fantasizing about each other. The book begins with the Beloved initiating sex rather explicitly.
Nothing ambiguous there. Note especially the “let us hurry!” This woman needs some action. The Beloved continues:
She works hard and takes care of her family, but her own needs have been neglected. The Beloved wants to find her Lover — why should she wander around like a prostitute (“like a veiled woman”) searching for him among the flocks?
The “mare among stallions” imagery is pretty hot. We read above that the young women adore the Lover, and the Beloved is no less in demand. The Lover will array his Beloved in jewels befitting her beauty. (Some have interpreted these jewels to be the Lover’s semen shot onto his Beloved, but that may be a stretch.) When the Beloved replies she again turns the conversation to sex.
These three verses focus on the fragrances of the Beloved and her Lover. While the Beloved is spreading her… fragrance… her Lover is feasting. Her Lover is a packet of perfume (“csachet of myrrh) between her breasts. Women commonly used henna as a beauty product (as a component of make-up or hair coloring), and her Lover makes the Beloved feel beautiful.
“Verdant” is “green with vegetation; covered with growing plants or grass” — but figuratively: alive and fruitful. The Lovers’ marriage bed is full of primal, natural life. This is a joyous picture that always makes me smile.
That’s a lot of wood. Beams and rafters create a rather girthy image in my mind, but given the intimacy of the moment I suppose we’ll excuse the Lover if he brags a little.
If wood is the ancient metaphor for the penis, its equivalent for the female is the flower. The Lover’s member is a massive cedar, and his Beloved’s girly bits are a beautiful lily — compared to her, the other young women are thorns and thistles.

Interactive map and Database on the history of the State of Israel's expropriation of land from the Palestinian people
I had a pair of twin daughters who frequently became sick and would need to consult the doctors occasionally. Worst of all, they would cry in the middle of the night where they find it hard to fall asleep. We tried engaging several Masters to help them but all ended in vain. The whole family also suffered nightmares over the disturbed children. However, after consulting Master Tham and purchasing his amulets as well as having my children blessed by him, they had stopped crying and enjoyed good health too! We finally can sleep soundly and have peace. We are extremely grateful to Grand Master Tham for his valuable blessings and genuine amulets. Our family will always purchase amulets from Master Tham and even recommend our friends and relatives to consult him in matters related to Feng Shui. Thank you Master Tham!
I visited Master Tham with my son some time ago and he told us that my son’s luck was bad and that he should be careful since he is prone to accidents particularly that year. We bought a few amulets from Master Tham and he blessed us. One afternoon, my son was driving a motorcycle before he met an accident. He fall from the motor and the crash was quite serious. Miraculously, my son suffered only minor injuries. There was one thing however, where the amulet we purchased from Grand Master Tham was broken due to the accident. The amulet saved my son’s life. We went to pay Master Tham a visit and purchase a new amulet for my son. My son’s bad astrological star in that same year had a recurrence of accident a few months later. However, in the second accident, it was a great surprise that the amulet my son wearing had disappeared even though the necklace with the amulets could not be removed or came out from the head while the helmet is still put on. With such massive impact of the second accident crash, he was very lucky to survive. We visit Grand Master Tham and inform him of his genuine foresight of the accident, his effective blessings and the capability of the genuine amulets. We bought more amulets for our family too. Master Tham’s amulets and blessings had saved my son’s life twice. The amulet also brought him luck and protection. For all these reasons, we are extremely proud to express our gratitude to Grand Master Tham. We also recommend our relatives to purchase Master Tham’s genuine and good amulets. I suggest that all parents should acquire genuine and effective amulets for themselves as well as their family members for protection. These amulets are far more valuable than jewellery because they can enhance luck, good health, romance, wealth, relationship and above all, save lives.
There are a number of problems that arise in my job before I seek Master Tham for his takruts and amulets. I met with a lot of hardships and obstacles. After seeking Grand Master Tham for his blessings and his special amulets, my job started to become really smooth. Somehow, there is a company that is willing to offer me a much better position with extra higher wages. Besides, my children had all improved in their education as compared to last time. They also managed to get more friends in school and teachers get to like them as well. Once, there is some strangers who made black magic in our house by placing some dung attached with some weird items including a cigarette. However, due to Master Tham’s takruts, the black magic did not work. We are truly grateful to Grand Master Tham for all his fantastic and genuine services. Thank you once again!
I used to have difficulties and face many complications in my business and personal life. However, I purchased some amulets and takruts from Master Tham a few months back. He blessed me and prayed for me as well. After that, my business improved tremendously. My life becomes merrier and happier. I am truly grateful to Master Tham for his wonderful amulets and Buddha Statues that assisted me greatly in personal and business matters. He is a really good Feng Shui master.
International Feng Shui Grand Master Tham Fook Cheong or best known as Master Tham is a notable person in Malaysia. He is well known for his contribution in welfare activities, community services as well as in the field of Feng Shui, Astrology, and Buddhism.
Master Stanley Tham have been awarded by the International Association of Lions Clubs’ International President in 1983 for his unflinching loyalty and services towards the cause of Lionism.
In 1984 the Lions Clubs District Governor of Lions Clubs International District 308 comprises of Malaysia, SIngapore and Brunei awarded Master Stanley Tham a Certificate of Appreciation for his contribution as District Chairman for Activities. In 1983 District Governor 308-B of Lions Club International District 308-B awarded Master Tham a Certificate of Appreciation for his contribution as District Chairman for Citizenship. Master Stanley Tham had been important advisor to a number of youths and public organizations. He have received various awards and appreciations from various clubs, associations and public organizations, such as from Sektor Rukun Tetangga, Buddhist Associations, Persatuan Peniaga-peniaga, various youth organizations and Chinese associations. The master also founded the Buddhist Association of Bidor and currently the important advisor of the association.

An upper-division course on the philosophical theory of knowledge. Not a general, encyclopedic survey of the field, but an investigation and detailed discussion some of the central problems in the subject. Knowledge of many different kinds is obviously fundamental to scientific, cultural, social, and personal life. What is it about human perception, belief, and knowledge that makes it so difficult to find a philosophically satisfying general explanation of how human knowledge is possible? And how are those obstacles to be overcome?
How do we come to believe and know things that we do not perceive to be so at the moment (e.g., the future)?
What exactly do we perceive, and how does it give us knowledge of the world around us at the moment?
In addition to discussion-section requirements as assigned by the Graduate Student Instructors, students will be expected to write three five-page papers throughout the semester, one on each of the three questions. Possible paper topics will be suggested in each case.
Photo Booth for Wedding: People love the idea of taking silly photos in a photo booth, but some have complained that the interior of a typical photo booth is small and cramped. At parties, most guests enjoy taking photos in large groups with friends and family. Hmm….What can we do?
The Open-Air Party Booth is the latest iteration of the classic photo booth, and it’s popularity has exploded over the last couple of years. Essentially, it is a photo kiosk that measures 2 ft wide by 1 ft deep by 6 ft tall.
This tower of fun has several attractive features: Since it is open with no side walls, it’s great for large group photos, accommodating from 1 to 15 people! The open style not only entertains those taking the photos but also everybody else watching! It’s compact size is perfect for where there is limited venue space or difficult access (e.g., on a balcony or an upper level with no elevator).

In order to make this manicure you need dip gel nails. At home, to make such a manicure without special equipment will not work. In order for the gel to dry on the nails you need a special lamp. The nails are covered with a base under the gel, then a layer of dip gel nails is applied, which needs to be dried. The final step is the application of a topcoat.

There are many different ways to measure all sorts of things about the usage of Social Media. How do you measure your own performance? How do you go about determining if your organisation is using collaboration tools effectively? One way is to use freely available metrics tools to help you determine whether your social media engagement is effective. Here below are listed 10 examples.
Nowadays, the gasoline economy still prevails in most markets. The US market has been favouring gasoline yields for a long time.
Even in the Indian refining market where petrochemicals have been strongly focused, gasoil or resid feed still needs to be cracked to gasoline before they are further converted to LPG. The FCC reaction system is highly complicated but, to simplify, the ability to crack diesel range molecules to a gasoline fraction is defined as the conventional cracking activity, best facilitated by Y-zeolite. The cracking of the bottoms fraction into diesel range molecules mostly occurs on the matrix.
HCpect (Qingdao Huicheng Environmental Technology) has been focusing on improving both matrix and Y-zeolite activity to create value for refining customers, all while maintaining or improving coke selectivity. The Y synthesis and treatment has been optimised to offer improved activity, while the treatment of non-framework aluminum improves coke selectivity. On matrix technology, HCpect has a combinatorial system using compensating natural clays to form desirable pore size structure. Moreover, the clay and specialty alumina complement each other for optimised pore size distribution. Both technologies were deployed in a commercial trial in a Sinopec refinery. For a fair comparison, both the current and the incumbent catalyst were without metal trapping technology, despite notable levels of metals on the Ecat.
The FCC unit throughput is 28 000 b/d with a dual reaction zone design. The secondary reaction zone promotes hydride transfer and isomerisation reaction to reduce olefin content in the gasoline product. The catalyst inventory was 380-400 t and the catalyst addition rate was 3.0 t/d. During the otherwise smooth trials without major operating disruptions or cut point shifts, the feed API was consistent at 21.2±0.6°. The combined Ni+V content on the Ecat was approximately 4000 ppmw, with an uptick toward the end of the second trial.
The conversion showed a 1.8 wt% increase when significant inventory was replaced with HCpect catalyst (while far from an ideal catalyst inventory replacement, here comparison was done at ≥20% vs ≤20% inventory replacement levels), as shown in Figure 1. During the trial, small amounts of ZSM-5 additives were used throughout the trial. To eliminate the artefacts of the inconsistent addition of ZSM-5, the combined weight yield of LPG and gasoline is shown in Figure 2; an average increase of 1.7 wt% was evident. Also shown in Figure 3 is the slurry yield comparison against conversion. The new matrix showed improved slurry yield and selectivity when compared against the catalyst with traditional matrix and the incumbent catalyst.
Overall, the value creation through activity and bottoms cracking improvement still proved pivotal to the bottom line of the FCC optimisation. In this trial, the profit margin was improved by $1.13/bbl at the current inventory replacement level. This margin can be further improved when the catalyst replacement reaches an ideal 70-80% level, primarily due to the improved activity through bottoms cracking and Y-zeolite cracking.
Jamie Hince's bandmate Alison Mosshart says that he is closer to her than to his girlfriend Kate Moss.
He would put Rain Man to shame with his recitation of stats and facts about all the different guns involved and available in the game.
This game, and the countless others like it, go against pretty much everything the ol Erstwhile Husband and I have tried to instill into his sweet wonderful little brain over the years.
When they were little, we limited the kids' daily television viewing/computer use time to half an hour. We monitored the shows they watched and computer sites they visited. The Gameboy The Boy received for Christmas when he was 7 was accompanied by a note from Santa that laid out some pretty strict ground rules for any and all Gameboy usage. If these rules were breached, the Gameboy would be taken away.
Now his big dilemma is whether or not to "invest" in Grand Theft Auto IV... stealing cars and hookers.
In fact, I try to be supportive of his passion...he doubts my sincerity (he's a clever boy) but I try to take an interest in his interest.
I actually even handle the transactions in which games rated Mature are purchased. You see, the stores can't sell games to kids under 17...rather... they cannot take money directly from the hand of a kid who is under 17. They're totally cool if that under 17 kid is standing beside his over 17 Mum whilst she grits her teeth and hands over her child's hard-earned birthday and Christmas money in exchange for a violent game that she wishes her under 17 kid wouldn't play.
For Christmas last year, we gave him a fancy schmancy headset that allows him to listen to the game in kickass stereo sound as well as talk to the dudes he's playing with online.
As any good Mum would, I immediately "Liked" his status update and commented "Nice Work!!"...and then I sent him a congratulatory text that read,
Ok...now the congratulatory text might've been a bit much and he obviously could see right through it...
He worked hard for months and he accomplished what he set out to do...and even though it's just a game...he worked hard and it's something that's important to him.
I do struggle A WHOLE BIG BUNCH with how much time he spends gaming and I try to justify it by noting that the act of gaming DOES involve tons of problem-solving and team work and it DOES strengthen his hand-eye coordination and he IS interacting with his buddies and his step-brother through Xbox Live so when he's holed up in his room, he's "virtually" surrounded by his good friends and he's not by himself just playing with faceless strangers.
He loves it and it's been difficult to get him passionate about much over the course of his teenage life ... so I don't want to undermine this passion. As much as I wish with all my heart that he was passionate about something that didn't involve sitting in his room for hours on end playing violent video games, I don't want to discourage this rarely displayed enthusiasm.
A few years ago, I stopped telling him that I didn't want to hear all the intricate details about his games ( even though I find them horrible and slightly tedious...sorry JJ) because, the way I see it, regardless of conversational content, he's talking to me.
I figure that if I don't listen/pay attention when he talks to me about the simple small stuff he likes, he sure as hell won't talk to me when the big important stuff comes up.
I don't want him to think that what's important to him (however tedious and unimportant it might be to me,...sorry JJ) isn't worthwhile or interesting.
I also figure that he's not smoking weed at school or partying and getting hammered every weekend (or ever, really).
He's not surfing countless porn sites (unless HE'S the one racking up the scaredy squirrel porn pageviews...bastard!!)
~A Quick Illustration of The Boy's Character: Last year, I was super excited when the Disney movie "Brave" came out...I adore Disney movies and announced that we were having a Family Movie Night and the 4 of us headed out to the theater and watched this fun and beautiful movie. On the drive home, we were discussing the merits of the film and giving our "Out of 10" ratings and The Boy said that it was "ok" and I said "hmmph" and gave him 10/10 for lack of enthusiasm and thought nothing of it until a week or so later when it dawned on me that I made my 14 year old son go to the theater to see a Disney Princess Movie...in public...with his Mum...and he didn't raise one single word of protest....*sigh* I love My Boy.~
So if he's spending his time gaming instead of doing any of the less pleasant activities mentioned above, I guess I've gotta be satisfied and happy that he's a good kid... who likes to game.
p.s. There's actually a punch line to this story...the other day, he came out of his room/gaming den with a bit of a lopsided grin on his face and tells me that he's been suspended from Xbox Live (the online gaming community) for 48 hours because he used the word "shit" in his Bio.
It cracks me up that "they" provide a virtual arena where gamers from around the globe unite and proceed to gun each other down by the thousands BUT they draw the line at a kid using the word shit in his Bio.
However, it impresses me that "they" actually do some sort of monitoring of content and are willing to take "appropriate" (??) disciplinary action when the need arises.
As the Mother of 3 boys.. all play video games (although Mass is still on Mario and Luigi stuff), I can tell you that they do play less as they get older. When my boys were J's age they played ALL the time as well. They are now 18 and 19 and probably only play a few times a week.
I struggled with the same issues but unless you're going to ban the unit in your home and do away with all play, this is what you're going to have to deal with.
If it's any consolation, neither of my boys have (yet), killed anyone in real life. I did worry that it would skew their grip on reality but it hasn't.
The thing that still bothers me are the conversations they have with their team mates (usually friends) while playing. Calling each other terrible names and liberal sprinklings of the "F-word" are not cool with me and I'm always telling them to stop that.,
My son was quiet a gamer - about 14 he pleaded for us to allow him a game that was "older", my wife did get it for him but was a bit concerned. Actually credit to him he told her it freaked him out - they part ex'd it in for something else and he didn't loose too much on the deal.
B4- I am afraid of clicking on that link...so I'm not gonna and I'll just be thankful he's not a brony sight unseen
Laura - Thanks for the Gamer Mum Support. Hopefully my gamer will fare as well as yours have. Fingers crossed!!
Just to make sure that I'm starting out on the up and up, I should probably disclose the fact that the profile pic I've posted isn't really me. It's a Squirrel who goes by the name Scaredy and NOT a girl who goes by the name of squirrel_e_. (**I should probably also say that Scaredy Squirrel and all things related to him (including my profile pic) belong to the most excellent Canadian children's author, Melanie Watt. I'm just borrowing the picture. I will give it back. I promise.) I have always gotten a huge kick out of squirrels. For years, I have fondly placed the blame for the swift-moving, erratic and sometimes frantic inner-workings of my mind squarely at the feet of the lunatic squirrels who reside inside my head. (BTW- that's figuratively inside my head. I'd have to be a real freak-show to have them literally residing in my head. I keep the live ones in my closet.) Hopefully, this little blurb will explain my choice of title for this blog-Future, past and present posts will be swift-moving, erratic and sometimes frantic ... just like my beloved squirrels. Beware: This blog may contain nuts.

I hate my life so much. At school, I have absolutely no friends. Everyone is so into sports and I'm not. So, they all act as if I'm invisible. The few "friends" I've actually made have all ended up stabbing me in the back. One of my "friends" started telling me how fat I was and how without her, I would be nothing, so I got away from her because she is in less advanced classes then me. Then, my next friend ditched me for the "cool kids." And then my other friend got mad whenever something good happened to me, so she always pointed out how fat I am and told me to grow up and realize that I'm a loser. A couple years back, this creep "liked" me and ended up stalking me, and since then, apparently all other guys who liked me backed off because of that stalker. Then, my ex-"best friend" started helping him get to me and she kept telling me that I'm living life wrong and that I should agree to go out with that guy because no one else will ask me. When I dropped her, she went after all of my friends and any friends I've made, so I really have no one. And I attend this music program at a nearby town so I thought I made some friends there, but they're all fake. And my best friend from there has turned into a bully. The other day, I said that I was upset and she said that her life is worse so I should just get over myself. She talks about me behind my back and thinks I'm a "drama queen." And at home, I can't talk to anyone. My mom has lately just vanished from my life because I haven't done anything that she can brag about to her friends and my dad wants me to be a musician and tells me to practice more. Then, he says he's SO happy with me in public and then yells about what a shitty performance I gave. THEN, he yells at me for not cleaning up the house,and then yells at me for not getting straight A+'s in school, even though he forces me to practice for at least 5 hours a day. I barely get through my homework. I don't know what to do. I know it doesn't sound that bad on this page, but that's because I can't talk about anything more without revealing really personal information online which could cause some creep to come stalk me, which I don't need again.
I'm really alone. I can't talk to anyone. It's gotten to the point where I've considered "accidentally" taking too many pills. A few months ago, I was by myself on my grandparent's apartment balcony which is 8 stories up and I almost jumped, but I didn't because at last minute, my little cousin barged in. I just really hate my life.
Although I was born in Sweden, my life has been one of travel and transition since I was a child. Wildlife was a favourite subject from the time I learned to read, and a trip to Kenya when I was 12 sold me on Africa – a passion that has never abated.
A degree in environmental management from the University of Tasmania and a research year in the Masai Mara introduced me to both photography and the semi-nomadic lifestyle I’ve since adopted. These days I hardly go anywhere without a camera bag and a suitcase, and I am convinced that observing the world through a camera lens greatly enriches rather than inhibits my life, encouraging me to pay attention to my surroundings in ways I had never thought possible before.
I was once told that specialising was the only viable way to succeed as a photographer – advice that I have been ignoring ever since. I am as happy photographing landscapes in Lapland or ancient temples in Myanmar as I am coming face to face with a silverback mountain gorilla in DR Congo or getting children to laugh at my obvious lack of dignity in Malawi.
While I don’t shy away from serious issues I prefer to focus on the positives, on solutions rather than problems, and I try to convey that in my work. I want to capture those aspects of life that I believe we could all use a bit more of: strength, love, beauty, pride, joy and hope. If you look at one of my photos and feel moved to care about its subject – be it a person, a places or an animal – then I’m on the right track.
I keep my work purposefully varied, taking on jobs ranging from providing visual material for non-profit organisations and leading photographic trips and workshops to working with tourism boards and writing and photographing travel features. I work closely with Tiny Globe, a wonderful PR agency focusing primarily on humanitarian work, and collaborate regularly with non-profits such as Gorilla Highlands, the National Geographic Society, Force For Good Foundation, Gorilla Doctors, Chipembele and the Anne K Taylor Fund. I have been published in numerous international magazines and newspapers, but work most closely with Scandinavia’s largest travel magazines, Vagabond (Sweden and Norway) and Rejsemagasinet Vagabond (Denmark) and, most recently, the exciting new popular biodiversity magazine bioGraphic.
While I hardly ever enter photography competitions, I did so in 2015 and was rewarded with a finalist photojournalism image in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, leading among many other things to being featured in the Royal Photographic Society Journal – the world’s oldest photographic magazine. Recurring clients and partners include the National Geographic Society, bioGraphic, African Parks, Luambe Conservation (where I am also a conservation and community development advisor), and Vagabond.
This week, Life Training Online is reviewing The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment , by Eckhart Tolle, the tenth of fifty-two books in the 52 Personal Development Books in 52 Weeks series.
One of the core points the author tries to get across throughout the book is that the mind is separate from ourselves. Also, it has its own agenda.
The mind is your ego’s representative — the enemy to true Being or living in the Now. It will do everything in its power to keep you from experiencing the present moment fully. And if you can understand the common strategies the mind uses to keep you from being fully conscious, you’ll be able to more quickly enter and maintain the state of being completely in the present. We’ve already discussed worry and guilt. Another major strategy the mind employs is waiting.
What Tolle refers to as waiting is our tendency to look to the future for our happiness. We are constantly waiting for that next job, or the next vacation, the next relationship, or waiting until we make lots of money — until we’ll be happy. This state of mind is destructive to living fully in the present. What you are really saying is that you want the future and not the present. You don’t want what you’ve got and you want what you don’t have. Making a habit of this will greatly reduce the quality of your life.
When you catch yourself “waiting”, snap yourself out of it. Just enjoy being. Come into the present moment and look for the beauty and life that is all around you. I like Tolle’s example:
“So the next time somebody says, ‘Sorry to have kept you waiting,’ you can reply, ‘That’s alright, I wasn’t waiting. I was just standing here enjoying myself — in joy in my self.’”
According to Tolle, there’s no way to intellectually understand what ‘presence’ is. Truly understanding presence is being present. When you are intensely present you are free of thought, and one of the best ways to become intensely present is by becoming aware of your inner body (which I’ll talk about in the next section).
For most of us, the only relief we find from the ramblings of our mind is by occasionally reverting to a level of consciousness below thought. Sleep is one way in which we all do it. Another way people find relief is through sex, alcohol, and other drugs. But these are all temporary ‘fixes’ without any lasting solution.
The answer is not found in falling back to a conscious level below mind (which is the level of animals and plants), but in moving forward into the consciousness of being totally here in the Now.
One method of becoming aware of your inner body is by going within and “feeling” your body from the inside. As an exercise, Tolle suggests you close your eyes and try to “feel” the life energy that pervades throughout your hands, legs, organs, arms, chest and so on. If you can’t feel very much at this stage, just pay attention to anything that you can feel. It might just be a slight tingling sensation in your hands and feet. These sensations will grow as you practice.
By directing your consciousness to your inner body, and maintaining that attention there while performing other activities (like reading this for example), you will be anchored in the Now. By doing this, you don’t get lost in your mind. Your thoughts and emotions will still be there, but the difference is, they won’t take over.
The Power of Now is the tenth of fifty-two books in Life Training – Online’s series 52 Personal Development Books in 52 Weeks.

Chris Slabber is a creative artist and designer from South Africa; he has created a beautiful series called “Destruction/Creation“.
Inspired by the works of Alberto Seveso, he created his own series of paint in water sculptures. These were exhibited at KKNK 2014 at a gallery called Art Karoo.
He writes: “The idea behind this series was to show that from Destruction comes Creation. As the paint falls there is a constant point of creation, but at the same time it destroys itself.”

ANOTHER DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER: It's too bad I don't have referrer logs, because I'd love to know if former Report editor Candis McLean stops by. Today the Edmonton Journal published the following letter:
If I read any more stories saying, "As a former employee of Alberta Report, let me tell you some amusing anecdotes that illustrate how clever I am and what impractical eccentrics the Byfields are," I will abandon all hope for journalists as a species.
These writers imply, with an urbane snicker, that had they been at the helm, the valiant ship would still sail on. What rot.
I worked for the magazine for five years and I have never met anyone who worked harder than the Byfields, or who struggled more determinedly to keep an ideal afloat. They ceased publication only after every courageous effort had been made to fight society's drift toward today's buzz word of "whatever!"
We watched as Link Byfield not only tackled the grinding, hands-on job of editor, but also co-hosted with his wife, Joanne, a daily radio program. Their aim? To reveal the wide range of topics covered by a magazine which, astonishingly, most of its critics had never even read. The demands of those two full-time jobs were brutal, yet Link somehow retained his sense of humour and caring for his staff and readers. The word for that is "commitment."
Septegenarian Ted Byfield wrote weekly nationally syndicated columns, while masterminding the breathtaking Christian history series. Less well known -- because he would never mention it -- are such deeds as he and his wife, Virginia, quietly opening their home, for months on end, to fellow church members down on their luck.
While former employees across the country recount stories of how they could have done better than these "impractical eccentrics," I would love to see the Byfields write a book about employees they have known. Yet, stoically, they do not respond.
I would love to hear some of their more lighthearted tales. For instance, Paula Simons' recent Journal column began: "I am Ted Byfield's bastard daughter." Simons' comment was intended to be metaphorical, as she went on to reveal her philosophical differences with her former employer. But the claim led to several curious calls to the Byfields, and the irrepressible Ted whipping off a note to Simons' father stating: "I deny paternity."
It's corny, I know, but sometimes on a hot summer afternoon I find myself dreaming that an intelligent backer will step forward to refurbish the ship that worked so tirelessly to ferry Canadians from the quagmire of "Oh well, whatever" to the terra firma of commitment.

It's a good time to be a Christian metal fan right now. It seems everywhere you turn, more new metal is being released, and you may have a hard time picking which band to buy. Well, here's some more music to choose from. The Murfreesboro, Tennessee band A Plea For Purging has released their sophomore album on Facedown Records, entitled Depravity.
A Plea For Purging's musical approach can best be described as August Burns Red with less breakdowns and somewhat more straightforward song structure. The vocals are low and very guttural, which sounds good for the most part, as long as they are supported by the instrumentation. By themselves, as we hear briefly in the third track "Malevolence," they sound somewhat strained and forced. The guitars chug along in the typical metalcore style, occasionally breaking out into some fast runs or high, more ethereal accompaniment. Every once in a while, an electronic feel will emerge briefly, which is a nice touch. The overall sound is solid and exactly what the listener would expect from a metalcore band.
Unfortunately, A Plea For Purging has one very obvious flaw that affects the entire album. There is very little variation between tracks, especially where rhythm is concerned, and at some point every song becomes a slow, grinding growl that drags for longer than is warranted. By the time the listener gets to the final track, everything has started to sound the same. Occasionally the band does manage to produce an energetic sound that can carry the track through, without getting boring. The aforementioned "Malevolence" is definitely the high point of Depravity, bringing a consistent energy that mounts very nicely into a soaring chorus. "Traitor," "Motives," and "Retribution" are also solid efforts. Yet, the other tracks do not always measure up.
A Plea For Purging is a talented band that could use some more experience in songwriting before they will be able to unleash their full potential. It is definitely nice to hear a band that isn't entirely committed to endless breakdowns. In that sense, Depravity possesses a refreshing sound. At the same time, this is a flawed album. Metal fans looking for new music will be justified in purchasing Depravity, but they should expect only an average effort.
Sex, pleasure, carnal desires … those things Ashlynn understands. Love … not so much. Her world is turned upside down when she starts to feel something for not just one man, but two. The question is, can she have all that she desires, or will loyalty to her family interfere.
I just knew that Leyton’s story was going to be sexy, spicy and filled with everything that makes an entertaining and unforgettable read. Nicole Edwards did NOT disappoint.
In Beautifully Loyal, we meet Leyton and get a glimpse of the life he came from before he joined the Adorite family and the Southern Boy Mafia. Abandoned by his mother and abused by his father, his friendship with Max Adorite took him on a path where he finds a life he wouldn’t change and a family he would do anything for.
Ashlynn Adorite is sister to Max Adorite and has grown up in the life of the mafia. She knows what it means to do whatever it takes for what you want and to protect yourself. She’s tough and sexy and lives with a ‘take no prisoners’ attitude. Being female, she’s often underestimated and uses that to her advantage.
For years, they’ve harbored feelings for each other but never acted on them; which leads to so much angst between them throughout the book. The catalyst for them is Jase… Ashlynn’s head of security and regular boy toy. His desires spark the flame that changes their lives.
Meanwhile, the mafia life gets in the way and Ashlynn is in danger. This amps up the suspense element in the novel which kept me on my toes. It was similar to a tennis match. To left is danger and to the right is smokin’ hot sex and vice versa. The steam level was top notch and worthy of a couple panty changes (so be sure to keep spare panties handy). The M/M, M/F, M/F/M, M/M/F scenes were WORTH. THE. WAIT!! Each providing all the passion and emotion that I could have asked for.
Ashlynn turned to see Jase sauntering down the hall toward her, his thigh muscles bunching with every step. She loved the way those faded jeans hugged him in all the right places, accentuating his muscular thighs, fantastic ass, not to mention the giant bulge he sported between his legs. The man had caught her attention from the very first day he’d stepped into her house five years ago, looking for a job. He was mouth-wateringly good-looking, and that voice of his… His words alone made her insides quiver with need.
When Jase’s six-foot-two-inch, extremely powerful frame pressed her up against the wall, Ashlynn clutched his broad shoulders as she peered up into those sexy, crystal-blue eyes. His blond hair was cut short but not so short that she couldn’t slide her fingers through it and pull him down to her.
Jase nuzzled her neck as he slid his big, warm hand beneath her skirt, easing inside her panties and pressing his finger against her clit.
The man knew exactly which of her buttons to push to ratchet up her heart rate, and he didn’t have any qualms about giving her what she needed when she needed it.
Ashlynn nodded again, her eyes rolling back as the pleasure intensified. “Don’t stop,” she murmured, riding the sensual high her body craved as he teased her clit.
Ashlynn smiled against his mouth. “I’ll tell him I’m a big girl and I can fuck my head of security if I want to.”
“No doubt.” Jase’s free hand slid around to cup her ass, squeezing her close as he adjusted their positions so that he could push two fingers inside her. “Is that an offer?”
That was another thing she liked about Jase. He sated her every craving and wasn’t afraid to ask for what he wanted.
“The first, although the second’s not a bad idea, either,” she told him breathlessly, hating that his hand was forced to retreat as she slid her back down the wall, her eyes still locked with his.
While she fumbled with his zipper, Jase pressed his fingers against her lips. “Suck them clean and I’ll give you my dick.”
Never looking away, she took his fingers into her mouth, licking them clean while she freed his cock from his jeans. When he removed them, her tongue instantly lapped at the bead of pre-cum pooling on the wide, swollen head. His hands slid into her hair, gripping her firmly while she proceeded to blow him right there, in the hallway of her brother’s house.
This was probably one of the more private places she and Jase had gotten down to business in. They’d become notorious for acting on their urges spontaneously. It kept it interesting, to say the least.
Ashlynn wasn’t embarrassed to say that her sex drive was high, significantly higher than most women. Previous lovers hadn’t been able to keep up, which was likely the reason she had never settled down long enough to have a real relationship. That and she didn’t believe that sex and love had anything to do with one another. But if she was ever going to give in to love—if it even really existed—then she was damn sure going to be certain the man could sate her every physical need first.
Regrettably, finding that man wasn’t as easy as she would’ve preferred. Not until Jase, anyway. Not that this thing between them could be categorized as a relationship. But it was the longest amount of time she’d been with any one man exclusively. They’d been fucking like rabbits for about a year, and the frequency hadn’t lessened with time. In fact, Ashlynn was inclined to think she wanted him even more now. It was as though he knew her, knew what she liked, what she needed, what she wanted.
It helped that he wanted the same things. Such as Leyton crushed between them. Jase was openly bisexual, although he hadn’t been with a man in all the time they’d been sleeping together. To help alleviate that desperate need that ate at him, they’d started talking about their fantasies while she secretly plotted a way to get Leyton to succumb to his own desires. It was the twenty-first century, after all, and a woman was allowed to ask for what she wanted, to explore her sexuality and admit she had needs. It had been during one of those fantasy discussions that she and Jase had both learned that adding Leyton to the mix would be the cherry topping on a fucking kick-ass sex sundae.
“Aww, yeah,” Jase moaned, tugging her hair as he pressed his hips forward. “You’re so fucking hot like that, Ash. My dick buried in your mouth.”
That was another thing she enjoyed about Jase. He was incredibly vocal. There were times when he could almost get her off with little stimulation and a hell of a lot of that dirty talk.
However, as good as he was, no one was perfect. The one thing about Jase she’d noticed early on … although he was supremely alpha, when it came to sex between them, he had always submitted to her to some degree. Even if he topped from the bottom so to speak, he had always allowed her to maintain the ultimate control. And she knew, deep down, Jase worried she would break if he took that away from her.
Movement out of the corner of her eye caught Ashlynn’s attention. While she continued to suck Jase deep into her mouth, using her hand to stroke him simultaneously, she flicked her gaze down the hall. There, in all of his sexy glory, was Leyton.
He looked almost bored, but Ashlynn knew better. He was likely trying to figure out whether or not he should join them. She already knew what his final answer would be,but a girl could definitely hope.

We are on the corner of 7th Street and 8th Avenue NW and we are looking toward the east at the homestead of Reuben Ash one of the early settlers of the area who is reported to have a cabin on this site around 1838. This house with the red brick was built over a number of years. The house to the left with the entrance was built around 1853. The wing to the right was added in a few years after final construction and there is no change in texture of the house. This is a typical rectangular style house out of brick, and there are also ones of the same type in town made out of wood. This is the only one of this kind over here because it was the farmstead. There are three-over-three windows and over the door it has lovely transoms that let light into the house. The pillars are probably not original, but the porch line probably is. It is a Greek Revival house, and a double-brick style house made of local brick which was baked right on the property. The brick has the same tone of color as the buildings on the Cornell campus and buildings in town. About every several rows you will see a row of headers mixed with the stretchers that are tying the walls together.
Ash owned all the property around here and to the east. The main part of this district was the orchard. At Ash’s death his daughter sold this off to a couple of late 19th Century developers. His front yard was across the street here and is now called Ash Park. He sold it to the college for athletic fields. His property extended across the railroad tracks and the community lore was that Ash was upset with the railroad cutting up his property.
The period of significance here is from 1895 when the land was available through 1919 when the last house was constructed until the mid 1950’s. The developers who bought this orchard and plotted it were Charles Whittemore and William Platner. They received their plot in 1893. Platner operated a stone quarry and little is known about Whittemore.
The first great national depression occurred in 1892-93 and it did affect this part of Iowa. It will not be until 1895 when some of these houses were built and there will be a number of college faculty who will build in this area since it was close to the college and fairly close to the depot.
Between the years 1895 and 1919 thirty-six of the forty-two houses which comprise the district were constructed. Part of the attractiveness of this area for the National Register is that is was all built within a generation and it clearly has local roots all the way around.
When you come around the back of Ash’s house you will see that there is a small enclosed porch on the wing. It adds a considerable amount of area to the house, but it was once probably built as an open porch. We come to the barns back here. We have the gentleman’s carriage house which has now been modified into a garage with a little hay door up on the top. We have a number of these carriage houses in town. This goes back to the latter part of the 19th Century.
We are on the corner of 7th and 7th. The very large house with the partial wraparound porch is the home of Hartung who was one of the developers of this area. It sits on a very large corner lot and was built in 1902. The houses to the north of this house are not included in the Ash Park district. They are mostly in-fill. This house is very characteristic of its period. It has a porch with its lovely balustrade and columns, and the first floor has narrow siding and the second floor and gable ends are shingled as well. If you look to the east side of the house you will see the large windows and the lovely highlighted fish scaling.
If you cross the street on the other side you will see the Chaffee house, 617 7th Avenue NW. It was built in 1895. It was one of the first homes built here in the district on the corner of 7th and 7th. It has a delicate porch above the porch, fish scaling in the gable ends, and it has a beautiful bargeboard in the peak of the roof. This home is very straight forward, and it would not have been an imposing house at the time. There have been very little alterations on the limestone basement.
If we look across the street at 616 7th Avenue that house was built in 1900. It is a good example of what was going on in domestic styles. This is a gambrel roof which means that the gable has an extra hip in it. There is a lovely porch around the bay window, the balustrade looks very much original, and on the south side there is another bay window. There is another gambrel on that side, delicate window treatments, and there is a banding of fish scale that forms a kind of a frieze just above the column and below the overhang of the porch.
The house next to it down to the south 608 7th Avenue NW has a complex roof line and a large amount of fish scale in two different patterns. This has a lovely one-story bay, the porch is very straightforward, and the gable ends are interesting. Notice the oval window which is called an oculus with little details on it in the attic. There are similar window pains or muntins in these houses (608,616) especially in the upper windows which are not unusual in the early 1900’s. If you are looking at the south side of 616 the beautiful panes are into the sitting room, and there is an enclosed porch on the back. You really need to stand in front of the house to see the sense of entry with its transom windows. It attempts to make on arch over the door.
We are going further south to the next corner of 7th Avenue and 6th Street. Lets go east and we are at 625 6th Street NW. Despite a number of additions and alterations, this house is clearly from the turn of the century. We will see a number of these styles with just a front gable. It has a little fish scaling in the gable end, a hint of a bay window on the west side, a small porch and on the east side a chamfered corner part of the Victorian style, and then another addition on the side here that is probably not original.
The next house is 615 6th Street NW. It is a real Queen Anne style. Notice the turret on the entrance and another one immediately to the right. There are two different styles of siding, a large siding on the lower floor and narrower siding on the second floor. There are lots of windows and irregular roof lines which are part of the Queen Anne style. Undoubtedly there were porches on the back that were closed in. There is an obvious close in of the second floor porch in the back where the larger siding is used in the upper part of the house while the original house has it on the lower part of the house. That is pretty tell-tale evidence of an addition or it has been enclosed. The roofline is original. The east side of the house has a main turret with its 2-floor 2-bay windows. There is another bay window stuck on the first floor.
Walking east next we go to the bungalow at 609 6th Street NW. (walk east) This is very typical of the whole Bungalow movement and this was one of the last houses built here until after the war. It was built in 1921. It is usually considered a story and a half. The gable off the west could very well be an addition. There is a nice sense of entry. The room upstairs has a crazy roof line and there are different ways to finish it off, and you can have one big room if you wish. From the east side there is a little 2-window addition. This is one of a number of bungalows in Mount Vernon and most of them are between 1910 and 1925.
If we go east to the corner we will come to 603 6th Street NW. This is called the Freer house and it dates from 1901. There is wide siding on the first floor, narrow siding on the second floor, and fish scales in the gable end along with the oval attic light. There is a bay window here on the west side and it is supported by the wall. There is fish scaling on this one as well. This is one of those houses where you have to walk all the way around it to get all the details. One of the mysteries of this house is that there is no roof over the extension of the front porch and there never has been. You can tell by the way the shingles and wood are right above the window. It is very usual to see any of these Victorian houses without a roof on the front porch. There are transoms on either side of the door and there was once one above. The decorative work inside the windows was added.
Across the street at 525 6th Street NW we have a lovely sand brown house with chamfered corners and it would have had a very different porch line. This house is from 1897 and is one of the early homes in the district. It is close to the town and just about three blocks from the college. The house has been covered with aluminum siding and has lost some of its sharpness of the angles.
We are going north and come along the other side of the house at 603 6th Street NW. It is worth feasting the eye on. It has very complex surfaces. There is a triangle in the corner of the gable roof and a fish scale treatment all the way up the roof. It is a very busy house. Notice the dentils under the splash rail and another oculus. There tends to be not another gable roof arrangement like this in this area. It is asymmetrical to say the least.
Across the street at 606 6th Avenue NW the house is from 1895. It has a bay window and a complex roof line. The bay is on the south side and the aluminum siding has deprived us from the subtleties of the house. The doorway is not original. A large front porch has probably come off at one time. There looks like there is some sort of addition on top.
We go north and come to 616 6th Avenue NW. There is a bay window on the south again. This is a very small and modest house in a lot of ways. The second floor porch has obviously been added. The porch could have come clear across at one time. You have to use a little imagination, and siding was not used as balustrades in the period. This house may have been identical to the house on the right. This porch dimension looks original. There is shingling used up in the gable ends. The roof slopes to the south and makes no attempt to be symmetrical. The little gable above the porch that anchors the doorway is about at the same angle of the roof. There is a little bit of balance in angles but not in materials. The house on the south has the bay windows with the chamfered corners and wide siding all the way up. Lets look around the north side of 616 and check the gable ends here. There is a different type of fish scaling here than the front. It attempts to be a type of bay here that protrudes from the house and breaks up the long wall.
These are fairly modest homes here except for the Freer home which is quite elegant in comparison to the others.
Now lets look at 620 6th Avenue NW. This is from 1910. The porch line may be original. This is an American four-square house. It is very straightforward. There are no bays. It is the simple, inexpensive model home.
*This is the most elegant block in the district. There are three key structures here and the house immediately to the right is the VanValkenbery house at 703 6th Avenue NW. It was built in 1896. This is a Queen Anne style with a large tower. If you stand in front of the house you can see the different types of textures on the turret. You have a frieze of fish scales and notice the arrow points below the shingles. You do not see much of them in town. The gable end to the right has fish scales and sunbursts. There is a delicate porch with balusters on the bottom as well as under the over hang. The porch skirt is quite interesting. That is the area between the porch and the ground. It is a lovely home and was the residence of professor VanValkenbery and part of the college influence.
We are now at 711 6th Avenue NW. This is a four square with small interesting details on it. We do have two different styles of siding here. There is a pattern on the first floor and a narrower one on the second. There is gable with fish scaling and a flat roof. There is a large window to the left of the door with cut glass in the upper part of that and that is original. It is asymmetrical after the Victorian arrangements.
*Walk north to 717 6th Avenue NW. This is one of two key structures that anchor the block, built in 1905. There is a huge wraparound porch which covers a huge bay window. If you look above the porch you can see that the bay is a two-story bay that moves toward a conical roof line as a turret against a sweeping roof line that reaches much higher than the top of the tower. These broad steps may be original and with this much space they seem to work. There are very plain balusters and columns and a gorgeous sitting area. This is a very good style of a Victorian style room arrangement. If you look to the north you will see that there is a door into the house. That is the door that the family would use. That goes into the family area of the house. The real entrance to the house is over on the left. Just past the swing you will see the protrusion of the structure. That is the company door and goes into the lovely bay area, living room, and then into the dining room. Frank L. Wright hid his entrances saying that “the only people who need to know where the entrances are, are the people who live there.” You have to look very closely to see the door to the right and you can not even see the main door from the front of the house. We will go a few feet to the driveway so you can see the north side of this house. Viewing this house from the north side you see the angles of the roof lines with a large amount of fish scaling on the second floor and on this very long stretch of unbroken narrow siding. There is another bay window on this side that is in the dining room. One of the nice things about this house is that it sits on this gorgeous lot. When they did the garage they maintained the same narrow siding concept. This helps considerably and does not just leap out at you.
*Across the street we are going to go to 716 6th Avenue NW. We need to walk past the house a little bit to the maples to get the full view of this house. This was built in 1901. It has a complete wraparound porch and again has a door on the side. That is usually a sign that that is a family door. The front door with the oval glass is the company door. There is a lovely covered bay window which allows light into the living room. You come into the house and there is probably a stairway hung on the north side. The siding on both floors is the same. On the gable end we have a semi-circular attic window against fish scaling. There is a porch above the porch and that begins to be an interesting topic. Some would say that it is just a sitting porch where someone would sit in the evening just off of a bedroom. Many of them really are. Those porches also had the function of being a place where someone could shake off a dust mop. When you are doing house cleaning on the second floor, you could always shake it off there instead of opening a window. It was great for letting air into the house for cross ventilation. It is a design feature, but they did have some pragmatic value. The fluted columns on both floors are quite lovely and do really well on this house. They help bring it down. It is a very large structure and the porch balusters are heavy. There is a hint of a bay window which is probably the dining room in that house just off of the porch. People could go directly into the dining room and then onto the porch for dessert.
We are now up the street to the south at 712 6th Avenue NW. It was built in 1907. It is a basic American four-square house with a little bit of sense of entry by the roof line on the porch. There are two very interesting gable ends up there. There are narrow paned windows one with fish scaling and the other with elaborate little triangles, and they are trying to let light into the attic functionally, but they are a very important design element. In the fall if you stand across the street and look at the three gables, the house has some very interesting attempts of symmetry. The north side of the house is very plain, but on the south side there is another sense of entry. We just looked at three house essentially in a row that have two front doors and this one again has one off of the old dining room. The porch is scaled down and delicate. If you look up into the gable that faces the south you will notice those 12-paned windows. They are on both of these gables – one facing west and the other facing south. They become a real decorating element in that space against fish scales.
We are going to go south to the corner of 6th Street and 7th Avenue. This house at 702 6th Avenue NW has been altered considerably, but notice this gable end with the bay and fish scales and Queen Anne style panes in the windows on the first floor. This was built in 1900. The enclosure over the front door has given us a problem when thinking what was once originally in its place. When you see windows with the little panes and then if you see another one immediately up the wall from it that is usually a sign that there is a staircase on that wall and those windows are letting light into the staircase. When you walk into the house there is a landing to the right, it bends at the window and you go straight up to the second floor.
We are now going to walk to the east. There is a nonconforming structure at 515 7th Street. We are now down on 5th Avenue and 7th Street. We are going to go across the street to 615 5th Avenue NW. This is a remarkable house. You have to look at it for a long time in order to grasp what is there. There is a bay window on the north side, a huge roof line with very interesting treatment over the attic window with dentils, and a bargeboard complete with brackets. The upper part of this house has a tremendous amount of detail. When you look at the front of this house, the bedroom area looks like it protrudes from the front wall, but it is not. There are brackets, semi-circular windows, and it is cut deeply into the roof. There was probably a balustrade at the front of that area. It is very deep and could have been a sitting porch. It bears so much of the weight of the roof line. Reconstructing the porch would require some sensitivity to the engineering because there is a lot of weight. There are nice panes in the window on this side, and in the back of the house you can see the huge sleeping porch. If we walk south past the house you can see a bay on this south side and these lovely porches. There is another huge porch on the back. These porches are clearly a part of the private area of the house. This house was built in 1901. Please notice the Gingko tree. It is very large and there is one up at the President’s house which is the largest Gingko tree in Iowa. This one is very close to the other one in size and age. The interesting thing about Gingkoes is that they drop all their leaves i￼n one day.
The next house south is 609 5th Avenue NW. It was built in 1910. It is an American four-square and has a nice little porch. It is essentially a square house with a small gable. There is not much to it. Lets now move to the south side. There is a porch arrangement on the back and could very well have been a sleeping porch. They have added vinyl siding. There was a fireplace in here originally because the small window to the right of it indicates that.
We are down on the corner of 5th Avenue and 6th Street at 603 5th Avenue NW. This is one of the earliest houses and was built in 1897. The house is essentially all here and it did have a sleeping porch in the back. It is nicely painted and has a nice sense of entry. The bay on the south side has chamfered corners with decorative elements. This house was built by a Mr. Carlton and has had only about four owners. There is another porch on the south side. If you go to the corner and around the pine tree you can see the enclosed sleeping porches on the back. If you are company you would enter through the 5th Avenue side, but if you were family you would enter through the 6th Street side. This is the corner of the district across the street.
The town was originally laid out on the topography of the town. In the late 1890’s when Ash Park was being incorporated they decided to line up the streets with the cardinal directions resulting in non-perpendicular streets. The town to our south follows the topography of the hill.
On the corner across the street is a rather interesting house at 608 5th Avenue NW, built in 1912. The porch on the south side is probably a replacement for the smaller porch that was there at one time. It is a very straightforward house and the only decorative elements are the fish scaling in the gable ends.
*The next house to the north in one of the key structures. It is 610 5th Avenue NW and was built in 1901. It is American four-square and there are small interesting elements here. Notice the dentils under the overhang on the frieze. There are nice muntins in the window on the gable end. This house is symmetrical. There is a door in the middle and two big windows on either side of the door. The windows above them lineup with the lower windows. The porch is well proportioned. The whole house has a sense of plainness except for the small decorative elements such as the dentils and the window panes. This was the Harry Kelly house and he was the first manager of the local telephone company. He was part of the Business Men’s Commercial Club and a Sunday school teacher. According to the newspaper this house was built by D.C. Hartung who was the developer in this area.
The house to the north and on the corner was built in 1901. It is 616 5th Avenue NW. These three houses on this block are all from the turn of the Century. There must had been a nice porch on this house at one time which had been taken off. The bay window is five instead of the original three. The house looks very plain and the shutters have been added. The front living room, where the bay is, is huge. It does have a little element of the Victorian era. On the north side there is another little bay and a protruding area on the roof line on the top. The garage does not help the charm on that side of the house. There are no brackets or fish scaling.
We now cross the street to the north and this is a lovely area in the district. The next house is 707 5th Avenue NW. It was built in 1910. If you look at it you can see that there was a second door on the south side and it is just up in the air now. The house has a small bay on it supported by lovely little brackets. It is very much like the house right behind it. If the large addition on the left was taken off, you would get the feeling that you had seen this house before. If you go north and look at the north side of the house, you will see that there is a hint of a turret which is another element of the Queen Anne style. That turret is a contemporary addition to the house. You would not find that kind of turret with those type of double windows. It is tied really nice to the house with the siding and the roof lines.
We are now going to turn around to the east and look at 708 5th Avenue NW. This was built in 1915. It is sort of a transition house. It has the elements of the bungalow style on this porch with its large columns which are probably original given the shape of the upper porch. There are three windows which make up of a flat bay. There is a nice sense of entry and it is symmetrical in some sense. The upper roof is clearly symmetrical. There are virtually no brackets of any kind. It is a transition between the Victorian and Bungalow style.
The next house is 710 5th Avenue NW and was built in 1918. There are two brackets under the window on the upper floor. There could have been a window box on them, but no one is really sure what their purpose was. This house has the broken pediment in which the roof line starts back just a little bit as if to create a triangle in the upper part of the house. There is a flat bay and a short porch. These two houses are clearly from the same period with just little differences.
Le’ts look across the street to the west at 715 5th Avenue NW. It was built in 1905 and is another of those large houses. The porch has been altered and probably had just a small entry porch. The dimensions of the porch are probably the same, but it is just closed in. It is a rather complex house. There has been a little bay window which has been added on the north side. There are nice fish scales in the upper gable.
Lets do the next house to the north which is 719 5th Avenue NW and was built in 1912. This house has been completely resided. It is a symmetrical four-square house. This area developed quite quickly.
*724 5th Avenue NW has a very interesting history. The turret that is facing you with lovely little swags and leaded glass is a spiral oak staircase. There is leaded glass to the right in the sitting room. The porch wraps around part of the house and provides for the doorway. It is also sort of hidden so you have to look for it. You will notice that the whole north side of the house is a huge bay area. The attic gable is most unusual. There are swags as long as fish scales. The windows has very interesting muntins. This house was built in 1910 and has been moved to this site. It was up on main street at the present location of the Merner dormitory which is across the street from the field house. When they built that dormitory they moved a couple of houses. The college apparently owned this lot. It was rental property from the college until it was sold to a faculty member who has since sold it again. Notice the letter drop in this window on the turret. That would have gone onto the floor at￼￼ the foot of the staircase. It has lovely oak woodwork throughout the house. This house may have set differently on its other location. The house should probably be turned to the right a quarter of a turn. This is one of the key houses in the district.
We will make a few comments on the white house across the street on the corner, 725 5th Avenue NW. It was built between 1910 and 1920 and is noncontributing. It is symmetrical and the windows are over each other. The door is almost in the center. The high porch has the elements of the Bungalow style. This porch is not much different than the two houses on this side of the street.

Prior to meeting MM, falling in love with MM, and beginning to believe that I would build a life with MM, I had given up hope of ever having my own child. I'd actually given up that hope twice. The first time was when I decided to change careers at age 30 while still unmarried and childless; I realized that this choice greatly decreased the likelihood that I would be in a position to focus on motherhood. I gave it up again when my relationship with SL ended; I truly believed at that time, based on my relationship history, that it would be years before I would fall in love again, and I thought that there was a strong possibility I wouldn't ever marry. Single motherhood has never much appealed to me: being a parent is one of the hardest things in the world, and I couldn't fathom choosing to do it alone!
I have always had a strong mothering instinct and knew that eventually it would have to find an outlet other than Golden Retrievers. I had a vague plan in my mind that once I had reached my early-to-mid 40s and all prospect of my own, biological child was passed, I would adopt a child from foster care. Baby or slightly older child: it didn't much matter to me. Until then, I would devote myself to developing my career, spending time with friends, and pursuing hobbies.
However. . . I fell in love with a man who wants a child of his own. And while I had put that dream out of my mind prior to meeting him, apparently I had never totally given up on the idea because it was readily revived once I knew that it was again a possibility. I was happy, eager to revive it.
Thus the hope of having a child of my own was reborn. And to tell you the truth, since that hope has returned, I've felt worse than when I had just accepted that it would likely never happen.
I have written here before about our decision to stop using birth control and our efforts to get me pregnant. My period is due tomorrow, and every sign is pointing toward it arriving right on schedule yet again. For six cycles--just over five months--MM and I have done everything "right," but I'm still not pregnant.
I know, I know: five months really isn't that long--especially at my age!--and "God will bless us when He thinks the time is right." "Some people try for years!" BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH. We should "just relax"! I haven't told many people of our efforts; in spite of that fact, I've pretty much heard every imaginable platitude already in regard to our failure to conceive to date.
I'm sure that there aren't appreciably more babies or pregnant women in the world today than there were six months ago. . . but I am now acutely aware of both in a way that I wasn't before. Thank God I have not yet reached the point where I cannot be happy when a friend or family member announces her own pregnancy. . . but I fear I am moving in that direction. (I am already bitter when I hear that one of the felons MM supervises has fathered another child, primarily because these pregnancies are almost invariably unintended and unwanted.)
Technically, I am not "infertile," as infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after trying for a year. (Some doctors say six months of trying if you're over 35, as I am.) Even by the looser, six-month standard, I won't be "infertile" unless we don't conceive this coming cycle. In spite of that fact, I have already scheduled a consultation with a reproductive endocrinologist (an OB/GYN specializing in the treatment of reproductive disorders) for us; the appointment is on October 14th.
By the time the appointment arrives, we will be just days shy of six months of "trying." While I fear that something is wrong with either MM or I that is preventing us from making a baby, I fear almost equally that nothing is wrong, except that I am old to be trying for a first pregnancy. If we find out that something is wrong that cannot be fixed, what then? If we find out that NOTHING is wrong, I guess we just keep "trying"?
I regularly visit a website on which I chart my cycles, and that website has message boards. From visiting these message boards, I am well aware that many women have had (and are having) a more difficult journey to parenthood than I have had thus far. My own sister "tried" for over two years before conceiving her son, and I know more than one person who has had to have IVF in order to become a mom.
BUT. . . knowing that other people have it worse than I do has never been a solace to me in any other area of my life, and it's not a solace to me here. I'm only five months in, and I'm already thoroughly sick of this.
Sometimes I wish I had never revived my hope for a child. I was much more contented when I had set it aside.
It is really hard and depressing when you want so badly for something to happen, that you have no control over. I am so glad that you have an appt-why wait? FWIW, in my young 20s, it still took me 9 months for my cervical linging to return to normal post birth control. 2nd time around I got pregnant without trying, so I really do think it was the BC. Good luck to you. I hope it happens soon.
I have been exactly where you are - married at 36 for the first time. My husband actually had to undergo a vasectomy reversal in order for us to conceive (I am in NO WAY incinuating "we had it worse blah blah blah"). I had my first daughter 5 days shy of turning 39 and second daughter at almost 41. I had regular periods and was considered "fertile" but starting taking this herb combination "Fem Restore" and then was lucky and conceived. Another "trick" I did was using the feminine product 'Instead' after sex and leaving it in place for 24 hours in order to keep the spermies close to the target.
Sorry if too much info! I probably should have e-mailed you instead. LOL Anyway good luck to you and I'm glad you are seeing the doc soon to give you some piece of mind.
The ONLY thing that made me smile when we were TTC was when my sister told me "God is making your baby prettier than the rest so its taking a little longer". The "just relax", "it takes time" crap made me want to punch someone.
As a local business owner you will certainly megazoom 4 asic want to develop a legal entity framework to obtain limited responsibility defense. A popular method to obtain restricted liability defense is to develop a LLC to secure your personal possessions from financial institutions, debtors, as well as legal insurance claims. One of the foremost factors for you to form an LLC is the benefit of having limited obligation protection. Restricted obligation protection is managed to all members of an LLC An LLC ought to be run with a full splitting up of individual as well as organisation properties. One benefit of developing an LLC is that of travel through taxation status, or revenue moving with the entity to the members or owners. In order to keep the opportunity of restricted obligation protection, the company must follow all regional, government, as well as state laws. The company must likewise do every little thing that is called for to keep a great business standing, pay all needed taxes, and submit all essential documents. megazoom 4 asic
megazoom 4 asic Prior to you determine if submitting an LLC is right for your details scenario, you will have to find out about some of the benefits, risks, and needs that will certainly impact you and your service. Below are several of the advantages of developing an LLC megazoom 4 asic
LLC can be strained much like sole-proprietorship, partnership, or corporation (Internal Revenue Service type 8832).

Ideally after reading this you have a better idea about the needs and several of the prospective challenges of establishing and also running your own LLC. While this post is not suggested to have every one of the responses, it will with any luck offer you an excellent basis for progressing with the development of your new LLC.
LLC stands for a limited responsibility company. LLC’s operate similar way as a corporation, because it is a legal entity that can perform organisation under its very own name. A growing number of entrepreneur’ are electing to develop LLC’s yearly but why precisely are numerous business owners now doing this?
As the name limited responsibility recommends the reason many local business owner are determining to develop an LLC is to minimize their individual liability. For instance if you continue to operate your business as a single owner or collaboration you are personally in charge of any kind of service debts as well as for legal action settlement responsibilities brought versus your company. Simply put virtually everything you own can possibly go to threat and be utilized to resolve organisation debts. When you established an LLC you hold separating your business from on your own. By doing this you are assisting to secure properties such as your individual cost savings and also other building including your cars, bank accounts, home etc
. By forming an LLC, keeping as well as running it effectively, you in addition to any other participants (proprietors of an llc are called participants) entailed must not be held directly responsible for points that might fail during the training course of company or any one of the financial debts that are encountered. This suggests that individual assets of the participants are shielded as well as will not be utilized as a method of clearing up organisation financial obligations.
So simply exactly how specifically do you go about forming an LLC? Believe it or otherwise if you wish to develop an LLC you will certainly find it to be a somewhat basic procedure and also it might be just one of the very best things that you ever before provide for your organisation. Actually all you actually need to do is the complying with making it legal and also a truth:.
First you will have to select a name for your company. There are two important factors when it comes to doing this. The evident one is you should see to it the name you want is offered and also second of all you have to make sure that it follows your state’s limited responsibility company statutes such as ending with LLC. Better, some words might be restricted by your state such as financial institution or insurance policy.
Following you have to file formation papers with the state. These are normally referred to as the articles of company or a certificate of development, There is a fee to submit the files with the state and could vary between $50 to $500. When your LLC declaring has actually been approved by the state you need to then develop an LLC operating agreement. Within this contract you must set out the rights and also responsibilities of each of the LLC members.
Last but not least a couple of states require that you release notification that the LLC formation has actually been finished. Ensure to check if this is required by your state. When this is finished you after that simply need to acquire a Federal Tax obligation ID Number (FEIN) in addition to any kind of licenses as well as permits that may be required for your kind of organisation.
LLC’s or a Limited Obligation Company is a sort of entity that you are able to register in numerous states. You have the ability to sign up a LLC through the Secretary of States’ workplace in the state that you wish to form an LLC within.
LLC’s are created for several reasons and one major factor could be the tax obligation advantages that can be obtained. Taxes for Restricted Obligation Business are done using something called go through taxation. This indicates that the earnings made by the service as well as tax obligations for business would be reported by the members of the Limited Obligation Company, it would certainly not be separate from the individual.
Like Corporations, LLC’s have the ability to offer liability defense for your service. It offers defense by creating splitting up between you as an individual and business. As long as the LLC is established properly, it will certainly secure you from any kind of obligations or issues incurred by the business. megazoom 4 asic
A benefit that Minimal Obligation Firms also provide is the freedom to run your service without the headache of constant coverage. Unlike firms, LLC’s are not required to maintain a document of conference mins e.t.c. This makes it a great deal less complicated to run an LLC, specifically for brand-new company owner that will not have time to spend making certain they did the right paper job.
Utilizing a 3rd party to sign up new LLC’s, can be advantageous as well. Not only does it get rid of the problem of paper job, however it likewise provides you the guarantee that the documents is done properly, getting rid of any kind of possibility of problems in the future.
C-Corp: You are planning to elevate outdoors capital from a team of investors, believe your company will certainly expand to be an industry and also possibly go public one day, or you would certainly choose to have all taxation handled at the company level rather than passed thru to specific investors including yourself.
LLC: You expect your business to be smaller and not have as many investors, as well as to increase little (if any kind of) outdoors resources. You do not expect to go public yet assume it is most likely you will certainly intend to pay the earnings made by the company out to shareholders regularly.
Still can not determine? We’ll specify each entity key in a lot more information which with any luck aids with your decision making.
LLC– Minimal Liability Company. These entities were developed to make it possible for local business owner to set-up a legal entity that provides them private lawful and also economic defenses (assuming you do not co-sign for the LLC’s responsibilities) while maintaining a tax obligation coverage framework that permits the business proprietor to record revenues and also losses on their individual taxes. Therefore, LLC’s are considered “Pass Through” entities for tax objectives, implying that the taxed earnings or losses for business are passed thru to business owners, who record these as component of their personal tax obligation filings. The LLC does not pay corporate taxes for profits and does not accumulate losses for future tax obligation offsets. Every one of this is passed thru to owners.
The LLC framework is generally best for smaller business where there are a few owners who are proactively involved in the business operations (proprietors of an LLC are divided into active as well as passive proprietors, as well as passive owners get substantially less tax obligation benefits from an LLC framework. To be considered “Active” you have to be fulfill the IRS’s definition of being meaningfully involved in the procedures of the business). LLC’s in many states are limited in regards to the variety of shareholders they could have, although this is altering as well as there are methods around these restrictions, but once more, LLCs are created for smaller companies so as you grow as well as your investor base expands, you may meet some of these constraints.
LLC’s are additionally a good choice in scenarios where you anticipate the company with have considerable revenues and you intend to pay those bent on shareholders on a regular basis. Because they are “Pass Via” entities, LLC’s are not exhausted for the profits and also rather this is done at the individual proprietor level. Therefore, any money from profits in the LLC has actually been spent for in terms of taxes currently by the proprietors, and can be distributed to proprietors without added tax due. This is different from a C-Corporation that encounters exactly what is called “Double Tax” in that the company pays tax obligations for its revenues, and after that shareholders pay tax obligations for any distributions (returns) paid to them. It is necessary to keep in mind that LLC’s do not need to distribute profits to investors. You can elect to maintain revenues in the company instead to reinvest in the business (or simply maintain for a stormy day). Each holders share of these earnings is tracked in their funding account (part of the equity item of your balance sheet).
We do not have information to show it, however have actually spoken with some folks that they think LLC’s obtain marked down values to some degree in a purchase, particularly if the acquirer is a C-Corp (note: virtually every public company in the US is a C-Corp). There are 2 possible disagreements for this sight. First, due to the fact that LLCs are not taxed, they are more likely to have some funky stuff going on when it pertains to funding accounts, kept incomes, etc. Since C-Corp finance teams do not recognize LLCs also, they can be naturally cautious, which may influence the appraisal paid. The 2nd reason is that it is viewed as being less complicated for a C-Corp to get one more C-Corp, whether it is the procedure of tackling outstanding supply alternatives, managing tax issues for the stub year of the acquisition or various other factors, there is probably some affordable disagreement right here. Again, we do not have data to back this up, but it deserves discussing as you consider the most effective structure for your business.
One final note on LLCs. If you have any type of plans to raise money from institutional investors, DO NOT form a LLC. There is a basic description for this. Most endeavor funds are prohibited from investing in LLC’s due to the fact that these entities can create UBTI (unassociated organisation taxable income) for the venture fund, and therefore for the funds restricted companions. The majority of endeavor fund restricted partners are charitable entities, and among the easiest methods to screw up this classification is to receive UBTI. Consequently, venture fund papers most likely to excellent lengths to ensure they will not be in a scenario where they could tackle UBTI. Before you create a comment listed below, yes, you are appropriate, there are a lot of instances of venture firms buying LLCs (wait, however you said …). HOWEVER, in these situations, the funds actually bought something called a “blocker corp”, which is a C-Corp created for the express function of investing in a LLC. This “blocker corp” properly blocks UBTI from entering the fund, since it is handled within the blocker corp’s C-Corp framework. So, yes, they TIN make a financial investment in an LLC, it is an annoyance for venture funds to do this and also they would substantially like you have a C-Corp. We ‘d likewise say that entering to pitch an endeavor fund with a LLC structure will certainly show you as being rather naïve regarding companies and also endeavor financing, which may not be a significant knock, but is still a knock. Given that, why offer a possible reason for a possible investor to look in other places?
C-Corporation. C-Corporations are exactly what we think of as “regular” business entities because these are the types of entities we see and work with on a daily basis. C-Corps are taxed business entities, suggesting that every year they report their profits/losses as well as pay taxes (state and also federal) when they make a profit, and also record a tax loss carryforward when they have a loss (these can normally be used versus future year profits for tax obligation objectives). Investors in C-Corps have no tax effects from profits or losses as a result of owning shares in the entity, as well as would only have to pay taxes if they were to receive a returns settlement from the company or were to sell their shares for an earnings. Furthermore, the ‘Business Shroud’ of C-Corps is really strong in lawful scenarios, meaning it is essentially uncommon that an investor of a corporation would certainly have any type of legal responsibility for the activities of business by virtue of merely being an investor. While LLCs have similar defenses, they are less examined in the courts and also since these entities are usually related to individual companies, it is in some cases feasible for plantiffs to “pierce the corporate shroud”. There is a huge amount of lawful precendent for C-Corporations, which is an important factor to consider, specifically as you service grows as well as the probability of some jerk attempting to bilk loan out of you for some fake legal case increases (do you get the feeling we do not like trial lawyers?).
The key negatives for a C-Corp is that they are somewhat much more expensive to keep from a legal as well as tax filings point of view, and face “double taxation” when distributing revenues to investors. This 2nd piece is the most crucial, and is finest explained with a fast instance. Take a company that pays 25% in tax obligations on every dollar of revenue, with investors that each pay tax obligations at a 30% efficient price. The company reports profits of $1,000 for the year, and also pays $250 of that in tax obligations. The company makes a decision to pay the remainder to shareholders, so pays $750 in returns. Shareholders report these rewards and income, and also are exhausted on them at the 30% rate (not at the lower Resources Gains tax rate), so of the $750 in rewards paid out, $225 goes to pay tax obligations. So, with a C-Corp, of the $1,000 in earnings, $475, or 47.5% is paid in taxes. If the entity were a LLC, the business would pay no tax obligation on the $1,000 revenues. Instead, individuals would pay tax obligations on these profits at their personal tax obligation rate, so in this example, $300 would certainly go in the direction of taxes, and also the other $700 would be paid to shareholders. This is a 17.5% tax obligation hit for having a C-Corp framework, which huges (as well as in our view a silly process, yet we question this gets altered anytime quickly, or ever).
Here is the good news. If you are intending to elevate equity capital or loan from Angel capitalists, it is unlikely you will ever pay returns anyways, so you need to not let the double tax problem trouble you way too much. Financiers anticipating to make multiples on their first investment are mosting likely to have a hard time gaining an appropriate price of return based upon returns repayments. While every liked financing framework we have actually ever before seen has rewards as component of the bargain, these are non-cumulative (or must be) and are truly just in place as a defense mechanism for capitalists (to avoid usual owners from paying all the capital in an organisation to themselves).
On balance, we would recommend you go with a C-Corp unless you are a small business or have a little group of proprietors. This is one to talk about with your co-founders as well as legal experts, however if you would certainly examine any of the boxes in the quick summary above for C-Corp, we ‘d advise performing.
Quick note: It is feasible to convert an entity from a LLC to a C-Corp. It can be a discomfort to do this, however it could be accomplished, so do not stress if you are already developed as a LLC, you could change it later on– we ‘d suggest you plan to do it in conjunction with an outside funding round as it is not a cheap process. Allowing potential investors recognize you are a LLC however plan to transform with the financing could aid with the minor knock we think you’ll get for being a LLC in the first place.
Second fast note: If you prepare to self-fund the business for a few years before elevating outside funding and also enjoy ideal tax obligation preparation (as well as have a good tax and also company attorney), consider structuring as an LLC in order to identify very early year losses personally before you raise outdoors money. Plan to transform when your organisation begins to develop an earnings or when you raise outdoors funding (whichever comes first). This just functions if you are self funding with a meaningful quantity of loan, and also will certainly call for additional work (as well as legal fees), so we question this is the appropriate course for regarding 97% of the people reviewing this post, yet we such as tax optimization so figured we would certainly state it for the 3% of you around.
. Possible clients might really feel that a corporation is extra substantial and much more “actual” than an LLC.
The company will certainly earn a profit right after the incorporation and also will distribute it to the investors.
To your second inquiry, you are much better off working with a legal representative to do it for you if there is more than someone (significance you will need an Operating Arrangement) or there is any complexity.
I agree that possibly the most fundamental part is drafting an excellent operating contract, services like legal zoom will certainly not provide you with a personalized Operating Agreement and accountants do not actually like drafting controling papers.

Still can’t make a decision? We’ll specify each entity key in more detail which ideally helps with your decision making.
LLC– Minimal Liability Company. These entities were created to allow business owners to set-up a lawful entity that gives them private lawful and economic protections (assuming you do not co-sign for the LLC’s liabilities) while keeping a tax coverage framework that allows business owner to record revenues and losses on their individual tax obligations. As such, LLC’s are considered “Pass Thru” entities for tax objectives, indicating that the taxable earnings or losses for the business are passed thru to the business owners, that record these as part of their individual tax obligation filings. The LLC does not pay business taxes for profits and also does not collect losses for future tax obligation offsets. All this is passed thru to proprietors.
The LLC framework is usually best for smaller sized firms where there are a couple of owners who are proactively involved in business operations (proprietors of an LLC are separated into active as well as passive owners, and also passive owners receive significantly fewer tax obligation benefits from an LLC framework. To be considered “Energetic” you need to be fulfill the Internal Revenue Service’s definition of being meaningfully involved in the procedures of the business). LLC’s in the majority of states are restricted in terms of the number of investors they could have, although this is transforming and there are ways around these restrictions, but once more, LLCs are made for smaller sized businesses so as you expand and your investor base grows, you might run up against several of these restrictions.
LLC’s are likewise an excellent choice in scenarios where you expect the company with have considerable profits and you prepare to pay those out to shareholders on a regular basis. Because they are “Pass Thru” entities, LLC’s are not taxed for the revenues and instead this is done at the individual proprietor degree. Therefore, any kind of money from profits in the LLC has actually been paid for in terms of taxes currently by the owners, and could be distributed to proprietors without added tax due. This is various from a C-Corporation that faces exactly what is known as “Double Tax” in that the company pays tax obligations for its revenues, and then investors pay taxes for any kind of circulations (returns) paid to them. It is important to keep in mind that LLC’s do not have to disperse profits to shareholders. You can elect to keep profits in the company instead to reinvest in business (or simply keep for a rainy day). Each owners share of these earnings is tracked in their capital account (part of the equity item of your balance sheet).
We do not have data to show it, however have spoken with some folks that they think LLC’s get discounted values to some extent in an acquisition, in particular if the acquirer is a C-Corp (note: practically every public company in the United States is a C-Corp). There are two possible arguments for this sight. First, due to the fact that LLCs are not exhausted, they are more likely to have some fashionable stuff going on when it involves funding accounts, preserved revenues, and so on. Since C-Corp financing groups do not comprehend LLCs also, they might be not surprisingly mindful, which may influence the evaluation paid. The second factor is that it is viewed as being less complicated for a C-Corp to acquire one more C-Corp, whether it is the procedure of handling exceptional stock choices, dealing with tax obligation issues for the stub year of the procurement or other variables, there is possibly some practical disagreement here. Once more, we do not have data to back this up, however it deserves pointing out as you take into consideration the very best structure for your service.
One final note on LLCs. If you have any strategies to increase money from institutional financiers, DO NOT create a LLC. There is an easy description for this. A lot of venture funds are prohibited from purchasing LLC’s because these entities can develop UBTI (unrelated organisation gross income) for the endeavor fund, and consequently for the funds limited companions. Most of venture fund limited partners are non-profit entities, and also one of the easiest means to screw up this category is to obtain UBTI. As a result, endeavor fund files go to fantastic lengths to guarantee they will not be in a scenario where they may handle UBTI. Before you compose a comment listed below, yes, you are correct, there are a lot of instances of venture companies investing in LLCs (wait, but you stated …). NONETHELESS, in these cases, the funds actually invested in something called a “blocker corp”, which is a C-Corp developed for the express objective of purchasing a LLC. This “blocker corp” successfully blocks UBTI from entering the fund, due to the fact that it is dealt with within the blocker corp’s C-Corp framework. So, yes, they CAN make an investment in an LLC, it is an annoyance for endeavor funds to do this and they would considerably choose you have a C-Corp. We ‘d also suggest that going in to pitch a venture fund with a LLC structure will certainly reveal you as being rather naïve regarding companies and also endeavor funding, which might not be a significant knock, but is still a knock. Considered that, why offer a feasible reason for a potential capitalist to look in other places?
C-Corporation. C-Corporations are just what we think of as “normal” business entities because these are the sorts of entities we see and deal with everyday. C-Corps are taxable business entities, suggesting that each year they report their profits/losses and also pay tax obligations (state and federal) when they make a profit, as well as videotape a tax loss carryforward when they have a loss (these can usually be applied versus future year revenues for tax obligation purposes). Shareholders in C-Corps have no tax obligation implications from revenues or losses as a result of possessing shares in the entity, and would just need to pay taxes if they were to obtain a returns payment from the company or were to sell their shares for a revenue. On top of that, the ‘Corporate Veil’ of C-Corps is extremely strong in legal circumstances, implying it is essentially unusual that an investor of a firm would have any kind of legal liability for the activities of business by virtue of merely being a shareholder. While LLCs have similar securities, they are less checked in the courts as well as due to the fact that these entities are usually pertaining to individual companies, it remains in some situations feasible for plantiffs to “pierce the corporate veil”. There is a vast quantity of lawful precendent for C-Corporations, which is an essential consideration, especially as you business expands and the likelihood of some jerk aiming to bilk loan from you for some phony lawful case boosts (do you get the feeling we do not such as trial attorneys?).
The primary negatives for a C-Corp is that they are somewhat much more costly to keep from a lawful and tax obligation filings point of view, and also face “dual taxes” when distributing earnings to investors. This 2nd item is the most essential, and also is finest clarified with a quick instance. Take a company that pays 25% in tax obligations on every dollar of revenue, with shareholders that each pay taxes at a 30% reliable price. The company reports earnings of $1,000 for the year, and pays $250 of that in taxes. The company decides to pay the remainder to shareholders, so pays out $750 in rewards. Investors report these returns and revenue, and also are tired on them at the 30% rate (not at the lower Funding Gains tax price), so of the $750 in rewards paid, $225 mosts likely to pay tax obligations. So, with a C-Corp, of the $1,000 in profits, $475, or 47.5% is paid in tax obligations. If the entity were a LLC, business would certainly pay no tax on the $1,000 revenues. Rather, people would pay tax obligations on these revenues at their personal tax obligation price, so in this instance, $300 would certainly go to tax obligations, and the other $700 would certainly be paid to shareholders. This is a 17.5% tax obligation pinch hit having a C-Corp framework, which huges (as well as in our sight an absurd process, however we question this obtains altered anytime soon, or ever before).
Right here is fortunately. If you are intending to increase financial backing or cash from Angel capitalists, it is unlikely you will ever before pay rewards anyways, so you need to not allow the dual taxation problem bother you too much. Investors anticipating to make multiples on their initial financial investment are going to have a tough time making an appropriate rate of return based on dividend settlements. While every liked financing framework we have ever before seen has returns as component of the deal, these are non-cumulative (or ought to be) and also are really just in place as a defense reaction for capitalists (to prevent common holders from paying all of the capital in a business to themselves).
On balance, we would certainly recommend you select a C-Corp unless you are a local business or have a tiny team of owners. This is one to review with your co-founders and also legal consultants, however if you would inspect any of packages in the quick summary over for C-Corp, we would certainly advise going that route.
Quick note: It is possible to transform an entity from a LLC to a C-Corp. It can be a discomfort to do this, but it can be completed, so don’t stress if you are currently formed as a LLC, you could change it in the future– we would certainly suggest you intend to do it together with an outdoors financing round as it is not an economical procedure. Letting possible capitalists recognize you are a LLC however strategy to convert with the funding could aid with the minor knock we assume you’ll get for being a LLC in the first place.
Second fast note: If you prepare to self-fund business for a couple of years before raising outside resources as well as are into optimal tax planning (and have a great tax obligation as well as business lawyer), consider structuring as an LLC in order to identify very early year losses personally before you increase outdoors loan. Plan to transform when your organisation starts to develop a revenue or when you increase outside capital (whichever precedes). This only works if you are self financing with a significant quantity of money, as well as will certainly require extra work (and lawful costs), so we question this is the appropriate course for about 97% of the people reading this write-up, however we like tax obligation optimization so figured we would certainly discuss it for the 3% of you out there.
. Prospective consumers could really feel that a firm is much more substantial and much more “real” compared to an LLC.
The company will earn a profit right after the incorporation and will certainly disperse it to the investors.
To your 2nd inquiry, you are better off working with an attorney to do it for you if there is greater than one person (significance you will certainly require an Operating Agreement) or there is any kind of intricacy.
I agree that possibly one of the most important part is preparing an excellent operating arrangement, services like legal zoom will not supply you with a custom Operating Agreement and accountants don’t actually like drafting controling files.
Every state requires every LLC to have an operating contract and also it is among one of the most essential records you’ll ever before prepare for your LLC. megazoom 4 asic
An operating arrangement that is tailored to your LLC needs to be prepared as well as submitted by your company legal representative so that it is precise and also total.

If your ancestors are Myasnikov from Priluki (or you have any information about them) – please contact me. It is possible that we are relatives 🙂
Priluki is a historic town located in Chernihiv region of northern Ukraine, center of the Prilutskiy region (not to be confused with Old Priluka – a village in the Vinnitsa region, a former shtetl). Priluki is located on the Udai River, a tributary of the Sula. The city’s estimated population is 61,600 (as of 2005).
Before the Great Socialist Revolution of 1917, Priluki was the center of the Priluki Uezd of Poltava gubernia.
Priluki first appears in the historical record in 1085. The settlement was founded initially as a border post during the time of Yaroslav the Wise.
In the 17th century, the Cossacks took part in the Khmelnytsky uprising. The fertile soil of the Udai basin proved itself attractive not only to marauders, but also to hard-working people fleeing from backbreaking toil. The number of inhabitants of Pryluky and adjacent villages grew considerably in the 17th century. One of the documents kept in the archives of Stockholm, Sweden stated that there were 800 chimneys, i.e. 800 houses, in Pryluky in 1632. Assuming that each house accommodated at least six persons, about 5,000 people lived in the city at that time.
In 1648, Hetman (a high ranking Cossack officer) Bohdan Khmelnytsky introduced a new system of territorial-administrative division in Ukraine, having divided the country into regiments. Under this system the city of Pryluky became the military center of the Pryluky Regiment and Colonel Ivan Shkurat-Melnychenko was appointed its first commander.
In the XVII century, Priluki was home to only a few Jewish families. This was probably a result of the decrees set by hetmans Ivan Skoropadskiy and Danila Apostol, which prohibited Jews to live in Left-bank Ukraine.
Priluki received Magdeburg rights only in 1783. It can be assumed that a strong Jewish community emerged in Priluki around this time.
The current plan of the city was created in 1802 when all old streets were connected to the city’s central thoroughfare. This main thoroughfare would be renamed several times, in the later imperial Russian era (Ulitsya Aleksandrovskaya), in the Soviet Period Ulitsya Lenina, and Vulitsya Kyiv’ska after Ukrainian independence.
Intense construction started after the great fire in 1831, which almost completely destroyed the old buildings.
In 1855, among Priluki Jews there were 124 merchants of the third guild and 690 of lower middle-class citizens.
By the end of the XIX century, two private theaters existed in the city, called Jewish and Intim, which belonged to A.M.Bukler.
By 1869 there were 4 brick factories in Priluki. In the early 20th century, the factory was owned by Mariengof Beniamin Levinovich (the first brick factory on Algazina St., 60), Smilyanskiy David-Itzhok Shlomovich used to own the second brick factory on Frynze St., 42, not far from the Dolgin’s mill, nowadays a residential built-up area, the brothers Shershevsky Neah-Israel and Yankel Izrailevich owned another brick factory on Kievskaya St., 210; in 1910 the owners were Manilo Kopel Leibovich and Shershevskiy Yankel Izrailevich), Kapara Vladimir Andeevich (Kievskaya St., 131).
In 1901, Priluki’s Iosef Flaivech Liapidus was appointed the official rabbi, in 1908 this position was occupied by Leiba Movshev Tsirelson.
In 1901 and 1903 the official rabbi was Joseph P. Flavievich Lyapidus in 1907-09 – Leib Movshev Tsirelson, in 1911 – Zelman Geselovich Tsifrinovich.
Jews owned two tobacco factories, two flour mills, and two small oil refineries. Many Jewish tailors sewed ready-made garments, which were sold in fairs in faraway towns. Apart from hadarim there were schools for boys and girls, and from the beginning of the 20th century, there was a Hebrew-language school.
A Relief society to help Frid’s Jewish secondary school for men was founded. Over the next two years, over 2,000 rubles were collected.
Letter of Rabbi Tsirelson to Rabbi Nemirover (city Yassy, Romania) with notification about 70 rubles which were collected by the Jews of Priluki to support the pogrom victims in Romania, 1907
Difficult economic and political conditions caused a huge wave of Jewish emigration to USA and other Western countries at the end of 19th – beginning of 20th century. The US immigrants from Priluki founded a relief society called “Ershter Priluki”.
As a result of severe ethnic and political restrictions, the Jewish youth was very active in the socialist revolutionary movement. In the summer of 1903, local “Bund” activists organized a small traders meeting in support of a general strike in the southern part of the Russian Empire. A branch of “Poalei Zion” existed in Priluki in 1905.
Perhaps, all Priluki photo studios, three or five at the time, were owned by the local Jews in 1908. Their owners were Y.V. Vinshteyn (Konotopskaya St.), Solomon Leibov. Krasnopolskiy (Gimnazicheskaya St.) and Evzer Ioselev. Rivkin.

The first commercial printing press in Priluki was set up in 1883 by Yankel Morduhovich Linkov on the market square. Another one was founded in 1904 by Aaron Yakovich Mirov in the building on Kievskaya St., 198a (the building survives nowadays). In 1908 they were the only two publishing houses in Priluki.
In 1910, there were six synagogues and a Talmud Torah, three private Jewish schools for girls and one secondary school for boys. In 1910, 1,206 Jewish houses were recorded.
Before the 1917 Revolution, 206 Priluki Jews and their family members were recorded as members of the merchant class and 20 were designated as the noble citizens of Priluki.
The first Priluki telecommunication station was built in 1910 by Baron Ginsberg. The state station was built in 1912 only.
In 1913, a Jewish businessman Abraham Berkov Dolgin built a four-story high mill near the railway station. It became a major trade point for corn in all of the Priluki region. The mill burnt down during WWII and was demolished completely in 1990.
Before 1917, there was a Jewish Hospital in Priluki. For the first time it was mentioned was in 1900. The construction of the hospital was funded by a tobacco factory owner Benia Rabinovich.
Tobacco industry plays an important role in the economy of Priluki. Priluki’s tobacco factories have been around for over 150 years. Before WWII, these factories were employing hundreds of Jewish workers. The first tobacco factory was built in 1876, with two more factories built within the next ten years.
The most famous tobacco factory in Priluki was founded by Benni Rabinovich and Zalman Fratkin in January 22, 1889 on the right bank of Udai river in the village Brodki (became part of Priluki in ~ 1900). In 1903 there were 447 workers. Among them was my great-great grandfather Aizek Myasnikoff, who worked there his whole life.
Before 1917, the factory exported tobacco to Germany, Romania, China, Turkey and other countries. It was the biggest enterprise in Priluki. The factory became a joint stock company in 1916.
In 1920 the factory was nationalized and became the Second State Tobacco factory. Until 1938, it was named after a revolutionary Christian Rakovsky. The Priluki tobacco factory was among the biggest in Ukraine.
During WWII, the manufacturing equipment was evacuated, but the buildings were destroyed by retreating German troops. The factory was rebuilt after the liberation of Priluki.
Now the Priluki Tobacco company belongs to British Tobacco and is still the largest and most profitable manufacturer in Priluki with the best conditions of employment. It produces 30% of all cigarettes in Ukraine.
4. Tobacco factory “Rybolov” was created by Priluki Jewish merchants E. Rozenberg and B. Dvorkin in 1886. In 1904, it employed 29 workers. The factory was located in a private building on Oleksandrovskaya St. (now Kievskaya St.). Now this building houses the knitting facility of the local hosiery factory.
In 1920, the tobacco factory “Rybolov” was nationalized and subsumed by the Second State Tobacco factory (former Rabynovich’s and Fratkin’s).
Members of “Souztabaksirye”. this organization supplied tobacco to the tobacco factories. Yankel-Shmul Meerovich Karasik (1885-1970) is sitting in the first row in the left corner. Priluki, 1930s
The 1901 Business Directory mentions Boris Galperin and the brothers Fratkins as the factory owners but no other information about the location and the owners exists to the knowledge of the website creator.
The first Jewish pogrom occurred in October 1917. The second pogrom was instigated by the soldiers of the Ukrainian Directorate (Semen Petlura government) in December 1918.
The White Russian army led by the General Denikin occupied Priluki from August 25, 1919 till December 1, 1919. This period marked the worst time for the Jews of Priluki during the Russian Civil War.
In December 1919, the town’s Jewish community paid 200,000 rubles in a “contribution” to prevent a serious pogrom.
The Chernigiv Archives house several petitions of Priluki citizens submitted in 1924 who suffered during pogroms. These documents contain names, witnesses, and lists of murdered and injured relatives and neighbors as well as looted property. The following names were mentioned in the petitions: Elimeishe Gulinskiy, Blinkin Veniamin, Mendel Berkovich Bruh (54 years old), Gleih Yankel Mendelevich (22 yeras old), Tantlevskiy Boris Aizikovich, Rachinskiy Motya Israilevich (20 years old), Minya Israilevna Kyznetsova and his three children of four and three years of age and a six months old infant, Zolotnitskaya Gisya Avramovna.
Naturally, these two lists did not include the relatives of those who left Priluki between 1919 and 1924.
In 1910s-1920s in the US, there was United Priluker Relief Landsmanschaft, which helped Pruluki Jews during and after the Civil War.
The Zionists remained active for a couple of years after the October Revolution. In 1921 a pioneer group went to Palestine, where they were among the founders of the kibbutz Kiryat Anavim. Their names are Avraham (Ben-Nariya) Lichtroub, Zeta Goldstein, Yehuda Levyatov, Efraim (Ben-Hayim ) Leibnsohn, Sonya Gershonovitz and Shalom Kaushansky (official kibbutz web-site kiryatanavim.com)
The Chernigiv archives store very few documents about the Zionist activity in the region; however, most of the surviving documents are related to Priluki.
Semen Grogorievich Belman (Head of the Chernigov Jewish community) discovered the following names of the Priluki Zionists in the archives:
Due to the Korenization campaign the Jews from Priluki, Piryatin and Yagotin obtained the right to communicate with the authorities in Yiddish. A Yiddish court was established in Priluki.
A Jewish orphanage was established in the 1920s. These were mostly for the children whose parents perished during pogroms in shtetls near Priluki like Piryatin, Lovitsa and Varva. These children testimonies are stored in the Chernigov State Archive.
In the 1920s all big businesses were nationalized. Among them were the “Jewish” Tobacco Factory owned by Rabinovich and Fratkin, Volodarskiy’s tobacco factory, Shahin’s and Dolgin’s mills.
Before 1920, there were only two energy generators in the town, powering the Intim theater and the local cinema, and both owned by the Jewish entrepreneurs, Abraham Moiseevich Bukler and Zolotarev. Both generators were nationalized in 1920.

In 1924-1925, the Jews from Priluki organized 7seven collective farms in the Kherson region. Nearly 600 people resettled in the area.
Some 65% of Priluki Jews worked as factory laborers and artisans, and about 165 were members of a Jewish kolkhoz named Nayer Shteyger (New way of life) . The local Jews numbered 9,001 (31.4% of the total population) in 1926, decreasing to 6,140 in 1939 (16.65%).
In November, 1927, the main synagogue was closed, which was reportedly demanded by the employees of the Second tobacco factory and was refurbished as a workers’ club. The building of the mikva was nationalized in 1920s and returned to the Jewish community when it was completely derelict.
In October 1941, the chief officer in charge of the medical service for the 331st Artillery Regiment Khaim Kil was executed in the prisoners of war camp in Priluki.
Many of Priluki’s Jews succeeded in leaving before the occupation started. The remaining Jews were ordered to wear a white armband with a yellow star and they were prohibited from going to the market and the cinema. They were recruited for forced labor, such as repairing roads, clearing demolished buildings, etc. On October 15, 1941 a murder operation that had several Jewish victims was carried out, probably by the German Secret Field Police unit no. 730.
Farewell letter of Lisa Shershevskaya (1927- 1942) who was killed during Prilku ghetto liquidation on May 20, 1942
A ghetto was established at the beginning of 1942 in the building of School #4 (build by merchant Shkuratov in 1912) and nearby streets. From January 1942, groups of 30-40 young healthy men were systematically taken from the ghetto and executed at an unknown location. Most of the Jews of Priluki were killed in a mass murder operation in May 1942.
Last letter of Eleonora Parmut (1926-1941) from the Priluki Ghetto. It was found in 1990s during repairs of the building.
Another mass murder was carried out by Germans in Priluki on September 10, 1942. The victims were Jews who had hidden or escaped from the previous killing operation.
Moses Fainboim (1909-1986, Moscow) with his wife Elizabeth Averbuh (1915, Chigirin – 2016, Germany) with son Igor (1938 – 1942, Priluki) and Elizabeth’s brother Efim Motilev (1914, Priluki – 2001, Israel). Igor was killed in Priluki
Jews from Polova, Ladan, and Linovitsa of Priluki region and from Kharitonovka, Podol, Radkovka and Malaya Devitsa and other regions of the Chernigov region were murdered in Priluki. Nearly 3,000 Jews were killed during German occupation. We know the names of only of 430 civilians and 316 soldiers.
Meir Ofman was drafted to the Red Army but his detachment was encircled near Kiev. He slipped away to find his family in Priluki and was murdered alongside the rest of the local Jews.
You can download the lists of the mass killings’ vistims here and here (the lists are 95% identical).
In the post-war period local Jews played an important role in the economic and cultural life of Priluki. For example, Rabinovich David Fridelevich was in charge of the textile factory for 21 year from 1944 until 1965.
After the war, observant Jews gathered at the house of Magit for prayer on Gimnazicheskaya St., 55 and at the Lev Ofman apartment on Kotlyarevskogo St., 199J. The local police would disperse the meetings, especially on High holidays.
A Jewish community council was established again in the late 1980s when Leiderman Moses Gdalievich (1928-2000s) founded “The Jewish Culture Society”. The next chairman was Leonid Klugman who emigrated to Germany.
In the 1990s, most Priluki Jews left for Israel, Germany, and the US. It is estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 people left in that time.
In 2003-2013, Lipin Pavel Gershelevich was the Head of the Jewish Priluki Community. After his death in 2013, Beis Irina Yakovlevna became the Head of the Community.
In June-July 2013, the old Jewish Cemetery was vandalized. Up to 20 tombstones were brought down or destroyed. The local police promised to find the criminals but the investigation is still ongoing…
The Priluki Archive was created in September 1921. During the Nazi occupation it wasn’t evacuated and remained in the town. Surprisingly, not many documents were lost during WWII. In 1995, 1,451 archival records containing thousands of documents were stored here.
In January 2004, the Priluki State Archive was transferred to the Chernigov region archive. All documents were moved to Chernigov. This was a real tragedy as most local historians lost their opportunity to continue their research into the history of Priluki.
Despite the move, the Chernigiv archives proved a friendly place with helpful staff, and as a result of the author’s own research, the most valuable document about the Priluki Jews in Chernigiv Archive is Record 1502/1/13 and 14 – it is a list of Priluki Jewish families dated to sometime between 1889 and 1918. If you find your family name here, you will be able to get some details of 2-3 generations back in one place. The list of family patriarchs you can download here. More details on this unique document are found here Miriam Wainer website.
Most recent surnames I came across when going through the family lists and birth records for several years are: Karasik, Zolotnickiy, Myasnikov, London, Korhin, Pantelyat, Finkilshteyan, Levin, Kanevskiy, Lomonosov, Oleyner, Bentzionov, Zaslavskiy, Krypnickiy, Krjijanovskiy, Fratkin, Berkov.
My particular interest is the Myasnikov family. They appear in Priluki in the middle of the 19th century, arriving from a small hamlet of Nezhirov near Malaya Devitsa village. I can assume that they were forced to resettle in Priluki during one of the anti-Semitic campaigns, which resulted in the transfer of Jews from rural areas to towns and urban centers. The hamlet was not recorded on a 1863 map which means that it probably disappeared, when the Jews moved away. By the end of the 19th century, there were four large families by the name of Myasnikov, over 100 people in total. According to the 1923 census, there were approximately 50 people with this surname in Priluki, probably a result of a huge wave of emigration to the US and different regions of the Soviet Union. Among the Holocaust victims, only five people with the Myasnikov surname were mentioned and two were found in the lost in action lists but we know that these records are not complete. Nowadays, perhaps, fewer than ten descendants of the Myasnikov family survive in Priluki.
The Jewish surname Myasnikov also appears in eastern Belarus so I can assume that they came from the Gomel region in the mid to late 18th century. At that time, Jews started to appear in the records of the Chernigov region after the Khmelnitskiy massacre and the Ukrainian Civil War in the late 17th century.

In 1892, he left for America and became a newspaper seller, later working at a shelkes factory, becoming a “Sabbath visitor” of the Yiddish theater and alongside with Abe Kogut founding the “Young Star Dramatic Club”, where he was the secretary. When Leon Mandeltort performed in the Goldfaden club in “Naye be, naye me”, W. was the prompter, and later he performed with Mandeltort across the province as a prompter and script-writer.
Later Wilensky became a stage manager with Kessler, debuting in the role of “Lawyer” in Kobrin’s “East Side Ghetto”, and from then on taking on the roles of a stage manager and actor with popular troupes of New York. From 1912-15 Wilensky was a stage manager and also performed in episodic roles on the English stage. In 1920 he became a partner at the Lyric Theatre. In 1923 he was stage manager with the English actor Warfield.
Pre-1917, there were four private Jewish secondary schools in Priluki: Two schools owned by Levin, one by Hazanov and one girls’ school owned by Frid.
There was a Jewish library in Priluki until 1920, mentioned for the first time in the commercial records from 1901. It belonged to Beilin Gersh Abramovich.
After 1917, the Jewish schools were re-organized into three seven year schools and one four year school.
Jewish school №5 was converted from a Russian school in 1923 under the name of the October Revolution. Yiddish was used as the main language of education for the first three years. After that, most lessons were taken in Russian. Goldin Lev Abramovich, Zaks (first name unknow) and Novikov Boris Iosipovich are some of the head masters of the Jewish school. Eleven teachers taught Year 1.
Jewish school №5 was turned into a Russian school in 1938. From 1925, the school occupied a large building in the central town square. It was burned by the Germans in 1943.
Jewish school №8 was based on the private school, owned by Novogrudskiy in 1918. 250 Jewish children studied there in five year groups. The school occupied the building of the former Bukler theater on Pereyaslavskaya St. (demolished in 1980s) and only admitted paying students.
In 1919, Hebrew as a language of education was prohibited in the Soviet Union and the school adopted Russian as its primary language.
In 1920, the school was nationalized. In 1921, 19 teachers were employed there. Bashmachnikov Iliya Solomonovich was the director there.
In 1924 and 1925, the school head masters were Slavina Sarra Iosifovna and Grishko Vasyl Pilipovich. Jewish school №8 was closed in July 24, 1925 due to the derelict state of the school building.
Jewish labor school was created in 1920 and was located in the building of Kislih’s secondary school (the building survives on Vokzalnaya St., 35). Among 15 teachers were Nahman Gold and Frederika Iosifovna Lyapidys.
In 1922, the first branch of the children’s Communist League, called “The Young Spartans” was founded in Priluki. One year later, the organization was renamed the Young Pioneers. Isaak Bruk (1908-1985) became the main organizer, with Krasin (the son of the school’s history teacher) was in charge of the first brigade.
Bruk family in 1960s, Kiev. Isaak Bruk (1908-1985) with son Vitaliy (1935-2005) and grandson Meir. Isaak survived the Nazi concentration camp during WWII and lived in Kiev. His grandson Meir (b.1964) is a Rabbi in Brooklyn.
In 1923, the school moved to the building of a former Barsky hotel on Vokzalnaya St. (ruined during the WWII). It was renamed as a Polytechnic College of the First of May. In 1931, the school was affiliated with the local electrical station where students were trained in technical disciplines. The school pupils often helped at the Jewish collective farm “Noviy Pobut”. After the WWII, the school was never re-opened.
In 1930, the collective farm included 200 families and 650 members, who owned 445 acres of land, 58 horses, 177 sheep, 5 cows and a tractor. Local Jewish artisans also joined the collective. They set up various workshops, a mill, a blacksmith’s, a shoemaker’s and others.
In 1930s, “Noviy Pobut” became the largest collective farm in the Priluki region. In 1931, several prospective collective farm members were assigned a plot of land outside of Priluki and founded a small settlement, called “Noviy Pobut” (see map above). There were 20 houses.
In the 1960s, the remaining settlers were moved to Priluki and the city cemetery was established in that place. The offices of the collective farm were located in the building of the former brick factory on Frunze St.
Several documents and witness statements confirm that before and after the 1917 Revolution most Priluki Jews lived in the central part of the city between the present-day Kotlyarevskogo and Ivanovskaya Streets.

The house of the tobacco factory owner Zelman N. Fratkin, located in Kievskaya St., 156. Between 1947 and 2000, it was the local library. The house of another merchant, belonging to the same family, was located on Kievskaya St., 265.
The building of the City House of Culture, the construction of which was initially funded by the merchant Brodsky and the owner of the brick factory Shtonda but was terminated as a result of Brodsky’s going bankrupt. It was completed only in the 1930s.
Fratkin’s house (the owner of the tobacco factory) located in Kievskaya St., 273. After WWII and until 2003, it was a children’s library.
The building on Vokzalnaya St., 57, used to belong to the mill owner Dolgin. Now it is a telecommunications center.
The present-day Priluki Сity Council was build by a Jewish merchant Zolotarev in the second half of the 19th century. Before the Revolution of 1917, it was rented out to the Nobility Assembly. During the Second World War, the building burnt down and was rebuild in 1943-1951.
In this brief overview of the Priluki Jewish community, the name of the soap factory owner Frid Berko Failovich deserves a mention. His house still survives on the corner of the Pereyaslavskaya and Kievskaya Streets.
In 1895, in Pereyaslavskaya St., 13, in the place of the present-day House of Culture, Abraham Moiseevich Bukler constructed his Intim theatre for 300 seats. In different time periods, it was used for theaters, Jewish schools (post-1918) and the baking factory (after WWII). The building was destroyed in the second half of the 20thcentury.
In the Chernigov archives, the documents about the transfer of local synagogue buildings from religious communities into the public ownership which took place in 1922 are stored. The documents contain lists of all synagogue property which was signed by community members. This is why we know for certain that in 1922, there were nine synagogues in Priluki. In 2000s, Pavel Grigorevich Lipin compiled a list of five existing buildings which used to be synagogues in the early 20thcentury. I identified only three of them. The details of the synagogues located in two other buildings remain unknown.
A wooden building constructed in the 1870s. The overall area of the building was 240 square meters. In 1922, it housed 21 Torah volumes. The following names were listed as regular attendees in 1920s: I.Khazan, R. Agranov, Sverdlov, A. Nyhman and others. Now the building is used as a residntial house.
A wooden building which was constructed in 1880. In 1923 it housed 57 Torah volumes. Among the attendees in the 1920s, there were G.Samoilovich, Iosel Rivkin, H. Evelkin, M.Katsnelson, Izko Kapitulskiy, Boruh Berkov Krypnitskiy, Zalman Haimov Gurevich, S. Karasik.
According to the 1899 Business Records, in 1901 the following people were in charge of the Kravetskiy Prayer House:
The synagogue was built in 1861 to replace an older wooden synagogue or a prayer house. The total area of the building was 2,000 square meters. The building was popular among the members of the Jewish working men society. The synagogue was closed down in the 1927 and converted into a working men’s club. There was a small theater there which staged Yiddish plays. In 1945, it was converted into a cinema. In 1954, the building was reconstructed, destroying its distinctive dome in the process. The cinema was closed in 1990. After that, the local council used the building as a storage space for the artifacts from the local museum. The roof and the dome of the synagogue were disassembled and the building survives as a storage facility in its 1954-dated conversion.
In 1922, the Choral Synagogue used to house 57 volumes of the Torah. M.Katz, Boris Soloveichik, Abraham Gurevich, E.I.Sverdlov were listed as members of the synagogue community.
The 1899 Business Directories list the following people as the board of the Choral Synagogue in 1901:
town-dweller Moses Beniaminovich Bukler (lived in private house on Gimnazicheskaya St.); the treasurer – merchant Israel Berkov Zolotnickiy (lived in private house on Sobornaya St.), the chair of the board – merchant Elya Ioselevich Rozenberg (lived in private house on Sobornaya St.)
The building was wooden and overlaid with brick and was completed in the year 1885. In 1922, it housed 12 volumes of the Torah. In 1920s A,.Grinberg, M.Levandovskiy, S.Urovskiy used to attend the prayer house. It was located not far from Big Choral Synagogue in the center of Priluki on Trehsvyatitelskaya St. (now Gogolya St). However, its exact location and current state is unknown.
Town-dweller Aaron Berkovich Rozov as the reader (lived in a private house on Halahanoskaya St.); the treasurer – town-dweller Ehil Shaevich Sverdlov, the chair of the board- merchant Sryl-Ber Leibovich Rivkin
The Fratkinsky prayer house was a brick building which was constructed in 1872. Because of its name, we can assume that it was the local businessman Fratkin, the owner of the tobacco factory, who donated the money for the construction of this synagogue. The Fratkinskiy prayer house currently houses as a music school (from 1966). In 1922, the prayer house housed 35 volumes of the Torah. M.Rott, Simha Ginzburg, Merinson were members of the community.
According to the 1899 Business Directories, in 1901, the following were on the board of the Fratkinsky prayer house:
The reader – merchant Berko Faivishev Frid (lived in a private house on Alexandrovskaya St., now it is Kievskaya St.), the treasurer and the chair David Notovich Kisin (lived in a private house on Pereyaslavskaya St.),
was situated on Pereyaslavskaya St. In 1922, it housed 15 volumes of the Torah. The exact location and history of the building is unknown.
The 1899 Business Directories list the following persons as the members of the Kvashinskiy Prayer House in 1901:
The reader – merchant Moses Urievich Kagan (lived in a private house on Alexandrovskaya St., now it is Kievskaya St.); the treasurer – Osher Abramovich Nemkovskiy (lived in a private house on Alexandrovskaya St., now it is Kievskaya St.), the chair – Yankel Moiseevich Slonimskiy (lived in a private house on Alexandrovskaya St., now it is Kievskaya St.), Iosel Gershovich Dvorkin (lived in a private house on Alexandrovskaya St., now it is Kievskaya St.)
This synagogue was founded in 1906, within boundaries of the Rabinovich & Fratkin Tobacco factory on Konotopskaya St. in a two-room building. One can assume that it was built for the workers of the tobacco factory who were primarily of Jewish decent. H.G.Krypnitskiy, Abraham Lifshits, Aleiner attended the services there.
The exact location and current state of the structure is unknown. Most of the old building burnt down during the Second Warld War.
On May 20, 1942 the inhabitants of the Priluki ghetto were ordered to assemble at the bridge over the Pliskunovka River, ostensibly to be settled in a new area. Most Jewish men had already been murdered before that date.

Only women, children, and the elderly remained. All those who arrived were taken to a ravine near the bridge on the way to the village of Pliskunovka. They were lined up in rows and shot. The number of victims amounted to 1,290, including some Jews from neighboring villages who were shot together with about 1,150 Jews from Priluki itself. The killings were carried out by a detachment of Sonderkommando Plath of the SD under the command of the head of the Kremenchug security police, Karl Julius Plath. The German field gendarmerie, local Ukrainian police, and a Cossack unit participated in the mass killing of the local Jews. The adults who had to take off their clothes, were beaten and then shot. The children were shot or buried alive.
The grave was fenced off and flowers were planted in June 1944 by the Jews who returned from evacuation and the army. In 1948, all separate burials in the ravine were combined in a joint grave.
The first attempt to put up a memorial to honor the murdered local Jews in the late 1940s failed because the local authorities banned the construction.
In 1967, local Holocaust survivors Leonid Briskin and Vladimir Entin placed (without official permission) a cast-iron tombstone in the Pliskunovka ravine, at the site of the mass murder of local Jews. It had an ethnically neutral inscription in Russian that said: “Here lie buried victims of fascism who were shot by Hitler’s soldiers during the occupation of Priluki in the years 1941-1943. May their memories be preserved for eternity.” Later, the policy of the authorities changed and a marble tombstone with an inscription identical to the earlier one was erected by the officials replacing the original.
In addition to the original monument, in 2005, a marble gravestone was placed at the mass murder site of the Jews from Priluki and Priluki region at the bottom of the Pliskunovka Ravine on the eastern outskirts of the town. The inscription in Ukrainian and Hebrew on the stone reads: “In this place on May 20, 1942 1,290 Jews were executed by the fascist invaders during the occupation.”
Nearly 1,500 Jews were murdered on the Priluki racetrack, close to the local prison, together with non-Jewish locals, at different times between 1941 and 1943. Local Jews were systematically arrested by the Germans in small groups, imprisoned in the Priluki prison, and then shot on the racetrack. In the winter of 1942 a group of 100 Jewish men from the ghetto.
The murders were apparently carried out between October 1941 and February 1942 by the German Secret Field Police unit no. 730 and from February 1942 — by the Secret Field Police unit no. 721. Before being shot, the Jews were forced to take off their clothes. Some of them, including many children, were buried alive. Many Jews from the Priluki region were murdered at the racetrack in Priluki: documents report the killing of Jews from Ladan (at least 15 Jews were shot on May 20, 1941), Linovitsa (at least 6 Jews were shot on March 1, 1943), and Polova (at least 2 Jews were shot on March 1, 1943). Some Jews from the Chernigov region were also murdered on the racetrack: documents report the killing of Jews from Radkovka in Malaya Devitsa region (at least 3 Jews, who were arrested in 1943 and sent to the Priluki prison) and Malaya Devitsa (at least 1 Jew, who was arrested on February 25, 1943 and sent to the Priluki prison).
A ghetto was established for the local Jews in the autumn 1941 in the building of school No.4 and the streets nearby. All Jews housed in the ghetto were killed on May 20, 1942 in the Pliskunovka ravine.
School No. 4, the center of the Priluki ghetto, where local Jews lived from September 1941 to May 1942
The history of the Priluki ghetto is described by Vladimir Entin in his book (ed.), Iosif Zeev ben Dov from Priluki (Jerusalem, 2006). There are only a couple paper copies of this book in Ukraine but you can download it here.
According to the census, we can assume that the Jewish cemetery appeared in Priluki in the early 19th century. It wasn’t marked on city plan by 1802 and appeared only when the 1859 city plan was published. Also, it was mentioned on the plans of 1863 and 1888. It was located on the western outskirts of the city, near the road to Rudivka village (see map above), between the roads to Nezhin and the Udai river. The first Priluki Jewish cemetery was closed in the late 19th century. It was not possible to identify any records of when it happened. Sheptovitskiy Lev Mihailovich (1921-2000) said that he remembered the old cemetery on the banks of the Udai river. It can be assumed that it was still in existence before the Second World War.
The cemetery is located on the former outskirts of the town of Kvashyntsi in Partyzans’ka Steet, near the bus stop marked «Hospital». The estimated number of graves is 2,600. The cemetery is partly fenced in. Trees have been planted around the perimeter but it is open to all. Jews from the towns of Linivitsa, Ladan (10 km away) , Gusynya and Malaya Divits (10 km away) also used this cemetery. The cemetery was established in 1905 when local Jews raised some money and purchased land.
Schmull Mackler (1886-1990), a former resident of Priluki, who left that shtetl in 1907 mentioned this in his memoirs:
At that time, the town was growing quickly. The Jewish population grew so fast that, at one point, it was necessary to buy more land for the cemetery. Everyone in the town donated something toward the building of the cemetery.
The latest graves are dated between 1970-1980. The cemetery consists of two parts: the older section and the new section. The graves of the new section date from the mid to late 20th century. The local Jewish community continues to maintain this new section.
The older section is completely overgrown and is in a state of disrepair, with tombstones only visible in winter and spring. There are a number of photos of the older tombstones. It is impossible to fit them here, but if required, they could be emailed by request. According to the testimony by Vladimir Entin, the Jews from the Priluki ghetto were buried here. However, the location of the graves is unknown.
Many members of Priluki’s most prominent Jewish families were buried here: Krupytsky, Rabinovich, Krasnopolskyi, Zorahovychiv, Zolotarev and Bukler, Fratkinyh and Dolgin.
After 1974, local Jews were buried in other cemeteries and at the Jewish part of the Noviy Pobut cemetery. In 2010, the Jews received permission to use this cemetery again but no new burials appeared here.
Vitaly is to be congratulated upon his generation of the events and history of Priluki. The information is most valuable and I will ask his permission to attach this information to my website. Of course, attribution to Vitaly will be attached to him for this excellent work.
Thanks so much for this great page. I have been looking for information about my Priluki ancestors (the Belikoff family) and this brings so much to life. I hope to someday be able to visit and see what information I can collect.
My father was Morris Belikoff who emigrated to the United States in the early 1900s. i may be related to Michael Krieger through one of my father’s sisters, perhaps Ida. Thank you again for your excellent work.
Paul, Please contact me if you see this. Ida was my grandmother and your father was my namesake. I hope to hear from you soon. mk@mkrieger.com
Hello “cousin” Paul! Yes, I am Ida’s grandson. I have sent you an email at your AOL address, hope to hear back from you. Thanks Vitaly for bringing family together.
I have been looking for information on my father Anatoly and his sister Elena Levinskaya from Priluki. Maybe someone can help me find her.
My grandfather, Herbert Marsh (Hyman Masnikoff) was from Priluki. thank you for sharing this informative and emotionally powerful information.
Thank you for this page. I lived in Priluki from 2004-2006. I can’t find the village of “Pliskunovka” on google maps. do you know the location/coordinates Pliskunovka Yar?
Hi Vitaliy, I am a Myasnikov (Masnikoff) descendant. My great grandfather immigrated in 1908. I have several Masnikoff family trees, but no way to connect them, do you think you could help?
I will send you detail infprmation by e-mail, it will be too much for one comment. Glad to find anothe descendant!
We are just at the beginning of our heritage project. Did you encounter any Manilov family members? I know of Luba Manilov who was part of the Zionist group that were banished to Turkemenistan in the 1920’s (they were later released and made it to Israel, Kiryat Haim). I also know of first cousin Yakov and Tzivia Manilov (wife) who immigrated to Israel and settled in Kfar Bilu, Israel.
By the way, do you have any information about the Belikoff family there? My my grandmother Ida was born there around 1894, her dad was Harry born 1870; his father was Pinchas, not sure what year he was born.

There's nothing funny about that. Intimate knowledge of the band's wardrobe and hairdressing habits are crucial for the correct dating of unspecified pictures and footage. Just wait till we add a page to the website detailing which band member had a haircut on which dates between June '79 and May '80.
Sorry, I didn't mean that noticing the clothes was funny I meant that Peter wearing the same clothes for both was funny.
FageOner's 2014 remaster of the rehearsals. Included in the video is the missing "No Love Lost" from the March 1979 rehearsals. The song should be available on Fage's blog soon enough.
I certainly hope that does not happen, fage. The only audio that has any immediate copyright danger is "Ceremony," because of its official release. All that I have released in that video has already been made public, either recently or in the past
Re official release - "In A Lonely Place" (Take 4) is on the Record Store Day 2011 12", and the "Pictures In My Mind" tracks are available for sale via the Hacienda Records website.
I'm not keen on trying to integrate a Wiki page into the site as we'd end up with conflicting information. Quite often someone will email me telling me about a gig JD played which isn't on JD central and I have to dig back through 15 years of emails to find out why we removed it from the site. If we had a Wiki it would lead to conflicting information and uncontrolled changes. Or to put it more honestly - more work for me.
I would suggest anyone who has anything to add on the rehearsals issue chips in here and then Fage edits his opening post accordingly. Then, when everyone is happy it's finished I'll transpose the info to a new page on the site.
Newly added to the Factory roster, Hewick had a recording session in June 1980 with producer Martin Hannett in Graveyard Studios, where he recorded two tracks ("Haystack", released on From Brussels with Love compilation in 1981, and "A Piece of Fate") with the three surviving members of Joy Division, a month after the death of Ian Curtis and just prior to their adopting the name New Order.[1]
I wondered if the Joy Division survivors might be there tidying up some of their tracks? Ceremony and In a Lonely a Place as featured on the Heart and Soul box set is credited to May 1980 so maybe they were doing something else in June?
I'd more likely put that as the first New Order rehearsal so to speak - wasn't it Tony Wilson's idea to put Kevin forward as a possible replacement for Ian?
Respect and gratitude to fage & Marko for their top new page. Great to see all this info collated at last - and I'm sure this ain't the end of it.
Very interesting, twenty4hours. I've seen this photo 200 times and I've never seen what you have seen, although it is so obvious.
Nearly all vocal-microphones, even the cheaper ones and even back then weren't "hard-wired", the cable wasn't an integral part of the microphone. They mostly had XLR-connectors like the most widespread dynamic vocal-microphone of all times, the Shure SM-58. Only microphones for the amateur reel-to-reel recorder target market had integral-cables. They might be decent quality-wise, they simply hadn't to face the kind of abuse, vocal-mics have.
They used two microphone-stands to record the "room-sound". Look at the micro-stand to the left of Ian. Same microphone.
This is a method bands used and use to record songs if they don't own a multitrack-recording device or if they just want to record their performance without much hassle (overdubbing, recording different instruments one at a time, using 5 or more microphones just to record the drums etc.)
1978/9 affordable 4-track or 8-track tape-recorders which allowed overdubbing and mixing after recording were not widespread.
So you just used a stereo-tapedeck or reel-to-reel and two microphones and recorded the room sound: the unamplified drum-set, the bass-amp, the guitar-amp and the voice, which was a vocal-mic connected to a small PA-System (a kind of amplified small mixer with two speakers, most had an inbuild reverb-effect).
I'm pretty sure Ian had a kind of PA / a special amp and speakers just for his voice and an ordinary vocal-microphone like a Shure SM 58 or something similar.
If he would have, he couldn't hear his own voice while recording / performing against the amplified guitar, the bass and Stephen's drums. These mics are just connected to the tape-recorder, not to any kind of amp.
And if these microphones would have been connected to an amp, the feedback would have been unbearable. Vocal-mics are unidirectional to prevent feedbacks, these microphones aren't because they are made to record not just what's directly in front of them and supress everything else like vocal-mics.
^^^wow! Thanks for explaining all that!! Very informative esp. for someone like me who is in "no teknik" on the how of how they did it. Thanks! :-)
thanx for posting - the early versions of a means to an end (one of my all time faves) are reallly influenced by iggy pop - you can hear IC trying to imitate one of his heroes... obv the version in Closer is completely different...you can hear martin hannets' magic touch
Not so sure, Dirk - depending on the sensitivity of the mics, input gain to the recorder and the volume of the PA, they could have been used for rudimentary PA work. My take on what is happening - bearing in mind Bernard's affinity with electronics - is that they're recording the vocals to one side of a stereo tape (let's say left), through the mic Ian's using, while the other side (right) is capturing the sound of the band in the room. Ian's mic could be output to the PA via the left output from the reel-to-reel (either from tape, assuming it has a combined record-and-replay head or just straight through the machine via a record monitor output) which would enable him to monitor his vocal. Pretty nifty way of capturing a rough rehearsal with clear vocals. on playback, they could just listen to the recording in mono by playing it through a mixer. Place the speaker close enough to Ian for him to hear, yet far enough away from the other mic so the band drown it out, and you could end up with a pretty passable recording
Alternatively - and this is just complete conjecture - they could be doing this PLUS Bernard may have been able to set one side of the machine up (bit of tape over one side of the erase head if there are separate record & replay heads) and botch a bit of tape echo for rehearsals. Certainly wouldn't have been beyond his know-how!
I hardly doubt that they did it this way. Just read Sumners book. Ian had a PA just since they first rehearsed. They pretty soon bought a new one 'cause his somehow sounded distorted. They used the first for guitars then.
I've used all these techniques you describe when I was 13 and had my first 3-head reel-to-reel in 1976. But never in a rehearsal situation and I don't know any band that did.
All the published rehearsal tapes from Joy Division, most famous the versions of Ceremony and IALP are stereo microphoned recordings of amplifiers, drums and a PA for the vocals, maybe some of the drums and the synths.
No singer I can think of, who has used even budget dynamic vocal mics like the Shure SM58 and a PA with a reverb would like to hear himself through that tape-recorder mics without reverb and tone shaping possibilities.
Bernard might have put together his own synth, but to use tape delay or at higher speeds tape reverb the way you describe it: I hardly doubt it. It simply doesn't make sense regarding the equipment they had at hands in their rehearsal room.
And as I've mentioned before: using these mics or one of them would cause an unbearable amount of feedback due to the omnidirectional characteristics of these mics if they would have been amplified through speakers in the same room.

CellTrust Prepares NFC Provisioning APIs Using SecureSMS for Carriers and Banks as NFC Technology Rollout Begins in 2011
CellTrust Corporation, the world's largest provider of SecureSMS for mobile phones (www.celltrust.com), announced today that it is preparing patent-pending, NFC-provisioning APIs using SecureSMS, in anticipation of NFC technology rollout beginning in early 2011.
NFC (Near Field Communication) is a short-range wireless communication standard that bundles a contactless chip with a contactless reader inside the mobile device. With NFC technology, consumers can simply wave or tap their phone within a few inches of a reader to transfer information to their mobile phone or to complete a mobile payment or transaction.
Designed to make life much easier for the end-user, provisioning NFC will require the carrier to send sensitive and confidential information to the mobile subscriber's handset. While a few methods exist to provision NFC, CellTrust believes SMS is the optimal choice because it uses the mobile communications control channel, which is separate from voice and data and operates regardless of the voice or data being used. The control channel has high resiliency, low bandwidth requirements and was designed for carriers to send specific commands and instructions to the handset via SMS. It is important to note that standard SMS is not secure and can be spoofed. Provisioning NFC with CellTrust's SecureSMS APIs addresses spoofing with a fully authenticated, government-grade, highly encrypted, tamper-proof process, which also enables message sizes up to 5,000 characters.
"At Juniper Research we forecast that 1 in 6 subscribers globally will have NFC phones by 2014," said Howard Wilcox, Senior Analyst, Juniper Research. NFC is all about ease and convenience for users although the first question from users usually relates to security. This announcement by CellTrust is an important development to quell peoples' security concerns and enable the rollout of NFC enabled mobile wallets."
NFC has the potential to be a significant, pervasive technology, but the lack of NFC chips in existing handsets and security concerns have held the industry back from wide-scale integration of mobile payments on NFC-equipped devices. CellTrust's NFC solution could be a key driver in finally bringing mobile payments to NFC devices and unlocking the market potential for this technology.
CellTrust's SecureSMS NFC APIs use Short Message Service Center (SMSC) and allow carriers to use their existing investment in SMS infrastructure while provisioning NFC, therefore a new NFC platform is not required. Carriers can easily integrate with the SecureSMS APIs and send secure commands and instructions to the handset to provision NFC with all types of transactions, including adding and deleting credit cards. CellTrust's technology addresses the security gaps that exist with basic SMS, paving the way for NFC-enabled mobile devices to be securely used as an "electronic wallet."
SecureSMS also gives mobile network operators an added level of security for OTA (Over-The-Air) configuration and provisioning of mobile devices compared to today's standard SMS infrastructure, which is not tamper proof and can be spoofed.
"CellTrust's SecureSMS NFC solution will make it easy for carriers and banks to implement and integrate NFC," said Sean Moshir, Chairman and CEO of CellTrust. "We believe the cost savings for mobile operators will be substantial, since they will be utilizing their existing SMSC infrastructure."
CellTrust's SecureSMS Appliance is the first global enterprise appliance to offer secure SMS communication for handset to handset and enterprise applications to handsets with highly encrypted end-to-end security in compliance with HIPAA, FISMA, and Sarbanes-Oxley, ensuring that information is kept private and only delivered to the intended recipient. CellTrust's award winning SecureSMST Appliance and Gateway reaches 200+ countries and over 800 carriers.
CellTrust SecureSMST Appliance was named winner of many industry awards by CTIA, Mobile Marketing Association, RCR Magazine, MobileTrax, and more.
CellTrust is a leading provider of secure mobile messaging and applications. CellTrust's patent pending SecureSMS Gateway™ featuring the SecureSMS™ Appliance and a suite of mobile applications provide advanced secure mobile messaging and information management across 200+ countries and over 700 carriers. CellTrust ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information on mobile devices to the financial services, healthcare, government, education, energy, information technology, marketing, and travel, among other global industries.

If you’ve picked up a newspaper in the past decade, you might be aware of a few basic strategies for shopping smarter in the grocery store. Most of us, for instance, likely know that:
♦ It’s wise to stick to the perimeter of the store — produce, dairy, meat — where the fresh products are sold. (Interior aisles are filled, floor-to-ceiling, with processed foods.)
♦ Everything is positioned where it is for a reason — i.e., the most alluring items didn’t end up directly in your line of vision (and, more diabolically, your kids’ line of vision) by accident. To find the healthy stuff, you need to look up high and down low. (To see what we mean, check out the photo above.)
♦ It pays to read the label. I know that a quick scan of the nutrition facts panel will give me a sense of when something is high in fat or calories. And thanks to recent campaigns waged largely by enraged parents, I know to avoid trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, horse meat, pink slime, etc. I also know that it’s not a good sign when an ingredient list is so long, you need a magnifying glass to read it. (Unless it’s a birthday party or a barbecue; in our house, it’s never a birthday or a barbecue without the Reddi Whip or some S’Mores made from Hershey bars.)
But what I didn’t know until I had the opportunity to work with Michael Moss on his book, Salt Sugar Fat, was the degree to which processed food companies have formulated their products to not only get us to eat them, but to eat more and more of them. I didn’t know about the “bliss point,” or “mouthfeel,” or the high-stakes race for “stomach share.” I didn’t know that sodium was not the same thing as salt. I didn’t know that the average American now eats 33 pounds of cheese a year, that the most die-hard Coke drinkers — known within Coca-Cola as “heavy users” — drink up to 1,000 cans a year, or that the processed food industry accounts for $1 trillion dollars a year. Michael is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, and it shows: If you’re interested in the inside story of how the food giants have hooked a nation, if you believe that knowledge is power, if you want to know the marketing strategies that are behind those “convenient” items so many of us are feeding our children, this book might be a life-changer — or at the very least, a family dinner-changer. (You may have seen Moss’s book excerpted in The New York Times Magazine last Sunday.) We asked Michael to annotate the labels of a few of the country’s most popular, kid-friendly supermarket items to illustrate just how bad it is, and what we’re up against. He was kind enough to oblige. — Andy
Hot Pockets is owned by Nestle, the Swiss-based food giant. In 2002, it paid $2.6 billion for this microwavable snack, and now counts it among its “billionaire brands” — with annual sales in excesses of $1,000,000,000.
At a mere 4.5 ounces per sandwich, who wouldn’t be tempted to eat them both? But doing so could get you up to 12 grams of saturated fat (3/4 of a day’s max for most adults), 1,180 milligrams sodium (more than 2/3 of a day’s max), 5 teaspoons of sugar, and 700 calories.
No trans fats? Well, yes, thanks largely to the fierce pressure consumers put on the manufacturers when the deleterious health effects of these fats became more widely known. But beware of any brag like this on the front of processed food labels. The fine print on the back usually reveals a host of items just as problematic for one’s health.
Nutrition advocates have a simple rule of thumb when it comes to ingredients: avoid anything you can’t pronounce. Laden with chemical preservatives, emulsions and conditioners, this would not be a label for them. (Seriously, try counting the number of ingredients in there — if you can even read the microscopic type.)
This label is actually a fascinating study on food processing. Consider the chicken alone, represented here as both “ground and formed,” whatever that means. And note the numerous mentions of salt, sugar, and cheese, including imitation.
The FDA bears responsibility for failing to update its serving sizes, which grossly underestimates the power of salt/sugar/fat-heavy processed foods to compel overeating. But the food giants reap the benefit. A “serving” of these gushers weighs less than an ounce, which helps keep the numbers in the nutrition facts panel from looking too scary – 3 teaspoons of sugar per tiny pouch, versus 17 teaspoons per box. The problem is, lots of kids can’t stop at one pouch.
First launched by General Mills, these “fruit” snacks have exploded in popularity and now have their own stretch of the grocery store, a million miles from the real fruit aisle. The reason for the growth: a huge, fruit-centered marketing ploy is driving sales. These sugar-bombs convey the illusion of health.
Real Fruit? Not really. In truth, real processed fruit. Companies add these fruit derivatives to foods and drinks, sometimes in miniscule amounts, which allows them to splash the word fruit on the front of the label.
Is table sugar worse than corn syrup? Nutritionists say they are indistinguishable, bearing the same number of empty calories.
Pears and grapes are the most commonly used fruits in processed foods because they are cheapest to buy. The processing typically “strips” them of the fiber and the filling water that makes fresh fruit so wholesome. The result is just another form of sugar (often known as fruit sugar or stripped fruit).
In this small of an amount, partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil likely has negligible effects on your health. But nutritionists say there are far better choices to look for, like canola.
Each year, the dairy industry spends tens of millions of dollars trying to get Americans to eat more cheese through a marketing scheme overseen by none other than the USDA, and it’s a boon for the food giants. Average consumption has tripled to 33 pounds a person a year, thanks to new products like this all over the grocery store that use cheese as an alluring, fattening ingredient. Cheese used to be something we ate on occasion, when friends were over, before dinner. Now it’s in everything.
The more cheese, the better: it’s an industry mantra. And companies are vying to outdo one another with the types of cheese they can pack into one can or box.
With more than half of the calories coming from fat, it’s no surprise that oil is the largest ingredient after potatoes. Companies use these four oils — corn, cottonseed, soybean, and sunflower — and others interchangeably, depending on market supply and cost. Oil and fat are what give processed foods their sought-after “mouthfeel,” as industry types call it, which is a crucial part of a product’s allure.
These Pringles have moderate loads for salty snacks… if you stick to a single, one-ounce serving. But let your child eat the whole can over two days, and they’ll get more than a full day’s max of saturated fat, two-thirds a day’s sodium, and a teaspoon of sugar thrown in for good measure. (Not to mention 2,000 calories.)
People trying to limit their sodium have a lot to worry about when it comes to processed foods. These Pringles have four sodium compounds, including MSG, along with salt (added by itself and in each of the four cheeses).
Tune in to Fresh Air today, Tuesday, February 26, to hear Michael Moss talk more about Salt, Sugar, Fat.
What a great post! It is truly frightening when you realize all of the crap companies put into the “food” they produce. I try to avoid buying anything with more than five ingredients.
And not even the food producers know what their raw ingredients are composed of, as the current horse meat in processed foods scandal rampages through Europe. Our relationship with food is so out of kilter not even the Ikea meatball is safe, it appears.
After I read his article in the NY Times, I took a closer look at our supposedly whole wheat sandwich bread and Googled the ingredients. Needless to say, I threw it in the garbage after looking up an ingredient that is also used in synthetic wax! I borrowed my mom’s bread maker and made our sandwich bread for the week with only five ingredients. If Justin Timberlake can bring sexy back, then I’m bringing bread back. Thank you Michael, I can’t wait to read your book!
I guess I’ve known about labels and ingredients to avoid, but what really shocked me about his story in the New York Times was how calculated these companies are and how much they know about our eating habits and patterns. To quote that insider “I feel sorry for the public.” That’s how I feel too. Thanks for the post.
There is nothing left to eat! Even “fresh” food is demonized by it’s sourcing, seeds, fertilizer, antibiotics, inhumane animal treatment, packaging, price, label mischaracterization, country of origin, etc.
Whoa, that is scary. I read an excerpt of the excerpt in the NYT, and I got really depressed. Thank you for posting this.
Yep, there’s plenty to avoid out there! Interesting about the various sodium compounds. The problem with that salty stuff is that once you start, it’s so hard to stop. Better just to skip it altogether.
Great post. All of these “foods” are clearly junk, but I find the line gets a little blurry for me with other items. I have convinced myself that anything from Trader Joes is BETTER. Their ingredient lists are usually about half as long as a similar item at the grocery store, their price is cheaper, and they taste great (my kids prefer TJ’s wheat crackers over wheat thins). I know the TJ’s pirate booty is full of empty calories and zero nutrition, but somehow I feel better about buying it. (Delusional, right?)
It makes me pretty sick. I try to eat healthy foods and do this with my child too. I try to pack as many of her lunches as possible, she wants to be like the other kids and have school lunch some days – but at least I know she likes to eat a fruit or veggie at her lunch and she gets a fruit or veggie in the morning snack at school via a cool program. http://lve.rdale.org/modules/cms/pages.phtml?sessionid=3c2f66cb003f523b833bdddf260dfac5&pageid=275209&sessionid=3c2f66cb003f523b833bdddf260dfac5
Great post. We eat very little processed food (or try to buy packaged items that contain few ingredients like corn chips or Kashi brand items) but this is a good reminder. We always have a secret stash of “fruit” snacks tucked up high in our pantry that we save for special occasions…so gross to think about what goes into them (and what kind of example are we setting for my kids that something so processed is the “treat” instead of some homemade treat). Anyway, thanks again. Can’t wait to read his book.
I really enjoyed seeing this post on here, I’ve been trying to avoid processed foods since my daughter was born, and it’s become hard to do these days!
Thanks so much! Let’s remember to check ingredients on Hot Pockets as well as that frozen pizza from Trader Joe’s, on fruit snacks and fruit strips, because when it comes down to it, it’s still junk food, even if it came from Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods.
This is such a great post! It’s really important to keep all these things in my mind when grocery shopping. It pays not only to be a mindful eater, but also a mindful shopper! Here’s an in-depth review of the food label: http://beanafoodie.com/decoding-the-nutrition-fact-panel/
Great post. After reading the Times article, I am now trying to find a decent substitute for the shockingly sugary TJ yogurt I’ve been packing in my daughter’s lunch every day (all her classmates eat the same one). I’m not going to go crazy, but perhaps make small changes over time. Thanks for this!
another great book on this subject is “The End of Overeating”. Also addresses topics like “mouthfeel” and the fact that processed foods are basically engineered to have optimal amounts of sugar, salt, and fat to make us crave more and more. Our biology seems not to have caught up to our environment – we’re wired to crave high calorie foods so that we can stock up for when times are more lean and food is not abundant. But these days, food is always abundant.
I agree with some of the commenters that I’d love to see some label analysis of the “healthy” snacks at Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s.
I was fascinated by the NY Times excerpt, but was sad to learn that Stacey’s Pita Chip are owned by Frito Lay. I won’t be able to eat them now without thinking about “mouthfeel.” Also, Kashi is owned by Kellogg’s, fwiw, so I think their labels bear scrutinizing too.
I agree with Michelle, this was certainly eye-opening, but I would love more information on things that seem healthier. There are times when you do need something processed (or at least partially processed) and when things seem healthier like Kashi or Trader Joe’s I have trouble deciphering what is really going on. Would love suggestions from you guys!
Now that I think about it something like v-8 is a great example, is that actually healthy in anyway or is it bad? Obviously it’s not better than just eating vegetables, but is it better than juice?
Just saw Michael Moss on Dr. Oz and he was great! His story in the New York Times was the perfect conversation-starter, and I can’t wait to read his book. Our country has been in denial for too long, and I think it’s wonderful that he’s making it so hard for us to ignore these issues in our food consumption.
Great post, Andy. It is getting so difficult to find “real food” in the store these days. The most upsetting thing to me is how products like yogurt and bread, which are assumed to be “healthy”, have been hijacked by the food industry and their marketing (think Go-Gurt and bread with high fructose corn syrup in it!). Most busy families just don’t have time to keep up with all of the investigating it takes to ensure that we’re eating right.
A few months ago my six year old casually shared an observation she made about food. “Mom”, she said, “You know a food is healthy if you eat it and then your done. It’s unhealthy if you just want to keep eating more and more and more…” And there you have it.
My kids and I have an agreement: if there’s anything on the label that looks like it would be found behind the locked, glass cabinet in your chemistry classroom and you’re required to wear goggles in order to handle it, your internal organs will thank you kindly to leave it on the outside of your body.
There are few upsides to being the parent of a food allergy kid, but being able to keep a whole category of food out of our shopping cart and home is certainly one. (She’s allergic to milk – so no cheesy pringles or mac and cheese or hot pockets here!) And forcing us to read labels isn’t always a bad thing either. It can be hard to distinguish between “safe” and “healthy.”
I pretty much stopped eating processed foods about 7 years ago. I do a lot of my shopping at Trader Joe’s but I don’t buy any of their prepared foods. Just groceries. Food preparation does take a little more time, but just a little.
Great info. Thanks. I’ve found that one way to get my kids not to eat this stuff is to let them eat it. We’ve tried some of the processed meals and invariably they always say “that wasn’t very good” or “that looked better in the package than it tasted and usually will go for my cooking. My kids prefer my mac & cheese to the boxed kind. Sometimes frustrating is their friends who aren’t very willing to try the homemade meals but just LOVE chicken nuggets.
It’s pretty shocking what these big companies can get away with in their labeling, saying there is “real fruit” or “sugar-free” etc, doesn’t mean its good for you! It takes one company to hire one scientist to say this product is what they say it is, and they can pay that scientist however much is needed to get the outcome they want.
Great post! But so shocking to actually read what is being put in some foods. I’m picking this book up to share with my kids!
What’s frustrating to me is how biologically disposed my kids seem to be towards the processed stuff even though they barely ever have it. We live in Cambodia and I definitely limit the processed stuff and make a lot of stuff fresh. So I like to think I am cultivating little fresh food pallets. But the second they get their little tongues on those packages of instant oatmeal with like 2 tsp worth of sugar in them, they instantly prefer that to the homemade stuff made with brown sugar. Feels so hard to win!
Great post on reading labels. My daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 7. For the past four years we’ve been diligent label readers, including her. She knows to look for serving size in order to figure out how many carbs are in each and every food item that she eats. Just this morning she was teasing me for losing count on the serving size of 55 Goldfish.
Loved the (terrifying) excerpt in the NYT Magazine. Can’t wait for the actual book – although, in a way it’s just confirming stuff we’ve all suspected forever. But it was pretty discouraging to hear 1. how long the companies have known this stuff is bad and 2. how bad they actually know it to be. When it comes to ingredients, less is always always more. … (Also, how cool that you worked on this book!!! Congratulations).
I agree with Michelle. These foods are obviously not healthy. I would love to see a post about foods we buy that seem like they should be but aren’t.
I am going to start eating bugs, I wonder what the dung beetle tastes like, maybe a bit of habaneras to help it go down.
At the beginning you said YOU got to work with Michael Moss on this book . What work did you do…would you please share. Would be interesting to see how a great blogger got picked & what your contribution was. Thanks…always finding myself going back to your blog now & then!

Bedsores, also called pressure sores or decubitus ulcers, are areas of damage to the skin and underlying tissue ultimately resulting in lesion and ulceration. They most commonly occur over bony areas or prominences in the body such as under the ischial tuberosities (buttocks) or on the shoulders, hips or heels. Pressure sores can be difficult to treat, extremely painful and even life threatening in extreme cases.
* Pressure: skin and tissue directly compressed between the bone and a solid surface such as a chair.
* Shear: occurring when skin and tissue are pulled in opposing directions, for example when a person slips down or is dragged along a bed.
People with decreased mobility often have difficulty moving to relieve pressure. They may be unable to reposition themselves in a chair, increasing pressure over prolonged periods of time, or may slump, causing a shearing effect.
People with sensory impairment may not feel the discomfort of pressure building and therefore not reposition themselves accordingly.
People with high body fat have increased padding, but this tissue is poorly vascularised making the person more vulnerable to shear forces.
Bladder and/or bowel incontinence increases dampness in high risk areas, making the skin more likely to lesion.
Body fluids also contain substances that cause skin to deteriorate more quickly and can increase the risk of infection in open sores.
Good pressure care should be viewed as a holistic issue and practised across all activities of daily living. Correct pressure care equipment is an important component of any planned prevention programme, but should not be recommended in isolation
A prevention programme for people at risk of pressure ulcers may include some or all of the following:
It is important that any equipment provided, such as seating or beds, give good support to all areas of the body - spreading load evenly. Relieving pressure from areas at risk Pressure should be relieved from the body at regular internals - especially over bony prominences or areas of concern.
It is important to allow time for blood to flow normally to pressure areas so that skin cell oxygen levels can be restored. If a person cannot change positions independently, they will need to be assisted by a carer. People at risk of sores should be regularly repositioned throughout the day.
To reduce the effect of friction and shear on the skin, appropriate manual handling techniques and equipment need to be used. Slide sheets and hoists can be useful to reduce shear when transferring or repositioning although a thorough risk assessment should be completed.
Pressure relief equipment may include mattresses, cushions, bed cradles and joint protectors. Some products may have a pressure relief rating to assist health professionals choose the correct products for their client. These ratings have been provided by the product's suppliers, and are intended as a guide only. A full assessment by an appropriate health professional in conjunction with product suppliers as required is strongly advised.

Every parent of a child with autism (or any other life-altering condition) has a diagnosis story. You would think with 1 in 36 children being diagnosed with autism in this country, that diagnosis delivery would be done with support, factual, current information, empathy and understanding.
Sadly, it’s not. There was a recent thread on a facebook group where a mom had asked others what they were told at the time of their child’s diagnosis. Overwhelming, the response was that they were most often told there was nothing they could do, that their child would live in an institutional setting and that things like diet weren’t worth trying. My own story pretty much echoes all of that but my story happened 10 years ago. I was floored that in the last 10 years, nothing had changed. Except the fact that there is an epidemic of children experiencing neurodevelopmental disabilities in this country in 2018. 1 in 6 children has a learning disability. Boys still experience autism at about 4 times the rate of girls. At this trajectory, there will be no men left in this country to work, to serve in the armed forces, to become fathers themselves.
I think the words of the mothers speak for themselves. Included here are the Diagnosis Stories of your neighbors, your daughters, your sisters, your friends. As parents, we manage to find our way through the grace of God, through hard work, through the help of our own community. It’s the most traumatic moment of my life to hear the words ‘He has autism’ and then to have a professional tell me that there was no hope for his future (and we’re talking about a 4 year old here).
These stories are shared with permission. I am grateful to be part of a community that isn’t broken, but rather broken open and works towards HEALING.
I was told there was nothing I could do and my son (with chronic diarrhea and yeast infections- not medical at all) would have to live in a “home” one day. Year 2002. ~ A.A.
We were told there was nothing we could do. He was 2 years old. We were told he would not be able to play soccer because crossing the midline would never happen and also his coordination was off. His brain couldn’t tell his legs what to do properly apparently. Fast forward one year after I started GFCF and the neuro developmental pediatrician who told us all that said there was no evidence that GFCF worked. Fast forward another year after that and she said we should check out the GFCF diet because it seemed to be working for some of her patients. By age 7, my son was playing travel baseball. Soccer was never his thing. LOL. He still has issues, but this was my first eye opening experience into how the medical community knows NOTHING. It was the start of our holistic journey. ~ C.G.
Mine told me “if I worked really hard that I could undo the damage.” I know I was fortunate to have a doctor encourage us to start healing. ~ M.V.
Ours told us that 20 hours of ABA was the only evidence based treatment (insert major eye roll here). If only that vile woman could see my daughter now after never receiving ABA but plenty of other “non evidence based” treatments:) ~ L.C.
Little Man was diagnosed at an actual “Autism Center” that is supposed to be nationally renown. I was told he would more than likely never speak again, never really connect and that accepting that was the best thing I could do for him and our family. That it was genetic and there was no real treatment except ABA and then I was given a stern lecture about all that nonsense out there when she noticed I had written down he was on a probiotic. There are other fun details like when I went up against the Director of the Center one on one over about $10,000 of therapy (William was in their esteemed early intervention program that was about $500 a day) and he had Paul Offit’s book on his desk. He was trying to bait me. I got all the money back without a lawyer. ~ C.W.
The neurologist our pediatrician sent us to when d regressed at 3 said “we are seeing this late regression and don’t know why.” He then slipped me a piece of paper in which “autistic regression syndrome” was written down. He didn’t even have the balls to say the words. We left with zero resources. The pediatrician, upon hearing this told us “the only thing you can do is ABA therapy and you can’t afford it so you might as well Give up”. And “the only thing gluten free diets might help is celiac”. I fired him on the spot. ~J.W.
The Neurologist told me that early intervention would help and gave me a prescription for B6 because he read recently in an article it could help autism. He didn’t seem really hopeful, though. This was in 2000. ~ M.D.
The doctor literally told us to go to the Autism speaks website and read the first 100 days, and not to research too much and wear myself out!! Oh and told us to read Temple Grandin’s book and he would see us in 3 months, that was 2 years ago, never been back! ~ L.P.
I was told that I was wasting their time by being there. She walked in, measured my son’s head, and told me that he had obvious autistic facial characteristics and that I needed to stop by to schedule a psychiatric appt on my way out. **she later called me and apologized. My son’s MRIs weren’t normal and she learned a big lesson. ~ H.S.
They told us to find an institution for our severely affected son before he hit puberty. Today he still struggles with PANDAS, but he has recovered from his autism, is mainstream in school and has a pretty typical life. It’s not perfect, but let’s just say that his two younger siblings who aren’t affected by autism give me more issues than he does these days. There is always hope. ~ T.D.
The neurologist we saw was a joke! Came in with a backpack on (like he was on his way to lunch) checked my sons knee reflex, made him throw a balled up piece of paper and then says “yep diagnosis seems correct” ~ V.G.
We were told to accept that he would live with us until we couldn’t handle him anymore, probably by 14 since he has “big genes” and then a group home. He’s 19 and healed, in college playing football. NT (neurotypical). ~ S.S.
When my son was three years old a team of child psychologists, a speech pathologist, and an OT told us that George would never be in a mainstream classroom, he would never have friends, never go to college, and never fall in love. Can you imagine saying that kind of thing to a parent? They were wrong!! They were so so wrong. He has been in a mainstream class without supports for 5 years now, has several beloved friends, makes straight A’s, and has the kindest, most beautiful heart I’ve ever been lucky enough to know. They were so wrong. ~ G.O.
I was given a book that said no hope, no cure, just adult living facility. I’m sure there are wonderful adult living programs, but at the time he was 140+ ATEC, and it was scary (now 21 ATEC at age 13). ~ M.P.
There were many, many more. And every day at least 120 new families receive an autism diagnosis. And every day 120 families must endure the opinion of a doctor that there is nothing they can do to help their child except put them in behavioral therapy for 30 hours a week and then find them a home when they get older.
Please know that there is SO MUCH that you can do to improve the health and expression of life for your child. These folks who diagnose autism do not treat autism. They are trained to look for certain behaviors at certain levels of intensity and then label that with a diagnosis. They don’t read about treatments, they don’t follow people they’ve diagnosed, they DON’T KNOW.
If you have a child with a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, please know that there is hope and promise for your child’s future. Never give up, never stop questioning and keep learning. ~ Amy Y.
I do not know you. But I do know one thing. You are NOT physically OK like the police report stated. Not just after what you went through. After your body heals, you are not going to be mentally or spiritually OK for a long time either. My heart goes out to you. The clean-cut, nicely dressed stranger, who brazenly walked into your front door on Sunday afternoon and raped you, is sick. And he may attack others. The sheer audacity of a man to walk into your front door, on a Sunday, and then just walk out the front door after the attack, is terrifying. I imagine that you will re-play that horrific experience over and over again every time you come back home. The violation; the brazen lack of fear; the violence; the planning that likely went into it.
This man may have walked away free, and may not think much about it later—but you, my dear neighbor, will likely never forget it. You are changed forever. I wish I could say that you’ll be fine. I wish I could say that you won’t have nightmares, or that you won’t get up in the middle of the night and check your locks repeatedly. I wish I could say that you’ll soon feel sexy and free and trusting again. But it will take time. And there will be flash backs.
Your friends, who you dare to tell, may not show up for you, as rape is a subject no one is comfortable with. Even the most ‘spiritual’ of your friends may forget about it a few months from now because they don’t want to think about it. You will likely avoid them, or avoid taking ubers home alone, or avoid walking into your house alone for years. Forgive your friends for not checking in six months from now when you become paralyzed and debilitated with fear. No one wants to think about rape, or the world-shattering effects it has on a person’s life.
But we need to think about it. And we need to care more. Rape is an epidemic in our country. Every 98 seconds a woman is sexually assaulted in America, according to RAINN.org. One in every six American women has either been raped, or been a victim of an attempted rape. It’s mind-blowing. It’s shocking. It’s disgusting.
My neighbor, you may feel overwhelmed, angry, helpless and hopeless. Move through all the feelings, get help from a therapist, and then fight your way back to hope again.
All men are not like this man. And even though it can seem like we women are now surrounded by misogynistic and degrading men everywhere we turn— from our president, to our favorite talk show hosts. But not all men hate women. You will feel safe in your house again. Maybe you’ll get a dog who will charge down anyone who tries to enter—like mine did—saving me from a home invasion 15 years ago.
If you ever read this blog and want to find me, my doors and arms are open, and I will listen to you any day, any time.
Rape is an attack of a person’s soul. In my eyes, what you did is the same as attempted murder. You tried to murder this woman’s life as it once existed.
Maybe, as Marianne Williamson says, love is the only thing that is real, and all violence is an illusion—but I see you. I see you right now lingering in your dark, shadow vibration that wants to, and feels entitled to, hurt others. And I know deep down that you see your worthless and disgusting behavior for what it is.
You will not get away with this in the long run. No matter how many others you attack. You will get caught. And when you die, I pray that you will have to re-live this moment and any others. I pray that somehow, someway, the angels and spirit guides for all the women you have attacked, will show you just what rape feels like—from the inside out. You will feel and see their fear, their pain, their tears, as your own. Isn’t that what ‘One Love’ is all about? See, I’m one of those southern yogis who believes that the Holy Spirit moves powerfully within the flow of Universal forces that steer us in the direction of love. And love isn’t just an ethereal feeling. To love is to try to understand, and to care, and to be kind, and to empathize and to hold yourself accountable and to make amends when you don’t treat others, as you would have yourself be treated.
You will, one day, truly understand what you have done. You cannot fool God. As you sow, so shall you reap. I pray that you will be personally guided closely toward that conscious light of love. I pray that you will be steered up-close and thrust within its blinding light.

The first country to give women the vote has another world-leading ambition: closing the gender pay gap.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the world’s youngest female leader, says her government aims to achieve pay equity for women in the public service within four years as a catalyst for widespread change. More than 120 years after her nation granted universal suffrage, Ardern hopes it can again be a flag-bearer for equal rights.
“If New Zealand is seen as a champion of issues around gender pay gap and pay equity, I would be proud of that,” Ardern, 37, said in an interview Tuesday in Wellington. “I know, though, that we will only be seen as a world leader if we’re able to make inroads ourselves.”
New Zealand ranked ninth out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report for 2017, well ahead of neighboring Australia, which placed 35th. While its pay gap has dropped to 9.4 percent this year from 16.2 percent in 1998, according to Statistics New Zealand data, the Ministry for Women says progress on closing it has stalled in the last decade.
Ardern’s Labour government swept to power last month on a pledge to put a human face on capitalism by intervening to address social failures, including the treatment of women in the workplace. Sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein may have triggered a global discussion about the difficulties women face, and even toppled a leading politician in the U.K., but Ardern said the next step is to achieve real change.
“I think these global conversations are incredibly important, but they’re only precursors to what needs to follow, and that is a change in culture, a change in behavior,” she said. “There is a need for conversations with young people in particular around issues of consent, healthy relationships.”
Since giving women the vote in 1893, New Zealand has been something of a trailblazer in terms of equal rights. The country’s gender pay gap is half the U.K.’s 18 percent, Ardern is the country’s third female prime minister, and the Governor General and Chief Justice are also women.
But there is only one female chief executive officer among the 50 companies on New Zealand’s benchmark stock index, and even though the nation ranks relatively highly on the World Economic Forum’s gender gap index, it has slipped from fifth place in 2009.
“We’re going backwards,” said National Council of Women President Vanisa Dhiru. “In New Zealand we like to think we’re pretty equal -- we were the first country to give women the vote after all -- but we’re not.”
The government needs to make it easier for people to make claims for equal pay through new legislation and additional resources, particularly for those at the lower end of female-dominated occupations, Dhiru said.
Ardern said closing the gender pay gap among the 46,000 core public service workers will send a strong signal to the private sector to follow suit.
“In 2017, we cannot continue to send a message to young women that they can expect to be paid 10 percent less simply for their gender,” she said. “That is not a message that can continue.”

Most people go to conferences to network. I am still of the mind that a network programs your television or, is something IT people maintain. This is why I am an anomaly in the marketing world. I really don't like to schmooze.
Other than the reception I slunk my way through last night, I've avoided hospitality suites left and right at this conference. I really don't want to buy anything from anyone and I am not selling. I am not looking for a job or trying to find someone for one. So I don't have the energy to "go fish" with my business cards in a hotel suite just to get a free drink and a stress ball with some bus company's name on it.
I haven't even sought out collegues to go to dinner with. I am perfectly fine with dining alone or calling room service. So obviously I will never be a leader in my profession or a person who will seek public office. I am not a good old boy nor am I that kind of guy everybody knows and likes. I can walk into a room and go completely unnoticed even though I've worked in this industry for almost a quarter of a century.
Yeah, why would you need actual human contact when you have us. We are very similar to real people. (Well, most of us anyway).
I'm not a schmoozer either. I would be miserable if in the same situation. If there's at least one or two people that I am good friends with, then I'll hang with them. Other than that, I'd be alone in my room.
I never quite masterd the introductory thing, "Hi, my name is..." That's about as far as I get before I say, "I can do a great chimpanzee impression." Not a great opener at business functions.
I'm a people person, but find that in similar settings I'm perfectly happy with room service & my laptop. Congrats on the award, Tim!
You are an anomoly, and I think that's a good thing. Everybody there is after something, and bother or attempt to use other people to get it. You're there because you "have" to be. I like that.
I know this sounds simplistic, but I love that we are all different. It really does take all kinds. We sometimes have to be in a room full of people that are nothing like us to realize who we are and that we like it that way.....revel in your aloneness.
I’ve always thought of you as a deity and I think this is final proof. Most people in the schmooze based realm are oblivious to your presence and my guess is when someone does notice and make an attempt to figure you out they wind up getting you all wrong anyway.
Incidentally I hope you don’t mind but I’ve printed out a copy of Dizgraceland and use it as frequently as I reference The Holy Bible, The Koran and The Zohar. There is something disturbingly mystical about you. I can’t wait to start decoding you…

Why buy the blog when you can get the posts for free? Very good question to which I don't have any good answers other than it would boost my self-esteem if not my bank account.

No, I am not warning people that I am about to drop trow and moon them. I am actually referring to the impending full moon that will be in the sky tomorrow and wreck havoc with the emotional state of the world as we kind of know it. Though me dropping my pants and mooning people could have the same emotional impact.
It seems like I write about the full moon every time it makes its appearance because I tend to feel it before I see it. I feel more disjointed mentally than normal. And I lose my manic drive to blog obsessively and try desperately get people to read my posts. Though I think I need to pick meatier subjects than beauty bark if that is indeed my goal.
I've lost track really of what my goal is. After almost six years of blogging, the odds of me becoming an Internet sensation are pretty much astronomical. It is a harsh reality that I've had to face along with middle age and the fact that I'll never be rich (or better looking). The full moon somehow exacerbates all of this.
To add insult to injury, I still have these annoying little beauty bark splinters in my fingers. But the plant beds look pretty darn spiffy. They'll just glow in the full moon light tomorrow if the clouds lift. The moon doesn't really have much influence on beauty bark other than making it live up to its name.
Speaking of driving traffic to my blog, Google AdWords tried to tempt me to advertise with them with a $100 worth of free advertising. Every time someone searches for a key word that I associated with my blog it would pop up there on the right of the search. I was almost ready to do this when it dawned on me that there is no single key word that I could associate with my blog that would be flattering or would make someone want to go to my blog when they were looking for something altogether different. And since I don't sell anything, there wouldn't be any real reason to advertise my blog anyway.
No, I need to be content with people randomly colliding with my blog the way random asteroids collide with the moon. I wonder if more asteroids hit the moon when it is full than when it is a new moon?
See how I neatly brought my digression about Google AdWords full circle back to the full moon? That my friends is the sign of a seasoned writer.

Berlin based Jay Bo recently held a solo show at Hamburg's Circle Culture featuring some of his most recent paintings. We lvoe his work.
Fifty24SF opened Street Anatomy, a new solo show by Austrian artist Nychos a week ago last Friday night. He's been steadily filling our city with murals over the last year, with one downtown on Geary St. last summer, and new ones both in the Haight and in Oakland within the last few weeks, but it was really great to see his work up close and in such detail.
Nate Milton emailed over this great short Gator Skater which is a follow-up to his Dog Skateboard he emailed to us back in 2011... Any relation to this Gator Skater?
Congrats on our buddies at Needles and Pens on being open and rad for 11 years now. Mission Local did this little short video featuring Breezy giving a little heads up on what Needles and Pens is all about.
In a filmmaker's thinking, we wish more videos were done in this style. Too much editing and music with a lacking in actual content. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
Matt Wagner recently emailed over some photos from The Hellion Gallery in Tokyo, who recently put together a show with AJ Fosik (Portland) called Beast From a Foreign Land. The gallery gave twelve of Fosik's sculptures to twelve Japanese artists (including Hiro Kurata who is currently showing in our group show Salt the Skies) to paint, burn, or build upon.
FFDG is pleased to announce an exclusive online show with San Francisco based Ferris Plock opening on Friday, April 25th (12pm Pacific Time) featuring 5 new medium sized acrylic paintings on wood.
Backwoods Gallery in Melbourne played host to a huge group exhibition a couple of weeks back, with "Gold Blood, Magic Weirdos" Curated by Melbourne artist Sean Morris. Gold Blood brought together 25 talented painters, illustrators and comic artists from Australia, the US, Singapore, England, France and Spain - and marked the end of the Magic Weirdos trilogy, following shows in Perth in 2012 and London in 2013.
San Francisco based Fecal Pal Jeremy Fish opened his latest solo show Hunting Trophies at LA's Mark Moore Gallery last week to massive crowds and cabin walls lined with imagery pertaining to modern conquest and obsession.
Well, John Felix Arnold III is at it again. This time, he and Carolyn LeBourgios packed an entire show into the back of a Prius and drove across the country to install it at Superchief Gallery in NYC. I met with him last week as he told me about the trip over delicious burritos at Taqueria Cancun (which is right across the street from FFDG and serves what I think is the best burrito in the city) as the self proclaimed "Only overweight artist in the game" spilled all the details.
London based illustrator FRENCH recently held a show of new works at the Melbourne based Mild Manners
Ever Gold opened a new solo show by NYC based Henry Gunderson a couple Saturday nights ago and it was literally packed. So packed I couldn't actually see most of the art - but a big crowd doesn't seem like a problem. I got a good laugh at what I would call the 'cock climbing wall' as it was one of the few pieces I could see over the crowd. I haven't gotten a chance to go back and check it all out again, but I'm definitely going to as the paintings that I could get a peek at were really high quality and intruiguing. You should do the same.
Mario Wagner (Berkeley) opened his new solo show A Glow that Transfers Creativity last Saturday night at Hashimoto Contemporary in San Francisco.
The paintings in the show are each influenced by a musician, ranging from Freddy Mercury, to Madonna, to A Tribe Called Quest and they are so stylistically consistent with each musician's persona that they read as a cohesive body of work with incredible variation. If you told me they were each painted by a different person, I would not hesitate to believe you and it's really great to see a solo show with so much variety. The show is fun, poppy, very well done, and absolutely worth a look and maybe even a listen.
NYCHOS completed this great new mural on the corner of Haight and Ashbury in San Francisco on Tuesday. Looks Amazing.
With rising rent in SF and knowing mostly other young artists without capitol, I desired a way to live rent free, have a space to do my craft, and get to see more of the world. Inspired by the many historical artists who have longed similar longings I discovered the beauty of artist residencies. Lilo runs Adhoc Collective in Vienna which not only has a fully equipped artists creative studio, but an indoor halfpipe, and private artist quarters. It was like a modern day castle or skate cathedral. It exists in almost a utopic state, totally free to those that apply and come with a real passion for both art and skateboarding
I just wanted to share with you a piece I recently finished which took me 4 years to complete. Titled "How To Lose Yourself Completely (The September Issue)", it consists of a copy of the September 2007 issue of Vogue magazine (the issue they made the documentary about) with all faces masked with a sharpie, and everything else entirely whited out. 840 pages of fun. -Bryan Schnelle
While walking our way across San Francisco on Saturday we swung through the opening receptions for Kirk Maxson and Alexis Mackenzie at Eleanor Harwood Gallery in the Mission.
Jeremy Fish opens Hunting Trophies tonight, Saturday April 5th, at the Los Angeles based Mark Moore Gallery. The show features new work from Fish inside the "hunting lodge" where viewers climb inside the head of the hunter and explore the history of all the animals he's killed.
Beautiful piece entitled "The Albatross and the Shipping Container", Ink on Paper, Mounted to Panel, 47" Diameter, by San Francisco based Martin Machado now on display at FFDG. Stop in Saturday (1-6pm) to view the group show "Salt the Skies" now running through April 19th. 2277 Mission St. at 19th.
For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to quit my job, move out of my house, leave everything and travel again. So on August 21, 2013 I pushed a canoe packed full of gear into the headwaters of the Mississippi River in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, along with four of my best friends. Exactly 100 days later, I arrived at a marina near the Gulf of Mexico in a sailboat.

Eighties teenager Marty McFly is accidentally sent back in time to 1955, inadvertently disrupting his parents’ first meeting and attracting his mother’s romantic interest. Marty must repair the damage to history by rekindling his parents’ romance and – with the help of his eccentric inventor friend Doc Brown – return to 1985.
The final installment of the Back to the Future trilogy finds Marty digging the trusty DeLorean out of a mineshaft and looking up Doc in the Wild West of 1885. But when their time machine breaks down, the travelers are stranded in a land of spurs. More problems arise when Doc falls for pretty schoolteacher Clara Clayton, and Marty tangles with Buford Tannen.
Marty and Doc are at it again in this wacky sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud. But things go awry thanks to bully Biff Tannen and a pesky sports almanac. In a last-ditch attempt to set things straight, Marty finds himself bound for 1955 and face to face with his teenage parents — again.

The first, Presbyterian, period can be traced back certainly to 1637. although at an earlier date there are hints of Puritan influences in the town,. Gasper Hicks, the vicar of St. Mary Magdalene in 1630 was a Presbyterian, later to be ejected from the living at Landrake. In 1637 William Crompton came to St. Mary’s from Barnstaple, where he had been ‘a lecturer.’ “He was much followed and admired by the puritanical people of that place and in the neighbourhood; but his doctrine being not esteemed by many orthodox, or as those of his persuasion say, that he was envied by the Vicar thereof, because he was better beloved than him, he was forced thence, by the diocesan and ecclesiastical power, and thereupon receiving a quick call he removed to Launceston, where being a preacher in the church of St. Mary Magdalene, he continued in good estimation among the precise people about four years, and then to their grief he was untimely snatched away by death in the prime of his years.” His son followed his father’s opinions and was afterwards an eminent Nonconformist in Devon, being ejected later from the church at Cullompton.
Crompton died in 1642, and for six years there was no continuing minister. A successor was appointed in 1648, when the name of Joseph Hull first appears in the parish register as clerk. Hull had been born in Crewkerne, Somerset, and was Rector of Northleigh, Devon, from 1621 to 1635, when he emigrated to New England with his wife and seven children. He did not settle down, and after several moves returned to England and came to Launceston. The following year, on January 23rd, 1649, “was baptised Rubin son of Joseph Hull, Clarke” and a similar entry follows at almost yearly intervals until 1654, when the birth (not the baptism), pf John Hull is recorded on November 25th. Soon after this Hull left Launceston, because of his growing family; John Tingercombe wrote of him: “Tis hoped the man is godly. He has a very greate charge of children neare twenty. Some say more.” A latter hand has tampered with the name of his son born in 1651, and other entries directed against Puritans in the same hand suggest that Hull was a Puritan. Other proof of this comes from the fact that the Council of State in October 30th, 1655, approved an Augmentation of £50 certified by the Trustees for the maintenance of Ministers to “Jos. Hull, minister of Launceston, co, Cornwall.”
He was succeeded by William Oliver, another Presbyterian. Oliver, whose father was a gentleman of the country, had received a liberal education. He was a critic in the Latin and Greek tongues, for which and his other excellencies he obtained a Fellowship in Exeter College, from which he removed to take the pastoral charge (of Launceston). He was a good scholar and an excellent preacher, for which he was valued by the gentry of Cornwall and Devon. However, he did not escape criticism in Launceston, for in 1661 Peter Blewett gave securities for good behaviour “for having said that Mr. William Oliver, minister of this town, was a base rogue.” His appointment is interesting; a manuscript at Lambeth Palace gives a memorandum that on December 10th, 1656, “there was shown to the commissioner on approbation of public preachers, a nomination by the Mayor and Commonalty of Launceston of Mr. William Oliver, to the curacy of the Parish Church of Launceston.” This can but reflect the influence of the Puritans in the town at the time. One local celebrity was well known for this point of view. Thomas Gewen, of Bradbridge, in the nearby parish of Boyton, a former auditor to the Duchy of Cornwall, was elected to Parliament in 1647, although later, through his frequent opposition to the military party during tyhe second English civil war, he was excluded in “Pride’s Purge.” He had strongly advocated a Cromwellian monarchy and a House of Lords, had sought the exclusion of the Bishops from Parliament, “a stricter observance of the Sabbath,” the abolition of ceremonies unwarranted by Scripture, and the provision of able and laborious ministers of religion.” He was a shrewd man, well trained in administration, and a member of various Parliamentary committees in Cornwall. But he shared the common prejudice against the Quakers, and must be held partly responsible for the imprisonment and suffering which George Fox endured in Launceston Castle. Fox, with his two companions, Pyot and Salt, had been arrested at St. Ives for distributing religious tracts and brought to Launceston to await the March Assizes in nine weeks time. This trial proved to be a farce, and the conviction resulting in their imprisonment was the technical one of not removing their hats in court. Yet the six months they suffered in Doomsdale (below) was the worst imprisonment Fox was to endure, his suffering being intensified by the indescribable filth of the prison. Fox describes the horror of it both in his journal and more fully in the pamphlets he afterwards published.
Fox thought the inhabitants “dark and darkened” and in vain did he protest against the vanity and love of sport in the town, seen displayed on the bowling green adjacent to the prison. Sewel, Fox’s biographer. describing the gaoler – a former criminal. writes: “It was not at all strange then, that the prisoners suffered most grievously from such a wicked crew, but it was more to be wondered at that Colonel Bennet (t), a Baptist Teacher, having purchased the gaol and the lands belonging to the Castle, had there placed this head gaoler.” Bennett was obviously impatient of the Quakers, although he ultimately released the three men unconditionally on September 9th, 1566, without payment of the fees to their brutal gaoler, “and so as innocently they caame out of prison, as innocently they were put in.” Fox left behind him in Launceston a “Little remnant of friends that has been raised up here while he was in prison, whom he visited when he returned to town a very short while after his liberation.” The subsequent story of the group is not known, but it seems that it did not survive for long.
Colonel Robert Bennett, to whom they referred, was a local man of considerable prominence. He was born at Hexworthy, Lawhitton, and his father, Richard Bennett, who died when Robert was only fifteen, had been a Counsellor-at-law. Robert Bennett was named in 1643 as commanding 1,200 foot and 300 horsemen from Cornwall at Torrington, but his effort there to surprise Colonel Digby was defeated. In 164 Cromwell is reputed to have spent three days with Bennett at Hexworthy-which is quite possible, since Bennett was one of Crowell’s trusted advisors. 1649 sees him defending the trial of the King, justifying it before Truro Quarter Session by “an appeal to scripture, law, history and reason.”
In 1653 he was a member of the Council of State of thirteen, and the next year he was one of Cornwall’s Members of Parliament. In local life he was an Alderman and a Justice of the Peace. While his civil and military career is fairly well known, nothing has yet been discovered to shed any light on Fox’s description of him as a Baptist. Hitherto there is no trace of baptist influence in this part of Cornwall. Possibly there were a few Anabaptists and Brownists in Cornwall, but there is no evidence of an Anabaptist Congregation in Cornwall such as the community in Tiverton in 1626. On the other hand the Civil War had brought many new influences in its train. Dr. Whitley emphasised the part the Army played in spreading Baptist Doctrine. “Many a garrison town heard preaching by Baptist officers, to the scandal of the clergy and even of their own commanders….The Army was mobile, and it is instructive to study the rise of Baptist Churches where regiments were quartered.”
But in Launceston, in spite of Bennett, no church seemed to have been formed, and it would seem that in this small community there was but little scope for Baptists where the Presbyterian forces were strongly entrenched. The Restoration deprived Bennett of his seat in Parliament. He retired to Hexworthy until his death on July 6th, 1683, at the age of seventy-nine. His finely carved slate tombstone was found in the 1950’s in a neglected part of Lawhitton Churchyard, and is now fixed to the South Wall of the Church interior. Gewen on the other hand was in favour, and was replaced in his office under the Duchy of Cornwall, but shortly afterwards died.
With the Restoration came other changes. William Oliver, the minister of St. Mary’s Parish Church, had been outstanding in Presbyterian circles, as the frequency of his name in the minutes of the Cornwall “Classic” suggests. But with the Act of Uniformity Oliver was ejected, though he remained active in the district. It seems as if he continued to gather a congregation around him, preaching in unlicensed places. In an isolated community such as Launceston the penalties for this might be defied if the local authorities were sympathetic, as indeed they might have been. The Secretary of State to Charles II was Sir William Morrice, another Presbyterian, who lived in the nearby parish of Werrington, and through his influence a pension was secured for the support of Oliver and his family. Yet there is a hint of their suffering given in the parish records, for William, son of William Oliver (born on July 31, 1658), was buried on April 29, 1664 2in the little yard.” Oliver is still described in the entry as “Clarke” although afterwards this was partly deleted.
A few years later, on 22nd April, 1672, John Hicks, who was a Puritan Mayor during the time of the Commonwealth, applied for a license for “William Oliver, of Dutson, near Launceston, Presbyterian” and an indulgence had already been granted to him. Oliver had in fact taken the “Oxford Oath” in 1666, and thus escaped the penalties of the Five Mile Act which fell on those unwilling to declare that they abhorred resistance to the King and would not seek an alteration in the government of Church or State. Soon after this a census showed that there were thirteen Nonconformists in the town, as well as some Quakers who had been in the town gaol for many years. Oliver kept a school in the town, bred many good scholars, and died a Lay Conformist.
Subsequently, a tablet was placed in the South-East corner of the Church from which he had been ejected to commemorate him.
(“William Oliver, Master of Arts, Sometime fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, and not long sinnce Pastor of this church, but recently Master of the Royal Free School in this place, sweating in the dust of which he died of consumption.”)
The death of Oliver did not mean the end of Puritan influence. The Parish Register of St. Thomas the Apostle, Launceston, has some entries concerning a Robert Gill. In January 1695, he buried his wife Jane, but remarried in October of the following year, and on January 12th, 1697, “Robert Gill and Mary, his wife, has a daughter baptised Mary by a dissenting minister”-the last four words in a later hand. A similar entry on January 22, 1699, records the baptism of their son, Robert, “by a dissenting minister.”
Who this minister was is not known, although in the late 1950’s records of the Cockermouth Church had shown that in 1694, thirteen years after Oliver’s death, there was a church in Launceston whose minister was Deliverance Larkham. Deliverance Larkham was grandson of Thomas Larkham, Vicar of Tavistock (from 1648 until ejected in 1660) and first minister of the Tavistock Congregational Church. George, Thomas Larkham’s son, was first minister of the Congregational Church at Cockermouth which Thomas Larkham had founded while still holding the living at Tavistock, Deliverance, George’s son, was born there in 1658. Sent to London for better education in 1667, he was received into the Cockermouth church in 1681 which in 1694 called him as assistant for his now ageing father. But on July 22 “The Pastor received a letter from the people at Launceston which manifested they had chosen him caalled by them, namely, Mr. Deliverance Larkham, for their Pastor. Wherefore they desired to keep with them.” The following year Larkham promised to come to Cockermouth, but finally changed his plan, and left Launceston for Lancaster.
The Presbyterian church in Launceston was again without a minister in 1705, for a copy of a letter dated November 5th of that year is recorded in the Church Book (begun in 1790). The copy appears to have been made about 1830:
“Revd. Sir, We whose names are under-written, knowing that you are not ignorant of our cause. And how calamitous it is like to be upon the removal of the Rev. M. Berry, unless some other suitable supply may be obtained, do hereby make it our earnest request to you that you would be pleased to favour us with your presence and Ministerial Labours….”
It is not known whether the unnamed recipient accepted the invitation. M. Berry who was leaving may have been related to either Harry, Benjamin or Henry Berry-all ejected ministers and active Nonconformists in the West. Henry Berry had in fact lived not far away in Torrington from 1690 to 1744, where he died and was buried, having “ministered to a numerous people, but very poor.” The authenticity of the letter, which was signed by forty men, is guaranteed by a number of their names appearing in the local parish registers of the period. The list includes Robert Gill, Edward Bennett and Thomas Oliver.
Edward Bennett was the grandson of Robert Bennett. His father, William, who died in 1704, left £120 to erect “a convenient meeting-house for the ordinary and most common use of entertaining a Congregation of Dissenters from the Church of England, as were commonly called Presbyterian.” The land was purchased for this in 1707, and the church built and opened in 1712. This was the site (The Congregational Church in Castle Street below) that had the Union church.
Once the meeting-house was built, the church grew under the ministry of Rev. Michael Martin, who had been ordained by the Exeter Presbyterian Assembly on June 28th, 1694 and was financially assisted while in Launceston by an annual grant of £6 from the Presbyterian Fund in London. Within a few years the Congregation included 130 ‘hearers’ amongst whom were five county and fiver borough voters, while the actual membership of the church consisted of three gentlemen, fourteen tradesmen, five yeomen and ten labourers. Yet the life of the church could not have been easy, even though there were neighbouring churches at Tavistock, Okehampton and Holsworthy. The town was strongly Tory, and Nonconformists did not flourish in such an atmosphere. There was much to harden and coarsen the inhabitants of the town; criminals were still publicly hung on the Castle Green, only 100 yards from the church, while for lesser offences women as well as men were flogged through the streets behind a cart.
Martin, who later left for Lympstone, was succeeded by Rev. William Tucker. He, however, removed to St. Ives in 1728, and Martin then returned to Launceston, remaining there until his death in 1745. In his will he left £50 to the church, and a further £ 10 for a neighbouring church at Hatherleigh. But the cause was declining; no minister was appointed to succeed him, although a Mr. George Castle occasionally preached. Eventually the meeting-house was closed, and Richard Coffin-heir of Edward Bennett, sold the property to a local clothier. So it was that the early Presbyterian Church, whose roots are to be sought in the Puritanism active in Cornwall in the early 17th century, and which from this obscure beginning became a separate reality by the leadership of William Oliver after the events of 1662, found strength to survive the first hazards of its career, securing its own building, partly because of the help of the Bennett family with its Baptist sympathies. Yet, once the first perils had been passed, decline set in. Was Oliver, the founder, at fault, for having courage, yet not courage sufficient to go striving for reforms as others did? Or was the church too prone after all to follow the fashions of the day? Did some wooing voice succeed in undermining their dissent? Or were the church leaders led to conform by hope of their securing public office in this ancient borough, then the capital town of Cornwall? All we know is the church suffered the fate of others at this time, and its life seemed ingloriously to have ended.
But by now a fresh wind was blowing in the religious life of the land. In 1743, Wesley was evangelising in Cornwall and George Whitefield in Devon. Wesley’s first visit to Launceston was in 1747, and he paid a number of visits subsequently. By the time of his visit in 1789 a chapel had been built which on that particular day was too small to accommodate the congregation which came to hear him. Yet despite the astonishing growth of Methodism in Cornwall it did not completely take the place of the lapsed Presbyterian churches, and in Launceston itself the heritage of the earlier Dissenters was not to be lost to their more direct heirs. In 1777 Sir William Trelawney gave an address in Launceston and a certain William Derry was seriously impressed. Yet not in him alone was God’s Spirit at work. The preface to the Congregational Church Book, dated June 6th, 1790, begins:
“The Cause of Religion in this Town and Neighbourhood in the dissenting line had declined and ceased for a considerable number of years previous to the year 1775. About this period it pleased God to bless a Mr. John Saltren of this Town with a Religious Concern; very soon did he meet with a pious friend in the neighbouring borough of Newport, when they met together form time to time for the purpose of Social prayer and religious conversation. In a short space of time after this, a few others, being also under God wrought upon by means of the Spiritual instruction received by means of the persons mentioned, they formed themselves into a religious society, and appointed stated times for their devotions.”
So it was that the little group grew; “Then “Mr. Saltren began to excercise his talents more publicly and openly, by preaching the Word of God to all who chose to attend. Hearers at this time began to increase in number.” So a larger kitchen had to be used to accommodate them, and soon after they had to move again to “the Great House, situate at the foot of St. Thomas Hill.” John Saltren left Launceston for Taunton and then Bridport, but his brother William succeeded him. In 1788 the old meeting-house at Castle Street was purchased and “was entirely refitted, or rather rebuilt, as it had been planned out for a dwelling house….The expense of reconverting it, including the purchase money, amounted to the sum of £380. This house was opened for religious worship on Thursday 18th of September, 1788.”
At this period we find for the first time precise information about Baptists in Launceston. There is no doubt that the cottage meeting at Newport, from which the Independent Church had grown, had contained a minority if Baptists. They now decided that the time had come for them to form their own separate church. They were never numerous, and events proved the town was too small and Methodism was to become too strong to allow both the Baptist and Independent churches to thrive. Yet, although overshadowed by the sturdy growth of the Independent church, for twenty-one years a small Baptist Church met regularly for worship, a church which is not without its claim to fame. Its story can be partially reconstructed from it minute book.
The leading figure of the church was Thomas Eyre, in whose hand the entire minute book seems to have been written. He was engaged in the wool, skin, and combing trades, and was of sufficient local prominence to be one of eleven local householders who in January 1832 were active in seeking reform in local Parliamentary representation. His brother, John Eyre, became an Anglican priest, after graduating at Oxford, and then joined the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion. Robbins, in his book, states that John Eyre was at first associated with William Saltren; his influence within the Baptist Church is evident from the careful formulation of their confession of faith, set out in twenty-seven numbered paragraphs which faithfully reflect contemporary Calvinism.
Eleven signatories-eight men and three women, appear beneath the “Solemn Agreement entered into by all who join this Church commonly called Baptists.” On Thursday, March 24th, 1791, they had opened their meeting-house in Southgate Street. Alteration to the premises had cost nearly £49; there is no record that Thomas Eyre was ever repaid this sum. Then on the next day, Friday, at 8 p.m. six of the men were “put into a proper Church State by the Revd. Hugh Giles and gave each other the Right Hand of Fellowship. The following Sunday three more members were received on their behalf by Revd. Giles. who administered the Lord’s Supper.”
So the Baptist Church in Launceston was born; a small yet sturdy infant, meeting in a large room at the back of what was then “Ching’s Stores,” for which their accounts show they paid £5 5s. a year rent, having a twenty-one year lease of the room. Their accounts also show that another minister was present on March 25th, a Revd. J. Wilkinson, whose expenses were 5s., compared with 7s. 6d. for Hugh Giles. Not lacking in zeal, at a church meeting on March 31st they “agreed to continue at every Thursday Month at Evening. And Stated Times of public worship by Sabbath Days-Eleven o’clock in the morning-Three o’clock afternoon-and Six o’clock in the Evening-and that all meetings be ended at Nine o’clock in the evening and not later.”The next month a member was added by baptism, the service being conducted by Rev. William Smith, when in addition a man from Tavistock was baptised. The Church Meeting which had authorised the baptism had also made Thomas Eyre their first, and only, deacon and elder.
At the close of April the Church Meeting passed a resolution concerning another of its members, Jacob Grigg “…we also believe that he is possessed of spiritual and natural gifts, as we have frequently heard him with pleasure and profit dispence the Word of God among us…We therefore call him to preach the Gospel here amongst us, or whenever a door may be opened in Providence for that purpose…”
In May 1792 Isaiah Birt of Plymouth and Robert Redding of Chacewater visited the church. Birt baptised Thomas Eyre together with William Lenn (another foundation member) and his wife “who desire to bless God for what they experienced of his prescence in that holy Institution.” The baptism took place in the Mill Stream at the foot of Ridgegrove Hill. Later in the month Richard Lenn was baptised by Birt – but at Plymouth. (It is interesting to note that these foundation members were only subsequently baptised).
A year later, in May, 1793, the church considered Jacob Grigg’s request “to go to the Academy at Bristol for a Term of one year for Instruction, and then to return for to reside among us again in preaching the Word as usual.” To this he was commended through the agency of Isaiah Birt. Already in January of this year Grigg had been registered as the teacher of the church, But at Bristol Grigg found his horizons widened, and in consequence did not returne to Launceston but, being accepted by the Baptist Missionary Society, sailed in 1795 for Sierra Leonne.
The church never recovered from the loss of Grigg. In 1796, in their letter to the Association, which met that year at Exeter, they describe themselves as “remaining obscure from our Brethren and Fathers in Christ.” The only remaining entry of consequence in the minutes is the copy of the letter to the Association dated 1797. After a florid introduction it continues:- “And we beseech you, that…you would have a kind remembrance of us, two or three poor members of Christ at Launceston; for the cause of Christ is very low with us as to our number, and we are almost weary of waiting the Lord’s Coming to make bare his Arm, as we have no addition to our Little Society, and are at a distance from the Ministers of Christ visiting us: Yet we bless God that we are kept together in the Love of the Lord Jesus, and that we frequently find His presence with us, which still encourages us to keep open the doors of the Lord’s House…”
So the handful of members struggled on. In 1811 the church was still listed in the Baptist Magazine, but the next year the lease at Southgate ended, and after this, the church ceased to exist as an organised body. One or two of its members of the Independent Church, where undoubtedly more continued to worship. Yet without a building, and without regular Baptist fellowship, a few remained loyal to their Baptist principles, so that a generation later another church was founded with greater success.
In the meantime a very different story was being enacted at Castle Street, where the Independent Church was making great progress. After the Independent Church had been worshipping in the Castle Street meeting-house for a little less than two years, they felt themselves strong enough to draw up a constitution and a set of rules, which was adopted and signed by Twenty-seven foundation members. Three days later, on Wednesday, June 9th, 1790, William Saltren was ordained to the Christian ministry, with representatives present from Plymouth, Bideford, Kingsbridge, Appledore, Bridport, Honiton and London. The srvice began at 10:30 a.m. and continued until 2:30 p.m. A service the same evening was somewhat shorter. According to a manuscript of Robert Pearce, Junior, the charge to the minister was preached by Rev. Mr. Lavington, of Bideford. On the first day of the next month two deacons were chosen, and three new members admitted. The following Sunday the Lord’s Supper was observed, twenty-six people being present, and the collection for the poor amounted to 8s. 8d. which was immediately distributed to four members. For many years the practice continued of holding a Church Meeting on alternate months, and always the Lord’s Supper was celebrated the following Sunday.
During the five years of William Saltren’s ministry the membership grew from twenty-seven to forty-two. One of these members, June Hurden, was received on a recommendation from “Revd. Mr. Birt, minister of a Baptist Church at Plymouth Dock (modern day Devonport).” We are left to speculate why she joined the Independent Church, and not the Baptist, and wonder of on the day before this meeting approved of her she witnessed the local baptismal service which Birt conducted. It certainly suggests that as in the previous days of the Newport Meeting, there was still tolerance of the Baptist position among the Independents.
Saltren died on Saturday, April 18th, 1795, aged forty, and a bachelor. Soon after, three more deacons were chosen, and in August it was resolved “to engage the Revd. Jonas Lewis, late from Wincanton, Som. until Ladyday, 1796, at 20/- a week.” When this probationary period was ended he was called to the pastorate on a permanent basis, and although dissuaded by an anonymous letter, he accepted the call when it was unanimously repeated. The same year saw the first missionary interest, and a collection in June, 1796 raised £14 for this purpose. But Lewis pastorate was short. The Church Book has been mutilated, so that the record is deficient, but soon after May, 1798, Lewis left the church. It was suggested that there was a personal difficulty with the congregation. Although the church was soon to prosper, this was but the first time such an event was to take place.
The turn of the century saw the beginning of an outstanding pastorate. On June 29th, 1800, Richard Cope, then senior student at Hoxton Academy and afterwards a Doctor of Law, first preached at Launceston. His stay was prolonged for two months, then for a year, when he was invited to the pastorate at a stipend of £60 a year. This invitation he accepted, and was ordained on October 21st, 1801, remaining at Launceston until June 1820, when he left “to fill a more important situation in the church of God as tutor to an academy in Ireland.” Cope was a most enterprising man, a keen social reformer, and active in seeking the abolition of the Slave Trade. (He published a sermon on this theme in 1807 that he had preached on May Day). Due to his initiative a Sunday School was founded in 1800, during his first probationary year. It was one of the earliest in the county, although at Falmouth such work had begun earlier still. Within a generation the Sunday School had grown to a Union embracing seven other schools in the neighbouring country areas. The church grew so that it was necessary to erect another gallery within three years. But soon after the work was completed, on Christmas Day – a Sunday – while the church was at worship “a storm of wind seized the roof with such violence as to damage it very considerably” while a few weeks later another storm blew a chimney stack down, causing further damage so that “a great part of the timber work was broken…the rains that followed brought down a considerable portion of the plastering and rendered the Meeting almost unfit for worship. However, a subscription list was opened which attracted some sixty-six donors from all local parties and creeds. Nearly £100 was raised, which almost paid for the new gallery, as well as the roof.
Continued growth required further enlargement in 1809 – costing over £300 – and in 1815 another gallery was erected, this time behind the pulpit. When Dr. Cope left the church his stipend had been increased from the original £60 a year to £150; he had admitted 104 new members into the church, including two members of the Lenn family, two of the Eyre family, and a Grigg, all families with Baptist connections. He had been head-master pf a local school during part of his pastorate. Subsequently he ministered at Wakefiled and Penryn, where he died in 1856 at the age of eighty.
The following year Alexander Good began a new pastorate, during which the church building was again completely repaired, its last major alteration. In 1824 Revd. J. Barfitt succeeded Good; nothing is disclosed concerning the end of his ministry. Barfitt ministered for twelve years, during which time the system of pew rents was revised, the best seats costing 8s. per annum (or £3 3s. a pew) while others could be had for 6s. or 4s.
John Horsey, of Western College, almost immediately followed Barfitt in 1836 – another notable ministry which continued for thirty years. During his first year’s ministry an interesting minute is recorded:- “Persons offering satisfactory evidence of conversion to God shall be considered eligible to all privileges of Church Communion, not-withstanding any difference of opinion on the subject of baptism and other points now expected.” New members for that year included a Mr. and Mrs. Pattison. In August, 1830, Professor Pattison of the Northfield Bible Institute of America, on a visit to Launceston, stated that his grandfather had been a member of the early Southgate Baptist Church in Launceston, and subsequently moved to London, becoming a member and later a deacon at the Bloomsbury Baptist Church. Here again is evidence that the Independent Church continued to accept the members of the defunct Baptist Church into its fellowship and that the scanty records of the baptist Church do not show the complete extent of its life. Pattison seems to have been a man of some status in the town, for he was a solicitor who became the first president of the Mechanics and General Institute, founded in 1847. Probably in 1850, due to influence of the Castle Street Church, the village chapel at Greystone Bridge was opened. This was later adopted by the Baptists. Although Horsey’s ministry was of such duration, all was not well. There is no entry in the church book for the last ten years of it. In 1865 he resigned, but then withdrew his resignation. After the subsequent discussion in a Church Meeting which was far from happy, the greater part of the congregation split, and continued to worship in the Western Subscription Rooms (a public hall below), until after the end of Horsey’s ministry.
Horsey resigned the pastorate in 1866 “after passing through a severe trial in respect to himself and the church.” At the close of his ministry he was able to persuade the church to abandon the old Presbyterian custom which had prevailed until then of sitting in singing and standing in prayer.
T. E. M. Edwards began a short pastorate in 1867, which he resigned for health reasons two years later, but in which he had ministered to the reunited church, and seen the membership grow from 57 to 97, a growth which was reflected in the considerably larger, but unrecorded, number of “seat-holders,” and the publication of the first Church Manual in 1868. The church was sufficiently strong to entertain the Association for their two-day meetings in April, 1869. Also during this pastorate the old box pulpit was removed, and another pulpit installed, while the project for a new vestry was accepted.
Thomas Jackson, B. A., from New College, became the pastor in 1870, and at his ordination the Baptist Minister from the church at Lifton was present. This Lifton Church, opened in 1850, partly fostered the revived Baptist Church in Launceston, founded in 1876, Jackson’s pastorate was unhappy; after two years he tendered his resignation stating he felt he had lost the confidence of some of the members, and his insecurity was made worse by the inadequate stipend (£140 per annum) and lack of a house, as well as by his own indifferent health. After a stormy meeting, when no less than 248 members of the congregation had petitioned him to remain, despite the deacons opposition, all seemed well. But by July of the following year Jackson brought the deacons continued opposition into the open. Six sermons which he had submitted to two distinguished arbitrators, Dr. Allen and Professor Charlton, were pronounced orthodox. When these findings were made public however, some of the deacons continued to remain hostile. Jackson thereupon not only resigned, but left the ministry, adopting medicine as a profession with good success. Within ten years of his settling in Croydon he was elected to the Town Council.
Jease Bamford succeeded him in 1874, and began a pastorate of nineteen years which marked the peak of the church’s life. The membership grew swiftly; in March 1877 no less than twenty names of prospective church members were proposed. The same year the organ was enlarged, and soon afterwards the fine block of Sunday School buildings which face the church was erected (below). It is of interest to note that this period was also one of general prosperity in the town, marked especially by the building of several new streets of substantially built houses.
In 1891 a Men’s Bible Class was started – the origin of the Launceston Brotherhood – while the Church Book records a discussion on means of improving both the attendance of young people at the church services and the general attendance at the weeknight meeting. But the little village at Langore, whose origin is unrecorded, so declined that this time of prosperity in the town the trustees were compelled to close and sell the property to pay off the accumulated debt on the church. In 1894, Bamford was followed by William Miles. His was another happy ministry often recalled by older members. At this time the manse was purchased, and better incandescwnt gas lighting was installed in the church. The long-hoped-for vestry was built and a new heating system installed. Some of this work was stimulated by the 20th Century Fund. In 1901, the village church at Polyphant was sold to Wesleyan Trustees for the sum of £10. At the turn of the century, therefore, we find the church apparently vigorous and strong, with an evening congregation which frequently filled the building which seated five hundred.
With the Baptist Church at Southgate ceasing to exist as an organised body in 1812, its few stalwarts continued to be active in the district, and the Baptist witness was maintained by their preaching. In 1849, in the village of South Petherwin, a Baptist church was founded (below left). Very little is known of this church, and so far no trace of its records or minutes, if any were kept, has come to light. In the following year another church was formed, at Lifton, on the main road to Exeter.
This church had at least one immediate link with the former church at Launceston, since Dorothy Gould, who with her husband, John, were prominent in its life, was a daughter of the Lenn family. William Lenn had been a foundation member of the first Launceston Church with his son, Richard. A shoemaker by trade, Richard was well known as a preacher in the district, and would walk miles every Sunday to serve the village churches. He had some fame as a local poet, and wrote verses on topical events for the local newspaper, especially about feuds that then existed between the churches and the chapels. He did not die before 1874, and provides at least one certain link between the earlier church and the churches at South Petherwin and Lifton. Mr. Stanley Gould, who became secretary of Mutley Baptist Church, Plymouth, comes of this stock and having been president of the Association in 1943-44, gave sure proof that the family still keeps to its tradition.
The church at Lifton decided to build a chapel which was completed in 1851 and seated 150. From the start the church had an open membership, but its trust emphatically stated that the minister must preach “Believers baptism, and no other.” The following year saw the visit of “Mr. Wheeler to Launceston, formerly a missionary in West Africa.” Was there any recollection then, we wonder, of Jacob Grigg who had left Launceston for West Africa fifty years earlier? “Mr. Wheeler” was in fact J. A. Wheeler who went out to the Cameroons under the Baptist Missionary Society in 1850, but returned in 1852. Wheeler remained at Lifton, becoming its first pastor.
The minutes of the Lifton Church show that W. D. Hanson was also active in its life. He was later the squire of Polyphant, and was instrumental in forming a Baptist cause in that village in 1872. This Church was again short-lived, and little information about it survives. Mr. W. R. Pattison was another leading personality, whose connection with the former Launceston Church has already been noticed. He provides another link between the two churches. Another active Baptist was a Mr. Peter, of South Petherwin, who was frequently associated with activities at Lifton. An interesting minute records that on Good Friday, 1893, a Baptismal Service was held, and one of the speakers at the evening meeting was R. Lenn, of Launceston. At the Church Anniversary in the same year the congregation exceeded 200. In 1855, there was some discussion about raising the pastor’s stipend, and a suggestion made that the Church at South Petherwin would help, but the idea fell through. In 1860, the membership had passed forty; the tenth Anniversary was celebrated, the visiting preacher being T. H. Pattison of Regent’s Park College – a son of W. R. Pattison. He was later to become Professor T. Harwood Pattison, D. D., of Rochester Seminary, U. S. A., who gave the Ridley lectures in his old college in 1900, a few years before his death.
The following year records, amongst other baptisms, one from Greystone Bridge – the first record of Baptists there in 1862, the Congregational Church at Launceston, which had hitherto been responsible for this small church, made an arrangement with the Lifton Church to share responsibility for it. The Church, now closed, held a service once every Sunday; its congregation was small – rarely exceeding a dozen, often half that number. But there was an atmosphere of sanctity in the small building so delightfully situated on the banks of the Tamar nestling under a wooded hillside. Its older members could recall still earlier years, and the baptisms in the river close by. From 1928 it was under Baptist Trustees.
In 1863, a preachers’ plan was drawn up to embrace Lifton, Greystone, Bulford (of which we have no knowledge) and South Petherwin. The following year a church was established at Sourton; this church standing on the borders of Dartmoor, looked however to the Baptist church at Okehampton for its main support. In the record of baptisms we find names of two Launceston ladies, both of whom were at the time in membership at the Independent Church at Castle Street. 1868 saw the baptism of Henry Fitze a member of a long standing Baptist family. Now there come some changes in the pastorate; the year 1869 sees Thomas Honyer inducted to the pastorate “after labouring as an evangelist in connection with the church for more than three years.” He left in 1872, and was succeeded for six months only, by John Hier. In 1874, George Parker became minister, and with his coming the church discovered new vitality. He came from Croscombe, Somerset, and was introduced to the church by William Haines, of Spurgeon’s College. The next year sees the first reference to services at Portgate, and amongst others baptised is the new pastor’s second son.
The Portgate church trust was dated February, 1864 – ten years before this, and it was never legally enrolled. It was built by Mrs. Thomasine Smale largely for her own use, and by her will she left most of her estate for its benefit. The will was contested by her family, but the Devon Baptist Association proved the case, and then accepted a sum of £660 captital to provide “Smale’s Bequest,” the income from which was for the benefit of the Baptist Minister of Lifton or Launceston. The church itself has long ago ceased to exist, and the derelict building with its small graveyard was legally disposed of, not without difficulty, in 1930. Parker’s entry in the Lifton Minute book for March 26th, 1876 reads “Comd. preaching the Gospel in the Room for many years occupied by the ‘Bretheren’ in Duke Street, Launceston. We had nine in the morning and twenty-six in the evening….We hope to continue the service here, and to work it in connection with Lifton.” The services did in fact continue, and the church at South Petherwin moved to Launceston selling their building there for £75 in 1890. By May the cause at Launceston was sufficiently established for a permanent agreement to be drawn up with the owner of the hall in Duke’s Lane (between Northgate Street and Tower Street); it was made over the signatures of George Parker, Richard Peter, Henry Gardiner (two men outstanding in the early days of the reconstituted chruch), James Palmer, R. F. Bray and C. Vesey. The rent was £5 5s. a year, payable quarterly, for the use of the room on Sundays and one weeknight. In July there were nine baptisms at Lifton, with 300 present; Parker also records “Mr. Spurgeon has sent a young man, a Mr. J. Wilson, to preach at Launceston and try to establish a Baptist Church there. He has continued his work with great encouragement. Several souls have been saved and baptised on a profession of their faith at South Petherwin.”
John Wilson had first preached on Sunday, May 7th, and the following Tuesday his ministry was recognised when Rev. John Aldis, of George Street, Plymouth, was the special preacher. Presiding over the evening meeting was Squire Hanson. The church was formally constituted later in the year – on October 12th, 1876, John Wilson being unanimously elected as its first pastor, and Messrs. Pode and Gardiner the first deacons. The church consisted of thirty-two members. Soon afterwards, Richard Peter was also appointed as a deacon .
The next twelve months saw the church established, but later in the year, after fifteen months work, John Wilson (who had already spent a short period at Chiswick) left for Woolwich, where he was to spend the remainder of his life. 1877 also saw the Lifton church purchase a Manse.
Wilson was followed at Launceston for a few months ny A. E. Johnson – another of Mr. Spurgeon’s early students, but after he had left, Parker, at Lifton, accepted the oversight of the church, and in December, 1878, thechurches at Lifton, Sourton, and Launceston, agreed formally to unite under the one pastor. Parker’s initiative was not yet spent. Having secured the formation of the new church at Launceston, he looked for other opportunities and found one at Thorn Cross, three miles from Lifton and five miles from Launceston, an area of scattered farmsteads and cottages that would not even comprise a hamlet, but yet together making a sizeable community. The first record of any work here comes in 1879, when Parker started a cottage meeting. Within two years land had been purchased for a Church building; in June, three months later, the first stone was laid of a building to be completed that same year – much of the work being done by voluntary labour and by farmers giving free carriage for building materials. In 1884 it was free from debt, the Association Chapel Case having contributed £100 towards it. At Sourton, too, the work was growing, and in 1882 a chapel was erected. This also was cleared from debt by 1884, so that Parker and the church at Lifton were responsible for two new buildings within two years, both of which were paid for by the end of the third.
After a ministry of eleven years, Parker left in 1885 to go to Buckinghamshire. When he left, the Sourton church turned to Okehampton for oversight, but Lifton and Launceston continued to work together with the smaller churches at Thorn Cross and Greystone Bridge.
In Sir Alfred Robbins‘ book on Launceston it is stated in respect of the Launceston Baptist Church that “for some years up to a recent date there were no regular services” Robbins wrote in 1883. If he meant that services were irregular between 1876 and 1883, this incorrect for Mrs. John Fitze, a foundation member, was able to assert categorically that there was no such break. He may instead have meant that some services were held periodically btween the closing of the Southgate church in 1812 and the opening of the new church in 1876, and if so (and we have no other proof of it) it means again that the Baptists were more active in Launceston than their records suggest.
The pastorate at Lifton was filled again in the following year, 1886, by the Revd. Franklyn Owen, who came from Bristol College. He resigned a year later and was succeeded by George Keen, a colporteur engaged in the district, who undertook the pastoral oversight of the group of churches. In 1891, the ministry of the Revd. H. Smart began – with the minister no longer resident at Lifton, but at Launceston.
The following year the Launceston church left the rented hall they had used hitherto and moved to the new church they had built in Western Road (below). This seated 130, with a basement Sunday School hall. Here the church worshipped during thirty-six years of steady growth until this building was out-grown, and they were established as a spiritual force in the life of the twon. Smart left in 1897, to be followed by C. J. Leal from 1898-1906. A. E. Knight succeeded him in the same year, and in 1908, D. Dighton Bennett B.A., began a ten-year pastorate.
While the work at Launceston was growing, the Lifton church fell on bad days. The village also had its strong Parish Church and a strong Methodist church; the Baptist church found as well that their daughter church at Thorn Cross was drawing considerably from their strength; the congregations declined to a handful, and it was at last decided to close the church. The final service was held on Whitsunday, 1916, and in 1920, the building and its furniture was sold for about £400.
Bennett had been succeeded in 1919 by William Bonser and in turn he was followed by E. P. Thorn in 1922. This pastorate proved to be a short one, and Bonser returned for a second pastorate from 1924-1927, before he finally retired. The church by now was seeking better accommodation than the small church building in Western Road offered, and at the time that they called H. W. Hughes (then a student at Spurgeon’s College) to the pastorate in 1927, they also embarked on an ambitious extension programme. The old church building was sold, and subsequently converted into showrooms for the local Electricity Authority.
A large old house – Madford House, standing in its own grounds in the centre of the town – was purchased, and its newer wing was converted into a church by rebuilding an outside wall to enclose a large area. The rest of the building was used for various church rooms, and as a Manse. The scheme cost about £4,000 but a portion of this was realised by the sale of the old church and by the subsequent sale of part of the gardens of Madford House.
The project was a splendid venture, although the church did not at the time realise how expensive maintenance of the property would become. Most of the house had been built early in the 17th century, and it was said to be the first house built outside the old, town wall, and to have accommodated Charles II when he was resident in Cornwall in 1645, being then Prince of Wales. When H. W. Hughes was succeeded by H. J. Harcup, most of the debt had been liquidated. He remained until 1945, being towards the end of his pastorate simultaneously pastor of the Congregational Church, with whom union was subsequently effected.
Returning to that church, in 1904, E. B. Rawcliffe began a ministry, but it lasted only two and a half years. Soon afterwards a new organ was installed, built by Wadsworth brothers at a cost of £458, and hydraulically blown. The Carnegie Trust contributed £125 towards the instrument. It was considered the best two-manual instrument in the district. In 1907, Thomas Bowen began a ministry which continued till 1911. The first signs of the gathering clouds are now seen. The church faced a serious financial deficit in 1909, and at the annual church meeting the following year, Bowen “made reference of the evidence of the lack of spirituality in the church.” Revision brought the church roll from 111 to 77, and when Bowen left he spoke of his ministry as being “exceptionally brief and quiet as exceptionally barren in visible results.”
1912 saw the church celebrate its bi-centenary (from the Presbyterian foundation in 1712), and in the following year, F. J. Sloper began a ministry which would have been briefer had he been physically fit enough to have joined the Army when war was declared. There were theological differences between him and part of the congregation; not a few of the champions of orthodoxy not only revolted against the “New Theology,” but forsook Free Church principles and turned to the Anglican Church (if to any) for spiritual succour. When F. J. Sloper left in 1919, he returned to the teaching profession and wrote “I have had much happiness and many dissapointments. The fact that the district is not Congregational has made it difficult to replace those that have gone. On the part of some members there is a marked slackness in regard to attendance and enthusiasm; on the other hand, some have been outstanding in their faithfulness and devotion.”
In 1920 began the pastorate of C. Sheppard Gibbs. The church membership now stood at about seventy and finances were proving difficult. In 1923 he stated his intention of leaving. That year sees also the end of the old ‘Church Book’ and the minute book which follows it is the entire work of James Treleaven junior, for long the secretary of the church and an outstanding counsellor and philanthropist, whose gracious influence in the town was as beautiful and characteristic as the clear copper-plate of his writing.
In 1924 A. F. Davies began a new pastorate, and soon afterwards the legacy of Hadrian Evans was upheld in court, and the ‘May Evans Trust’ of which £300 invested in 4 per cent. consols, began to benefit the church. F. Bowden followed in the pastorate in 1930, but two years later resigned, having met with considerable criticism for his methods. He returned to London broken in health, and not long afterwards died, leaving a wife and a small child. Augustus Julian, a retired minister succeeded him for a period, but in 1935, in view of the continued decline in membership – now only thrity seven – it was resolved to seek union with the Baptist Church. A scheme for outright union was rejected by both churches in 1936, and A. L. Trudgeon came to the pastorate until 1940. It was then agreed that the church should continue to exist separately, but worship with the Baptists. The agreement was reached after full discussion, and by the decision of an overwheming majority of both churches. On the first Sunday of June, 1940, the congregations united in worship under the ministry of the Baptist minister, H. J. Harcup.
The two churches continued to worship in both their buildings using each on alternate Sundays. At the end of the war, in 1945, when H. J. Harcup left for Long Sutton, Lincs., it was agreed to seek full union, and to concentrate the work in the Congregational premises. These, while in a less convenient site in the town, were more commodious than the Baptist church, which lacked any large hall. After a short, temporary, pastorate under W. P. Hodge, K. E. Hyde was called to the pastorate of the uniting churches, and the decisions were implemented. The Madford Church building was leased to the Ministry of Works for office accommodation. The small Walker organ, given by Mutley Baptist Church, Plymouth, was re-erected in Emmanuel Baptist Church, Plymouth, while the pews went to Hele Baptist Church, Torquay. The income derived from the lease of the property was entirely absorbed by the extensive programme of building repairs at Madford and the long-needed renovation at Castle Street.
Subsequently, F. R. Jewry, another Baptist, accepted the pastorate. He was a native of Launceston who married Miss Margaret Gardiner, a daughter of Mr. H. Gardiner, a former Deacon and lay preacher. After ministries in various parts, he returned to Launceston and began his ministry there in 1949, remaining until November, 1953. He was followed in December of that year by the Revd. W. Howard Smith, a Congregational minister whose ministry was greatly appreciated and richly blessed. He remained until failing health and eyesight compelled him to resign at the end of March, 1956. In November, 1956, Revd. R. W. Carr commenced a brief ministry, which terminated the following August, and, owing to the lack of support, it was then decided to close the church in 1957. The Devon and Cornwall Baptist Association and the Devon Congregational Union disposed of the two churches and devoted the money to the establishment of new churches elsewhere. The Greystone Baptist Church closed in 1963 also through the lack of support and the Thorn Cross Baptist church, which had been taken under the supervision of the Halwill group of Baptist Churches at the same time, also later closed.
The question will doubtlessly be asked why a church with so fine a tradition as that which formerly worshipped at Castle Street should so seriously decline; although there has been a decline od church life in the nation as a whole, here it is entirely abnormal. While there is no simple answer, several factors can be seen to have been at work. The area is strongly Methodist, and the local parish church is strong. The wide-spread initial success and subsequent failure of the earlier Presbyterian church points the way; so does the remarkable success of the Methodist Revival in Cornwall, which was no doubt helped by the ‘vacuum’ which the lapsed Presbyterian churches had left. The Launceston Church grew under a strong evangelical ministry. A similar ministry saw the growth of the Baptist church; the Congregational church declined most seriously when the ministry was not fully evangelical. But most of all the problem seemed to relate to the fellowship of the church. Out of thirteen pastorates in a hundred years, six ended unhappily, including that of Horsey, who had been minister for thirty years. Edwards, who followed, seemed gald to leave after a short while, and Jackson, the next minister, left in such disgust that he went right out of the ministry. A better period followed with Bamford and Miles, but a generation later the same story was repeated. Soon the decline had set in, short pastorates became the order of the day, the youth work of the church declined – as it always will when the spiritual life of the church is at fault – and the membership was not replenished.
The former Congregational Chapel and Sunday School were acquired from the Congregational and Baptist Union in 1959 by the Downinney Foursquare Gospel Party. With a major renovation and modernisation of the chapel building needed, the Trustees engaged the firm of Norman Weight Ltd., of Plymouth to carry out the work. The old Sunday School over the higher section of the chapel was removed, whilst completely re-felting and re-nailing slates on the existing roof and re-roofing the higher end of the building were carried out. At the same time the old vestry, which stood under a portion of the old Sunday School, was demolished. The exterior of the building was re-plastered and given a Tyrolean finish. New windows were fitted throughout and the interior walls were all re-plastered and painted. Also a oil-fired central heating system was installed. The pulpit was removed and a speakers platform fitted in its place. A small vestry under the balcony to the left of the platform was also fitted. The tiled baptistry, which was installed to the right of the pulpit when the Baptist and Congregational members united, was retained, as the Foursquare Gospel preached and practised total immersion as the only Scriptural form of Baptism.
The departure from traditional style in the lay-out was expressive of the views of the Trustees, who pointed out that the re-opening of the church was a venture of faith consistent with their conviction that a spiritual revival was imminent. History has proved, they said, that too often the traditional church had been slow to recognise and accept revival when it comes.
For that reason, the church was run on the Free Church lines with directions from no ecclesiastical body, the view being expressed that the Scriptural meaning of ‘the church’ is the body of believers united in a common faith, subject only to the Head of the Church, Christ himself. The venure was motivated by the firm conviction that the Gospel of Jesus Christ was still the power of God unto Salvation and that a personal experience of conversion would replace the present traditional approach. They believed the behaviour of young people, which at that time was causing much public concern, was regarded as an expression of the aching void in the human breast which God alone could satisfy.
While not affiliated in any way, the Foursquare Gospel were supporters of the T. L. Osborn ministry at Plymouth, and believed with him that every believer should be a personal soul-winner. Speaking in 1964, Mr. F. Bate, of Trew Farm, Tresmeer, the then secretary of the the Downinney Foursquare Gospel Mission, said “the beliefs of the Foursquare Gospel are not far removed from those of Primitive Methodism and the early Bible Christians. Emphasis is laid on the need of a personal salvation and on the privilege of Divine healing for the believer.”
They began using the former Congregational Chapel the following year, 1965, and continued to use it until the early 1980’s. The building had proved unsuitable for the groups needs and the congregation began meeting elsewhere in the town, latterly in a classroom at the St Joseph’s School in St Stephen’s Hill. The building was put up for sale by the Trustees, but having lain unused and empty for 30 years its condition deteriorated and in November 2013 it part collapsed. With it being unsafe it was completely demolished and the site is currently up for sale with planning for development.

In this post-conviction matter, the Court addresses for the second time a motion to recuse filed by the self-represented Petitioner, Manoj Kumar Jha. See ECF 217. It is titled “Second Motion For Judge Hollander's Recusal And Disqualification” (the “Second Motion”). Id. The government opposes the Second Motion. ECF 225. Jha has filed a reply. ECF 229.
No hearing is necessary to resolve the Second Motion. See Local Rule 105.6. For the reasons that follow, I shall deny the Second Motion.
Jha, a former engineering professor, was initially indicted on November 14, 2012 (ECF 1), on five counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343; mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341; and falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1519. Id. In a Superseding Indictment filed on August 21, 2013 (ECF 49), a charge of theft from a program receiving federal funds was added, under 18 U.S.C. § 666. In addition, the Superseding Indictment contained a forfeiture count, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(2)(A).
Beginning on March 18, 2014, the Court presided over a nine-day jury trial. See ECF 100; ECF 101.[1] At trial, more than 200 exhibits were introduced and over 30 witnesses were called to testify. On April 1, 2014, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to all counts. ECF 118; ECF 119.
Numerous issues were contested in presentencing submissions with regard to the calculation of the advisory sentencing guideline range applicable to Jha. See ECF 124; ECF 131 (Defense); ECF 127 (Government). The Presentence Report (“PSR, ” ECF 123) reflected that Jha had a total offense level of 27 and a criminal history category of I, with an advisory sentencing guidelines range of 70 to 87 months of imprisonment.[2]
Sentencing was held on August 29, 2014. ECF 134. The Government initially requested a 78-month sentence, based on its belief that Jha had an offense level of 27, with guidelines of 70-87 months. See ECF 127 (Government's sentencing memorandum) at 3. However, I concluded that Jha had a final offense level of 25. Based on a final offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of I, the advisory sentencing guidelines range called for a period of incarceration of 57 to 71 months. In light of the Court's ruling, finding an offense level of 25, the government sought a sentence of 65 months' incarceration. See ECF 158 at 78.
Despite my characterization of the government's recommendation as “reasonable” (id.), and notwithstanding the defendant's reprehensible conduct (id. at 88), I awarded a substantial downward variance to Jha. Id. at 90-92. In particular, I sentenced Jha to concurrent terms of 36 months' incarceration and ordered restitution in the amount of $105, 726.31. The term of incarceration was obviously well below the low end of the advisory guidelines range and well below the 65-month sentence that the government requested.
Judgment was entered on September 11, 2014. See ECF 137. In the Statement of Reasons (ECF 183), to explain my leniency in imposing a variant sentence, I stated that Jha is “an immigrant, a scholar and a professor [who] has helped many minority students . . . to his credit.” Id. at 3. I also pointed out that Jha's “career is ruined, ” noting that he “had to resign in disgrace.” Id.[3]
Thereafter, the defendant noted an appeal to the Fourth Circuit. ECF 135. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the defendant's convictions on June 4, 2015, in an unpublished, per curiam opinion. ECF 163. The mandate issued on June 26, 2015. ECF 164. See United States v. Jha, 613 Fed.Appx. 212 (4th Cir. 2015).
Jha subsequently filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court. See ECF 162-2. The Supreme Court denied Jha's certiorari petition on October 13, 2015. ECF 166 at 9; ECF 171 at 2; see Jha v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 349 (2015). On November 6, 2015, Jha filed a petition for rehearing in the Supreme Court. See ECF 166-4. That petition was denied on December 7, 2015. ECF 166 at 9; ECF 171 at 2; see Jha v. United States, 136 S.Ct. 611 (2015).
On February 25, 2016, Jha filed “Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 Motion To Vacate The Judgment of Conviction, Sentence And Restitution, And Order A New Trial” (ECF 166, “Rule 33 Motion”), along with numerous exhibits. By Memorandum (ECF 173) and Order (ECF 174) of June 13, 2016, I denied the Rule 33 Motion. Thereafter, Jha noted an appeal to the Fourth Circuit. ECF 175. In a per curiam opinion issued November 22, 2016, the Fourth Circuit affirmed. ECF 185. On January 24, 2017, the Fourth Circuit denied Jha's petition for rehearing. ECF 191. The mandate issued on February 1, 2017. ECF 192.[4]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the interim, on October 14, 2016, while the appeal was pending as to this Court&#39;s disposition of the Rule 33 Motion, Jha filed a petition to vacate under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 2255. See ECF 180. And, he filed motions to supplement the petition on October 14, 2016 (ECF 181) and February 8, 2017 (ECF 193). I granted those motions in an Order of February 24, 2017. ECF 199. The government filed its opposition to the § 2255 petition on May 30, 2017 (ECF 207), to which Jha replied on June 23, 2017. ECF 209. Thereafter, in a filing on July 13, 2017 (ECF 211), Jha sought a stay of the § 2255 petition, advising that he was pursuing certiorari in the Supreme Court as to the Fourth Circuit's ruling of ...

This is the second video tutorial on using GeoGebra. This is the video of the article GeoGebra Tutorial 3 – Constructing a Square. Sorry for some grammar lapses (I am not very good in impromptu), and I am really having a hard time imitating American accent to make most of the viewers understand this video. Sometimes my tongue gets twisted — so twisted that it automatically adds “s” to singular nouns (chuckles) like squares instead of square.
Anyway, this is a math blog, so I suppose it is appropriate for us to leave the grammar stuff to language teachers, although you are very much welcome to comment on errors, grammar may it be.

People often ask me how did I know when something was wrong. Were there signs? How did I go from a perfectly healthy 30 year old female to nearly dying over night?! So many questions on so many tongues including my own. Did I overlook weird symptoms in the weeks leading up to my diagnosis? YES. Can I believe that it’s only been two years since my cancer diagnosis? NO. January 22, 2014. These years have felt like an eternity.
I started having random unexplained bruising that would go on for weeks not healing. My energy levels were depleting but I chalked that up to the busy life of a business owner. Instead of being able to jog my normal 3-4 miles with best friend Marissa Herdon, I could barely do 2 miles without breathing so heavy that I had to call it a day. I started noticing little red dots all over my legs and arms. I would later find out that those are called petechiae which is when there’s bleeding under the skin. My skin, face in particular, was a vibrant shade of alabaster. All of these symptoms got worse and more noticeable with time. I turned a blind eye on them. Finally I woke up on 1/20/2014 with a symptom that could not be ignored. It was a shooting pain down my right leg mainly at my thigh. I noticed I had a hard time getting out of bed and walking. Within just an hour or so I was doubled over and in tears. *Little known fact; I graduated from Radford University in VA with a dance degree so my body has been through the ringer and I have some strong legs. Past Michele could leg press 300 pounds!* However, I have never felt more intense pain than what I felt that day in my leg.
If you’ve followed my journey, you know where this goes. The leukemia had taken over 85% of my body. It is a miracle I am still here today. But I find myself sometimes wandering into the “What If?” land of make believe. What if I had gone to see a Dr. sooner, could things have been different? The physical I had done the September prior where I had failed to do the blood work at Quest Diagnostics like I was supposed to do; what if I had done it? Would I just have been anemic at that point and not had full blown cancer? Those damn what if’s. They’ll get you every time.
So mething I’ve been meaning to write about forever is how much I dislike unsolicited advice. Who’s with me?? I
can’t tell you how much of this I’ve gotten since my diagnosis. Mostly from people who have never had cancer, like they could ever understand what they’re talking about and from whom I didn’t want their mouths to open in the first place. I’ve heard it all from what I should eat to how much exercise I should be getting. I’m sure plenty of people know all about what I’m preaching right now. But if you will humor me for just a moment or two. I’d like to give you some said advice. If you like it, you can take it. If you don’t, you can send it right back. (Ron Burgundy) Our bodies truly are our temples. We should treat them as such. This can entail many things that are left to each persons own interpretation. All I will say is, at the very least, get a physical done every year. Don’t skip the blood test like I did! Women…check those boobies. Early prevention can save lives. Cancer takes too many too quickly. I know it feels like it can’t happen to you. It felt like that for me too until it did. That’s it. That wasn’t too painful now was it?
A while back I had broken the news about my mom being diagnosed with breast cancer. Shortly after her diagnosis, her doctor did the genetic testing to see if she had the gene marker BRCA2. Remember the Angelina Jolie story about how she had both breasts removed and reconstructive surgery? She had this marker. Unfortunately my mother tested positive which mean’t they had strong recommendations for other preventative treatments. Also, very unfortunately, this did not bode well for her offspring. Or as you’ve come to know that person…me.
Some people have expressed their concern with how she’s been doing so I would like to give that update now. She opted out of reconstructive surgery therefore she is missing her right boob. We had a small ceremony and played funeral music while chanting to the booby Gods afterward. Chemotherapy started in November with 8 weeks of aggressive treatments every other week. After that ended, there’s 12 weeks of less aggressive chemo treatments once a week. She should be done by the end of March. This is the third week of the less aggressive treatments. She’s mostly dealing with little to no energy, fatigue, and nausea. Since getting the diagnosis back in June everything has seemed to drag on forever. I keep having friends tell me they thought she was done with chemo months ago. NOPE. We only wish. Trust me. No one is sicker than us of being sick.
It’s been a while since I’ve told you about my present health which I feel is still such a question mark. I am still anemic which my oncologist has said is somewhat normal of leukemia patients. I’ve been battling head pain that’s managed with medication, an anti-psychotic at that, but we’re really hoping that drug’s not going to turn into long term use. The most recent and kind of scariest at the moment is that I just had to visit a Kidney Dr. because my creatinine levels have been progressively getting higher. I have to go in for more testing to hopefully get to the bottom of the issue. Two years later and leukemia is still doing damage.
I almost forgot. I was tested to see if I had the same gene that my mom had. If I did, there was an 85% chance of me getting breast cancer at some point in my life. Are you kidding me? I’m not even done fighting this cancer and I’m faced with these odds?! It’s seemed like our family has been cursed of late so in the weeks that I had to wait for the results, I waited with this thought “Expect the worst, hope for the best.” I even had a folder saved on my computer titled “Boobs I like.” Yes, that’s right. I’m not 62 like my mother. I would definitely opt for reconstructive surgery! Come to find out, the surgery is actually covered under health insurance whether you have breast cancer or have the gene and are doing a mastectomy as preventative. Way to go healthcare, you’re finally starting to do some things right. After weeks of waiting, the results were in. Negative. The best news I had gotten in close to two years! Thanks Dad.
I'm a makeup artist and cancer blogger. www.BeTheMatch.org saved my life. Before I got sick, I didn't even know the organization existed. After I got sick I found out there was no adult donor in the registry anywhere in the world that was a match for me (a riskier cord blood donation was my last chance). Please visit their website and join the registry for free to save a life like mine.

There have been a few larcenies in front of our house as of late, as items have been stolen out of ours vehicles. I am sorry to say that I didn't get the name of the neighbor who told me that her garage was recently broken into, as well. I have made reports with the precinct. They said to be vigilant, and that there is little that they can do (which I found disheartening).
If you have been a victim of theft, please report it so that there is a record with the precinct. (914) 377-7900
Also, I wonder if we have had a met with the new captain since he began a couple of months ago? (Captain Daniel Campanini)? Is it time to touch base with them as a community since larcenies are high right now?

It’s not enough to just share content through social channels – you need to actively participate in the community, too. Got a Twitter account? Then join in group discussions with relevant hashtags. Is your audience leaving comments on your Facebook posts? Answer questions and engage with your readers. Nothing turns people off quicker than using social media as a broadcast channel – use social media as it was intended and actually interact with your fans.
However I feel that batching all the things influencers share , filter whats relevant from whats not… and ultimately niche it down to identify which exact type of content is hot in order to build our own is a bit fuzzy. Influencers share SO MUCH content on a daily basis – how do you exactly identify the topic base you’ll use build great content that is guaranteed to be shared?
When diagnosing an issue, you need to think back to what was the last item that changed. It could be a code push that somehow removed analytics from your site, it could have been a change to content that has caused a decline in search traffic. Did you make a change to your advertising? Sudden declines (or increases) are often traceable back to the last modification (big or small) that was made. - Greg Kihlstrom, Yes& Agency
This is another program doing much the same as the previous two, but it has a few unique aspects that put it on this list above the hordes of others. Particularly, it comes in many forms; a web interface, a stand-alone browser, a windows or mac executable or even a paid version. In a fit of goodwill, the paid version – costing $30 for the cheapest version – comes with a huge warning to try the free version before buying. It also warns of a lack of refund policy, so buyer beware.
TrafficWave is, again, not quite a traffic exchange. Rather, it’s a valuable tool to use with the traffic you’ve already attained. It’s a fairly sophisticated autoresponder for email lists, with a 30-day trial and a suite of tools designed to help you put together the best autoresponses available. Use it in conjunction with any of your affiliate or referral programs for a sizable benefit.
So many businesses are focused on attracting new customers through content marketing that they forget about more traditional methods. Email marketing can be a powerful tool, and even a moderately successful email blast can result in a significant uptick in traffic. Just be careful not to bombard people with relentless emails about every single update in your business. Also, don’t overlook the power of word-of-mouth marketing, especially from people who are already enjoying your products or services. A friendly email reminder about a new service or product can help you boost your traffic, too.
Wow, it was interesting reading this post. To hear all the different opinions made me realize that there are so many opportunities to generate traffic. I have been using Twitter and SEO to promote my blog posts and it has worked well for me. After reading this, I will bookmark this page and study some of these other options carefully. Thanks for sharing
Servers are able to compile every request for a web page, arming its operator with the information needed to determine how popular the site is and which pages receive the most attention. When a web server processes a file request, it makes an entry in what is known as the “server log” on the server's hard drive. The log gathers entries across posterity, forming a valuable database of information that the site owner can analyze to better understand the website's visitor activity.
Google Analytics is an invaluable source of data on just about every conceivable aspect of your site, from your most popular pages to visitor demographics. Keep a close eye on your Analytics data, and use this information to inform your promotional and content strategies. Pay attention to what posts and pages are proving the most popular. Inspect visitor data to see how, where and when your site traffic is coming from.
For my Adsense plugin which you can get here https://wordpress.org/plugins/adsense-made-easy-best-simple-ad-inserter/ I’ve created a PRO version (https://www.seo101.net/adsense-made-easy-pro/) that is available to those that sign up for my mailing list. It’s not much but it gets me 5 to 6 subscibers a day. And best of all I know exactly what my subscribers are interested in… WordPress and Adsense:)
So many great tips! There are a couple of things I’ve implemented recently to try and boost traffic. One is to make a pdf version of my post that people can download. It’s a great way to build a list:) Another way is to make a podcast out of my post. I can then take a snippet of it and place it on my Facebook page as well as syndicate it. As far as video I’ve started to create a video with just a few key points from the post. The suggestion about going back to past articles is a tip I am definitely going to use especially since long-form content is so important. Thanks!

I really enjoyed your post, im building my own business from the ground up making custom furniture, lighting, and home decor. it took me a year to launch my website and now im trying to invite more traffic and ways for clients and interested parties to share my content and start buying my product. I liked the idea of Share triggers… im going to be incorporating that into my social media strategies. Any advice would go a long way. thanks again Brian
5. Distribute some freebies with your website logo on it like T-shirts and mugs. Organize free seminars in your local area; collaborate with important people there to increase the buzz. Or you may create some unique tool or a video and post it on Google for free, link your site with it. If your idea works off you may see a sudden burst of traffic coming your way.
High ranking metrics will result in getting your site on the top position of several charts such as Top Alexa sites, Top WOT sites and so more. People usually go through these lists to discover new sites and hence you will be getting referral traffic as well. Who knows? Some of those traffic may be your next big client or loyal reader of your blog.
I find it interesting that you talked about nutrition supplements for athletes. I am very close to launching such a product for enhancing aerobic exercise performance in women (ie. improved times in a 3 mile run).. The product contains no stimulants or exotic herbs. In fact three of the five ingredients are well known minerals, but in forms not found in most multi-vitamin-mineral supplements. The research behind the product comes from me. The credibility behind the research is that I am a professor of human nutrition with over 100 research papers. Now, the trick will be to use my connections and credibility in a business savvy way.
I feel I have great content…but most of it is within my email marketing campaign instead of my blogs. I’ve used my blogs to include links to my email marketing campaigns to lead to my product. In your opinion, should my blog content be the priority? I find my marketing emails sound more like a blog than just a “tip” or a reason to grab people to my list.
#6 Go on podcasts! In 13 years of SEO and digital marketing, I’ve never had as much bang for the buck. You go on for 20 minutes, get access to a new audience and great natural links on high dwell time sites (hosts do all the work!). Thanks for including this tip Brian, I still don’t think the SEO community has caught on to the benefits of podcast guesting campaigns for SEO and more…it’s changed my business for sure.
Brian, I recently found your blog by following OKDork.com. Just want to say you’re really amazing with the content you put out here. It’s so helpful, especially for someone like me who is just starting out. I’m currently writing posts for a blog I plan to launch later this year. I think my niche is a little too broad and I have to figure out how to narrow it down. I essentially want to write about my current journey of overcoming my fears to start accomplishing the dreams i have for blogging, business, and travel. In doing so, I will share the best tips, tools, and tactics I can find, as well as what worked, what didn’t and why.

Barlow - With only one sub, as opposed to the 12 that sat on the McCracken County bench on Sept. 17th, the Bombers put forth a concerted effort against the Mustangs; although, they would ultimately walk away from the contest with a 1-11 loss.
The first half was a bit brutal as the Mustangs scored 4 goals within the first 10 minutes of play. After struggling to keep possession of the ball, the Bombers scored a goal with 12 minutes left in the half via Senior Clayton Walker off of a PK from a MCHS handball in the box.
Junior midfielder Austin Walters took a shot on goal right before the end of the half, but was unable to secure the goal. The half ended at 1-9 with MCHS in the lead.
The second half saw no one scoring for eleven minutes. The Mustangs then lobbed in a ball, thereby adding yet another goal into their scoring account. Shortly thereafter, the Mustangs’ Noah Wilkens landed a goal via a corner kick, and the Mustangs took the win with a score of 1-11.
The Bombers took the field again on Thursday, Sept. 19th as they played Caldwell County on Senior Recognition Night. This time, the bench was more evenly matched, and the Bombers took the field with a strong 1 v 1 and passing strategy.
Senior Clayton Walker started the game in attacking mode with a “Game on” stance as he took a shot on goal just 5 minutes into the game; unfortunately, he was unable to sink the ball into the net. Senior Weston Gordon also had a strong shot on goal, but it missed its mark and hit the side bar.
Despite the Bombers cross passes that lead to players charging the goal, they were unable to score. Caldwell, however, was able to score 2 goals, bringing the score to 0-2 at the half.
The Tigers scored another goal within the first 6 minutes of play of the second half and then finished the half with another goal with just 2 minutes left to play. The final score had the Tigers taking the win with a final score of 0-4.

I am developing an android contacts based application.I have designed the views.I am in problem.When i click on plus button a edittext should appear in the same view
I think his problem is adding dynamic view to his current activity means when the user clicks on plus button, may be he want to add dynamic edit text to his activity. For example in the android contacts while adding new contact there is a plus button whenever we click on that edittext will be added dynamically there so that we can add more contact numbers of a person like mobile, home etc.

Good Night America was hosted by Geraldo Rivera from 1974 through 1977. The show gained notoriety for its excellent, and sometimes dangerous investigations. Hugh Hefner (Good Night America 4), Roy Scheider from Jaws (Good Night America 20), daredevil Evel Knievel (Good Night America 7) were just some of the interviews that had millions of americans tuning in. Bringing outlaw biker gang Hells Angels members on-set (Good Night America 11) was just the beginning. Despite purported threats of major fines, lawsuits and far worse, Geraldo was the first to air the original Zapruder film on Good Night America 15 in 1975. This footage was used in the investigations and to prove or disprove the conspiracy theories surrounding President John F. Kennedy's assasination. News programs in the format of Good Night America grew more and more rare as time went on.

John J. Nazarian and his team have provided services to family law and criminal defense attorneys throughout the United States and overseas. Much of Nazarian & Associates services are to private clients with personal issues and concerns that need to be addressed with utmost confidentiality. We have offices in California, New York and Florida and most of our staff are retired law enforcement, active duty law enforcement officers or career military officers.
In addition to Investigations, we also provide Security and Protection services for clients who need a physical presence for many different issues. Mr. Nazarian and his team are also highly respected for directing clients as to securing their homes, place of business, and their travel for personal appearances, vacations, and loved ones to and from work or school.
Nazarian & Associates, with our worldwide resources in the private sector, active law enforcement and the military, are willing to take on any assignment nationwide and internationally. We're available 24 hours a day and our information sources are the best in their field, anywhere.
We believe there are times when a nice "breeze" is far more impressive and effective than a stiff "gale." For those who are wondering, we don't handle "explosives" and we have no "felons" on our payroll. We do things the old-fashioned way: serious "gum-shoeing" and solid investigative techniques.
You can always be assured that your problem will be handled in a professional, peaceful and completely confidential manner. For example, our standard policy has always been that all files are incinerated or turned over to the attorney or client. We don't keep them so you don't have to worry about where those files might end up.
Nazarian & Associates' services are in such high demand that the agency has always been very selective -- unfortunately we are not for everyone.

It's a well known fact that it's not that easy to write cross-platform applications for both iPhone and Android, keeping performance of application in mind. Some of the pros includes rapid app development, easy for JS programmers and code reusage. For Android development, Titanium is one of the perfect choice, if you have already worked on it.
I would like to thank MobileAPPtelligence Team for their professional service. Kindly find below our testimonial about how we felt hiring MobileAPPtelligence as our Application Developer.
"We had signed MobileAPPtelligence for developing our Payroll ESS Mobile app and we are pleased to say that the decision was a great accomplishment. We were very impressed by the professionalism and the quality of the team that worked on our project. They not only came up with impressive Design and UI but the team also displayed a real understanding of our issues and came to the table with suggestions and ideas that are very striking. The team has excellent communication skills and a fast response and improvement time. This has led to a better overall product, and one that we are very confident in moving forward.
The final application version has been delivered to our full satisfaction. We are looking forward to extend the cooperation with MobileAPPtelligence in near future for our next app project and I would recommend MobileAPPtelligence to anybody looking for any App Development Services."
When we came up with the idea for Kurdistan Events, what we needed was company that could make our idea a reality. We looked at number of companies but MobileAPPelligence really stood out. When we approached them with the idea I really felt like they understood what we what to do with Kurdistan Events, we had the idea and they the technical know-how and development experience we needed. They exceeded our expectation. Within a month we had exactly what we were looking for a user friendly application that allows residents and visitors in Kurdistan to find out what's happening and events are taking place. II think the thing that really sets MobileAPPtelligence apart from other companies is there great level of support. Despite the time difference there was always someone available to help and advice us as we built our App. The designer was amazing. After talking to him, he was really able to design something that fit our vision for Kurdistan events. I would recommend MobileAPPtelligence because not only they deliver quickly, but they delivered quality.
MobileAPPtelligence recently completed a project successfully for Vertex Innovations. The project has a mobile app part on different platforms (Android, iOS, and Windows) and a web portal aspect. The solution is for schools, and MobileAPPtelligence delivered on time and on budget.
The technical team at MobileAPPtelligence is very good at what they do, they are very accomodating and take time to understand requirements properly before going on to development. We are on the verge of starting another project now, and I'm sure we will do several other project.
I am sameer sagar, director of Mushroom World. I had got a unique plan in my mind when i was looking for any android app developer to develop my game application. After discussed with many companies i found MobileAPPtelligence. I felt that these people are really able to understand my thoughts as same as it was in my mind. They do listen well but they give additional ideas too. The thing which i really appreciate about them designers and programmers that these people attends my call even at 3 o'clock at night too. Quality of designs is ultimate. Coordination of project manager, designer and programmer is really nice. They really try to deliver your project before given time period. In short I would say " Nice Team".

Last few years witness the entry of many e-commerce companies which made impressive profits. The evolution of e-commerce has given birth to
. It is basically the use of mobile device to buy articles, pay bills, redeem coupon etc. There are so many speculation associated with this emerging field. Amidst all speculations, it has managed to grab the attention of big players and occupy a prominent place in the industry. Eyeing the m-commerce market potential, big telecom companies are planning to introduce WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) - enabled smart phones.
Recently, the industry saw a swift shift of e-commerce to m-commerce thus scaling demand of mobile app development from online retailers and stores. Smartphone penetration into the market has propelled this shift. The popular e-retailers are registering 25 times more sales through smartphones in a single year. Secondly, the growing app mania among smartphone users has also boosts the growth of m-commerce. In the highly competitive retail market, price is the king. Developing and maintaining a retail app is easy and inexpensive than maintaining a website. Moreover, mobile app offers customized and better shopping experience compared to website.
According to a leading e-commerce company, the value of m-commerce transaction is expected to cross $3.2 trillion by 2017.
The m-commerce market is expected to reach $721 billion mark with more than 450 million users by 2017.
With more reliable content delivery via wireless devices, it is expected that mobile commerce will outshine e-commerce platform for digital commerce transactions. The whooping number of mobile user base opens up more opportunity in m-commerce field. It has huge potential to expand in both consumer as well as enterprise markets. A surge of more than 10x has been reported in annual m-commerce investment and it is expected to increase further. Big companies are even trying to bring in speech recognition software for mcommerce transaction. Speech recognition facility will ensure the safety and reliability of
Geo-fencing is one of the features of the software program that use the GPS of the mobile device to interact with the geographical boundaries. The mobile application development companies use the mobile operating system like iOS and Android to inform the application, when you come in and out of geo-fences. These devices have framework that helps in providing a location. With the help of this data, you can see the apps operating in and out of the specific cities. Navigation apps, which are dependent on GPS tracking, are much in demand in car rental and transportation business.

My breath literally stopped the day I stumbled upon Mrs. Olajumoke Adenowo’s Instagram page. For a moment, I wasn’t looking at the pictures anymore. My mind took a flight, I was thinking of what my mind could achieve if I allowed it to run as wild as possible and bring into reality of the pictures it would have gleaned from the world of imagination where everything is possible.
Anyway, back to this incredibly talented woman whose works are celebrated in Nigeria, Africa and the world.

« At a different location in Dealey Plaza, the evidence indicated that a bullet fragment did hit the street. James T. Tague, who got out of his car to watch the motorcade from a position between Commerce and Main Streets near the Triple Underpass, was hit on the cheek by an object during the shooting. Within a few minutes Tague reported this to Deputy Sheriff Eddy R. Walthers, who was examining the area to see if any bullets had struck the turf. Walthers immediately started to search where Tague had been standing and located a place on the south curb of Main Street where it appeared a bullet had hit the cement. According to Tague, "There was a mark quite obviously that was a bullet, and it was very fresh." In Tague's opinion, it was the second shot which caused the mark, since he thinks he heard the third shot after he was hit in the face. This incident appears to have been recorded in the contemporaneous report of Dallas Patrolman L. L. Hill, who radioed in around 12:40 p.m.: "I have one guy that was possibly hit by a richochet from the bullet off the concrete." Scientific examination of the mark on the south curb of Main Street by FBI experts disclosed metal smears which, "were spectrographically determined to be essentially lead with a trace of antimony." The mark on the curb could have originated from the lead core of a bullet but the absence of copper precluded "the possibility that the mark on the curbing section was made by an unmutilated military full metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet from Governor Connally's stretcher." »

« Mr. DULLES - Is there any way of correlating the time of the shot with the position of the car so as to know whether possibly the first shot was fired before the car was out from the tree and it might have hit a branch of the tree and be deflected so it didn't hit the car? If he had fired too soon. I guess it is impossible.
Mr. FRAZIER - As to whether or not a limb of the tree may have deflected one shot. However, I think it should be remembered that the frame 207 is just as he exits under the tree; from there to frame 225 to where the President shows a reaction is only a matter of 1 second. He is under the tree in frames 166 until frame 207, which is about 2 seconds. So somewhere in that 3-second interval there may have been a shot--which deflected from a limb or for some other reason and was never discovered.»
« Since the preponderance of the evidence indicated that three shots were fired, the Commission concluded that one shot probably missed the Presidential limousine and its occupants, and that the three shots were fired in a time period ranging from approximately 4.8 to in excess of 7 seconds.»

Well I am half tempted to get this Tshirt- I know I would never put it on my body- but it is too funny!! I discovered it on Cafe Press where I finally found a COOL Big Bro shirt for our son.
You and I both know that when we read a bio on an artist’s page, it was the artist writing in third person. It doesn’t fit me so I will tell you a little bit about my work and a little bit about me.
About my work…which IS me: I am one of the millions of people that feel one should do what they love. Each work that I make is an attempt to “write the book that I want to read.” I enjoy experimentation and discovery. I love texture and dimension. I think pattern and detail are fun. So each piece I make is an attempt to cram as many of those elements as I can into one space. Every work I create, even if it ends up in my trash can, is a joy to create and brought me lessons for future works. If there is anything I want you to see in my work, it is the happiness that goes into it because I genuinely want you to get that back for yourself. Nothing pleases me more than when I hear from someone after years of owning my work and they tell me that it still makes them happy. I am fairly certain that creating art that makes people happy is my purpose in life. I believe that the Whatever that is connecting us ALL (four legged and two legged, republican and democrat) is what gave me the dream and the passion for what I do.
About me: This is super sappy but all true. I could tell you that I work an extraordinary amount of hours but instead I will tell you the truth. I play all day and sometimes when I am in my studio “working” with my dogs sleeping under my tables, I forget about time and I marvel at the fact that I get paid to do this. I live with the man I married in 1985 and although back then I felt I could not possibly love him more, I do now. I am equally enamored with my two adult children who are also excellent artists. One is in music, one changes her mind a lot but recently she’s into pies. It has been a great privilege for me to guide them for 18 years and I will continue to cheerlead for them or any other kid ( currently limited to ages 0 through 100) who is following their dream. I believe that happiness is about embracing what you are and what you have, cellulite and all. Thank you SO much for reading.
2017 has been a year of wonderful triumphs as well as untimely challenges. A year of tragedies and heartache as well as good fortune and blessings. We more than often have to play the cards that life deals us. I truly hope that for all of you, my precious Kings and Princes will be dealt the very best hand 2018 bringing you a year of peace and good will as well as great fortune!
This year we would like to start the New Year with a little humor and tongue and cheek. Please enjoy a few of our favorite jokes.
“ I was banging this sexy lady on her kitchen table when we heard the front door open. She said, ‘It’s my husband! Quick, try the back door!’
I hope you are all doing well and enjoying life to its fullest! A weeks ago a very dear friend and loyal gentlemen caller agreed to allow me to interview him to share his unique perspective on why he has been a loyal Tokyo Butterfly patron for the past 5 years. He agreed to an interview on the condition of complete anonymity and respect for his privacy in which I gratefully agreed so during the interview I will refer to him as Richard X. Please enjoy this intimate and personal interview.
Richard – I first had the pleasure of your company in 2012 December 24th. I remember closing a very important contract with a client and wanting to celebrate with a beautiful Japanese woman. After scanning the web, I stumbled upon your fantastic site and was bowled over by your beauty and charms. So I made a date for an overnight dinner booking. You were actually my first Japanese escort experience so I consider myself quite fortunate.
Misa – I know you said you were impressed with my website but did I live up to your expectations when you met me in person? Please be honest:)
Richard – You were absolutely gorgeous and still are in ever so many ways. Not just your physical beauty but as a human being as well. I remember we hit it off right away and had great chemistry. I think we spent so much time in conversation that we lost track of time.
Misa – Such the gentleman and always a charmer! Well enough about me. Have you had any other experiences with escorts or courtesans in Japan?
Richard – As you know Misa, I am a bit of a collector perhaps the correct term is hobbyist. I love the company of beautiful intoxicating women. Although You and I have a wonderful arrangement and history of spending time together when I visit Tokyo or when you visit the East coast, you know in the past I have met most of the other butterflies on your roster and in many cases more than once with some of these delightful maidens. Outside of the Tokyo Butterfly consortium I have not really had the need or desire mainly due to pitfalls and disappointments that sometimes come with booking non-English speaking escorts.
Richard – Well, in a country like Japan there are many obstacles to booking the right girl for a date. I have visited many sites that don’t cater to foreign clients and if they do they seem all too suspicious. My main concern was having the woman in the photo that I wish to book a date with actually would end being the same woman arriving at my door or not. I know that bait and switch is a big thing in Japan as well as other countries so it’s really a buyer beware market. When I first found your web site, I was really impressed with the fact that you did not hide your face and your photos were very consistent with being the genuine article. I was also impressed with the honesty and openness of your site. You obviously went to great lengths to build a very entertaining and informative web site that I found myself visiting many times. Your English is excellent as well.
Richard – I think the biggest piece of advice would be to book ahead. I know personally that you and the girls get quite busy and I have missed opportunities in the past because I should have booked our date more in advance. I guess those are the cards we are dealt with sometimes. I also think its really important to thoroughly review your dates web site. Read her profile, bio and FAQ. Most importantly clarify rates and booking courses to avoid any misunderstandings.
Always ask for a clear photo that is published on her web site to be emailed to you so you know she’s the genuine article. Try to book a hotel that meets her standards and most importantly book enough time to enjoy yourself. There is nothing worse than a rushed GFE date so in order to avoid that I suggest a four-hour dinner date. You can build chemistry and have that true intimate girl friend experience. Lastly always be respectful and polite. Especially with Japanese providers. I find you get a much more quality experience in bed by not being insensitive to their needs as well. I find buying a small gift of appreciation is an excellent form of foreplay and personal lubricant –Oops sorry about that Misa!
Misa – That's ok, I know you have a naughty side:) Richard you have been really generous in sharing with me today. Is there anything you would like to add?
Richard – Yes, there is – Misa and her consortium of butterflies are absolutely top notch and worth your time and attention. I highly recommend any one of these beauties for your next visit in Tokyo. I am completely hooked!
I hoped you enjoyed this brief interview with a cherished patron of our services. If you would like to share your experiences of course anonymously and discreetly or perhaps write a review. Please let me know so we can make arrangements.
Mel Gordon’s reputation as the preeminent scholar of early 20th-century sex culture was established with Feral House’s publication of his landmark 2000 tomeVoluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin. That book has remained in print for fifteen years, seeing multiple revisions and expansions as well as a companion piece, 2006’s The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber, further exploring Berlin’s vintage nightlife via a biography of the notorious nude dancer. 2015 finds Feral House issuing the long-anticipated release of Voluptuous Panic’s sister volume in the form of Horizontal Collaboration: The Erotic World of Paris 1920 – 1946—a book that brims with titillating pleasures like an overfilled coupe of champagne.
The history of demimonde culture is largely an oral and ephemeral one, making Gordon’s undertaking in Horizontal Collaboration a more monumental one than it might seem at first glance. Relying on vintage guidebooks, photographs, pulp magazine articles, and personal diaries, Gordon weaves disparate scraps of material into a comprehensive narrative that reveals hidden aspects of Parisian culture. Though it’s tempting to imagine “European cabaret culture” as something monolithic, the book takes a great deal of care to differentiate the conditions under which Parisian sex culture developed from the ones that led to the unique character of Weimar Berlin’s sexual underground. France’s tolerant attitudes towards prostitution, sexual satire, and prolific heterosexual coupling created a far bubblier, celebratory atmosphere than the doom-haunted, paraphilic world of Berlin’s sex culture during the twenties and thirties. The imagery in the book underscores this luminous sexuality. In fact, Horizontal Collaboration may be 2015’s leggiest publication: scores of well-turned gams adorn its pages, topped by beckoning bosoms and flashing smiles. It’s a visual tribute to Jazz-Age beauty of the most inviting variety.
Nowhere is Gordon’s thorough research and contextualization displayed more vividly than in the chapter on gay and lesbian nightlife. The brief flowering of interwar gay nightlife in Paris left behind little concrete evidence and no cohesive narrative. Strong legal and cultural taboos against gay sex plus a relative absence of gay counter- cultural social links meant Gordon dug through police blotters, memoirs, and rare photographic documentation to create a the first full picture of the history of gay Paris. The resulting text illuminates the lives of otherwise anonymous faces. One especially vivid example is found in the person of a butch lesbian dubbed “Fat Claude” in a Brassaï snapshot. She is identified as Violette Morris, a gifted woman athlete who would ultimately cast her lot with the Nazis, working as a spy with the SS and revealing French state secrets. Her collaborationist activities would escalate to the torture of female Resistance members until she met her end in a hail of commando gunfire in 1944.
All of this leads up to Horizontal Collaboration’s provocative heart and the source of its title: a chapter detailing sex culture during the Nazi occupation of Paris between 1940 and 1944. Rather than characterize the occupying forces as rapist Huns (as was the fashion in the Allied mass media), the book offers evidence that Paris’ status as a beyond-the-borders playground for the German military resulted in economic well- being and open-minded treatment for a majority of participants in the Parisian sex industry. First-person accounts of the time are quoted in which it’s revealed that jazz, though banned in Germany, was permitted on Parisian stages, and Nazi officers and soldiers are characterized as model clients by the prostitutes who serviced them. This combination of tolerance for performed exotica and an attitude of courtesy towards sex workers belied the genocidal purges and Gestapo tortures taking place beneath the city’s glittering surface. A thirst for vengeance in the aftermath of the war led to theatrical public abuse of women who slept with Nazis, and would result in a new puritanism that forever altered the landscape of erotic life in Paris.
Beyond simply cataloging a period in time, Gordon’s approachable, witty prose brings the naughtiness of vintage Paris to life. The author approaches his material with refreshing directness and affection, allowing the facts he presents to exist without the stain of contemporary politics creeping into frame. There’s a humor to Gordon’s phrasing that complements the avalanche of risque imagery. On the nude revues at Les Folies Bergère:
“U.S. Army guidebooks in 1946 maintained that more than sixty million spectators had been “fleeced” ... since the Armistice. (There was no need to know French in order to follow the vapid stage dialogue. In fact, linguistic ignorance was thought to be a singular advantage.)”
In passages such as these, Gordon presents fact and flavor side-by-side, entertaining as he educates.
In terms of presentation, the book makes a lovely shelf-mate to Voluptuous Panic. Saturated, full-color imagery and glossy stock mean that Horizontal Collaboration begs to be picked up and experienced. The hundreds of rare photographs and illustrations could easily overwhelm the text, but the combination of Gordon’s skillful writing alongside intelligent layout choices ensure readability and flow of information. That having been said, the experience of reading Horizontal Collaboration evokes the sensory overload of Parisian nightlife: one’s eyes are spoiled for sensual choice no matter where they land.
In an environment where provocative imagery is increasingly detached from historical context on image-sharing sites and social media, Gordon’s painstaking work in tracking down and cataloging the stories behind the bounty of images included in Horizontal Collaboration is to be celebrated. A passion project by any definition, Horizontal Collaboration is the rare book that is both a scholarly achievement and a steamy delight.

The 60-year-old avant-goth great on the sounds and artists that have meant the most to her throughout the years, including Chaka Khan and Johnny Cash, traditional Greek ballads and horror-movie scores.
Diamanda Galás is the kind of singular artist who seems to escape category and time. Her music—usually a mix of voice, piano, and minimal electronics—is more closely aligned to blues and jazz than the classical music she’s often roped in with. And the subject matter of her work is most often dark: genocide, war, abuse, torture. A couple of her records reference the devil and hell and Satan. She once recorded a spoken-word incantation complete with burning witch sounds called “Let Us Praise the Masters of Slow Death.” And the one book she wrote is called The Shit of God.
This is because Galás doesn’t work in a vacuum. She sings about real-world evils, and you can tell she wants to find solutions: She was once arrested inside New York’s Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in 1989 as part of a demonstration opposing the Church’s stance on AIDS education and distributing condoms in public schools. She’s also an active collaborator, someone who seems to believe in community. She’s worked with avant-garde composers like Iannis Xenakis and John Zorn, but also with Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones, synthpop vets Erasure, and industrial pioneers Einstürzende Neubauten—and her voice has been used by at least one black metal band.
Galás is fond of covering other people’s music, too, and her selections give a hint at what’s inspired her peerless approach. You can hear a bunch of these interpretations in one place on 1992’s The Singer, where she offers her take on songs by blues greats like Willie Dixon, Screamin’ Jay Hawkins, and Blind Lemon Jefferson, as well as her twist on a spiritual called “Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?” Her version—a haunting exorcism of howls and wails—is a far cry from what I was taught in Catholic school.
As she gets ready to wrap up a live stint in New York City this weekend as part of the Red Bull Music Academy Festival, Galás delves into her musical past, five years at a time.
I grew up in the ’50s and ’60s in San Diego, right on the border, where a lot of people speak Spanish as well as English, and my parents were always playing Mexican and Greek music. I've often said that I am a Mexican-Greek artist, because the influence of Mexican culture is so gigantic there. And when you’re Greek, you're clearly not American. My father always said to me, “Don't go outside, because Americans are stupid, and the Greeks will steal your money.” I said, “Really, that’s nice! Thank you!”
The unfortunate thing is that my father associated singers with prostitution, because in those days, it was often connected. So if I started singing at home, he'd say, “No, no, no. I don’t want you to be a singer, but you can play piano.” That’s why I always laugh when people tell me about the limitations that Muslim women go through. I say, “Oh please, talk to the Greek women—they’ll tell you all about it.”
I did a lot of piano improvisation right from the beginning. My father would sing or play me something and say, “Now you play it.” And that's a great way to learn the instrument and to learn music. Just use your eyes and then play. He started me on Fats Waller, and I loved him because he would bring a certain joy and sarcasm to his music. So many of the piano players of that era who then went on to do bebop—like Jelly Roll Morton and Art Tatum—all studied Bach! You can hear it in the precision playing and the counterpoint. Unfortunately, they don't want to discuss that shit in the jazz world because there’s political imperatives associated with it, and that's when they just start writing bullshit that has nothing to do with the music. It’s a pity. But if you play the music, you hear the influence.
My first experience of classical music was learning it by ear. I wasn’t interested in reading music at all—I’ve never been interested in reading notes on paper. I hate it. I don't have any fascination with it. I played in my father’s band since I was 13, and he played a lot of New Orleans music and a lot of stuff that Sonny Rollins would have played in the ’60s. My father was also the director of a gospel choir that came to the house, and that's where I heard a lot of black spirituals for the first time. I would sometimes play piano with them, but I would also just hear them on the staircase, and I loved that music so much. It meant so much to me. It was the music that accompanied me through a lot of despair, and I would find myself alone playing it and feeling that I could handle anything as long as I had that music to sing.
I wasn’t singing yet, but some of my first vocal inspirations came from horror films. One was called Blood of Dracula, a ’50s underground B—if not C—film. It was set in an American girls’ school, and the science teacher took aside a girl who was exceptionally violent tempered and said something to her that I'll never forget: “Inside of you is more power than the atomic bomb! And I am going to be the one to show you this power! All these girls ganging up on you will have no power over you, and you can eat the men alive, too.” It was great! Very empowering. Feminism came from the science fiction mindset!
So this girl had a medallion and when she would do whatever her incantations were, she would turn into this full vampire. I was paralyzed by this film and the sounds that were used in it. They must have gotten some voices and mixed them with feral cat hisses. I’ve never forgotten the sound. It was so unusual. It hit me in the head and stayed there. I was afraid of my entire family that night.
A lot of the people I was playing piano with were playing the music of Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Sonny Rollins, and those saxophone players inspired me to start singing. Because the truth is there was really little place for the piano in Ornette or Ayler’s music. It was not used. The real star was the saxophone. And it’s not like me to want to play second fiddle to anyone. So I just said, “Well, you guys are trying to emulate the voice—check this out. Let’s take the voice to the highest place we can take it.”
And I also got into Chaka Khan. When I was living the criminal life in Oakland in the ’70s, I heard her all the time, along with Sylvester, the Stylistics, and the Isley Brothers. She was just sensational. Really an innovator—the timbre of her voice and her style and her improvisation was all unique.
James Brown and Tina Turner both danced in this really powerful way, and their voices go through the soil to the heavens. There’s no fucking around. The whole body’s involved in the movement at the same time. The flamenco tradition has that, too. The physical power was just extraordinary.
I came to New York in 1983, when I was 28. I had just started singing. I did this piece, “Wild Woman With Steak Knives,” and this man wrote, “Well, the next time we see her, I’m sure she’ll be singing Wagnerian opera.” And I thought, He's got my whole career mapped out, doesn't he? Give me a break! I'm sure he's been very terribly disappointed by the fact that I was also influenced by [experimental vocalists] Roy Hart and Alfred Wolfsohn, who was a medic in World World I and heard all these soldiers dying and brought those types of vocalizations into the theater. It wasn’t just chance that people like him were thinking these things—they were seeing them in these wars. Americans didn't see things like that. I heard that H.G. Wells once said to Orson Welles, “You're very good! You see so much, but you’re not a European. You’re an American. You never had to watch a bomb drop on your soil. You’re limited.” Orson Welles never got over that. But it’s true.
When I discovered Alice Cooper, I was totally amazed. I like those freaky guys. Everybody’s heard of the Doors, and Jim Morrison’s all right, but he’s not Arthur Brown. I remember telling John Paul Jones that one of my favorite artists was Arthur Brown, and he’d say, “Oh, come on.” I don't understand why that band hasn't gotten the notoriety it should have. I mean, he was what he was singing about it: “I am the voice of hell fire.” Bam!
I had this fucking asshole critiquing me the other day because my speaking voice is nothing like my singing voice. They were like, “You can tell how much vocal damage she has from her speaking voice.” You fucking moron! I just sang for you for a fucking hour, and you’re talking about my speaking voice? I only spoke once. This reviewer loves the idea of the artist destroying themselves, so he’s going to really push it now and say I’m a real witch. And I’m like, “If that's what you want, baby, run with it!” There’s just so much wishfulness, mythology, ancient witchcraft, and ideas about burning of women mixed up in Western civilization. When you hit a certain age, people think: Why do you have this power? There must be something unnatural about you! When you're young it seems like athletic ability, but if you’re older and you do it, it's just fucking wrong. Wrong!
The amanedes tradition comes from Western Anatolia. Some of us believe that “amanedes” is derived from the word “manna,” which means “mother” in Greek. Amanes also refers to the people that were forced out of Greece during the different genocides of the Greeks. The ones that weren't sent to the deserts to die had to come long distances from Turkey to Greece, as they were kicked out by the Turks. So they’d say, “I've come this far but I can’t go any further. Can I just find a young child to sing me amanedes so I can go to sleep?” So amanedes is kind of like a cry of despair. It’s a prayer, but to nobody in particular.
I combined the blues thing and the amanedes singing, absorbing the blues into my own background. It’s most recognizable when people sing the Quran or prayers of the Middle East, because the Greek people were from the part of land that they got deported from! The land of Egypt! They had been there for so many years, and the culture’s mixed in Turkey. There were so many different groups that combined and sang together.
There’s a Johnny Paycheck song that I love called “Pardon Me I Got Someone To Kill.” I like that whole cowboy tradition of howling at the moon. I prefer to hear these lonesome songs sung a capella, because then it’s a lot scarier than on O Brother, Where Art Thou or whatever. And I love Johnny Cash so much. There’s a funny video of him singing with Elvis, and he was taking the fucking piss out of Elvis. Elvis was a great singer, but I mean, Johnny Cash? Forget about it. That guy was ferocious.
I remember hearing “Is That All There Is” when I was very young and being astounded by it. But then, later on, I heard so many of her songs and I loved them. This is when I really discovered her—and suddenly understood a lot of love songs that I would have rejected in the past. Here she was writing and singing all these songs, and she lived a very tough traveling life. And then she became a diabetic, like Ella Fitzgerald. These hard lives on the road. Not complaining about it, just doing it. Grizzly, scary lives. But the songs are just great.
I love Peggy Lee and Jo Stafford and Doris Day because they stick to the verse and the chorus and the melody. They could improvise like a motherfucker, but they would sing the song clean as well. They are able, in fact, to hear the melody—which by today's standards is quite rare, because everyone’s singing all this melisma shit. That just bugs me. I’m like, “Baby, would you do me a favor? The next one, just sing it clean and straight. I actually want to hear what the composer was thinking about when he wrote the song. Do you mind?”
I played Mozart on the piano when I was a little girl, but I didn't have the heart for Mozart at the time. I don't know why. Massive stupidity, I suppose. I had heart for Beethoven then; I wanted to prove that I was a strong girl. But once I started singing Mozart, I discovered some of his operas for soprano and coloratura soprano that really were magnificent. When you start to sing Mozart, you have to be really strong, that's for sure.
Paquita la del Barrio is beloved by the women of Mexico and hated by all the men of Mexico—or they laugh with her because they know how great she is. She is always putting down the men and singing songs about how weak a man is and how he can't do anything. She’s like, “Everything is small with you”—teasing them right from the head to the toes.
I went back to Baja California and heard all of this Mexican music on the radio all the time, and it's just beautiful. When I was a little girl and we'd hear mariachi music all the time and it made me so happy. There's a joy in Mexican music that I don't see in a lot of other music. Just a joy.
NEW YORK CITY -- Approximately 40 women and a handful of men came together Wednesday to protest Donald Trump.
"You are either with Donald Trump or either with women," said one woman as she addressed the crowd gathered in the shadows of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.
After the now infamous bus video that emerged last Friday, in which the GOP presidential candidate's vulgarity and lack of respect for women was captured on camera, the nonprofit group National Organization for Women decided to organize a demonstration.
For Nancy Deschamps, who has marched on behalf of women's rights for decades, the thought of demonstrating this close to Election Day as a result of one candidate's words in describing women would have been unfathomable if the scenario was presented to her at the start of year.
While the demonstration attracted international media attention from Colombia as well as Japan, it also captured the attention of three men, all standing side-by-side with women chanting in support.
"I honestly didn't know this was going to be here to be honest. It's nice to see some men here. I think it would be great to see more men in the cause. I think more men should be speaking up against Donald Trump's comments," said one man in a suit who did not want his name revealed.
Meanwhile, Trump Tower did have a small number of supporters protesting Hillary Clinton, but it was the naked cowboy who garnered the most attention when he stopped for a brief visit during the lunch hour.

Having a great landscape design in Bethesda Durham NC can make or break your home’s curb appeal. But having a home with curb appeal doesn’t have to be the end game. For many homeowners, having a yard that looks picture worthy is more than a goal, it is a passion. However, for those who want the beautiful yard but possess minimal knowledge of how to achieve that look, it can be an intimidating challenge.
Fortunately, having a gorgeous yard does not require a degree in horticulture, but is does mean either doing a lot of homework or either bringing someone in to do the work for you. If you opt to do the work yourself and lean as you go, then having some helpful hints from pros both around the country, and especially in your region, can be a big help. To get you started, here are some landscaping tips from the pros.
Don’t just get stuck on a beautiful yard for a specific season. Think about what your yard will look like from January through December, then plant accordingly and think with yard maintenance in mind. With this thought, be sure to include a variety of shrubs and trees that will remain green all year long.
Many people really have a hard time dealing with their lawn. This is especially true if you live in a place that can be really icy cold in the winter. You may need expert lawn care services to help you maintain a healthy lawn especially if you do not have any idea how to go about it. With the lawn mowing in summer and spring, the tidying up in the fall, and the shoveling of snow in the winter, you'll be requiring lawn care year round, so make the necessary investment in the right lawn maintenance company.
However, you need to know who to hire and how to make sure you hire the right people to do the job. Here are some factors to consider to ensure you make the right choice.
First, always consider the reputation. The testimonials and reviews about it should be glowing. Customers should rave over its service. Not only do the customers sing its praises, but they also continue patronizing the business. This is a factor that you should not miss to look for when opting to hire a lawn care service provider.
Next, opt for a company that offers prompt and timely service. Not only does it respond to your contact and schedule you right away, but it also makes sure to get its staff over to your property on time. Workers show up when they say they would, and should anything untoward happen, you will be advised about it as soon as possible. 24/7 accessibility is also a huge advantage for a provider. With this, you can call the company at any hour and on any day.
Additionally, the work attitude of the workers should be commendable. The workers should be extremely protective of your property. Their efforts are also backed by an insurance policy of a considerable amount. A lawn care expert whom you can freely communicate to is a huge plus. You can articulate what you want and you can be certain that you are well-understood. You can also easily understand what you are being told.
Look for service providers who are detail-oriented and always make sure to clean up after themselves as this boils down to being professional in everything that they do. The company should do background checks and should take other measures to ensure that its employees are safe and upstanding members of society. Aside from this, the company should take care of its employees. This will not only absolve you of liability in case they get hurt on your property, but also make sure that they are protected, insurance-wise. Finding lawn care experts should not be that hard anymore when you know what factors to look for.
Wide open green spaces of the lawn are lovely to view, but includes a lot of physical labor to keep the trees, shrubs, and other horticultural aspects of the gardens healthy and upright. Lawns are among the most important parts of a property where individuals can spend some time by playing with their kids and pets or relaxing psychologically under the warmth of the sun during cold weathers. Therefore, for effective lawn care one needs to follow some lawn maintenance strategies including regular watering of plants and providing necessary nutrients needed for its healthy growth, also to improve the quality of the soil.
Most people aim to have a beautiful green lawn but do not know what techniques are involved to achieve this purpose. A lot of factors like heavy traffic, the stress of heat and drought, over grown grasses, entrance of unwanted exotic plants and compacted soil can cause many areas of the lawn to die out completely or create brown spots and weeds leading into an untidy and messy green field. Effective lawn renovation and installation is reserved to help in preserving the beauty of the lawn both for the residential and commercial purposes. With the use of tools like the lawn mowing machines it renovates the lawn and increases the value of the property.
Some lawn renovating techniques include aeration, verticutting and sod installation. Aeration is carried out by digging holes in the soil to pass the necessary oxygen and water to reach deep down into the soil and the roots of the plants. It improves the drainage and reduces the formation of puddles and also helps in preserving the compactness of the soil. Another useful method is slice seeding which is done by using a machine that accordingly slices and seeds the lawn, provides the channel for the infiltration of water, encourages healthy growth of the turf by cleaning the thatches and prepares the seed beds for the seeds to grow faster. Lawns basically include carpets of grasses that is sometimes less than perfect, sod installation are fastest and easiest ways of seed germination, usually 2 to 3 weeks, that can be done anytime when the soil is not in a frozen state. Sod can be installed on hilly areas and slopes for stabilization as well. They help in turning the bare patches of the ground into grass covered gardens and lawns and requires less maintenance costs.
Top dressing can also be done for installing the lawn and benefiting the surrounding environment as well. It is literally a super fertilizer that is raked into the ground to improve its quality without causing any type of soil erosion. It protects the grasses in the winter season and keeps the lawn thick and intact. Professional lawn renovation and installation services are provided by some landscaping companies across the world and many people hire them to avoid the unnecessary hazards of lawn and garden care. These companies are honest and deliver services within the budgets of the customers.
Properties will always look better and more appealing when they have a landscaped lawn. These include commercial and industrial properties. Although the owners of these types of properties may focus more on their building or infrastructure, which is their primary investment and source of income and profits, they will still benefit greatly if their lawn or outdoor space is beautifully landscaped and well-maintained.
Unfortunately, landscaping a lawn on a commercial or industrial property isn't as easy doing a residential one. In general, more time, money, and manpower would be required to have beautifully landscaped lawn on a commercial or industrial property.
To make sure that the outdoor space on your commercial or industrial property will be landscaped perfectly and to everyone's liking, it is important to avoid committing some usual landscaping mistakes. These top mistakes include the following:
1. Setting a budget for a static landscape. This is a top mistake that commercial and industrial property owners usually commit. Seasons change; as such, your landscape should, too. If the landscape beds are always the same, visitors and other people will lose their interest easily. In addition, a static landscape quickly looks irrelevant. Lawn care and improvement experts recommend commercial or industrial properties to have seasonal colors by planting annuals in beds, incorporating vibrant containers into the landscape, and cultivating perennials that are abundant when they bloom
2. Not considering your property's front door appeal. The front part of any property is the first impression builder. In commercial and industrial properties, it's what customers and clients see first. If the landscape beds located in the front of you property are overgrown and unattended to, visitors might wonder how you handle the rest of your business. It is therefore important to pay close attention to the entrance of your industrial property. The appearance of your property and overall brand will certainly be elevated if you have a professionally landscaped front entrance.
3. Overlooking the necessary amenities of employees. Finally, it is also essential to make sure your employees and visitors have a place where they can stay if they want to eat their lunch outdoors or step out for some fresh air. As such, also consider providing a patio or gathering space that offers shade and seating. You can also have walking paths installed that can lead to common areas or stand alone, punctuated with seating, to provide an outlet for your people to get out in nature. Aside from being additional appealing features, these employee amenities will also go a long way toward improving morale and creating a happy work environment.

The commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific has just completed a four-day visit of China. From the look of things, little was resolved. And that's not entirely the fault of the increasingly assertive Chinese. Admiral Timothy Keating did not take advantage of an important opportunity to set military ties on a firmer footing.
There is a clear need to do so. After Beijing denied a long-arranged Hong Kong port call to the Kitty Hawk on the day before last Thanksgiving, the carrier and its multi-ship strike group sailed back to its homeport in Japan through the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese immediately complained, expressing "grave concern." Keating to his credit asserted the long-held policy of the United States Navy. "We don't need China's permission to go through the Taiwan Straits. It's international water," he said last Tuesday in Beijing. "We will exercise our free right of passage whenever and wherever we choose."
There is, unfortunately, a need for such forthright statements because Beijing maintains ludicrous claims. In addition to the Taiwan Strait, the Chinese claim the entire South China Sea, creating border disputes with the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam and endangering long-held notions of free passage.
Beijing's navy and air force are not yet strong enough to enforce its expansive assertions, yet the Chinese are willing to engage in provocative acts nonetheless. The downing of an unarmed Navy reconnaissance plane in April 2001 in international airspace over the South China Sea was followed in September 2002 by aggressive maneuvering against the Bowditch, an unarmed Navy oceanographic vessel in international waters in the Yellow Sea. In October 2006, a Chinese submarine for the first time surfaced in the middle of an American strike group-the Kitty Hawk's, by the way-which can only be interpreted as a signal to the Navy to clear out of Asian waters. And before the rejection of the Kitty Hawk port call, Beijing refused refuge to two Navy minesweepers seeking to outrun a storm.
When the Kitty Hawk sailed home after the port call turndown in November, it appears a Chinese Song-class submarine closely tracked the carrier for 28 hours as it transited the Taiwan Strait. A Chinese surface ship was also involved in what some termed a confrontation. Keating denied the reports, carried widely in the Asian press, of any incident. Yet even if absolutely nothing happened this time, our admirals need to come to grips with China.
The Navy's reaction to increasingly aggressive Chinese conduct has, over the course of this decade, been uninspiring. After each incident it has either been silent or called for more dialogue with Beijing. Keating's recently concluded trip to China is a case in point.
At the time of the rejection of the Kitty Hawk, Keating said he was "perplexed." Yang Jiechi, the Chinese foreign minister, compounded the mystery a few days after the incident when he told President Bush that the turndown was the result of a "misunderstanding." A day later a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that the refusal of the port call was not a mistake after all.
Keating's trip, during which he met China's top military officer and the foreign minister himself, presented a golden opportunity to clear the air. Yet he Washington Post reported that during his visit Chinese officials did not give any reason for the rejection of the Kitty Hawk port call. Keating, when asked at a news briefing in Beijing whether Chinese officials had provided an explanation, had this to say: "We didn't spend a whole lot of time on why."
Make that no time at all. On Thursday in Hong Kong the admiral told the audience at an Asia Society breakfast that he did not ask his Chinese hosts for the reason for their turndown. Instead, Keating talked about future visits. "Our Chinese hosts didn't say no to the pending request. I'm hopeful, I'm optimistic, I bet that our request will be approved."
And I'll bet that failing to confront the issue will eventually be seen as a mistake. It's hard to imagine how the United States can build enduring ties with China for the future by ignoring the unfriendly conduct of the present.
The troubles between the American and Chinese militaries are not merely matters of miscommunication or transparency, as the Navy often characterizes them. The fundamental problem is that China and the United States have mutually incompatible aspirations in Asia. There will be friction between the two nations as long as the Chinese harbor expansionist ambitions-and as long as the United States fails to respond.
I just find it necessary today to make a statement about the fact that although I use a lot of neutrals (grey...I really like grey), I also enjoy color.
There is something so appealing about neutrals, like black and white photos, so much emotion can come through. I find it funny that the one favorite that I clicked on was the embroidered green apple martini ring, and in her profile she says..."Sometimes I love to use color and sometimes I love to not use color - I guess it depends on my mood."
It's all wonderful. Your photos and jewelry have a very distinctive look that I like to see when I visit here.
I think that you've got a great sense of color. You use it sparingly and delicately, but oh so well!
YOUR color palette, i love. It's what i actually wear and feel most comfortable in as far as on my person...
All in all, we made it through the storm really well, especially compared to some of the folks in New York and New Jersey - our hearts just go out to them.
I knew that the skylight needed to be replaced but I think this moves our timeframe up a bit. Not sure we can accomplish it before winter but something has to happen by spring at the latest. Unfortunately the whole thing may have to go and be replaced with a dormer of some sort. I will really miss all that natural light.
Me too - its was very tense waiting for the storm to come ashore. Thanks to those of you who commented or emailed!
Now I am just left feeling horrible for everybody north of us. NYC is not that far away and yet they are in such a different position now.
So glad to hear you are fine Genevieve. What a storm though. I loved that part of your emergency preparation was having beads ready. A woman after my own heart. Hugs, Wendy

THE RELIGIOUS MIND is entirely different from the mind that believes in religion. The religious mind is psychologically free from the culture of society; it is also free from any form of belief, any form of demand for experience or self-expression. And man - it seems to me - throughout the ages has created through belief, a concept, which is called God. To man, the belief in the concept called God has been necessary because he finds life a sorrowful affair, an affair of constant battles, conflict, misery - with an occasional spark of light, beauty, and joy.
Belief in a concept, in a formula, in an idea, has become necessary, because life has very little significance. The everyday routine, going to the office, the family, sex, the loneliness, the burden, the conflict of self-expression - all these have very little meaning; and there is always death at the end of it all; so man has to believe, as an imperative necessity.
According to the climate, to the intellectual capacity of the inventors of these ideas and formulas, the concept of the God, the Saviour, the Master, took shape, and man has always been trying to reach thereby a state of bliss, of truth, the reality of a state of mind that must never be disturbed. So he has posited an end and worked towards it. The authors of these ideas and concepts have laid down either a system or a path that must be followed in order to achieve that ultimate reality. And man has tortured his mind - through discipline, through control, through self-denial, through abstinence, austerity - inventing different ways of approach to that reality. In Asia, there are many ways leading to that reality (at least they are said to) depending on temperament and circumstances, and those paths are followed to that reality that cannot be measured by man, by thought. In the Occident, there is only one Saviour; through Him alone is to be found that ultimate something. All the systems of the East and of the West imply constant control, constant twisting of the mind to conform to a pattern laid down by the priest, by the sacred books, by all those unfortunate things which are of the very essence of violence. Their violence is not in the denying of the flesh but also in the denial of every form of desire, every form of beauty; in controlling and conforming to a certain pattern laid down.
They have had some kind of miracles - but miracles are of the easiest things to achieve, whether in the West or in the East. And they that achieve these miracles are anointed as saints; they have broken the record in that they have so completely conformed to the pattern, which is expressed in their daily life. They have very little humility, for humility cannot be shown outwardly - the putting on of a loincloth or a robe is not an indication of humility at all. Like any virtue, humility is from moment to moment, it cannot be calculated, established, and laid down as a pattern to be followed.
But man, throughout the ages, has done this; the originator, the original person who experienced something called reality, has laid down a system, a method, a way - and the rest of the world has followed. His disciples, through cunning propaganda, through cunning ways of capturing the mind of man, have established a search and dogmas, rituals. And man is caught in that. Any man - any man who wishes to find that which mind is always seeking - must go through some kind of twisting, some kind of suppression, some kind of torture, to come upon that ultimate beauty. And so, intellectually, one sees the absurdity of all this; intellectually, verbally, one sees the absurdity of having any belief at all; one sees the idiocy of any ideology. Intellectually, the mind may say it is nonsense, and discard it, but inwardly there is always, deep down, the seeking, beyond the rituals, beyond the dogmas, the beliefs, beyond the saviours, beyond all the systems which are so obviously the invention of man. One sees that his Saviour, his Gods, are inventions, and one can discard these comparatively easily - and modern man is doing so. (I don't know why one uses the word `modern' - man has existed much as he is now for generations upon generations. But the present day climate is such that he is denying totally the authority of priest, belief and dogma, at the very root concept; to him, God is dead, and he died very young.) And as there is neither God nor belief, there is no concept other than of the actual physical enjoyment, and physical satisfaction, and a developed society; man lives for the present, denying the whole of religious conception.
One begins by denying the outward gods, with their priests, of any organized religion - one must completely deny these because they have no value at all, they have bred wars, have separated men, whether the Jewish religion, the Hindu religion, or the Christian religion, or Islam - they have destroyed man, they have separated man, they have been one of the major causes of war, of violence; and seeing all this, one denies it, one puts it aside as something childish and immature. Intellectually one can do this very easily - living in this world, observing the exploiting methods of the churches, temples - who can but deny? But it is much more difficult to be free of belief and of seeking at the psychological level. We all want to find something that is untouched by man, untouched by cunning thought; something which is not contaminated by any social, intellectual or cultural society; something that cannot be destroyed by reason. We all seek it, deeply, for this life is a travail, a battle, a misery, a routine. One may have the capacity to express oneself verbally, or in painting, in sculpture, in music, but even that be- comes rather empty. Life, as it is now, is very empty and we try to fill it with music and literature, with amusement, with entertainment, with ideas, with knowledge; but when one goes into it a very little more deeply and widely, one discovers how empty one is, how shallow the whole of existence is - though one may have titles, possessions, capacities.
Life is empty, and realizing that, we want to fill it, we are seeking - seeking ways and means, not only to fill this emptiness but also to find something that is not to be measured by man. Some may take drugs, LSD, or another of the diverse forms of psychedelic drugs that give expansion of consciousness; and in that state one acquires or experiences certain states, because a certain sensitivity has been given to the brain. But these are chemical results. They are the results of extraneous outside agents. One takes drugs hopefully, then inwardly one has these experiences; as one has certain beliefs, so one experiences according to those beliefs; the processes are similar. Both produce an experience, yet man again gets lost in belief - in the drug of belief itself, or in the belief in the chemical drug. He is inevitably caught in his thoughts. And one sees through all that and discards it - that is, one is completely free of any belief. That does not mean that one becomes agnostic, that one becomes cynical or bitter. On the contrary, you see the nature of belief and why belief becomes so extraordinarily important; it is because we are afraid - basically that is the reason. Fear - not only in life, the daily grind, the fear of not becoming, of not achieving psychically, not becoming, not having power, position, prestige, fame - all this causes a great deal of fear, and one puts up with that fear - but also because of this inward fear, belief has become so important. Faced with the complete emptiness of life one still holds on to belief - though one may discard the outward authority of belief, the belief in, vented by the priest throughout the world - one creates for oneself one's own belief, in order to find and to come upon that extraordinary thing for which man has been searching, searching, searching.
And so one seeks. The nature, the structure of search, is very clear. Why does one seek at all? It is essentially self-interest - enlightened self-interest, but it is still self-interest. For one says: `Life is so tawdry, empty, dull, stupid, there must be something more, I will go to that temple, to that church, to that...' And then one discards all that, and one begins to seek deeply. But seeking, in any form, becomes, psychologically, a hindrance. I think that must be understood very simply and clearly. One may objectively discard the authority of any outward agency that claims to lead to the ultimate truth, and that one does. But to discard because one understands the nature of searching, to discard all seekings, is necessary - because, one asks - what is one seeking? If you examine what it is we are groping after, what it is that we want, is there not the implication of seeking something that you already know, that you have already lost, and you are trying to get at it? That is one of the implications of seeking. In seeking, there is involved the process of recognition - that is to say, when you find it, whatever it is, you must be able to recognize it - otherwise seeking has no meaning. Do, please, follow this. One seeks something, hoping to find and on finding it, to recognize it; but recognition is the action of memory; therefore there is the implication that you have already known it, that you have already had a glimpse; or as you are so heavily conditioned by the intense propaganda of all the organized religions, you mesmerize yourself into that state. So when you are seeking, you already have a concept, an idea of what you are seeking; and when you find it, it means that you already know it, otherwise you can't recognize it; for this reason it is not true at all. Therefore one needs to find that state of mind that is really free from all search, from all belief - without becoming cynical, without stagnating. For we tend to think that if we do not seek, strive, struggle, grope after - endlessly - we shall wither away. And I don't know why we should not wither away - as though we are not withering away now. One does wither away, as one dies, as one grows older, the physical organism comes to an end. One's life is the process of withering, because in it, in daily life, we imitate, copy, follow, obey, conform, which are forms of withering. So a mind that is no longer caught in any form of belief, not caught in self-created belief, not seeking, not seeking anything - though it may be a little more arduous - is tremendously alive. Truth is something which is only from moment to moment, like virtue, like beauty, it is something which has no continuity. That which has continuity is the product of time, and time is thought; and time being sorrow, time...
Seeing what man has done to himself, how he has tortured himself, brutalized himself - becoming nationalistic, getting lost in some form of entertainment, whether it is literature, or this or that - seeing all this pattern of his life, one asks oneself, must one go through all this? Do you understand the question? Must a human being go through all this process, step by step - discarding belief, (if you are at all alert) discarding any form of search, discarding the torturing of the mind, discarding indulgence - seeing what man has done to himself in order to find what he calls reality, one asks (please ask yourself and not me) one asks, is there a way, or is there a state of explosion, that discards it all at one breath - because time is not the way.
Search implies time, the eventual finding - taking perhaps ten years - more; or the eventual finding through reincarnation, as the whole of Asia believes. All this implies time - the gradual throwing away of these conflicts, these problems, becoming more wise, more cunning, getting to know slowly - slowly, gradually unconditioning the mind. Time implies that. Obviously time is not the way, nor belief, nor the artificial disciplines imposed by a system, by a guru, by a teacher, by a philosopher, by a priest - all that is so childish. So, is it possible not to go through all this at all and yet come upon that extraordinary thing? - because that thing cannot be invited. Please do understand this very simple fact; it cannot be invited, it cannot be sought after; because the mind is too stupid, too small, our emotions are too shoddy, our ways of life are too confused for that enormity, for that immense something to be invited into that little house, into a petty though tidy room. One cannot invite it - to invite it, you must know it, and you cannot know it (it does not matter who says it) because the moment you say `I know', you don't know. The moment you say you have found it, you have not found it. If you say you have experienced it, you have never experienced it. Those are all cunning ways of exploiting another man - the other man, your friend or your enemy.
Seeing all this - not formally, but in daily life, in your daily activities, when you pick up the pen, when you talk, when you go out for a drive or when you are walking alone in the woods - seeing all this at one glance - you don't have to read volumes to find it out - seeing all this with one breath, with one look, you can understand the whole thing. And you can only really understand this as a whole when you know yourself; know yourself as you are, very simply, as the result of the whole of mankind, whether you are a Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian, or whatever you are. There it is, when you know yourself as you are, then you understand the whole structure of man's endeavour, his deceptions, his hypocrisies, his brutality, his search.
And, one asks, is it possible to come upon this thing without inviting, without waiting, without seeking, exploring? - for that just to be, just for it to happen, like a cool breeze that comes when you leave the window open - you cannot invite that breeze, but you must leave the window open. This does not mean that we are in a state of waiting - that is another form of deception - it does not mean that one must open oneself to receive - that again is another way of thought.
But if one has asked oneself without seeking, without believing, then, in that very asking is the finding. But we do not ask. We want to be told, we want to have everything corroborated, affirmed; fundamentally, deep down, we are never free from every form of outward or inward authority. That is one of the most curious things in the structure of our psyche; we all want to be told; we are the result of what we have been told. What we have been told is the propaganda of thousands of years. There is the authority of the ancient book, of the present leader, or of the speaker. But if really deep down one denies all authority, it means one has no fears. To have no fear is to look at fear, for as with pleasure, we never come directly into contact with fear - we never actually come into contact with fear as you come in contact when touching a door, a hand, a face, a tree; we only come into contact with fear through the image of fear which we have created for ourselves. We only know pleasure through half-pleasures. We are never directly in contact with anything I do not know if you have observed when you touch a tree - as you do when you are walking in the woods - if you are really touching the tree? Or is there a screen between you and the tree, although you are touching it? In the same way, in order to come directly into contact with fear there must be no image, which means actually having no memory of yesterday's fear. Then only do you come into actual contact with the actual fear of today. Then, if there is no memory of the fear of yesterday, you have the energy to meet the immediate fear; and you have to have a tremendous energy to meet the present. We dissipate this vital energy - which all of us have - through this image, through this formula through this authority; and it is the same in the seeking pleasure. The pursuit of pleasure is to us very important the greatest pleasure of all is God - supposed to be - and that may be the most frightening thing you could ever know - but we have imagined it, the ultimate, so we never come upon it. Again, it is as when you have already recognized a pleasure as a pleasure of yesterday, you are really never in contact with actual experience, with an actual state. It is always the memory of yesterday that covers and screens the present.
So, seeing all this, is it possible not to do a thing, not strive, not seek - to be totally negative, totally empty, without any action? - because all action is the result of ideation. If you had observed yourself acting, you will have seen that it takes place because of a previous idea, a previous concept, a previous memory. There is a division between the idea and the action - an interval however small, however minute - because of that division there is conflict. Can the mind be so completely quiet, neither thinking, nor afraid and therefore extraordinarily alive, intense?
You know the word `passion; that word so often signifies suffering; the Christians have used that word to symbolize certain forms of suffering. We are not using that word `passion' in that sense at all. In this complete state of negation is the highest form of passion; that passion implies total self-abandonment. For such complete self-abandonment there must be tremendous austerity; austerity that is not the harshness of the priest agonizing people, of saints who have tortured themselves, who have become austere because they have brutalized their mind. Austerity is really an extraordinary simplicity; not in clothes, not in food - but inwardly. This austerity, this passion, is the highest form of total negation. And then perhaps if you are lucky - (if you are lucky!) - there is no luck there - the thing comes uninvited. Then the mind is no longer capable of striving. Then you do what you will, because then there will be love.
Without this religious mind a true society cannot be created. We must create a new society in which this terrible activity of self-interest has very little place. It is only with such a religious mind that there can be peace, outwardly as well as inwardly.
Krishnamurti: What do we mean by expression, and what are we expressing? I know there is an idea that one must express oneself; and self-expression has become extraordinarily important. But what are we expressing, some capacities? If you are a painter you express yourself on a canvas, and the owner of the gallery exploits you. Or if you have certain capacity with a pen, you write a book. What are we expressing? - the same old patterns of yesterday: that is all we have; routine in different ways - so what is the need to express? I am not saying one should not, or one should - but what is implied in self-expression; what is implied when one uses the word `self-expression,?
The self is always the past, it is nothing new; you may express it very cleverly in a new way, using new words, a new technique, a new jargon - but it is essentially the same thing. So that is one side. Then, when you say, `I must give expression to myself', what is the thing you are expressing? - what is the self which is constantly demanding to be expressed, sexually or in books? Obviously the `self' is a bundle of memories - unfortunately it is nothing other then that. And in self expression, there is pleasure, so that when we talk about self expression we mean the pleasure of the self, which is the memory, which is a dead thing. But is there an expression which is not self seeking, which is not of the self at all? - the self being (we know what it is) memories, accumulated experience, pleasure - then expression may be entirely different.
Krishnamurti: `Expression without a motive' - most people pretend that expression is without motive, and are at the same time cunning enough to realize that expression without motive is a rather questionable thing. But we are asking something entirely different. Is there an expression without the self-activity which expresses itself And what is there to be expressed? When you love, you don't talk of self-expression. But if love is tinged with desire, pleasure, then you want it expressed, sexually or in books; it needs to be expressed. But if there is no self-centred activity in expression then it may not express at all - you will live and living itself is expression.
Here in the United States, we face momentous, and as yet unclear, changes in the delivery of health care. Approximately 46 million Americans lack any health insurance at this time, and tens of millions of others have grossly inadequate health insurance. Therefore, many millions of Americans are just one major illness away from a financial catastrophe.
In addition to the huge dilemma of how we go about making health care more efficient and more affordable for everyone, the United States, like most countries around the world, is in the midst of a dramatic shift in the average age of its population. As the graying of America continues (not to mention the ongoing epidemic of obesity across all age ranges, as well), the growing need for high quality, comprehensive health care will continue to present major challenges to our health care system here, and in many other countries around the world.
When I graduated from medical school in 1988, health care experts were predicting a huge surplus of physicians in this country, and in response to this concern, medical schools around the United States began cutting back their class sizes, and a de facto moratorium on opening new medical schools was initiated. Fast forward to 2010, and it has since become apparent that these dire predictions of an impending physician glut were absolutely incorrect. As our population grows older, and more diverse, the demand for physicians is increasingly in danger of outstripping the projected supply of doctors, including surgeons.
Aging patients have a higher incidence of illnesses and injuries that require the expertise of surgeons, and general surgeons in particular. Broadly trained and experienced general surgeons are the primary care doctors, and the workhorses, of the surgical world, and they manage an astonishing array of diseases and injuries. Unfortunately, and for a variety of reasons, comprehensive general surgeons are slowly withering in numbers, while the demand for their skills only continues to increase. Generational attitude shifts among recently graduating physicians have seen young new doctors gravitate towards less demanding “boutique” specialties, and away from the more challenging surgical specialties (like general surgery). Even among those young doctors who still elect to pursue residency training in general surgery, more than two-thirds will go on to train and practice in more restricted subspecialty surgery areas. (Disclaimer: As a surgical oncologist, I am one of those subspecialty surgeons. However, I still include a great deal of general surgery care in my practice, and I continue to take general surgery call in our medical center.) Another factor that discourages potential general surgeons is the enormous debt load that most newly minted doctors graduate from medical school with, and the resultant pressure that they feel to train in specialties that do not require the additional 5 to 10 years of training that general surgeons must complete. (Increasingly, new medical school graduates are, instead, seeking out specialties that are more financially lucrative, and require shorter durations of residency training, than general surgery.)
Yet another adverse factor that has harmed the recruitment of new general surgeons is the ongoing and progressive fragmentation of traditional general surgery practice into other subspecialty domains. For young doctors who are attracted to the diverse and clinically challenging sort of surgical practice that has historically made general surgery a highly desirable profession, the increasing practice restrictions imposed upon general surgeons have removed a major incentive to undergo the many years of training necessary to become a comprehensive general surgeon
Against the backdrop of these and other pressures that continue to dwindle the ranks of broadly trained and practicing general surgeons (as well as other critical core surgical specialists), the issue of surgeon burnout has only recently started to receive its due attention. The comprehensive practice of general surgery, and other demanding surgical specialties, can be grueling and exhausting, particularly in the private practice setting where declining reimbursements compel surgeons to work ever longer hours to maintain their income and lifestyle. (Future threatened cuts in reimbursements to surgeons will likely only further exacerbate surgeon workload problems, and eventual surgeon shortages, as new health care reform initiatives begin to roll out in the coming years.)
A newly published research study, which appears in the current issue of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, reveals a very disturbing picture of burnout, exhaustion, and depression among surgeons, and the potentially adverse consequences of distressed surgeons on patient outcomes.
In this study, nearly 8,000 surgeon members of the American College of Surgeons responded to a detailed survey, which included self-assessments of their practice details, a validated depression screening tool, and validated assessments of both burnout and overall quality of life. The results of these surgeon surveys were, in a word, depressing.
Among the surgeons who reported working less than 60 hours per week, 30 percent described themselves as burned-out with their profession. Among surgeons who worked 60 to 80 hours per week, 44 percent felt burned-out, and among those surgeons who put more than 80 hours per week, 50 percent experienced significant feelings of burnout. In addition to the number of hours spent in clinical practice per week, the number of nights spent performing overnight surgery call was a highly significant predictor of surgeon burnout. These two surgeon workload factors were also highly statistically significantly linked to clinical depression, difficulties in finding a reasonable home-work balance, and increased conflicts at both home and at work. Additionally, the rates of both personal emotional exhaustion and feelings of depersonalization towards patients were directly associated with working more than 80 hours per week, and with performing 2 or more night calls per week.
Excessive hours spent in clinical practice, as well as performing 2 or more overnight calls per week, also correlated with a significant increase in the number of self-reported medical and surgical errors committed by exhausted and burned-out surgeons. Nearly 11 percent of surgeons who worked more than 80 hours per week admitted to committing medical or surgical errors, compared to about 7 percent of surgeons who worked less than 60 hours per week.
Surgeons who either worked more than 80 hours per week, or who took more than 2 night calls per week, were also significantly more likely to express regret regarding their choice of specialty, and more likely to indicate that they would not choose to become surgeons if they had an opportunity to choose their specialty all over again.
The results of this survey of surgeons across the United States have been generally confirmed by other similar studies, recently. These disturbing findings, as reported by surgeons themselves, paints a picture of a large population of highly essential physician specialists who are, increasingly, feeling burned-out, depressed, emotionally exhausted, regretful of their career choices, and progressively more prone to both depersonalizing their relationships with their patients and to committing more medical and surgical errors. In short, my chosen profession appears to be a profession that is, frankly, approaching a state of crisis.
Because of these enormous (and growing) pressures and stresses that are being experienced by many surgeons, including general surgeons, many public health experts are viewing the current and future surgical workforce with considerable consternation. As more and more surgeons hang up their white coats and put away their scalpels early in their careers, and as more and more newly graduated doctors shy away from the more demanding surgical specialties, our country appears to be headed for a potentially catastrophic mismatch between the demands of an aging population for surgical care and the diminishing pool of physicians who are willing to shoulder the heavy responsibilities, and significant stresses, of surgical practice.
It is my hope that the governmental agencies responsible for implementing current and future health reforms will pay close attention to this study, and others like it. If hard-working surgeons cannot sustain reasonable income levels (against the decades of grueling training required, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in educational loans that most young doctors acquire) without working themselves into a state of exhaustion, burnout, and divorce, the ranks of general surgeons, and other core surgical specialists, will continue to become thinner and thinner. Ultimately, if things do not change, and soon, you and I might find it difficult to obtain access to high quality surgical care, particularly for emergency illnesses and injuries….

Gum disease, also known as gingivitis, or periodontal disease, has been closely linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Now, a newly published study from the renowned Karolinksa Institute in Sweden suggests that the risk of developing breast cancer may also be increased by chronic gum disease. The results of this clinical research study appear in the current issue of Breast Cancer Research & Treatment.
In this prospective clinical research study, 3,273 women between the ages of 30 and 40 years were evaluated between 1985 and 2001. Young women in this study who had documented chronic gum disease, or who had lost one or more molars due to gum disease, were more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer when compared to women without periodontal disease (even after adjusting for known breast cancer risk factors in these young, healthy women).
Previous research has linked periodontal gum disease with an increased risk of other cancers, including cancers of the uterus, colon, rectum, prostate and pancreas. However, up until now, there has been hardly any available research data linking gingivitis, or tooth loss due to periodontal disease, to breast cancer.
The exact mechanism whereby chronic gum disease increases cancer risk is unknown at this time. (Some experts have proposed that bacteria from chronically inflamed gums may enter into the bloodstream, and induce an inflammatory response that, in turn, causes cancer formation.) Irrespective of the true mechanism, however, certain cancers appear to be more common in people with chronic gum disease, even after adjusting for other known cancer risk factors.
If you experience red, swollen, sore, or bleeding gums, or premature tooth loss (or if your gums are retracting away from your teeth), then you may have periodontal disease (gingivitis). Based upon recent research findings, this condition may not only increase your risk of heart disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke, and diabetes, but also cancer as well. (Recent research has also linked periodontal disease in pregnant women with an increased risk of premature birth of their babies.) If you notice any of these signs of periodontal disease, then please make an appointment to see your dentist for a complete check-up.

The rising incidence of breast cancer, year-after-year, over the past 50 years in the United States (and in many other industrialized countries) has been attributed to a variety of factors, including environmental contaminants, rising obesity levels, and increased compliance with annual screening mammograms, among others. However, one factor that has been given inadequate attention, in my view, is that of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), despite nearly a century of data showing a strong linkage between lifetime exposure to the female hormones estrogen and progesterone and the risk of developing breast cancer.
In 2002, the enormous, randomized, prospective, blinded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study published its preliminary results, and prematurely terminated its combination HRT study because of an alarming increase in the incidence of breast cancer in the group of women who had been secretly randomized to receive combination HRT medications for menopausal symptoms.
Despite subsequent updates from the WHI, which have shown, essentially, a doubling of breast cancer risk after more than 5 years of HRT use, there was initially a great deal of resistance to the WHI’s findings (and the findings of other similar clinical research trials) linking HRT use with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
Now, a new national Canadian public health study offers additional powerful clinical research data linking HRT use with breast cancer risk, and reveals the equally strong link between declining HRT use and the declining breast cancer incidence in Canada. This study appears in the current issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
In this study, 1,200 women between the ages of 50 and 69 participated in the National Population Health Survey between 1996 and 2006. Just prior to the 2002 release of the WHI study’s results, 13 percent of these women regularly used combination HRT. By December 2004, only 5 percent of the postmenopausal women participating in this study were still taking HRT medications. During this same period, the incidence of breast cancer in this large group of Canadian women decreased by about 10 percent. (Importantly, compliances rates with screening mammograms did not change during the course of this clinical research study.)
Thus, between 2002 and 2004, when HRT use significantly declined, the incidence of breast cancer decreased by about 10 percent in Canada. Moreover, this significant decrease in breast cancer incidence occurred without any change in mammogram rates.
This study, as with other recent studies, adds to the overwhelming research data linking HRT use with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. As I tell my own patients who are approaching menopause, it is best to avoid HRT altogether. If you are already taking HRT medications, then ask your doctor to help you in weaning yourself off of these medications.
In recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I urge our tens of thousands of regular Weekly Health Update readers to join in the global fight against breast cancer. There are numerous organizations and groups, in virtually every community, that are sponsoring fundraising activities throughout October, including the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Another opportunity to participate (and at no cost!) is to vote for the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation Army of Women project in the Pepsi Refresh competition! There are also many other worthwhile and deserving fundraising programs available for everyone to become involved in!

Both patients and their physicians were stunned last year when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine annual screening mammograms in women between the age of40 and 49 years (as has been the standard recommendation in the United States, and in most countries around the world, for many years). The USPSTF’s recommendations quickly set off a firestorm of debate regarding the calculations and public health considerations used by the USPSTF to arrive at this surprising recommendation. Since the USPSTF released its recommendations in the fall of 2009, most breast cancer specialists and breast cancer advocacy groups have continued to recommend that women who are at average risk of developing breast cancer begin routine annual screening mammograms at age 40.
As I extensively discuss in my new book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race, there is ample available clinical research data showing that screening mammograms detect breast cancer at an earlier stage than other commonly available screening methods, and that survival is improved in women in whom breast cancer is first detected by a mammogram (as opposed to the detection of a palpable or visible breast mass).
Now, a newly published large-scale public health study from Sweden, which appears in the current issue of the journal Cancer, offers further important evidence that the routine use of annual screening mammograms among women between 40 and 49 years of age significantly reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer.
In this enormous study, women between the ages of 40 and 49 years were separated into two groups, depending upon whether or not they underwent annual screening mammograms between 1986 and 2005 (the average duration of patient follow-up in this study was a very impressive 16 years). In this very powerful research study, young women who underwent annual mammograms accounted for 7.3 million “person-years” of observation, while the young women who did not undergo mammograms accounted for a similarly astonishing 8.8 million “person-years” of observation within this landmark public health study.
When the number of breast cancer deaths were assessed in both of these huge groups of young women, the women who underwent routine annual mammograms were found to be 29 percent less likely to die of breast cancer when compared to the young women who did not undergo annual mammograms! (In public health terms, this 29 percent observed reduction in the death rate due to breast cancer is highly clinically significant!)
This public health study, which encompassed the entire country of Sweden, is the largest mammography study of its kind, and its findings are both powerful and persuasive in defense of beginning routine annual screening mammograms at the age of 40 in women who are at average risk of developing breast cancer. It is my hope that the dramatic findings of this huge clinical study will now lay to rest any lingering doubts regarding the effectiveness of screening mammograms, beginning at 40 years of age, in reducing the risk of death due to breast cancer.
For an evidence-based discussion of the critical importance of breast cancer screening, including mammograms, in a cancer prevention lifestyle, order your copy of my new landmark book, “A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race,” from Amazon or Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, Vroman’s Bookstore, and other fine bookstores!

Among all of the vitamins, only Vitamin D appears to have clinically significant health benefits in reducing the risk of death associated with cardiovascular disease, fractures, and cancer, based upon numerous recent clinical research study findings (for a comprehensive update on the role of Vitamin D as part of a cancer prevention lifestyle, please see my new book, A Cancer Prevention Guide for the Human Race, which is now available from Amazon and Barnes & Noble).
A newly-published clinical research study, which appears in the current issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, prospectively evaluated 1,194 elderly men (average age was 71 years) over a period of nearly 13 years. Blood levels of Vitamin D were measured in these elderly male men, and the results of these blood tests were then correlated with subsequent health outcomes.
In this prospective public health study, with extensive long-term follow-up, very low and very high blood levels of Vitamin D were associated with a significantly increased risk of death. In fact, a whopping 50 percent increase in the risk of death was associated with both very low (<46 nmol/L) and very high (>98 nmol/L) concentrations of Vitamin D in the blood. Death due to cancer was two times more common with very low Vitamin D levels, while very high levels of Vitamin D increased the risk of death due to cancer by almost three-fold. At the same time, death due to cardiovascular disease was nearly twice as likely in elderly men with very low Vitamin D levels, but not in men with very high levels of this hormone-like vitamin.
The findings of this prospective public health study add to the enormous volume of previously published clinical research data on the health effects of Vitamin D. As this study suggests, there may be an optimal concentration of Vitamin D in the blood that is associated with a decreased risk of death from both cardiovascular disease and cancer. Meanwhile, a healthy diet that emphasizes fresh fruits, brightly-colored fresh vegetables, whole grains, and fatty fish (and minimal red meat and other animal-based foods) is your best bet for a long and healthy life!

The event that officially kicks off the new season will be on Saturday, and I plan on being there as early as possible. Unfortunately, I only received one autograph voucher (Howie Kendrick during Session 2), but I figure that just gives me more time to roam around an enjoy the sights. This year FanFest will be held within Dodger Stadium, so we have the added bonus of spending the day in our second home. Jon Weisman at Dodger Insider points to a very helpful guide to Saturday's festivities, here. Below is the map.
Go here for more information about FanFest. All autograph vouchers are sold out, but VIP Experiences remain available online (they are pricey). Go here to check that out.
BTW, parking is FREE and there is no admittance fee. FanFest starts at 10:00 AM and closes at 4:00 PM. I am unsure when the parking gates open.

Thank god I am oblivious to the opinions of others while caught in the blinding splendor of my own cleverness.
By any chance are they the cartoons drawn by the guy who got fired yesterday? He worked for that paper for 25 years, first they muzzled him, then they fired him.
Yes. He was at odds with his editor. Normally his work might be rejected 3 times in a year. This editor recently vetoed his work 19 times.
Paul Manafort is on his way to the slammer until his trial. This comes within hours of trump saying "Manafort had nothing to do with our campaign. ... Paul Manafort worked with me for a very short period of time." Manafort was trump's campaign chairman for fucks sake.
Yesterday, New York's new attorney general announced that the state is suing the Trump Foundation, as well as Donald Trump and his children, alleging "extensive and persistent" lawbreaking.
Barbara Underwood said the charitable foundation had engaged in "unlawful political co-ordination" designed to influence the 2016 election.
The attorney general is also seeking to bar the president and three of his adult children, Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka, from serving on the board of any New York-based charity, "in light of misconduct and total lack of oversight".
She has referred the case to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission, she says.
Despite all of his legal troubles and proven lies, however, Trump is extremely popular with Republicans according to the latest Gallup polls.
In a poll taken just after the summit with Kim, Trump's approval rating across all political affiliations was 42%.

It's somewhat disheartening to know that so many people don't place value on the truth. If they did, they would find the daily lies intolerable. In the very narrow time frame of this morning alone he lied or mislead the American people 19 times.

I'm sure they didn't break any laws. I think Ivanka could take this opportunity to introduce a new line of jewelry to her ever increasing fashion empire.
Today..........Trump's personal attorney (well, fixer) Michael Cohen lost his bid to have a judge put a gag order on Michael Avenatti, Stormy Daniels' attorney.
Cohen has reportedly sent vague signals this week that he's ready to cooperate with federal prosecutors. He also ditched his previous (expensive) attorneys and is seeking new representation.
The review of the documents seized in the search of his home and office has now been completed, including those that Cohen shredded with a cheap shredder (which investigators were able to piece back together).
President Trump hadn't publicly mentioned Cohen since April. Today, however, the president insisted that his former attorney's decisions won't affect him because he (Trump) hasn't done anything wrong.
This afternoon Trump told reporters, 'I always liked Michael Cohen. I haven’t spoken to Michael in a long time.' Trump also stated publicly for the first time that Cohen is not his lawyer anymore.
Cohen is facing the possibility of criminal charges for bank fraud or campaign finance violations for giving $130,000 to Daniels close enough to the 2016 election that her silence could have affected the outcome.
^ Correction/update: Cohen's attorneys have been given 10 more days to complete the review of seized/recovered documents and messages for attorney-client privilege.
The government said it also obtained 731 pages of messages, including call logs, from applications such as WhatsApp and Signal, which encrypt data, and about 315 megabytes from a BlackBerry. The material is the most recent to be produced to Cohen’s legal team out of more than 3.7 million items taken in the FBI search of his home, hotel room and office.
The information was contained in a letter updating the judge who is overseeing the review of the seized files. Lawyers for the government on Friday detailed files that were turned over to Cohen’s team in the last two days. Both sides asked U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to give Cohen’s legal team 10 days to review the new material.

There is much that can be written and said about the philosophy of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity,Inc., but nothing said or done will be of any meaning unless the practice of that philosophy can be seen in terms of Brotherhood, Scholarship, and Service, through its members.
The Lambda Tau Chapter was established in the Fall of 1979, by two Phi Beta Sigma members: Bro. Ralph Hogges,PhD and Bro. Earl Davis. Bro. Hogges was an adminstrator at Florida International University, and Bro. Davis was an administrator for Miami-Dade County Public Schools. They were members of the Theta Rho Sigma Graduate Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. in Miami. Both brothers felt the need for creating an African-American fraternity presence at the university. These men eventually recruited the first initiates of the chapter, which consisted of Bro. Willie Gibson and Bro. Elton Lee. Bro. Hogges and Bro. Davis filed the paperwork with the Gerald Smith, National Executive Director of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. at the time, and the chapter was given the name LAMBDA TAU. Within a couple of years, more seven brothers were initiated into Sigmadom, and were sponsored by Theta Rho Sigma Graduate Chapter. Lambda Tau Chapter became the first Greek-lettered organization to be chartered at Florida International University .
Unfortunately by 1986, the chapter became inactive due to brothers transferring and graduating. In early 1988, measures were taken to revive the chapter, by Bro. John Worford, who was then an administrator at the university. The result of his work resulted with the initiation of the "Phoenix Project", which consisted of seven brothers in Fall 1988.
As the years went by, Lambda Tau Chapter had the priviledge of being involved in about every facet of academics, community service, fraternal business,and social activities on and off campus, here in Miami as well as throughout the state of Florida(i.e.: student orientations, study sessions, state conferences, Greek leadership conventions, cookouts, back to school parties, stepshows). The chapter was featured in a newspaper article in the Miami Herald back in the Spring of 1991, for our work in helping to fix up and remodel The Camillus House, which is a homeless shelter. The experiences the chapter cherished were grand, but weren't always rosy. The chapter went through some hard times in the later half of 1996. But these hard times only kept the Lambda Chapter down for so long, as Bro. Rudy Rodriguez-Chomat, a transfer brother from Mu Epsilon Chapter at Florida State University, began the recent revival of the Lambda Tau Chapter.
By 1998, there were only two brothers on the campus of FIU, Bro. Shawn Murray and Bro. Rodriguez-Chomat. These brothers spearheaded a heavy recruiting effort throughout the rest of the year 1998. By May 1999, 5 newly initiated brothers stood tall on the campus of Florida International University. Bro. Roody Metellus, Bro. James Alexander, Bro. Charlo Alexandre, Bro. Cyrus Armand and Bro. Wodlaire Clervaud, along with Bros. Murray and Rodriguez-Chomat, took over the Lambda Tau Chapter. Within the next three years, Bro. Andre Harriott, Bro. Yonel Bredy, Bro. Darrell James, and Bro. Keiron Quarrie were brought into Sigmadom.
Two of the recent accomplishments for the Lambda Tau Chapter, came in the year 2001 as the chapter has the two highest ranking collegiate officers in the State of Florida and the Southern Region of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. This all started with Bro. Charlo Alexandre being elected 2nd Vice State Director in February 2001 at the State Conference in Tallahassee, Florida, while Bro. Rodriguez-Chomat was soon after elected 2nd Vice Regional Director in April at the Southern Regional Conference in Birmingham, Alabama.
Along with the sorors of Pi Pi Chapter of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. at Florida International University, the Lambda Tau Chapter has participated in various community service projects with such charitable organizations around the City of Miami and the rest of Dade County. Due to a change in graduate chapter affiliation, Lambda Tau is currently under the supervison of Rho Sigma Graduate Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., in Miami.

Here follows a book with the continuation of a collection of examples from Ventus: Calculus 4c-1, Systems of differential systems.
Here follows the continuation of a collection of examples from Calculus 4c-1, Systems of differential systems. The reader is also referred to Calculus 4b and to Complex Functions.
We focus in particular on the linear differential equations of second order of variable coefficients, although the amount of examples is far from exhausting.
It should no longer be necessary rigourously to use the ADIC-model, described in Calculus 1c and Calculus 2c, because we now assume that the reader can do this himself.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the first edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.
Our students need to learn more than just the vocational skills that come from the arts. Although having a deep understanding of one’s medium is extremely important, the journey of creating art should initiate opportunities to learn so much more: about oneself, one’s community, and the culture by which one is surrounded by. A contemporary and multicultural art education creates a path for students to develop critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and the means to navigate through an increasingly complex visual world. By giving students a well-rounded art education, we arm them with the ability to create, think divergently, critically analyze and effectively communicate.
My art classroom will provide a forum for students to express themselves through visual arts and dialogue. Through class and small-group discussions, students leaving my classroom will have respect for their peers and their opinions. I will encourage conversations that critically explore the work and subject we are investigating. Students will leave my classroom with an understanding that not everything is black and white, right or wrong. They will be able to navigate through the gray areas within the world and confront the tasks before them. Each student’s voice will be heard within my classroom and each opinion will be highly valued. Students will not leave my classroom feeling unsure or insecure, rather they will leave with the confidence to attempt anything.
Our schools will continue to become more diverse; thus, our lessons and the way in which we teach should diversify as well. As teachers, we must find contemporary content to keep our young students interested and as multicultural teachers, we must find a way to share many viewpoints and cultures. I will empower my students through a multicultural and contemporary art education and in turn, these students will feel more a part of their community and their school. Exploring many cultural viewpoints will create empathic and tolerant students who will grow up to be empowered and strong citizens.
Ultimately, my goal is to help students find themselves. I will create contemporary and multicultural lessons that help students explore who they are and where they are in society. By understanding themselves, the culture in which they live in and our complex society, students will walk away from school confident, empathetic, and understanding.

Milliken's proximity to the Rocky Mountains offers endless outdoor adventure activities including skiing, hiking, fishing, and boating for the residents of Johnstown and Milliken.
Easter is always a joyous time of year because it means sweet treats, egg hunts, delicious brunches and the coming of spring. Colorado even adds its own characteristic spin with ski resort Easter hunts, so there’s plenty to choose from!...
Milliken has long been known as an agricultural center, though housing is replacing some farm land. Even so, Milliken maintains the tranquility and beauty that are such vital parts of rural life.
With miles and miles of picturesque, rolling farmland, quaint main streets and "small-town" ways, Milliken provides easy access to I-25 which makes commuting to a city easy.
School District RE-5J services Johnstown and Milliken, where there are two elementary schools, one middle school and one high school. The student to teacher ratio in School District RE-5J is 15:1 and the average ACT score is 21.3. Higher education options are ample in Northern Colorado, including the University of Northern Colorado, Aims Community College (both in Greeley) and Colorado State University and Rocky Mountain Community College (in Ft. Collins).
There are two parks in Milliken. Both Milliken and neighboring Johnstown are communities which offer a variety of recreational opportunities for it's young residents, such as Little League football and youth league basketball and baseball. And, like the rest of the region, the proximity to the Rocky Mountains offers endless outdoor adventure activities including skiing, hiking, fishing, and boating.
Being located near both Fort Collins and Greeley offers residents of Milliken the advantage of choice in health care. Banner Health’s North Colorado Medical Center in Greeley and McKee Medical Center in Loveland and University of Colorado Health’s Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland and Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins are well-respected facilities with some of the best doctors in the region.
Johnstown and Milliken are surrounded by abundant farmland, which provides the area's largest source of income. Hall-Irwin in Milliken is a full-service construction management firm, Uniscope in Johnstown is a producer of specialty agricultural products. However, given the low housing prices, bucolic and friendly setting, many settle here but commute to the larger surrounding communities such as Greeley, Loveland, Fort Collins or Denver for work.

The Law was officially published in Russian on the National Legal Internet Portal of the Republic of Belarus on 3 November 2015 and enters into force in ten days after its official publication.

A portable toilet company in Natrona County had its water temporarily shut off and faces nearly $50,000 in fines for illegally dumping waste into a sewer system numerous times over the past year, according to the Wardwell Water & Sewer District.
The district's elected board of directors voted unanimously last week to shut off the water supply to Shawn's Johns and its owner Shawn Nash, 3270 Salt Creek Highway, after the third notice of violation and the possible threat to public health.
Kyle Ridgeway, attorney for the Water & Sewer District, said Monday the water was shut off from Wednesday through Friday, and was restored on the condition the water be used only for residential purposes.
If violations persist, the board will order plugging the sewer lines, which would not affect neighbors, but it would be costly.
Nash referred questions to his attorney Andrew Sears of the Casper firm Murane & Boswick. Thursday, Smith declined to comment because of the pending litigation.
Hiring an attorney was the first time Nash responded to multiple opportunities to present his side of the story before the district, which serves Bar Nunn and nearby communities. He also did not appear twice in Natrona County District Court for hearings for a preliminary injunction.
The case began a year ago when district manager Gloria Brainard saw Shawn's Johns improperly disposing human waste from its portable toilets directly into the sewer system, according to a civil complaint filed in Natrona County District Court. "Upon this observation, Ms. Brainard spoke with Mr. Nash and explained to him that this constituted illegal dumping in violation of numerous environmental rules, including, but not limited to, Wardwell's Sewer Use Regulations."
A company such as Nash's must take its waste to the Sam H. Hobbs Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant east of Casper that has the equipment to handle large amounts of human waste.
The effect of each illegal mass dump of the portable toilets on the 8-inch sewer line is the equivalent of a 50-home subdivision emptying all of its bathtubs at once. We're not talking about bathwater here, however.
After learning of the violation last year, the Central Wyoming Regional Water System installed a flow meter installed immediately downstream from Shawn's Johns.
The flow meter, another observation by Brainard and complaints about smells from neighbors revealed more illegal dumping on April 16.
Wardwell then issued a Notice of Violation and Order to Cease and Desist. Wardwell also asked Nash to appear at an informal hearing on May 8. He didn't show up and did not request a hearing to respond to the notice.
He hadn't responded by June 5, so the Wardwell board ordered a $500 administrative fine and a $5,000 civil fine against Nash. Those amounts were half of what the board could have imposed.
The board also asked Ridgeway to pursue an injunction through Natrona County District Court for the violations.
Illegal dumping was detected on May 31 and June 12, which prompted the Wardwell board to issue a second notice of violation.
Nash didn't respond to the second notice or for an opportunity to appear in court to defend himself.
On July 6, the board issued a third notice of violation. (The second notice of violation had four individual violations, and the third had two, with one of those overlapping with the second.)
On July 9, District Court Judge Catherine Wilking held a second hearing and upheld a previous preliminary injunction.
After the hearing, Brainard said the Wardwell Water & Sewer District never had such a problem in its history.
Ridgeway said he wasn't qualified to comment on whether such dumping posed an immediate threat to human health, but said the case could warrant a look by the EPA.
On Tuesday, the board held its monthly meeting and had asked Nash to appear at its meeting to discuss the violations.
In addition to the previous $500 and $5,000 fines, the board fined him the maximum $1,000 each for the four administrative violations and fined him the maximum $10,000 for each for the civil violations.
The total $49,500 in fines does not include the additional costs for cleaning out the sewer line, attorney's and other fees.
Besides the money, board members agreed that any further violation will result in plugging the sewer line.
That's far more than the $7,000 to $12,000 a year Nash is probably saving by the illegal dumping, board member Mark Pepper said.
The dumping could cause a major problem if portable toilet waste with its disinfectant in a large volume damaged a lift station between Bar Nunn and the wastewater treatment plant, Pepper said.
Likewise, a large amount the disinfectant put in the toilets could kill the good bacteria that render the bad bacteria harmless at the plant, which would render useless the treatment of waste water, Pepper said.
The National Park Service has named Cameron (Cam) Sholly to be the new Superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of the Interior on Wednesday.
"I am honored to have the opportunity to work with the extraordinary staff and partners at Yellowstone,” Sholly said.
"Exceptional work has occurred there over the past years because of the dedication of the NPS staff, partners, and communities. I look forward to continuing a positive trajectory for one of the greatest parks in the world," he said.
Sholly replaces former Superintendent Dan Wenk less than a week after he said he was being forced out as a possible "punitive action" following disagreements with the Trump administration over how many bison the park can sustain. Two weeks ago, Wenk said he intended to retire in March after being offered a transfer he didn't want to take.
Ranchers in Montana have long sought reductions in Yellowstone's bison numbers because of worries that they could spread the disease brucellosis to cattle and compete with livestock for grazing space outside the park.
Wenk and park biologists have said the current population of more than 4,000 bison is sustainable. But U.S. Interior Secretary Zinke, former Montana congressman, has said the number was too high.
Wenk defended the management of Yellowstone, saying the park is not a livestock operation. "We're managing a national park with natural systems," he said. "We do not believe the bison population level is too high or that any scientific studies would substantiate that."
Wenk said National Park Service Deputy Director Paul "Dan" Smith told him a new superintendent will be in place in August and that he would be gone by then.
Smith said Sholly has worked with local communities and Tribes on wildlife and conservation projects, and has overseen some of the Park Service's most high-profile park infrastructure projects in recent years. .
Sholly most recently oversaw the completion of the $380 million renovation of the Gateway Arch grounds and museum in St. Louis, Smith said.
“As Cam takes the reins as the incoming superintendent, I look forward to working with him to ensure Yellowstone remains a shining example of our national park system," Wyoming U.S. Sen. John Barrasso said.
Wyoming U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney said, "I'm looking forward to working closely with the Superintendent to keep Yellowstone one of the Nation’s most beloved parks."
Since early 2015, Sholly has served as the Park Service Midwest Regional Director with 2,000 employees, a $250 million budget, and the operations of 61 national park units in 13 states. During the past three years, some of those national parks transferred nearly 800 bison to state and tribal governments.
Sholly has a master’s degree in environmental management from Duke University, a bachelor’s degree in management from St. Mary’s College of California. He also is a graduate of the Harvard University Senior Executive Fellows Program.

It’s giveaway time! September is Lymphoma Awareness Month, and I have a special giveaway that is near and dear to my heart. It is in honor of my brother-in-law, Ace, who just three years ago and right before his 38th birthday was diagnosed with cancer. ❤️ It’s been quite a challenging journey, not only for him but for his entire family. He continues to fight on with the help of his strong faith and of course my amazing sister @plantifulblessings who holds down the fort and then some!
Today, Ace has been in remission for a couple years now and is striving with his family to live a healthier, conscientious, and plant-based lifestyle.
My sister began her Instagram account around the time Ace was diagnosed as way of coping and keeping hope alive. It’s a journal of their amazingly tight family (her blessings) laced with their journey to living a more active, conscientious, and healthy plant-based lifestyle in San Diego.
We teamed up with one of my favorite plant-based vegan restaurants, @joicafe, to give away a gift card as well as my favorite specialty produce distributor, @melissasproduce to give away a deluxe and exotic tropical fruit basket. .
Entering the give away is easy. Simply, visit my Instagram account, @YvonnesVeganKitchen, and go to my September Giveaway post and:
Since I was a kid, I always felt I had a special connection to the Italian culture, maybe because my middle name (my mother’s maiden last name) was Milano, Milano is in Italy, and growing up, I watched “Who’s the Boss” with Alyssa Milano and she is Italian! Additionally, my favorite food growing up was Italian food (and I think it still is). I loved spaghetti, lasagna, parmesan cheese, cannoli, and especially Italian-style dressing. In elementary school, when I’d cook my way through the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook with my mom, I learned the basics on marinara-making and throughout the years, I have improved my marinara (recipe is in the Yvonne’s Vegan Kitchen App). These days, with less free time due my busy schedule, I actually pick up a jar of my favorite marinara by Rao’s at Whole Foods. Their Roasted Garlic version is absolutely delicious. One thing, though, I refuse to purchase at the store are meatballs. Normally, store-bought vegan meatballs have some sort of soy protein, who knows how much oil, mystery ingredients, and they just leave me unsatisfied. I developed a quinoa meatball recipe that I’ve shared on my app, and it was actually born out ofmy veggie patty recipe. It’s basically the same recipe, just in meatball form. I could not, though, get myself to call it an Italian meatball because there is nothing Italian about it.
Lately, since I’ve been cooking more at home again, I’ve been on an Italian kick. I took my original meatball recipe, used it as a base, and Italianized it using fennel seeds, Italian herbs, and as I created it, I even turned on my Pandora Italian Jazz station. The end result, an Italian meatball recipe that I am so thrilled to share with you. It’s one of my favorite recipes.
I was so happy that my friend, Vince Lia, who is 100% Italian, came into the kitchen to watch me make these and taste-test my Italian meatballs. We even made Italian sausage! I am happy to say, they are Italian-approved. Thanks, Vince, for catching me on camera to show everyone how it’s done. It was a blast making them with you in the kitchen! If you don’t already follow Vince’s kitchen adventures on YouTube, I recommend subscribing!
So about the sausages, we tried frying the sausages, but found that baking them made for a better crisp texture, so ditch the oil, and make friends with your oven! Your body will thank you for it!
Here’s the video, (click the photo) and below is the recipe. I hope you try it and love it as much as I do!
In a large sauté pan, over medium heat, add the onion, garlic, bell pepper, jalapeno, and carrot and cook until onions are translucent. You do not need any oil to sauté this mixture since the water from the onions and other veggies will seep out and will help cook the rest of the vegetables.
Add the salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, fennel seeds, garlic powder, cook for about 2 minutes, then add the parsley, basil, spinach and quinoa. Stir well and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and add the oat flour. Stir well until everything starts to bind together and the mixture cools. If it doesn’t bind together right away, add filtered water, a tablespoon at a time, at most 3-4 tablespoons.
Disclaimer: I recommend using gloves, or just have a slice of lime handy afterward because the hot peppers can burn your hands. Rubbing your hands with lime can help alleviate any burning.
Using your hands, form the mixture into meatballs, using 2 Tbsp of the mixture per meatball. Or a one ounce ice cream scoop. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and place the meatballs onto the pan. Place the sheet pan in a 400 degree oven for 35 minutes or until crisp and browned.
Add the meatballs into your cooked marinara sauce, top your pasta with meatballs, stuff your sandwich with meatballs, or smother it in a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce.
Growing up, at school, church, and at home we ate corned beef and cabbage on this Irish and religious holiday. However, I have recently come to find out that there is nothing Irish about corned beef and cabbage, and that Shepherds’ Pie has always been and still is a staple of traditional Irish cooking. Shepherd’s Pie is basically a layered casserole with a veggie and meat mixture topped with mashed potatoes, thrown in the oven until the potatoes are browned. Traditionally, ground lamb or beef is used in the meat mixture, but of course, I create my own type of soy-free, plant-based meat using nourishing whole foods: cooked quinoa, mushrooms, and walnuts. Broken down in a food processor, this plant-based mixture eerily resembles traditional ground meat.
To be honest, there is nothing traditional about my version of Shepherd’s Pie. I use a garlicky cauliflower potato puree instead of mashed potatoes. My recipe also includes olives, which brightens up the dish with a bit of a zing and adds a nice salty flavor. Additionally, I add sun-dried tomatoes for meatiness, a little sweetness, and more richness in flavor. I really love the chewy texture of sun-dried tomatoes. Without these two ingredients, I feel the pie would be a little flat. My partner in kitchen crime, Davin, suggested I add a layer of vegan cheddar cheese between the layers of meat veg filling and cauliflower potato puree, and that idea was a perfect addition. Why did he suggest it? Think about it, “hamburger meat, potatoes, and cheese”, then to kick it up a notch, we ate it with a few drops of hot sauce and a drizzle of ketchup, and it was delicious.
Cook this dish any time of year, on the weekend for the week. You can freeze and reheat, and even make little cupcake pies for kids.
On St. Patrick’s Day, make it extra festive with GT’s Multi-Green Kombucha! Have it on its own, or make cocktails by adding a little pineapple juice and vodka!
2. Slice off the top of a large head of garlic to expose the cloves inside. Place the head of garlic on a piece of foil, cut side up. Drizzle about 2-3 Tbsp vegetable stock and wrap it tightly in the foil. Roast until cloves are lightly browned and tender, about 30-35 minutes.
3. Clean the cauliflower, removing the outer leaves and base. Peel and cut potatoes. In a medium saucepot, add 2 cups of vegetable stock, ¼ tsp sea salt, and the cauliflower. Set the pot over medium heat. Bring it to a boil, then down to a simmer. Cover and cook until tender, about 20-25 minutes.
4. Once the garlic has roasted, let it rest for at least 5 minutes. It will be hot. Carefully open the foil, pick up the bulb, and push the garlic cloves from the skin (peel), starting from the bottom up, pushing the roasted cloves out and into a blender.
5. Strain the cauliflower potatoes and reserve the vegetable stock. Transfer the cauliflower to the blender. Add the remaining ¼ tsp sea salt. Add ½ of the reserved liquid. Blend just for just a few seconds. Don’t over-blend or potatoes will get gummy, and adjust the consistency. An immersion blender is best for this. Even a hand masher. If the puree is too thick, add more stock. If it’s too thin, try cooking the liquid out on the stovetop.
In a food processor, combine the cooked quinoa, mushrooms, and walnuts. Process until it looks like ground meat. Set aside.
Heat a large saute pan or pot, add the oil, heat it for about a minute, then add the onions, carrots, and garlic. Saute until it caramelizes (browns a little) and onions are translucent. If the veggies stick to the pan, add some water or veggie stock. Can also make this oil-free by water-sauteeing.
Add 1 cup of veggie broth (I use the vegetable broth that I used from steaming the cauliflower and potato)
In a casserole or deep pie dish, spread the filling evenly. Top with a handful (or more) vegan cheese (optional) and the cauliflower potato puree. Place on a parchment lined half sheet pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake for 25 minutes or just until the potatoes begin to brown. Remove to a cooling rack fofr at least 15 minutes before serving.

Happy holiday season! Whether you celebrate a holiday or not in December, ’tis the season to indulge in sweet Wintry treats, like this Mint Chocolate Chip Cake, a Braided Cream Cheese & Jam Danish, and Almond Cinnamon Marshmallow Treats. I teamed up, once again, with a few of my favorites gals from Sweet Simple Vegan and Ahnest Veggie to bring you these must-try recipes! Woo not only yourselves but your loved ones when you come to the table with one or all of these desserts-in hand. They are sure to please not only the eyes but your taste buds. Oh, and of course, they’re all vegan!
I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw Jasmine braiding this wonder on her InstaStory. I am quite impressed. In my pre-vegan life, I was not only a lover of croissants, but of danishes especially with cream and jam in them. Jasmine’s dessert is a dream come true. Find her step-by-step braided Cream Cheese& Jam Danish recipe, here!
Nothing says the holidays like cinnamon and sugar. Add a touch of almond, and I am transported to an Italian Christmas celebration. Sarah’s adult-version rice crispy treats not only remind me of marzipan, they bring the child-like spirit out of me. At the holiday dessert table, why pick up a cookie when you can reach for a Cinnamon Almond Marshmallow Treat? Ooooo la la! They are even dipped in chocolate and marked with an almond star. Thanks for bringing the child-like wonder back with this sophisticated marshmallow wonder. Find Sarah’s recipe, here!
Now, for my Mint Chocolate Chip Cake. Mint and Chocolate have always been one of my favorite flavor combinations. Ever since I was a kid, I loved York Peppermint Patties, Andes Chocolate Mints, Junior Mints, you name it! Then when my parents took me to the ice cream shop, I liked Mint Chocolate Chip among other flavors. Still do! All year round, too. But it seems like folks like it most around the winter season. The chill of cooling mint in your mouth is reminiscent of cool icy weather and chocolate is a nice rich and decadent offset. The desserts I’ve been making have seemed pretty boring lately, and while making this seasonal dessert, I became excited again. I had lots of fun. I love the creme de menthe in the frosting and I love the chocolate cake and chocolate sauce drizzles.
I find this childhood favorite of mine sophisticated and exciting at the same time. It’s, of course, vegan and gluten-free, and I think you’re gonna love it!

The Commitments is an Irish film following Jimmy Rabbitte’s efforts to set up a soul band composed of local musicians in a working class area of Dublin.
I’m not a big music aficionado, and I definitely don’t know anything about soul, so I didn’t expect to be so impressed by The Commitments, but even with my limited music knowledge, I had a fantastic time watching this film. Thanks to some brilliant directing, excellent performances and fantastic characters, this film is a heap of fun to watch from start to finish, featuring great music all along the way.
Let’s start on that very note (if you’ll excuse the awful pun), and talk about how the music works in this film. One of the main points of the story is that this band of misfits is playing soul, a genre that isn’t typically associated with anyone from their background. However, the characters do have a very natural and interesting connection with the genre, which means that when they’re up on stage, the songs are actually very meaningful.
The other really impressive thing is that, whilst music scenes takes up a healthy portion of this film, it never gets tiring. That’s of course due to the various fantastic songs in the soundtrack, but what really sells The Commitments’ musical performances is the passionate acting from across the board, and most of all the brilliant directing by Alan Parker.
Parker manages to make full four-minute concert scenes not only engaging, but hugely entertaining to watch. Rather than solely pointing a camera at a stage, we get to see the whole environment of wherever the band is performing, weaving in and out of close-ups of each of the musicians and getting to see what they’re feeling at the time. It’s a brilliant technique that makes every musical scene brim with energy and life, and also means that the film doesn’t fall into the classic musical trap, because it keeps the story and the characters alive while we listen to a piece of the soundtrack.
The music is an integral part of the film, and the directing makes it even more fun to watch, but for me, the best thing about The Commitments was the characters. It may sound clichéd, but the dynamic that you get with this band of conflicting personalities is so brilliant to watch. On the one hand, you get a dose of drama and tension when you see various characters clashing despite everything going fine on stage, but on the other, the variety of personalities makes this film feel that little bit more colourful and energetic.
Everyone gives an excellent performance here, managing to make their character stand out amongst what is a pretty big lead cast. Even those that aren’t necessarily the main focus of the plot, and often just ride along with the story, are still memorable, which is testament to how good the acting and writing is in this film, but it’s still never a film that totally centres on one person. Yes, we’ve got Jimmy Rabbitte as the lead character, but it’s clear from the off that this is a film that celebrates all the members of the ensemble, which I loved.
Overall, I was really impressed with The Commitments. It’s a musical that keeps itself full of energy and life from start to finish, but provides enough intrigue, laughs and drama to keep you interested all the way through. Its characters, performances and directing are equally fantastic, and that’s why I’m giving it an 8.2.

Allison and her son were talking about fashion and she confessed that she was once a model. Struck with an idea, Luke took the camera and asked his mom to pose for him. Allison slowly stripped at his sight and then grabbed his stiff cock and started passionately sucking it. They were just a step away from hot family sex.
Jacob found his mother in the bedroom. She was lying on top of the comforter that covered the bed, dressed in a short rosy robe that barely covered her pussy. Jacob couldn't tear his eyes away from her gorgeous body caught in a sudden desire to touch her. She sweetly moaned in sleep when he rubbed her pussy, woke up and took off her robe helping him to finish what he started.
Daniel just turned eighteen, when his mother realized that her boy has grown a handsome and strong man that needs an experienced woman to teach him the art of love. She felt his body trembling beneath her touch, when she wrapped her hands around his neck rubbing her firm tits towards his chest and licked his ear. A moment later his hard cock pressed against her crotch.
Sean went to his mother's bedroom and found her sleeping. He stared at her seductive body for a while, then came up to the bed and woke her up. She smiled to him and he bent down and kissed the back of her neck feeling his mother trembling with desire. He helped her to remove her gown and pounced on her bosoms enjoying each inch of her body that he dreamed about for so long.
Grace was sitting on the couch and talking to her son, when he suddenly sat next to her and kissed her passionately running his tender hand over her trembling body. She was stunned, but couldn't resist an overwhelming lust seizing her body, so she leaned back allowing him to do whatever he wanted.

As leader of a group of teens, known as the Super Random, God-Filled, Crazy People, and mom of 4 of my own children, I experience so many different things. This blog touches on them all!
Yep, those are my three biggest excuses! I am sick and exhausted so I can't physically do as much which discourages me! And guess what..they are valid excuses....for a while. Sometimes, occasionally, once in a while. But I think I am digging a hole in them!
See, I haven't felt great since October. It is now the end of June. That is a long time. I USED to be really good at pushing through and getting stuff done, just in smaller spurts. Now I just sit. And whine. And dream and wish that I felt better. And you know....those are valid feelings.
BUT...here is the kicker...the laws of physics apply. An object at rest tends to stay at rest. I might gain some energy when I am really sick and I rest and let my body heal. But when I am struggling with this nagging ick, not a debilitating sickness, then I end up staying at rest more and more and more. Then I have no energy, and I don't want to do stuff, and doing stuff is harder because I am more and more out of shape.
Well today is my day. My day to overcome. See, I am tired of being tired and I am sick of being sick. I am headed to the doctor tonight for a request for a full battery of tests, no more throwing an antibiotic or allergy meds and hoping something helps. Tests with answers that we can then approach this and cure it instead of treating symptoms. And then to the exercise and getting stuff done. Even if I have to do small spurts, exercising between small amounts of sitting and recovering my breath. I am GOING to get this done! NO MORE EXCUSES!
I have spent some time this week struggling with God. You see, I figured that I dedicate a LOT of time to serving him by reaching out to teenagers. When these teenagers make bad, or questionable decisions, despite obvious and recent lessons in our youth group, I feel discouragement and struggle with human feels in inadequacy, and invisibility (they don't listen, why do I teach!).
Come on people, I KNOW I am not the only one out there who struggles with this! Maybe sometimes I have spent a lot of time teaching a topic and a youth group kid does something directly against that teaching. Maybe it isn't so obvious, maybe I see as an adult where the future probably leads and the youth takes a path that I would not have recommended. Maybe one asks my opinion and then they do the opposite anyway. Maybe you don't struggle with this with a youth group, maybe it is a friend, or a family member.
You can choose (trust me, I know because I have done it!) to wallow in that negative feeling. Rolling around in it, justifying your feels of inadequacy, invisibility, frustration, discouragement, like a pig wallows in the mud. That mud sticks to the pig. And you know what, he does it because it feels good, it insulates him. It keeps him cool in the hot, it helps keep his skin from being burned. Gosh, don't those sound like great reasons to wallow in mud if you are a pig? When we wallow in the negative, we are insulating ourselves too. The problem in it leaves us cool, yes, it might protect us from being burned, but it also protects us from the loving warmth that we can have from the relationships we are hiding from. It adds an extra layer between us and God so we aren't feeling His warmth! These are NOT good things!
Now, don't get me wrong, I am GREAT at wallowing and struggle with seeing positives. But God has laid on my heart a LOT lately that major things wrong in our society, our church and even in my own family, is that we spend too much time focusing on negative junk. We aren't recognizing God's hand in our lives! Only the areas that WE perceive that HE is "forgetting" to act (i.e., our will, not HIS).
See, today is the 13th anniversary of my widowhood. I was 27, I had a 3.5 year old and a daughter who had turned 2 just 13 days before. I had been leading a drama group called CHAOS (Christ's Hands Acting On Stage). I had AMAZING group of teenagers who had stood by me during the 9 month illness my hubby had dealt with. These kids babysat, house cleaned, prayed and overall surrounded me with loving support. Then my hubby passed, eventually I remarried and moved about an hour away and didn't attend that church. Time passed, lives moved on. High school kids went to college, got married, had children, etc. In other words time passed and connections got lost and we lost track of each other.
Along comes facebook. Yeah, there is a lot of JUNK that goes around facebook. But through facebook, some of those youth group kids found me. I admit it, I stalked their facebook pages, I looked at their families, I rejoiced at their church involvement, and honestly, I figured that they had completely forgotten who I was!
Fast forward to this morning.....a private message on facebook pops up from one of these girls. Now, I haven't seen her in about 12 years. I haven't talked to her. And today she says to me "This day stays in my heart. Always." I expressed surprise that she remembered the date. She told me she never forgets. All these years later, I had impacted her in a way that she cares enough to remember the date and pray for me.
My heart rejoiced. I felt full. I remembered that I am NOT the savior, I am a sower. I sow seeds, through the blessing of facebook I was able to see fruit from those seeds that I might never have seen! On a week when I struggled with purpose and wondering why I bothered, God showed me what I needed to see. Gifted me with a blessing that couldn't have happened in any other way, but by following His leading and mentoring teens as He has called me to. No, it doesn't make the situations in this group any easier, but it changes my perspective. It reminded me of a video, I don't know if I can link to it right and I want to be sure the guy gets total credit, in the video he gets to the end and turns the picture around, changes the perspective, and changes the look of the entire picture. Here is the video
Words are powerful. Some people feel them more than others. Negative words replay through your head, dragging you down. The flip side is that positive words can replay and lift you up. Yet let me ask you this.....how many times do we complain? How many times do we encourage? We go to a restaurant and the service is terrible, the waiter is rude, the service is slow, the order is wrong and we want the manager! We want it fixed! How many times is the service good and we don't say a word? We just assume people don't need to be told or think that is just their job so we don't need to comment! Personally, I make it a point to leave a note or word of encouragement on those occasions. I hunt down the manager and make a point to say something GOOD about good service.
I've heard it said that for every negative thing we hear, we need to hear 5 positive things to counteract it. I've heard it takes 10 or 20 positives. But I don't think of it as a tally sheet. You learn from the negative AND the positive, but you feel better learning from the things you are doing right! So what do we do? We get in the habit of using more positive things than negative in our daily lives with everyone!
Praise: recognizing and acknowledging accomplishments and efforts SINCERELY! Fake things do no good! People know when you are just sicking up and when you are being real! You can praise even failures as long as you are genuine in recognizing the effort.
Affection: Not just the words "I love you" even though that can be very important too. But people we care about need to hear that they are important and valuable to us. They need to hear that we recognize and acknowledge the things in their life that are important to them and that we see those things as positive, even if they are not equally important in our lives. I may not LOVE to do the same things as my husband or children, but I can encourage them to pursue the things that make them happy instead of grumbling about the time, effort or money those pursuits take. This is MORE than a generic "good job" occasionally.
Affirmation and Acknowledgement: Not only do the people around us want us to affirm them, but they want us to do it in public too. Think about it, when someone tells you something positive about yourself, it feels good. When they tell you that same thing in front of other people, it feels even better. We perceive it to be more real or true.
So now that we have touched on the basics of words of affirmation: praise, affection, affirmation, acknowledgement; we need to talk about what it really looks like to give and receive it.
Some guidelines for giving words of affirmation include being genuine, being timely and being low key. When we are genuine, people can tell. It is more than just the words we say. It involves tone, facial expressions, body language...things that go beyond the words we are saying.
You have probably all had an experience where someone has said all of the right words but you just knew they didn't mean it. My mom used to tell me "if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all" and I would add "AND MEAN IT!" People aren't stupid. They can tell when something being said is genuine. Actually, things that are not really meant are almost more harmful that things not said at all.
As we think about timely words of affirmation, we need to think about how it feels to have someone react with an immediate and excited "Great job!" or a comment hours later that usually sounds like "Oh, by the way, you did a great job earlier." Which one feels better to hear? Are both words of affirmation? Sure, but one feel like an afterthought or obligation rather than a true reaction. As we look to give words of affirmation to others, we need to think about how we would feel if someone said that thing in that way to us. Would it uplift and encourage or instill doubts about the sincerity?
Then we have that low key part....I know, I just talked about doing it in public or immediately, but it also needs to not be overblown, over-the-top or excessive. If someone tells you the same thing in the same excited voice about 10 times and always in front of others, it starts to feel fake. You start to think they are trying to convince themselves, others and you that what they are saying is truth. Maybe it is, but this behavior can lead to doubts. That doesn't mean never affirm in front of others. It just means keep it believable.
In addition to knowing how to GIVE words of affirmation, we need to know how to RECEIVE them. I admit, I a particularly bad at this. I do not say thank you with grace and accept that people mean what they say even when they are following all of the above guidelines! I still doubt. I still try to deny, undermine or blow off what they are saying. It makes me uncomfortable and I never quite know what to say. Responding in that way does a great disservice to the people giving the words of affirmation. When people compliment you, graciously accept with a polite and heart felt thank you. Do not try to deny their words or opinion. Do not negate their blessing in that way. It isn't always easy and we are tempted to say "thanks but....." and try to explain away their words. We need to not do that.
Can you think of examples of words of affirmation that were obviously genuine? What gave you that confidence?
How do you react when people give you words of affirmation? Why do you think you react that way? Is that a good reaction or not?
This can be a really touchy subject for a lot of people and that is why it is so important to learn the healthy way to both give and receive words of affirmation! We don't want to hurt someone else with our efforts to bless them or their efforts to bless us!
At the request of some of my youth group kids, I am going to TRY to post some of my youth group lessons here. Probably not consistently, but hey, when have I ever been consistent with blogging!?
When we talk about love languages, we are not just talking about Oooo La La love. We are talking all types of love. Love is found among family, friends and those of interest in the opposite sex.
Many times you will hear people say love is not a feeling, it is a choice, action, decision, etc While this is true to some extent, we all know we must feel something also! There are people you meet and you just click (as friends or more) and people who just rub you the wrong way. I don't believe that every single person was made to be close friends with every single other person (friendship is different then treating people respectfully no matter what!). Sometimes it is a personality conflict, other times a misunderstanding or problem with perception on either part.
I had this experience vividly with one woman. When we were in the same Sunday School class it always came across to me that her answers were better than any others. She would respectfully let others answer then it always felt like she had to address their answer. I got to the point where I would avoid certain classes because she would be in them. I realized this was only hurting ME and not bothering her a bit so I prayed and got the feeling I was supposed to get to know her better. WHAT! So not the answer I wanted! I wanted to hold on to my negative feelings! After much time and an attitude change on MY part, I now see her heart. She AGREED with the answers given by others and was simply adding her thoughts. Maybe not the same way I would, but not belittling as I had perceived it either.
Opening myself to God on this did two things, it made me rethink how I view people and not be so quick to judge base on my initial impressions. I may still end up with people I simply don't click with, but I TRY not to view them judgmentally or negatively.
All of that to say, be sure to examine what you are bringing into each and every relationship and start recognizing how that plays into the feelings of "love" you have. Bring it to God. Give Him your negative feelings and ask for Him to open your eyes to the positive things about those people. Take your positive feelings to Him and ask Him to guide you in this and show you areas of concern if this is not a relationship He wants in your life.
So as we enter a few lessons on love languages, we need to think about why we desire love; what love looks and feels like for us in different relationships; and how we give love naturally. if we are expressing our love to someone one way but they don't receive love that way, we both miss out. They feel unloved, we feel unappreciated and misunderstood and frustration and anger often follow. This is a huge part of the breakdown of any relationship.
We were designed to seek relationships. Our creator declared that not only did He desired relationship with us, but we were to desire relationship with each other. In Genesis 2:18 the Bible clearly tells us "The Lord God said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone I will make a helper suitable for him.'". In Genesis 3:8-9 we are told "Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man, 'Where are you?'". He was actively seeking Adam and Eve. Desiring to interact with them. And He didn't design us to only seek relationship with each other in a romantic way, but true community with others. 1 Corinthians 1:9-10 tells us "God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful. I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so there may be no divisions among you and that you might be perfectly united in mind and thought."
From our desire to seek relationship comes a desire to connect. We want to interact with others in a meaningful way. It leads to our desire to pray and connect with God and our need to talk, some more than others! Mark 12:33 says "To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all the burnt offering and sacrifices." WOW! This implies a desire to connect on a deeper, more meaningful level. This desire gives us the power to demonstrate acceptance and friendship or the power to harm others with our rejection. This is a powerful tool in today's world.
In addition to wanting to connect, we want to take care of others, and be taken care of in return. Philippians 4:19, "And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus." This isn't just holding hands, scratching someone's back or rubbing their feet (which are all wonderful things!) but true nurturing of all needs, physical and emotional. It drives mothers to feed, shelter and clothe their children, fathers to provide and people in general to truly care about the people around them. Think of and share some ways you feel compelled to nurture those around you. Is it different for family, friends, etc?
We need to feel important or special. Our self-worth or self-esteem comes into play. When we believe that others do not find us valuable (true or not), we start to believe that we are not valuable. As we recognize this need in ourselves, we should begin to recognize the need to fill this need in others. Choose to uplift and encourage others, even when you don't feel like it.
2. Have you had times where your first impression of someone (either positive or negative) was skewed by what you bring into a relationship and later that impression was changed? Would you share why you think caused the first impression and what triggered the change?
3. What is your first thought when someone says love? Does something in your history figure into your perception of love? Do you think your view of love is healthy or unhealthy? Why?
4. Everyone is at a different place in life, remembering that there are no right or wrong answers, do you feel like your need for connection is seriously lacking, okay, pretty well taken care of, or kinda spotty (Good in some areas, lacking in others)? How can you fix any problem areas?
5. Everyone connects differently. What does connection look like to you in relation to your family? Friends? Church? (Ex: Hanging out, playing games, watching TV, eating meals, conversations, Bible Study, etc.)
6. Just like we all feel connected in different ways, we all feel nurtured or the need to nurture in different ways. What does that look like for you? Is it different with the different people in your life? If so, why?
7. The dreaded self-esteem! Where do you stand? (Low, middle, high) Good in some areas, struggling in others? More importantly, do you share that with others, seeking their help in boosting the lows and viewing the highs objectively? Why or why not?
As you can tell, the above lesson was directed at my youth group. I am pretty much including everything and encouraging the people who read it to really think about it. If you feel comfortable commenting, answering questions, etc. Feel free! I will gladly read those comments! I look forward to seeing what you think!
As I have led my Super Random, God Filled, Crazy People this summer I have pushed. I have pushed them to step out of their comfort zone, become leaders, pray out loud, learn to ask for help, work together, etc.
This week my daughter taught on forgiveness. She had a great start to her lesson. She worked alone and she was prepared...for a very short lesson! It was GREAT to see other kids step in, take the lesson a step farther and see where God led them! I was so awed!
And the lesson that could have gone no where fast......kids from the group quoted some of it in facebook! So it actually hit home!
Forgiveness is like a cut, it will heal, but it will leave a scar. Sometimes that makes you stronger, if you let it. THEN they realized that it is only that way from a human standpoint, from GOD'S standpoint, it can heal completely!
A few were honest and admitted they struggled with forgiveness. One said he struggled with hurt feelings when forgiveness was given to him but trust didn't follow. The whole leaving a scar and needing time to heal thing hit home with him. It was GREAT to see God take a small lesson and make it impactful!
I have been busy living life and running my business. This week I am involved in the Build Your Bundle Homeschooling Book sale (https://www.buildyourbundle.net/affiliates/idevaffiliate.php?id=422) so I have been anticipating TONS of business. Well, it isn't so much a flood, but a tiny trickle so far! Here is hoping though. It is only day two!
I sit here knowing the sun is shining the kids are happy with Grandma, the house is a mess and I went to a meeting this morning to learn how to use Twitter and learned nothing about it, but did get some good insight and networking time with other business owners.
I am learning that there is TONS involved with owning and operating a business that I never considered and I have struggled to feel like I needed to be an expert at it all and I am learning that it is OKAY to not be perfect in every area, as long as you are able to delegate to someone qualified. Sigh, now to find qualified people! :-)
I start a new chapter in life here soon, homeschooling. Yep, we took the leap and are going to homeschool some of the kids. The oldest will stay in school, but the Freshman and 3rd grader will come home and my 4 year old will start a Pre-K/K combo this year. We will see how it goes! I am revved up and they are excited but when reality sets in it may be a different story! I am going to do a post about it once we get going on that!
A few weeks ago for her birthday I got my oldest daughter a hand-fed, peach-faced, love bird. She was BEAUTIFUL!
I really wasn't convinced my daughter would like having a bird around. I thought it might be like all the other animals we had tried in the past (guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, cats, fish, even our horses!) and it would be a cool novelty for the first few days then the reality of taking care of it would set in and she would be kinda ignoring the bird, etc. I was fully prepared to have to take over the care and keeping of the bird myself.
From the day she arrived and ended up being named Kuruka (Swahili for fly), the bird and Rebekah were best friends. If Rebekah was home, the bird was on her shoulder or with her in some way. They bonded in a way I had never seen.
Yes, you can see what is to come. The child who always left the bird with me when she went in the laundry room with the dogs, one time forgot, then played with the dog, knocking the bird off her shoulder, dog thought bird was toy, grabbed bird. Bird died. Pain hit! HARD! Both for my daughter and I.
For starters we had both bonded with the bird. Second, I hurt because I got my daughter something, in the best of intentions, to bring her joy. Instead it brought her heartache and pain. I felt like I had failed as a Mom in not shielding her and protecting her from that pain. I feel guilty for not reminding her to keep the bird and the dog apart. I felt guilty for not knowing how to keep the bird from dying in my hands a few minutes later.
We are still working through the pain in this house, but I am also seeing the lessons. When tough times hit in life, you can close your eyes and plow ahead and chose to never remember them again, you can choose to wallow in them, constantly returning and getting sucked back into that pain and not letting go of it, or you can choose to learn the lessons that every trail can teach. Rebekah is learning that in the future she will be a lot more careful with her actions. She learned that she LOVED having a bird and she wants another one (which is ordered and will be hatching in the next couple of weeks and arriving here in another 9 weeks or after that). I am learning that as much as I wanted to shield my child from such pain, I can't, but I can help her through it. I can help her learn not to let the pain ruin her life. I can encourage her that even though it hurts, the love is worth it (being widowed, I can identify with that in the scary step of loving again and remarrying!) and that life is for living, not trying to hide from the pain the way Kuruka hid under Rebekah's pony tail!
And though it is hard and painful and we can't see ever loving another bird quite like we did Kuruka, we are learning to stretch our wings, cock our heads, perch on a high spot and examine our world with the wonder and awe of a young bird. Sometimes the perch isn't the safest or the most comfortable, but it is still worth trying! So we are going to get another bird, open our hearts to love, let others in and stop trying to wrap up in bubble wrap for protection!
Have you experienced pain in your life? Has your instinct been to wallow in it, hide from it, plow through it? How did that one work for you?
God didn't call us to protect ourselves from all hurt and pain. He called us to open ourselves to His love and sharing it. It may not be comfortable but that is what we are going to do!
So as we look at pictures and remember, we will also look forward with hope that we will have another amazing bird in the future and until then, we are going to choose to wallow in God's love to comfort the pain. Who wants to wallow with us?
I am a mom of 4. My older two girls are from my first marriage. Tim passed away 2002. My youngest girl and my only boy are with Cory.I have a group of teenagers that call me Momma Suz.
It was yet another narrow defeat for Llanybydder, as again a team missing some injured forwards competed well, and eventually claimed a losing bonus point. The home side scored first as Dafydd Jones crossed as he supported a strong run down the right wing. Llanybydder replied with a try for No 8 and captain Ricky Davies after a period of pressure with fly half Steff Richards adding the conversion and a further penalty to give the visitors a 10 – 5 lead. Injuries to lock Josh Jones and hooker Rhys Morris further limited the visitors, with backs having to fill in at forward,and eventually the experienced centre Mike Sauro and No8 Wayne Williams crossed for home tries, both converted by fly-half Dom Sauro who also added a penalty. Llanybydder replied with an excellent try for left wing Luc Evans after a fine team move, converted by Steff Richards to give a final score of 22 – 17.

6. Leasing. We now offer leasing options for purchasing your new product. Qualified customers will have the ability to lease their purchase with convenient and powerful financing options. You are provided with the flexibility, quick response, and simplicity you need with quality customer service during your financing term.
Leasing provides total financing. Generally no down payments are required, and lessees pay no extraneous tax, delivery, warranty, or other miscellaneous costs. All costs associated with a purchase can be included in the lease, including delivery and installation.
Leasing conserves working capital. Leasing leaves lines of credit at other financial institutions free for cash-flow purposes, investments, unsecured loans, or unexpected emergencies.
Leasing overcomes budget limitations. Most companies are hampered by capital budget limitations from time to time. Leasing allows businesses to acquire new equipment with easily affordable rental payments.
Leasing provides security against equipment obsolescence. Upgrade and trade-in options can easily be added to a lease agreement. In addition, there are no risks of equipment ownership, and lessees will never be required to resell or remarket obsolete equipment.
Leasing can offer tax savings. When properly structured, monthly lease payments may be fully tax deductible as an operating expense. This savings results in a lower after-tax equipment cost. Contact us to discuss tax advantages applicable to your specific situation.
Payments are a fixed cost. Monthly lease payments remain the same for the life of the lease, even if interest rates do not.
Leasing provides a faster return on investment. Revenues or savings created as a result of the equipment during the first month often will be in excess of the monthly lease payment, thereby providing an immediate return on investment.
It is important to note that the common thread in each of these benefits is flexibility. Lease payments and terms may be structured based on a businesses particular need. Equipment leasing can be an extremely valuable financial tool for growing businesses while staying competitive in today's marketplace.
A minimum total purchase value is required for leasing options. Not all customers will qualify for the leasing program. Please contact us to see if you qualify for our leasing program. Please Note: All Leasing options are provided by third party equipment leasing companies.
7. Promotions, Promotional Gifts. Promotional items include any free items/gifts you receive with your order. Promotional items are only available on certain items, where stated.

It’s week four in big school and Kayla has settled considerably well, or so I thought. Today while collecting Kayla, the teacher called me aside and asked for a ‘chat’. Like that I was sent to the bold corner, standing aside while all the other mummies and daddies collected their children.
Obviously thinking is everything okay? Did she fall? Was she upset today for some reason? Now as the next class of twenty something children get called name by name, the teacher approaches me ‘we had an incident today, didn’t we Kayla’. Teacher then proceeds to tell me my ‘little angel’ had hit not one but two other children in her class today.
So my darling as if butter wouldn’t melt daughter was a bully today. As someone who was bullied for years through small and secondary school, one thing I cannot stand is a bully. Teacher witnessed Kayla hit another pupil, unprovoked. I’m very disappointed and shocked to say the least.
Her school have a very strict anti-bullying policy; it was something I read through with a fine tooth comb. The schools I attended had awful approaches to bullies, almost leaving me more vulnerable for speaking up through my childhood. I’m happy it was dealt with abruptly, it proves bullying is totally unacceptable within her school. Fortunately for her she will get away with it this time, as both incidents happened in the one day, next time there will be consequences.
Maybe she was a little frustrated, maybe the other kid done something when the teacher wasn’t watching, we will never know. Anyways she has only got her iPad back after watching videos on YouTube without my permission, looks like it’s going to be gathering lots of dust again. She seems very embarrassed with her behaviour and genuinely sorry, only time will tell, so hopefully there will be no more incidents like this in the future.
Hi, I'm Kellie, an over-sharing Irish mammy of four (aged two, three, four and eight) who writes honest tales and parenting fails as a stay at home working parent. I'd describe myself as a mum bun wearer, professional cake eater and a coffee addict. I'm usually found bribing my kids with a custard cream, googling our next adventure or praying for Joe to get home.
It was Wednesday the 13th of July, with just under two weeks to my due date. The mini bus was kitted with our new Pebble Plus Maxi Cosi and my hospital bag. I was so nervous driving into the hospital, I was going in to have a membrane sweep. They had been successful in my last two pregnancies so as far as I was concerned I was going in to have my baby. Due to having a BBA (born before arrival) with Kadie I was been kept in after my sweep just as a precaution. (more…)
What a week it has been. Our beautiful little bundle arrived last Friday night, and she is perfect, all seven pounds two ounces of her. It’s like she’s always been here, and for everyone asking, yes, we made it to the hospital with plenty of time to spare. My poor mother was palpitating when I rang to tell her I was getting mild irregular contractions so much she left work in a panic and spent the next few hours hounding me to leave. (more…)
So there is absolutely no sign of anything happening. My Hicks, the niggly back cramps, and those mild contractions have disappeared off the face of the earth. It’s a really weird feeling especially at 38 weeks pregnant considering all my babies come early. I’m normally praying for the onset of labour, I even served Kadie her eviction notice this time last year, I dunno I feel like I’ve another week or so left in me. (more…)
It’s been a long week. I’ve had five iron infusions, my last one was yesterday. And I must say even though I was stressed out looking for minders for the kids these little infusions have me feeling fabulous. Everything to my complexion, the colouring of my eyes and I have bundles of energy. I’ve never in all four pregnancies felt so good especially not at 37 weeks pregnant. (more…)
It was my birthday on Wednesday, and as much as I wasn’t in the humour of celebrating because I couldn’t see a thing I had a great day with the gremlins. They made me breakfast in bed and ate it too. They cleaned the playroom before school then wrecked it again just before we left. They sent me flowers and ate the accompanying chocolates. Joe even organised the family together for a cake that evening, I ate it with a fork (more…)
I’m feeling very pregnant, up until this point I’ve pretty much winged it. Then this heatwave landed and it has knocked me for six. At 33 weeks pregnant I’m walking around the house half-naked, windows and doors open and spraying myself with mist every ten minutes. Did I mention I’m showering 3-4 times a day? I couldn’t care less what destruction the kids get up to while I’m in there. (more…)
Isn’t it magical how our bodies create tiny life? However in return, we succumb many obstacles. Obstacles I won’t miss that’s for sure. Here’s a list of things I won’t miss about being pregnant:
Been a grand couple of weeks. Some nice weather, bit of a breeze to keep cool. Joe even made me a washing line… He told me he’d get me one of those wind-up yokes. (more…)
My dates have been confirmed, I’m still due on the 25th of July but my OBs would still like to induce me early. I’m gonna play it cool and just not gonna show up. Can you do that? Like can they section you to come into the hospital? I can only imagine two guards arriving at the door ‘I am arresting you on suspicion of not delivering your baby…‘. (more…)

Take a hair porosity test. Knowing your hair porosity will put you one step closer to understanding what products your hair needs, how much and how often you should apply them.
First things first, take a hair porosity test (there are many ways to test hair porosity, we chose this one as it is easy with readily available ingredients). Take a strand of your hair, put it in a glass filled with water and wait for a few minutes to see the results. Low porosity hair will sink on top, Medium porosity hair will float in the middle while High porosity hair sinks to the bottom.
The cuticle layer is closed and that deprives the hair of moisture. To allow moisture to penetrate you have to use heat/warmth to open up the cuticles. Some of the safest ways to create warmth include: warming your Conditioner before applying, wearing a plastic cap (also known as the green house effect) as part of your night time routine, and using warm water to wash.
Medium porosity hair is the easiest to maintain. The cuticle layer is loose enough to let moisture in and retain just enough. Because the cuticle layer is open, heat and chemicals can easily transform your hair porosity from Medium to High.
The function of the cuticle layer is to protect the context. If it is absent or wide open, the hair excessively absorbs moisture and loses it just as easy. Most High porosity hair is damage due to excessive use of chemicals such as hair dyes and relaxers. Some of the methods used to manually close the cuticle layer include: using cold water to wash, massaging hair strands out and using heavy sealants to keep the moisture in for longer.

As part of our commitment to widening access to medicine, Lancaster Medical School take a holistic approach to reviewing applications and aim to understand as much as possible about our applicants and their potential.
Medicine as a profession needs to attract the best students to embark on what can be a challenging career. While academic qualifications provide one marker of potential, a number of studies have shown that potential to succeed in medicine is not reliant on qualifications alone. In 2012, Lancaster University’s Chancellor, the Rt Hon Alan Millburn, published a report which highlighted that the UK medical profession does not reflect wider society. We are committed to recruiting medical students who reflect the diversity of our society.
If you meet two or more of our widening participation criteria, meet the academic entry requirements and are successful at interview, you may be considered for a contextually lowered offer of ABB.
In this instance, you will be made a dual offer: (1) the standard offer and (2) the contextually lowered offer; the lower offer is dependent upon you making Lancaster Medical School your firm choice and attending one of our post-offer events.
In addition to the information collected through UCAS, Lancaster Medical School considers a variety of information to provide a full picture of the applicant and their circumstances. As part of the application process, the admissions team will consider whether applicants meet two or more of our widening participation (WP) criteria listed below:
your parent or guardian is in receipt of a means-tested benefit (e.g. Universal Credit, Income Support, Job Seekers Allowance);
The school where you are completing/have completed your A Levels (or equivalent) is a non-selective state school.2
The school where you completed your GCSEs has a below average Attainment 8 score.2 You can view your school’s Attainment 8 score here.
Your parent(s) did not attend university or attain a higher education qualification, apart from as a mature student.1
1 This information will be collected in addition to the UCAS application through the supplementary information questionnaire.
Most of the information that we use to consider your application is available through the UCAS application form, including information about your school.
Supplementary information will be collected after the 15th October 2018, when all UK applicants will receive an email inviting them to complete the supplementary information questionnaire. This secure, self-report questionnaire will ask you to provide additional information that is not available on your UCAS application. The questionnaire must be submitted by 15th November 2018 in order for the information to be considered alongside your application.
After 15th November 2018, Lancaster Medical School will decide whether you meet our widening participation criteria, using the information provided via the questionnaire and your UCAS application. If invited for interview, applicants who meet the widening participation criteria may be required to provide the relevant evidence. If this applies to you, you will receive an email confirming what evidence you will be required to bring to interview, but you can also view this in the Required Evidence tab.
The information you provide will only be accessible to members of Lancaster Medical School’s admissions team and will be stored in a restricted area. The deadline for providing this information is the 15th November 2018 and information will be retained for one year (i.e. until 15th November 2019) at which point all records will be erased.

In the early hours of Saturday Lola has had 5 healthy kittens. Midwife (Rachel) is a little weary after so many births in 24hrs.
It's been awhile since I put together an outfit post. For how I often I take pictures sometimes my self esteem needs a little break from being in front of the camera. So here is a little round up of outfits I shared on instagram from this summer to this weekend.
NOVICA is one of the leading fair trade artisan websites. They work with National Geographic to give talented artisans around the world a place to express their artistic talents and provide access to the world market. They have thousands of top fair trade corporate gifts, accessories, jewelry and home decor items on their website.
Scarf I picked up at Ross on my recent trip to Santa Barbara. During my layover in San Francisco all the stylish traveling city girls had beautiful pashminas on and I was so jealous of the their style. So I picked on up for my flight home. I ended up having a terrible flight home so hanging out at the airport all day, my new pashmina kept me company.
So I was checking out Pinterest one day looking for some inspiration for a new pair of boots. I really love Steve Madden shoes in general so it prompted me to check out their website. I found the perfect pair and even pinned them. They were selling on the SM website for $99 so it was a bit out of my normal boot price range. So later that day I went into Ross and found the same exact pair for $29! I only knew that they were the same exact ones since I saw the name of the specific boots online that morning. Probably one of my best finds yet.
Hope you are having a lovely weekend! I am gearing up for Monday that will kick off my first 31 Days post! Hope to see you then!
Those reunion shoes are SASSY! I haven't worn my boots yet but I'm dying to get them out. Every morning that feels cool enough, it's too warm by the time I leave the house :( And ps I can't believe October starts Monday. I need to get some posts ready!!
You're a pretty good bargain shopper! I get frustrated shopping at Ross and TJMaxx because they don't always have my size. I LOVE that pink dress with the brown belt though! Did you buy that skirt that it came off of just for the belt? I've done that before. ;o)
You’re wondering who I am? Hmmm…. let me think how I could describe myself without writing a whole autobiography, or even worse, a "Being Dom Huber for Dummies". No one can be like someone else!
To keep it as short as possible for all of us… I’m in my mid-thirties, born and grown up in Switzerland, can’t sit quiet for more than an hour without doing something creative such as making music, writing new songs, painting, photographing, filming, cooking, to think what I could do next, etc., etc., etc..
But don’t worry too much about me… These are just my passions next to my regular full time job - which really is a regular one - with people, meetings, structures and stuff like that.
Having grown up in a family which always used to make music, a father who was conducting, and an aunt who was very interested in arts, didn’t let me run away from it. Running away from things isn’t the solution for anything, anyway. So I decided to better face it and started early to play several instruments such as trumpet, tuba, drums and percussions. Later I also started with the guitar. I also remember myself always having painted something and how I was fascinated by those huge pictures at my aunt’s place. And it looks like I was not made for sport or anything similar. This must be the reason why I stuck to the arts.
Unfortunately in my past I didn’t always have the chance to be creative, as I had to focus on making a little bit of a career. But this main component of art inside of me was always missing until 2013/14. After such a long period I said to myself, "Enough is enough and from now on, you’ll learn to live your dream and stop hiding your stuff in a drawer".
Never ask me those two things! I’m more that kind of person who gets influenced by what he sees and what he is just listening to at present. By the way; it’s almost the same with the genre. I don’t put myself into a typical genre, as this is often influenced by my actual life phase and by my mood.
I have no concrete plan about what’s next, as I try to live in the present or in that particular "flow" if you want to call it so. Therefore I can’t say things like, "I’m posting something every week", or, "I will release something until…", or, "I will have whatever…"… NO!
There are times in life where I’m flooded by inspirations, which is fantastic, but there are also other times where the inspiration is just faded away.
The goal is to continue writing new songs, to paint new pictures and not keep them hidden in the drawer anymore, where they'll only be gathering dust!
Following the release of her recent track “Mellow” featuring Shygirl comes “Started Out”, the brand new single from Georgia, her second single of 2018. Watch the Rosie Marks directed video below.
“Started Out” is an upbeat and euphoric track infused with hedonism and influences from the Chicago house scene of the 80s. Using the same original 909 drum machines & sequential analogue synths used by dance legends of the 80s & 90s, “Started Out” is another shining example of...
Anna Calvi announces her third album, 'Hunter', which will be released on 31st August 2018 via Domino. To mark the announcement she has shared the William Kennedy directed video for single 'Don’t Beat The Girl Out Of My Boy'. Watch below.
Produced by Nick Launay (Nick Cave, Grinderman) at Konk Studios in London with some further production in LA, the album was recorded with Anna's band - Mally Harpaz on various instruments and Alex Thomas on drums - with the addition of Adrian Utley from Portishead on keys and Martyn Casey from The Bad...
The Black Tambourines make music grounded in the ethos of D.I.Y production and scuzzy, distorted garage-rock, but with ragged grooves and a sun-kissed haze. Their music has been described as “surf-punk that buzzes with urgency” – NME, “blissfully hazy garage-punk”- Clash and “scuzzy rip-roaring indie-rock” – BEAT.
Over the last year The Black Tambourines have performed at Glastonbury, Isle of Wight festival, The Great Escape (unofficially, playing a guerrilla gig from the back of their van) and Manchester’s Psych Fest; they’ve toured Europe and the UK and supported The Jesus and Mary Chain (among many other shows). This summer, the band...

For this version of the Fantasy blanket, I used a combination of the following three stitch patterns:
This last stitch pattern is the same as the original, but I am sharing the chart again to have all the patterns for the “Sand & Sea” blanket all in one post.
To make this blanket, you need to follow the instructions of the original Fantasy Blanket, but use these new stitch patterns instead.

Howdy! I'm JJ... Welcome to my creative chaos. I use this space to share my creative endeavors... from cooking, crafting, quilting, crocheting, SoulCollage and more... to discovering places of creative inspiration. You'll find it all here. I am non-profit markerter - have drunk the social media kool-aid. I am ridiculously, happily married to Fab!Hubby and the proud mom of 2 amazing kiddos, AK & The Z-Man. I am a passionate member of the Woman Within International community, I give my time to the South Central Region - Circles of Women. My mission is to create safety & acceptance in the world. I will probably hug you when we meet. Until then, if you are into all things creative... you're in the right spot... come on in... wander around... get inspired... go create!
I turned to Fab!Hubby the other day and declared, "You know, I just like to make stuff... to take anything... and make something that wasn't there before!" He sighed... "I know. My issue isn't that you make stuff, its that you make so much stuff, all at the same time." He's got me there. The Creative Source has always just flowed through me, effortlessly, and I enjoy being able to harness it. From quilting to murals to photography and much, much more... on this site I'll be exploring the creative process, documenting projects, and sharing the joy I find in color, crafts, and creativity... check out CREATE now >>
To say I like to cook is an understatement... big time... like calling The Mississippi River a creek kinda thing. I come from a very long line of what we call today "Comfort Food" aficionados. To those women who came before me, bacon and cream gravy were just kitchen staples. My new journey is to learn to cook good tasting food that's good for us... its an adventure. I also have a passionate love affair with cookbooks and am experimenting with cookie recipes in hopes of pulling together a great cookie cookbook... check out COOK now >>

I will be blogging about the things that inspire me, help me to grow, help me to live more consciously. You can catch a glimpse in my Personal Mission Statement here and check out INSPIRE now >>

Right now I have a regular bifold leather wallet. It gets the job done, but I just ran across this small Magic the Gathering 30 card deck box ( I think its like a promo box or something.) I don't usually carry cash, just cards. Including my driver's license, I have 12 cards (which admittedly, I don't need some of the cards). I like how small the box is, and it holds all 12 of the cards perfectly, with a little extra room left (if I wanted to carry some cash I suppose.) I can fit it comfortably in the same pocket that I keep my phone in.(Note 8 ), and I can also keep it in the pocket that I keep my wifi hotspot in(a bulky, weather resistant at&t one). I can't do that with my actual wallet, because it is too bulky. The only thing I don't like about this box, is it is made of cardboard, and I'm pretty sure that after one night at work (I'm an overnight stocker at a retail store) the box will most likely be a crushed and beat up. So those of you that are still with me here, what I am looking for is something similar to this small box that is either made of plastic, fabric, or leather (doesn't have to be real leather.) It also doesn't have to be an actual wallet with individual slots for each card. I just want something small that I can keep in my front pocket with my hotspot, so I am no longer sitting on a bulky wallet.
Thats actually not a book, just a bad picture. It was the first picture of the product that I found on the internet. Basically what I am looking for is something about the size of a pack of playing cards, however made out of something stronger than cardboard.
I've gone in the opposite direction. After a lifetime of carrying a wallet and no cell phone, I have finally given in to reality and now carry a cell phone instead of a wallet. I bought a cell phone case that can carry my id and a couple of credit cards, and use a money clip in another pocket for cash.
I used to be addicted to getting wallets, to find the perfect one. Went through quite a few on Kickstarter and elsewhere. Then, I bought a Dango wallet during the kickstarter. And nothing else will do now.
I have one. I migrated away from that because it's too limiting for me, and it started to stretch rather easily, just pulling the cards out of the wallet, and they got to the point where the resistance wasn't enough to keep them in (the EzGo minimalist).
I guess that's a risk no matter the choice. FWIW I think the dango looks way to bulky for what it is
I have two, one has the 5 cards that I carry everyday, (DL, 2x Debit, CC, Medicare) plus I can stick a few notes in the slot at the back.
The other has cards like non-reloadable VISA, Public Transport RFID, etc and I don't carry it unless I happen to need the cards in it.
Together they'll fit in a front pocket easily and each is about half the thickness of a deck of cards.
Any loyalty/shop cards were migrated to the banking app on the phone long ago so no need to carry those, (no real need for one of the debit cards either since the phone NFC takes care of that or cash out via cardless at an ATM).
Already have several times. Just take the tool out, and it's compliant. And I don't use the tool, so no problems on that regard.
And it's definitely less bulky than the ezgo (and many so called minimalist wallets) with the number of cards I have, and just as easy to get to them. I carry around 3 credit cards, insurance card, license, and HSA card in the front, and 2 medical insurance cards, AAA card, work entry card, amusement park card (which I could do without, but knowing me, I'd forget it when I go), and Costco card in the back.
And I stick it in my front pocket with my keys very easily, and the lanyard lets me just grab it from my pocket to use the scan card for work very easily.
Last time i did was the first time i updated and it also downloaded an update that significantly improved the display in the screen.
In small ways.Instead of backing up and doing all those thing, i thought why not download Updates that is installable in offline mode.
Have you tried to remove all updates/patches/downloads that are linked to sysinternals and retry? All the tools on the SysInternals website are also available as separate downloads, but also as one whole zipped archive. Then it is called: SysInternals Suite and this 23MByte download (give or take) shouldn't be a problem, even for bandwidth starved types of internet connection anywhere in the world.
Personally, I always download the suite whenever there is a new version of it, because I deem this software to be essential on any Windows installation. As far as I know, any of the software from SysInternals is updated irregularly, so you don't need to redownload the same tools over and over whenever you decide to use WSUS.
When taking a look at your screenshot, it appears that the WSUS software is not able to download directly from the sysinternals website. Whether that is a configuration problem on their end or on yours, is not that clear. Not to be offensive or anything, but it is more likely that the configuration mistake occurs on your end.
Please take into account that it won't be long anymore before Microsoft pulls the support plug on Windows 7 very soon, meaning that Microsoft completely stops making any patch/update/download for Windows 7. Microsoft really wants you to migrate to Windows 10 and without any type of support for Windows 7, you probably should...from a security standpoint, at least. Then there is the debate about (lack of) privacy with Windows 10...but that is a different can of worms...and there appears to be no end to that supply of cans in the future.
Anyway, after support for Windows 7 stops, your problems with Windows 7 updates through WSUS will automatically stop too. You might consider that the proverbial 'silver lining'.

A college girl supplements her income by offering her arse to the highest bidder. 2 guys call her and ask her to wear silver underwear and stiletto heel sandals.

A little Arab woman is learning hairdressing, but the parting she prefers to take care of is hers. She loves showing off her breasts in the streets or wanking off in her car, but most off all, she enjoys getting banged by two heavy dicks while her boss is away. Then, our hairdresser immediately strips off and goes wild. She's small-titted but she has a huge cock mouth in return; not only does she enjoy swallowing a thick prick up to the hilt, but above all, she also loves trying to stuff two dongs deep down her throat in one go. As soon as her partners are well aroused, she gets humped in all the directions, one rod in her fanny and the other one in her mouth. Our hairstylist is vicious!
Princess Demonia gets back to her slave, Mayu. After having tied her up with ropes and torn her apart, she starts fingering her anus. As she gets ready to sodomize her, Kotaro intervenes.

Tadashima is supposed to be shagged in turn, but overcome by a mysterious force, she manages to kill all the demons.

Fungo golf is a game involving two or more players in which they use fungo bats and baseballs and their object is to hit certain objects at a field. Fungo golf is played very similar to golf, where the player with the fewest strokes after a certain number of holes (typically nine or eighteen) wins the game. While there is no concrete history of how fungo golf was created, it has spread throughout America as a popular game especially with baseball players and coaches.

42 AFLOAT.com.au May 2015 ON THE WATER with David Lockwood How do you go boating in 2° Celsius? That’s the question I’m facing. With a bitter alpine blast along the coast, the relative outside temperature is less than half the actual. Worse, waves are forecast to hit five metres offshore. And there’s a small-boat and rock fishing warning. But one needs to be prepared for more of this weather On The Water this season. The good news is that, properly prepared – with safety and sensibility foremost in mind –the not-so -off-season offers rich pickings afloat. By necessity, and that of our boat’s engines and systems, we’ve become practised at it. One needs to change their mindset and toughen up a bit for starters. After all, our winters are a breeze compared to those in other parts of the world where they must ‘winterize’ their boats. To embrace and enjoy your winter boating opportunities, start with some decent attire. Go for a thermal wool base- layer washed in Cuddly hard-up against your skin, a performance Polarfleece-type (polyethylene terephthalate) second layer as they’re light and wick moisture, then a jacket ... Make a lifejacket imperative, as per legal requirements and even beyond that, and a compact inflatable yoke won’t hinder your fishing or sailing activities on deck. Serious foul-weather gear, or ‘ foullies’ as they’re affectionately known in the weather-challenged UK, are another good investment. I have no arrangement with Tasmanian- based Stormy Lifejackets, but I do advance the view that these are the duck’s guts of winter jackets, incorporating full-blown (when you hit the water) lifejackets or offshore-rated PFDs in the garment. If you plan to go winter boating offshore then get one, a personal EPIRB and clip-on strobe. Beyond the safety aspects of winter boating, your comfort factor is key. Layered clothing lets you dress-up or down to meet the conditions. Fingerless gloves, especially if you’re tugging on Spectra and Dyneema polyethylene sheets, and some form of headdress are essential. It’s hard to beat a beanie, but in really cold climes seaboots are necessary, especially when sitting on the rail to Hobart, trust me. Suitably attired, you’re set to go. Well not quite. Forget the esky and add the thermos. Pack a curry or something from the slow cooker. Cryovac your meals flat for easy packing on board, reheat and eat. A stovetop and some boiling water is all you need. Did someone mention Irish Coffee? Heck yeah. Give the offshore scene a wide berth if it’s howling from the southwest as it is right now, but do enjoy the inshore fishing, cruising, racing, reaching, sun catching and waterfront dining. Raft-up for a chummy onboard dinner party, enjoy some “me” time with a book, or some wholesome family boating with some board games or a movie. Just being aboard is transformative enough in winter. For the hardcore-fishing crowd, such softcore options don’t resonate much at all. Winter fishing is all about a whole lot of other outstanding opportunities and they aren’t lost on boat builders. In fact, there’s been something of a trailerboat assault by the latitude-challenged yards here and across the Tasman in recent years. SPORTSFISHING BOATS Sportsfishing boats with cabins, hardtops and enclosed helms stations are all the rage. I ’ve been on some timely tests on a bunch of these craft as recently as yesterday in the winter wildness. Chatting to the boat builder, his success and sales at this time of year hinge on the quality of the winter fishing. Prized species like southern bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna, billfish including the emerging Tassie broadbill fishery, snapper in Port Phillip Bay, and other tablefish like kingfish, blue-eye, and hapuka all drive boating activity. Some of the aluminium trailerboats on the market today are the most comfortable ever built for winter fishing. Their protected wheelhouses and fine hulls make offshore trips tenable. The list is long and includes Stabicraft from Invercargill in the frigid NZ South Island, compatriots Surtees and White Make a lifejacket imperative, a compact inflatable yoke won’t hinder your fishing activities.

We're not the only ones who like to photobomb pictures. From Jennifer Lawrence to Dustin Hoffman, People Magazine reminds us that even celebrities like to have their fun on the red carpet.
Last week, Glamour staffers gathered for their annual editorial meeting, which is usually a time for editors to draw inspiration from a speaker handpicked by editor in chief Cindi Leive before they head into the busy fall season.
ELLE, Teen Vogue, InStyle. If it seems that Danielle Prescod’s résumé reads like the ideal magazine subscription round-up, you would be right.
“In the day and age of “print is dead” we really feel that there’s still a place for print. I work with a group of very young editors who still love print and who still value print. We still believe that if you create something that is well done and artfully put together and you produce it with good, high-quality, there is still a place for print. Print is not dead exclamation point.” Pamela Jaccarino.

As sidedoor visits continue to dominate publishers’ traffic, many are coming up with new ways of holding onto — or at the very least extracting more value from — their mobile readers. For the likes of The New York Times, Huffington Post and Quartz, one successful tactic is the “read full story” button, which appears within articles after a few paragraphs for mobile readers.
Big media companies used to insist that cord-cutters — people dropping pay TV for Internet video — were a myth. Then they said cord-cutting might exist, but only in edge cases. Then they said they were more interested in cord-nevers — people who had yet to sign up for pay TV.
There’s nothing abstract about the height or width of an ad – those dimensions can be quantified. We believe the same about media quality. If you’re not measuring this third dimension, media quality, your campaign is missing its full potential. And you’re not getting the most value for every dollar you spend. Integral Ad Science offers a comprehensive suite of tools that gives buyers and sellers actionable intelligence on a wide variety of media quality data such as Viewability, Fraud, and Brand Safety. We’ve also created a proprietary holistic quality measurement called TRAQ Score, which combines multiple elements of media quality into one simple aggregate number.

The New Yorker's David Remnick writes: Four nights a week for sixteen years, Jon Stewart, the host and impresario of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” has taken to the air to expose our civic bizarreries. He has been heroic and persistent. Blasted into orbit by a trumped-up (if you will) impeachment and a stolen Presidential election, and then rocketing through the war in Iraq and right up to the current electoral circus, with its commodious clown car teeming with would-be Commanders-in-Chief, Stewart has lasered away the layers of hypocrisy in politics and in the media. On any given night, a quick montage of absurdist video clips culled from cable or network news followed by Stewart’s vaudeville reactions can be ten times as deflating to the self-regard of the powerful as any solemn editorial—and twice as illuminating as the purportedly non-fake news that provides his fuel.

When a fool comes into the study hall and sees everyone busy learning, he asks, “How does a person start learning Torah?” They tell him: “First he learns to read. Then he studies the Five Books of Moses, then the Prophets, then the rest of the written Torah, then he goes on to the Oral Torah, the Talmud, the laws and the aggada.” The fool says, “When will I ever learn all this?” and he runs away. But the wise man studies a chapter a day until he completes the entire Torah. (Midrash Rabba Devarim 8:3)

Starting at the downtown meeting point this tour takes us past Thumb Butte and towards West Spruce Mountain. The trail starts with some demanding driving and some wheels in the air a bit at certain spots. We work our way up through the Forest and always have little “windows” in the trees for excellent views of the Thumb Butte, City of Prescott, Granite dells with Watson Lake, Glassford Hills, Mingus Mountain and the San Francisco Peaks in the distance. After passing the peak at about 6700ft elevation we go downhill on the other side of the mountain range and soon the Forest opens up for breathtaking views of the lower desert, Skull Valley and Granite Mountain. We continue to our final lookout which surrounds us by Manzanita trees as tall as the truck and other awesome desert vegetation. After a short photo break we head back up into the Forest and take a small turn off to a hidden place with very old, huge Alligator Juniper trees and cactus growth. Incredible views make for a nice background while having a snack and rest a bit. The return trip on the trail then takes only about 20 minutes back to paved road and then we head back into town.

So, you're keen to gain access to photography? Well extreme lightning, now is a good an occasion as any high-power cameras have never been more affordable. You probably have a lot of questions on how to start and where to start, but don't worry, this short article will help. The following are some pointers that may help you begin with your photography aspirations.
Find out about composition rules. Practice and try out these rules to generate unique pictures. For example, organizing an image around diagonal lines gives an impact of depth. You can also fiddle with colors and gradual nuances to provide an impact of motion to your picture. Do not adhere to the rules blindly, but learn the best time to utilize them.
Pay attention to natural lighting. You may need to use your flash feature or install additional types of light, but you can utilize natural lighting to produce interesting effects with light and shadow. Position your subject accordingly. Ensure that the photograph is not too dark or too bright.
Use a tripod for maximum camera stability. For random shots of your own kids or buildings, a certain amount of camera shake isn't a major deal, however for once-in-a-lifetime shots that basically matter, a bit of camera shake can ruin an ideal memory. If your tripod is not available, try setting the digital camera over a flat surface.
Make use of the right lens to do the job. When you are photographing a landscape, for instance, you require a wide-angle lens that will allow you to capture the maximum amount of of the scene as you can, while sports events generally need a telephoto lens that allow you to capture faraway players in high detail. Being aware what lens to decide on can certainly make it much better to produce quality photos.
When taking a picture, make an effort to take one in a medium distance and then take one closer. You could decide at a later time a picture could have looked better had you taken it a little bit closer. Also, try to make certain your subject is toward the core of the image.
Before you take that picture, ensure it is going to enhance the most effective inside your subject! Get yourself a sense of the backgrounds of all your shots. Know about things nearby and then in the space. Also, use that eye of yours to find out how color will contrast with the main topic of your photo. In case the background and subject don't mesh well, you should find another spot!
Do not shoot 100 % daylight. You might find some good of your respective best photos by using an overcast day. The brilliant sunlight might cause overexposure, loss in detail and terrible shadows. Shoot at dusk or at dawn on days that are not cloudy for optimum leads to your photos.
You need to be quick! Work towards your reflexes to help you take faster pictures! It will take practice, but you need to get quick together with your equipment. Don't let a once in a lifetime shot pass you by since you were busy fumbling with cases and caps. Find portable camera storage which will provide quick access.
When arranging a shot, try to "frame" it. Not just a physical frame, only one which is totally natural. You may create frames which can be natural seeking your photography subjects by closely scrutinizing the nearby area. You can use this in an effort to practice photograph composition.
Fiddle with lens distortion. Most photographs use portrait lenses or zoom lenses to focus on a physical object, and make use of a wide-angle lens for landscapes etc. Using a lens to get a different use than its intended one, you will definitely get an extremely original photograph. Will not let this become your thing: learn when you are able make use of an original lens.
Pay careful focus on backgrounds when composing your photographs. Jumbled, messy rooms can ruin a graphic and prevent your subject from standing out. Also, even the smallest item within variety of the snapshot could be a distraction, taking from the central focus. Always make a quick scan of your room or landscape, then remove products which will detract from an otherwise perfect shot.
A wonderful tip that will make the photographs more interesting is to start utilizing patterns. Patterns is surely an excellent design motif if you are using them correctly. You can get patterns on just about everything. You can get them on plenty of clothes, in architecture, as well as nature.
An excellent rule of thumb in relation to choosing settings on the camera is to decide on the top quality settings that take up more room on your own memory card. The reduced settings will not provide for quality printing, especially if you want to enlarge them. When shooting in a high resolution, you can always lower it later for sending via email or displaying online.
Are you currently itching to shoot some dewy, rain-spattered subjects? Try to create the effect of rain on your own by carrying a rain bottle along with you.
Action shots can be quite challenging to capture correctly. When you can though, you are able to predict the region where action is going to be going next, and you can try to start taking shots here as the action approaches this particular area. It will help if you focus on something inside the shot.
A fantastic photography tip that can help you out is usually to only show people a sample of your own work when you're trying to find a critique. Don't just dump a massive assortment of photographs down because nobody wants to invest time undergoing them. Pick your best photographs.
An incredible photography trick that may make the photographs more interesting would be to always attempt to tell a story. Try to always be considering what type of story it is possible to inject in your photographs. You may even require a sequence of shots that tell a narrative.
When photographing birds or some other easily frightened animals, take advantage of the zoom feature in your camera. Remember that they can often times have a nest with offspring nearby. To be able to deflect attention in the nest area, birds will probably fly away with the slightest noise. For those who have an SLR camera with all the ability of changing lenses, use the best zoom which you have to get multiple shots prior to being detected by the subject.
Use a lot of different solutions to take good shots. Everybody can wind up useful photographic advice, but some people will benefit more from certain techniques than others. The information included in the following paragraphs are a fun way to begin taking memorable photographs.

In the evening before the day her son left for college, Bailey felt that the right moment has come to seduce him. They were sitting on the sofa and talking about the impending journey, when she suddenly lifted his shirt and started sucking his nipple feeling a growing bulge rubbing towards her tits. They were going to have a sleepless night full of hot caressing and wild sex.
Nothing can possibly stop a voracious mother if she decides to seduce her son. She knows him perfectly and her eventful life has taught her how to seduce any guy in less than five minutes. Innocent massage turned into hot petting and then wild passionate sex.
Horny son decides to shoot his mother and hides behind the curtains taking hot snaps of her ass, when she bends down to polish the sideboard. She notices him and eagerly poses in front of camera, but soon the posing turns into a striptease and then into a passionate orgy of a lewd mother and her horny son.
Unable to control his passion for his charming mother any longer, Dirk approached her from behind, grasped her by the waist and ran his trembling hands over her huge boobs. She turned around helping him to remove her dress and told him to lie down. She then climbed onto the bed, removed his pants and began sucking his cock preparing it for her insatiable pussy.
Megan was sitting in front of the mirror in sexy white lingerie and drinking whiskey. She couldn't stop imagining a thick stiff cock plunging into her dripping cunt, when her son went into the room and sat in front of her on the table. He stared at her barely naked body with a hungry and lustful glance and then pushed his foot between her thighs and began rubbing his toes over her wet panties. She groaned with lust and tossed him onto the bed and climbed over him unable to restrain her wild passion any longer.
Kyle went to mother's room and said that he fell in love with a cute girl, but has no idea how to seduce her. Amanda smiled him and said that seduction is an easy thing and she could teach him some tricks if he wants. She asked him to sit down and started licking his neck and taking off his shirt. During the evening Kyle learned many lessons of seduction and passionate sex.
Brianna went to her son's bedroom, got undressed and slid under the blanket. Both mother and son professed their love and gently caressed each other, his hands exploring her gorgeous breasts, sides, buttocks, thighs. She cupped his chest with her hands, trailed fingernails down his back, and squeezed his buttocks. Taking the lead, she rolled her son onto his back and led him to the ecstasy.
Megan was reading a magazine and called her son to show him a hot nude picture she found. It was a busty topless beauty and Jim got quickly aroused. He could feel his cock hardening in his pants, but his lewd mother noticed it too. She deftly fished his cock out of his jeans and wrapped it with her lips so sweetly that Jim couldn't resist enjoying the rest of her body to the fullest.
Isabel looked at her handsome sons that were sitting on the couch watching TV and realized that she couldn't restrain a sudden urge to taste their cocks with her cum-thirsty mouth and soaking wet cunt. She sat down between them and began gently stroking their thighs feeling their cocks hardening under her hands. They boys needed no additional motivation and pounced on their sexy mother fulfilling even her dirtiest desires.
Morgan came to her son's bedroom to wake him up and found him watching porn. She sat next to him on the bed pretending like nothing extraordinary happened and asked him if he likes it. Marcus felt confused, but she repeated the question and he silently nodded his head. She took his hand, put it on her tits and told that she will try to help fulfilling his desires.

For many years (basically for as long as I’ve had kids) I have spoken out against the existence of glitter, not just as a crafting supply, but as a general sparkly covering in all kinds of girls’ accessories. It has been called “the herpes of the craft world,” and there have even been entire prank…

What program do you use to chart your graphs? I have been searching for one that I can manipulate and have had no luck.
Hi, Paula. I actually use a Microsof program called Publisher. It is not a "crochet" program, but an editing/publishing one. I learned to use it at work, and I like it a lot. It takes a lot of cut/paste/grouping, but I find it easier to use than other programs. I hope this helps :-)

The campaign will see all new Honda ATV and Pioneer utility machines purchased after 1st November 2018 fitted with state-of-the-art tracking equipment free-of-charge.
Customers will have the option of adding on Datatool’s TQA-approved TrakKING Adventure package, which uses GPS chip set technology to offer theft protection, instant notifications and full journey history logging. The only cost to the customer is a monitoring subscription of £9.95 per month or £109 for a year (incl VAT).
A key safety feature in the Datatool package is the ‘G Sense’ impact alert notifications, which use a highly-sensitive 3D accelerometer to detect rollovers or high g-force impacts and alert an emergency contact via SMS - ideal for those working by themselves in remote locations. The system also includes location-based alerts, which automatically send a notification when the vehicle leaves a specified area.
To celebrate the partnership, Honda is offering Pioneer customers a half-cab for £999 outright (a saving of up to £880) until the end of March 2019. Comprising a hard roof, glass windshield, hard rear panel and windshield wiper/washer kit, the company says the option adds additional comfort and usability to their utility vehicle.
Andrew Parr, sales operations department manager at Honda (UK), said, “According to insight from NFU Mutual, the cost of rural crime has increased by 13.4% since 2016 alone - costing the UK some £44.5 million every year. The problems faced by rural communities are growing, meaning more needs to be done to improve crime prevention measures.
“We take security incredibly seriously and wanted to highlight the positive role manufacturers can play in tackling rural crime. Our partnership with Datatool is the latest in a long line of initiatives to lead the way in all-terrain security."
Accredited as a ‘Secured by Design’ product by the Police Service, TrakKING meets the highest security standards and has been specifically developed to deter theft, provide around-the-clock location visibility and aid recovery. Typically retailing at £349 (including installation), Honda say the system sets the standards in state-of-the-art 24/7/365 monitoring.
Dave Plummer, Datatool brand manager at Scorpion Automotive, added, “Fitting a tracking device to your all-terrain vehicle is not only a significant theft deterrent, but also looked upon highly favourably by leading insurance companies. We’re proud to partner with Honda in the roll-out such an important initiative to help prevent rural crime nationwide.”

However, with many items being available on the internet how do you really know how you choose? It must be impossible to contact someone to speak to, when you do, they have little understanding of the product and simply know the basics, it helps you to make a good choice then.
LEDs, with their many advantages including energy efficiency, longevity, durability and controllability, are now playing an important role in most forms of lighting.

marketplace indicate a wide variation in product quality and how effectively they may illuminate a space. Some lower quality LEDs sold may not provide sufficient
It’s not enough to simply look on their website or read their blogs and news pages. It’s all too easy nowadays to have a professional looking website telling you just how great they are.

Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve is regarded as one of the most important areas in terms of biodiversity in the island of Samar and within the greater Mindanao faunal region. Four study sites representing different habitat types, elevation range and degree of human disturbance were surveyed for their faunal composition. Standard faunal survey methods such as transect survey, mist netting, and trapping were used during the entire duration of the study. The methods were augmented with observations and ethnobiological interviews.
Of the 98 species of wild fauna recorded from the site, 41 species are birds, 11 are mammals, 6 amphibians and 12 reptiles. The 41 species of birds belong to 12 orders, 25 families and 35 genera. Of these, twenty-nine percent are endemic to the Philippines and one to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Among avian species, sixteen (40%) are considered threatened or at risk.
Of the 11 mammals, which belong to 6 orders and 9 families, 64% are endemic to the country. Three (42%) of these are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Five (46%) of these species are considered threatened or at risk.
Of the 6 species of amphibians recorded, 2 are introduced and the rest are native to the Philippines. Of the 12 reptiles species, five (42%) are endemic to the country and 2 are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Among herpetofauna, only one species is considered threatened or at risk.
Major threats to the wildlife population in the reserve include hunting and habitat alteration. Hunting among the local community is not only for subsistence but also for commercial purposes. Major activities leading to habitat destruction include conversion of logged-over areas into cultivation, illegal logging and indiscriminate collection of other forest products.
Being home to many species of fauna of national and international significance, Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve needs to be managed and protected from the various forms of unsustainable resources exploitation.
The Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve is located in the southern part of the island of Samar and lies within the coordinates 11�22'N and 125�20'E. Having an area of about 4,055 hectares, it was declared as a watershed forest reserve through Proclamation Number 106 on 10 December 1992, for inclusion in the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) by virtue of R.A. 7586 (DENR, 2003). It is under the administrative jurisdiction of the municipality of Lawaan, Eastern Samar.
Samar is within the greater Mindanao faunal region. This faunal region is comprised of Mindanao Island and all islands that were connected to it at low sea level periods of the Pleistocene such as Samar, Leyte, Bohol, Basilan, Dinagat and Siargao. Considered biologically the richest and one of the most distinctive in the Philippines, this faunal region contains at least 29 species of endemic birds and 26 species of endemic mammals (DENR, 1997).
Recently, the Birdlife International and the Haribon Foundation (Mallari et al 2001) recognized Samar as an endemic bird area with three important bird areas (IBA), one of which is the Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve. Avifaunal diversity survey in this IBA however is still in the pipeline due to some constraints.
The wild fauna of the Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve is still virtually unknown. The extensive forests in this reserve must support important populations of several of the threatened and endemic species of the greater Mindanao faunal region. With the current resource utilization patterns, which are responsible for the degradation of highly sensitive and fragile ecosystems in this landscape, the biodiversity is likely to be heavily affected. The study is a modest attempt to determine the existing faunal biodiversity, which must have resulted from the constant interaction between the local community and the resources base. The study is timely and significant, as it would serve as valuable input in formulating integrated conservation strategies that would promote biodiversity conservation at the same time address the economic needs of the local communities.
Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve is adjacent to the MacArthur Mountains, and straddles the boundary of Samar and Eastern Samar Provinces. The highest peak is Mt Honop at 731 m. The northern and western boundaries of the IBA approximately follow the Sulat River. Closed canopy lowland dipterocarp forest covers c.2,624 ha (65%) of the watershed, open canopy lowland dipterocarp forest covers c.952 ha (24%), cultivated areas with brush cover c.208 ha (5%), coconut plantations cover c.171 ha (4%) and contract reforestation plots (planted with exotic tree species) cover c.100 ha (2%). There are a few small settlements present in the area, and the small patches of agricultural land and kaingin are planted with coconut, banana and fruit trees (Mallari et al 2001).
The wildlife inventory (rapid assessment) of Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve was conducted on January 3 to 6 and February 18 to 22, 2003.
Sampling in the area was done in four sites, which cover different habitat types, disturbance levels and altitudinal gradients. Sampling site 1 was located in a heavily disturbed lower mountane forest dominated by agricultural cultivation particular devoted to coconut below 100 meters above sea level (masl). Sampling site 2 was situated in a disturbed lower montane forest dominated by cultivated areas with patches of secondary forest and regeneration areas between 100 and 200 masl. Sampling site 3 was located in the upper montane forest with patches of primary and secondary forests, reforestation, and cultivation between 200 and 300 masl. Sampling site 4 was situated in the less disturbed upper montane forest dominated by a mix of primary and secondary forests with patches of regeneration and active cultivation from 300 to 400 masl.
Rapid assessment of faunal diversity was employed in the conduct of inventory of all four major vertebrate groups (reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals) within the Bulusao Watershed Forest Reserve. Different techniques or methods of faunal inventory include trapping of non-volant mammals, mist netting of non-volant mammals, and transect survey of birds, reptiles and amphibians. Indirect methods of faunal survey such as footprints, fecal droppings, roosting and nesting sites, other physical evidences and ethnobiological interviews that may indicate the probable presence of wildlife in the area were also employed.
Composition and distribution of avian species were assessed using the transect survey method based on Mallari (1992). Transect lines measuring 2 kilometers each were set in every sampling site. The number of transect lines in each sampling site vary depending upon the variability of the sites. All species of birds encountered along the transects were recorded. For each species seen or heard, the following information were noted: species name, number of individuals, and habitat types. The avifaunal inventory was conducted early in the morning (from 6:00 to 9:00) and late in the afternoon (from 3:00 to 6:00). Identification was up to the species level whenever possible. Nomenclature and classification were based on Kennedy et al (2000).
Sampling sites cover different habitat types, disturbance levels and altitudinal gradients. The Sorensen's Index of Similarity (Magurran, 1988) was used to compare species composition between sampling sites. Similarity values (expressed in percentage) were calculated using the following equation:
Species richness for each sampling site was measured using Menhinick's Richness Index (Magurran, 1988) with the following equation:
The overall pattern of species richness in each site was determined by plotting the values of species richness indices against the sampling sites in a line graph.
The overall pattern of species diversity was determined by plotting computed Shannon diversity indices of sampling sites in a line graph.
Mist nets for volant mammals and live traps for non-volant mammals were used in mammalian survey. Nomenclature and classification were based on Rabor (1986).
Mist-netting stations were set up in strategic locations either singly or a series and operated for days in specific study sites. Each net has an average mesh size of 36 mm and an average height of 2 meters. Nets were set 2 meter high with a ground clearance of about 0.5 meter. Species captured were identified up to the species level whenever possible.
Trapping of non-volant mammals involved setting of cage traps baited with cooked coconut meat, sliced ripe mango or dried fish, on the ground near fallen logs or holes, along possible runways or root system of trees or stumps. Similarly, trapped or captured animals were identified up to the species level whenever possible.
Tracks and fecal matters were also used to estimate the presence of wildlife in each transect route used in avifaunal survey.
Random sampling along the transect route used for avifaunal survey for reptiles and amphibians was done whenever possible. Sampling was done along streams, rivers or near bodies of water or any site believed to be harborages of herpetofauna. Animals were either collected by hand or captured by nets for further verification. Nomenclature and classification was based on Alcala (1986) and Alcala and Brown (1998).
Ethnobiological interviews were conducted to determine the presence of other vertebrates that were not recorded during the field observations. Information on vernacular or local names, habitat type, socioeconomic importance and other patterns of behavior were noted. Other activities related to the overall decline or loss of wildlife species in the area were also recorded.
A total of 41 bird species were recorded in the four study sites primarily based on transect survey results (Table 1). These species belong to 12 orders, 25 families and 35 genera. The most represented order is Passeriformes with 18 species belonging to 13 families. The second most represented order is Columbiformes with 8 species belonging to two families. This is followed by four orders represented by two species each: Coraciliformes, Cuculiformes, Psittaciformes and Stringiformes.
Columbidae is the most represented family with 5 species of dove and 1 species of pigeon. It is followed by family Pycnonotidae with three species of bulbul. Most Columbidae species are frugivoruos and are often encountered in brushlands bordering secondary forest areas. Their ability as good agents for seed dispersal enables them to play vital role in the forest ecosystem.
Of the 41 avian species recorded in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve, twelve (29%) are endemic to the Philippines. Only one is endemic to Samar and the rest of Greater Mindanao faunal region.
The distribution of bird species in the four sites is shown in Table 2. Site 3 had the highest number of species with a total of 31; site 2 had the lowest with 16. Site 1 and 4 had 23 and 20 species, respectively.
Six species were found to be present in the four sites and are considered common. Nine species were recorded in a single site only. The rest (26) were observed either in 2 or in 3 sites.
Most frequently occurring and most abundant species were the bulbuls and the sunbirds. Most of these species are either insectivorous, or nectivorous or both. The presence of dense undergrowth in regeneration areas which harbor high insect population and the availability of fruit-bearing (mostly pioneer) tree species across the four sites warrant the steady supply of food for these group of birds species.
Of the nine species, which appeared to be in their restricted range as they were recorded in a single site only, the Philippine Grass-owl (Tyto capensis) was the only avian species observed in Site 1 where there are vast grasslands near active cultivation.
Green Imperial Pigeon (Ducula aenea), Dark Throated Oriole (Oriolus xanthonotus), Yellowish Bulbul (Hypsipetes everetti), White Collard Kingfisher (Halcyon chloris), Common Moorhen (Gallinula Chloropus) and Asian Glossy Starling (Aplonis panayensis) were observed only in Site 3. Green Imperial Pigeon, Dark Throated Oriole and Yellowish Bulbul were observed deep in the interior of intergrading secondary and primary forests. White Collard Kingfisher and Common Moorhen were found in relatively open area near a creek. Surprisingly, several Asian Glossy Starlings were observed in a reforestation site feeding on the fruits of buntan (Engelhardia rigida), a naturally occurring pioneer species in reforestation sites.
Steere's Pitta (Pitta steerii), Philippine Tailorbird (Orthothomus castaneiceps) and Philippine Eagle-owl (Bubo philippensis) were all observed in Site 4 only. Steere's Pitta and Philippine Tailorbird were observed in the interior of primary forest while Philippine Eagle-owl was observed in the edge of a primary forest near a headwater of a creek.
Table 1. List of avian taxa recorded in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve, Lawaan, Eastern Samar, c. 2003 (See table)
The similarity indices of the 4 sites are shown in Table 3. Site 1 and 3 had the highest index of similarity (74%). Site 2 and 3 ranked second (63%) while site 1 and 4 had the lowest percentage (46%).
The similarity in terms of degree of habitat heterogeneity and the habitat types present could explain the high similarity between Site 1 and 3. These sites were composed mainly of a combination of secondary forests, agricultural cultivation, and regeneration areas under coconut plantations. This combination of habitats provided adequate and quality food sources to a many species of birds particularly those with broad food preference and wide altitudinal range. Dense under growth of secondary forests and regeneration areas supports high diversity of insects and fruits, which are the primary sources of food of these bird species.
The low similarity of Site 4 when compared to the rest of the sites could be attributed to the difference in habitat types and structural complexity. Site 4 being at the highest altitudinal range among the four sites, was composed mainly of a mix of primary and secondary forests and small openings in cultivation areas. The less structural complexity associated to this site condition made it fit to harbor mostly interior bird species, which are usually adapted to the secondary and primary forests.
As shown in Table 4, site 4 had the highest species richness of 1.61 with 156 individual belonging to 20 species. Site 2 had the lowest species richness of 1.43 with 125 individuals belonging to only 16 species. Figure 1 shows that generally species richness increases with elevation.
The increasing trend in species richness along altitudinal gradient could be due to the decreasing abundance of individuals in a species and the increasing number of species. The decrease in the number of individuals per species could be a result of limited amount of food for a specific species. The limited amount of food inhibits increase of species population especially that of specialist species. The increasing number of species could be attributed to the decreasing degree of disturbance along altitudinal gradient. Site 2 was highly disturbed and highly homogenous because it was close to settlements and areas under cultivation. Site 4, on the other hand, was situated far from settlement thus less disturbed and probably must support a variety of small niches for specialization.
Site 1, on the other hand, had the highest diversity while site 4 had the lowest. Species diversity generally decreases with elevation (Figure 2). The decreasing diversity along altitudinal gradient could be due to the decreasing evenness of distribution of individuals among species and the increasing dominance of few aggressive species. In site 1, aside from the high abundance due to the seemingly unlimited and highly diverse food materials because of overlapping habitats, individuals were evenly distributed among the different species. In site 4 where food materials were of limited supply due to less diverse habitats and less structural complexity, some species tend to dominate thereby decreasing the evenness. As a result of stiff competition, the disadvantaged species would be restricted to expand its food preferences thus would tend to specialize.
Conservation status of avian species recorded in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve is presented in Table 5. The conservation status of at least twenty-four species appeared in various literature such as the IUCN Red List Category of Species, CITES, and Birdlife International and Haribon Foundation. Of the twenty species recognized by IUCN, 16 were considered near threatened (nt), 2 vulnerable (VU), 1 lower risk (LR) and 1 endangered (E). Under CITES, 4 were listed in Appendix II and 1 in Appendix I. The Birdlife and Haribon Foundation recognized 1 as threatened, 1 restricted and 1 threatened and restricted to Samar only.
The Birdlife International and Haribon Foundation has recognized the whole island of Samar as endemic bird area (EBA) in Mallari et al (2001). The Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve was recognized as one its important bird areas (IBA) in the Southern Samar mountains along with Mt Yacgun-Mt Sohoton complex, and Mt Cabalantian-Mt Capoto-an complex. The different bird species found in Samar Island as reported by Mallari et al (2001) is presented in Table 6. Unfortunately, only three species encountered in the field survey were included in the list. This calls for a thorough and intensive survey to determine what is actually left of the bird biodiversity of Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve.
One important species that has been observed in the area was the Rufous Hornbill (Buceros hydrocorax), which normally inhabits secondary and primary forests. This species, however, was observed in flocks of six to ten individuals perching on a toog (Petersianthus quadrialatus) tree in an active cultivation near a falls. Toog, the tallest tree in most cultivated fields in the area, is usually left uncut during logging operation because of its poor lumber quality. This avian species is recognized as Lower Risk species by IUCN and listed in CITES Appendix II.
Another important species that has been observed in the area was the Tariktik Hornbill (Penelopides panini), which is considered Endangered by the IUCN and CITES Appendix II. A local resident had caught one individual of this bird species during the field survey. Sadly, the bird has suffered gunshot from an air rifle. This species is primarily hunted for its meat.
Table 6. Threatened and restricted-ranged bird species found in Samar Island as reported by Mallari et al (2001). Highlighted cells indicate avifauna species observed during the avian survey.(See table)
A total of 11 mammals were recorded in four study sites (Table 7). These belong to 6 orders and nine families. Five species were observed during the field survey and six were discerned from ethnobiological interviews. Of these 11 mammals, seven (64%) are endemic to the Philippines of which 3 (42%) are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region.
Three of the species were considered Vulnerable by IUCN (Table 8). These include the Philippine Warty Pig, Common Palm Civet and Philippine Flying Lemur. The Philippine Tarsier is considered as Conservation Dependent. Only the Philippine Macaque is listed under CITES Appendix II.
Several tracts and fecal matters of Philippine warty pigs were observed in most transect routes used in the avifaunal survey. Snares and traps intended for this animal were likewise encountered validating its presence in three of the four study sites. In one makeshift hut encountered along a transect route, several jaws of wild pig was noted along with a couple of bills of hornbills.
A Common Palm Civet was captured by one of the field guides whose residence was located at the edge of a regeneration area near his farm. Local residents usually capture this animal because it destroys livestock particularly chicken.
Philippine Flying Lemur was observed in one study site. The animal was observed at dusk in a small open area close to a secondary forest. Dried skin of monkey was also noted in one makeshift hut in the same spot, which was according to local key informants would be used as bait for wild pig hunting.
Philippine Field Rat was observed in 3 study sites. Trapping success however was considered low even in areas adjacent to active cultivation. Key informants attributed this low abundance of rats to the presence of a good number of predators in the area particularly the Philippine cobra and raptors.
Table 7. Partial list of mammalian species recorded in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve, Lawaan, Eastern Samar, c. 2003.(See table)
Other mammals recorded were based on ethnobiological account. The presence of other mammalian species cannot be strongly ascertained because of insufficient evidence.
A total of six species of amphibians belonging to three families were observed in the four study sites in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve (Table 8). Of these, five were encountered during field observation and only one was discerned from ethnobiological interviews. Of the six species, two are introduced (Bufo marinus and Rana erythraea) and the rest are native. All the three species of Ranids are associated to bodies of water. The Common Tree Frog (Polypedatus leucomystax) occupies a wide variety of habitats from open areas near cultivation to forest interior. The Giant American Toad (Bufo marinus) is a cosmopolitan species and oftentimes seen in agricultural and other disturbed areas.
Of the 11 reptiles belonging to seven families recorded from the different study sites, nine were encountered during field observations while the rest were discerned from ethnobiological interviews (Table 9). Of these, five (45%) are endemic to the Philippines with only one endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region.
The Malayan Freshwater Turtle is associated to bodies of water from highly disturbed areas near cultivation to the forest interior. All the species of geckos and lizards were seen in or close to human dwellings. One species of skinks is common in coconut plantations and other one is common secondary and primary forest.
Reticulated Python is found in a variety of habitats. During the conduct of faunal survey, a juvenile individual was observed in the possession of a local resident. The local residents confirmed the presence of two species of cobra in the area. This was primarily the reason why the observers were not able to find the roosting place of giant fruit bats in the area, which according key informants, are abundant in one specific location in the area. Local guides and key informants refused to accompany the observers to these roasting sites for fear of encountering cobras. The Samar Cobra is a subspecies of the Philippine Cobra endemic to the place and the greater Mindanao faunal region (Alcala, 1986).
The presence of Monitor Lizard in the area was manifested by the skin of the animal chanced upon by the observers in a makeshift hut in one of the study sites. Key informants revealed that the skin would be used as bait in hunting wild pig. The Sailfin Water Lizard was captured alive in one of the study sites near a creek.
In Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve, the most serious threat to wildlife is hunting. Wildlife is not just hunted for subsistence but also for commercial use. The primary target species are the big games particularly wild pig and deer because of their large amount of meat per catch and the associated high price if traded commercially. The population of deer however has declined tremendously in recent years according to local informants, so that most commercial hunters in the area focus only in the pursuit of wild pig. With the changing trend from subsistence to commercial hunting in wild pig, sophistication in hunting techniques has also improved to increase catch per hunting effort.
During most desperate hunting trips, monkeys are hunted just to compensate time and effort used in hunting. Other mammals like Palm Civet and Malay Civet are hunted occasionally to prevent crop and livestock depredation.
Birds are not just hunted for food but also sold live as pet in the market. Most preferred bird for hunting is the Jungle Fowl (Gallus gallus) followed by the doves and pigeons owing to their large meat. Key informants revealed that a good number of local hunters possessed air rifle for hunting birds. Most preferred birds collected for pet trade are Colasisi (Loriculus philippensis) and Blue-naped Parrot (Tanygnathus lucionensis). Several individuals of White-eared Brown Fruit Dove (Phapitreron leucotis) were observed in the possession of local residents. These will be used as live lure in hunting the same species.
Among herpetofaunal species, only the Monitor Lizard is considered by the local people as an important hunting target for its meat and skin. Another economically important reptile is the Sailfin Water Lizard, which is hunted for its meat. Occasionally, local residents are able to catch Reticulated Python for its meat. Local people are not mindful about the amphibians probably because edible frogs are still abundant in the locality.
Habitat alteration is another threat to wildlife in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve. The conversion of forest to agricultural cultivation through slash-and -burn and illegal logging operations are serious threats to wildlife. Aside from lumber, local residents are also extracting timber to be made into boat keels, which is indirectly associated to the fishing industry in Lawaan and adjoining municipalities. Clearing of forests to some extent may be beneficial to wildlife because of increased habitat diversity and complexity. However if the trend continues, forests may be decimated to the disadvantage of those highly sensitive interior species of wildlife, which are mostly affected by the habitat transformation.
Of 668 bird species in the Philippines, 41 are recorder in Bulosao Watershed Forest Reserve. These species belong to 12 orders, 25 families and 35 genera. The most represented order is Passeriformes with 18 species belonging to 13 families. The second most represented order is Columbiformes with 8 species belonging to two families. Columbidae and Pycnonotidae is the most represented family.
Of the 41 avian species recorded in the Reserve, twenty-nine percent are endemic to the Philippines. Only one is endemic to Samar and the rest of Greater Mindanao faunal region.
Twenty species of birds are included in the IUCN Red List Category. Of these, 16 are considered near Threatened, 2 Vulnerable, 1 Lower risk and 1 Endangered. Under CITES, 4 were listed in Appendix II and 1 in Appendix I. The Birdlife and Haribon Foundation recognized 1 as threatened, 1 restricted and 1 threatened and restricted to Samar only.
A total of 11 mammals are recorded in the reserve. These belong to 6 orders and nine families. Of these 11 mammals, sixty-four percent are endemic to the Philippines of which 3 are endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region.
Three species of mammals are considered Vulnerable and one Conservation Dependent under the IUCN. Only one is listed under CITES Appendix II.
A total of six species of amphibians belonging to three families were observed in the Reserve. Of these, two are introduced and the rest are native. Of the 11 reptiles belonging to seven families recorded from the reserve, forty-five percent are endemic to the Philippines with only 1is endemic to the greater Mindanao faunal region. Monitor Lizard is the only species of herpetofauna that is listed in CITES II.
The most serious threat to wildlife in the reserve is hunting for both subsistence and commercial purposes. With increasing trend of hunting towards commercial purposes, increased sophistication of hunting techniques for the most sought game, the wild pig, is becoming more evident in the area. The possession of air rifle of many villagers in the area also poses great threat to bird population particularly the doves and pigeons, the favorite hunting target bird species. Aside fro hunting for meat, collection of birds for the pet trade is also becoming evident.
Habitat alteration brought about by conversion of forests to agricultural cultivation through slashes and burn cultivation, continued illegal logging activities and indiscriminate collection of non-timber products in the reserve are also great threat to wildlife.
Considering the magnitude of the present and foreseeable disturbances in the reserve, there is therefore an urgent need to implement some conservation measures. Such conservation measures must integrate economical viable and socially acceptable livelihood alternatives for the local communities in order to lessen their dependence on the resources of the reserve.
Ecological studies on threatened fauna must be carried out before any conservation measures are effectively implemented. More intensive faunal survey must be done to fully account for other important species that might not have been covered by the present faunal inventory.

Vibration and shaking of steering wheel during normal driving. Replacement of the tires and numerous rebalancing have had no effect. Acura dealer is not responsive and Acura customer care has informed me this "a charateristic of the car" while at the same time admitting that "we have received numeous complaints about steering wheel vibration and our engineers are investigating the problem" I was also told there we was no timeline for resolution. Given the situation, I am growing concerned about the handling and stability of the vehicle in its current state. Acura has admitted there is a problem but has not fully disclosed the details. I am also worried because this seems to be a widespread issue affecting many TL owners given the number of web forums I have visited on the subject.
Consumer noticed that after having the tires rotated at 10,000 miles and while driving at 60 mph vehicle vibrated uncontrollably. Consumer was able to maintain control of the vehicle, and pulled over. The vehicle was taken to the dealer for inspection, and mechanic determined that the tires needed to be replaced due to tread separation.
EL42 bridgestones that came with my new 2004 Acura TL are unsafe. They flat spot and hydroplane in the rain. The tires are very unsafe in rain and they are considered "all season" they are not all season in my opinion. I lost control on a number of occasions with the EL42 bridgestones because of hydroplaning. The faltspotting causes the tires to vibrate and bounce until they warm up. The car came with the original pvc type (early build) and the dealer refused to put the new "tu@" on my car. Ratings on this tire are terrible as shown on "tirerack.com" Acura dealer refused to replace my EL42 pvc original tires with acceptable safe tires. I have no choice but to put Michelin Pilot sport all seasons on my car quickly because I do not feel safe driving this car with the EL42. Please advise- I know many people with the 2004 Acura TL are unhappy with the EL42's that came with them. The EL42's are unsafe in the rain and snow they are not all season and should be investigated agressively before people lose control and get in accidents.
This complaint refers to the original equipment tires (Bridgestone el-42, 235/45-17 93W ) supplied on the 2004 Acura TL with 6 speed manual transmission. After just a short time I have found this tire to be entirely unsafe and unsuitable to this vehicle. I believe that both Acura and Bridgestone should be held responsible for replacing this tire on all existing vehicles. This tire exhibits unsafe characteristics in wet weather, with noticeable drift and hydroplaning in any amount of standing water, even as little as 1/16 inch. In heavy rains, even with no standing water present, the tire seems incapable of dispersing water as quickly as it falls, again leading to vehicle instability. From a ride quality point of view the tire is also unsatisfactory in that it flat spots every morning, especially in cool weather but even in warmer weather as well, leading to vibrations in the initial miles of any drive. It is also especially harsh over roadway expansion joints, and is so loud on concrete pavements that it poses a safety hazard due to driver fatigue induced by the continuous noise. I also understand that there may be an issue regarding the rating as an "all season tire" with many owners reporting that this tire is virtually useless in any kind of snow conditions.

Vibration and shaking of steering wheel due to vibration and unbalanced feeling from front tires. It seems that the front wheels and/or suspension have problems that cause them be unbalanced and make driving feel uncontrolled.
Bridgestone turanza el-42 tires that are oem on my new 2004 Acura TL have serious problems with "flat spotting". this perfect car runs like a flintstone car until tires warm up and round out. Acura is replacing with same brand and model tires that are supposed to be fixed.
Tire vibration. At about 50 mph, the tires cause the entire car to vibrate. This continues at all highway speeds and does not seem to go away. I have contacted Acura several times and Acura's engineers 'are looking into it'.
Severe vibration from the factory installed Bridgestone turanza el-42 tires on my new 2004 Acura TL. The vehicle has only 1400 miles on it and has been to the dealer four times for the flat-spotting in the tires. I am concerned that these are not safe. Acura of dayton, Ohio, Acura corporate and Bridgestone say they is nothing they can do. Other 2004 Acura owners have filed complaints with Acura and there are many who have complained on various internet sites including one called tire rack.
Acura 2004 TL VIN [xxx] is a problem with the Bridgestone tire a vibration from flat spotting. Acura is aware of this on a number of vehicles. They say that there will be a fix for it soon. I am concerned about the safety of the vehicle tires. The tire problem is with many of the Acura 2004 Tls. I think the delay is not good.

Driving at highway speed, with foot on accelerator, engine stalled lost all power steering and braking capabilities (added motor oil). Violent shuddering and loss of fuel mileage (check engine light) dealer changed motormount, no success. I visited a transmission shop, they tell me it may be the torque converter as they have had to replace them on the Cadillac (known problem). I will ask for old parts if GM needs to review to redesign..

After the imposition of sentence, some defendants in Florida may ask the court for post-trial release by way of seeking what is commonly referred to as an appeal bond (also called a supersedeas bond). While “appeal bond” or “supersedeas bond” are the most commonly used terms, “post-trial release” is the official term used in the rule. No matter what title is used, the ultimate decision by the court is discretionary. The right to bail under Florida’s constitution is limited to individuals held in pre-trial detention. Florida Statute section 903.132(3) prohibits the trial court from continuing the original bond into and through the appeal process. The Florida Legislature has mandated a separate bond proceeding for detainees seeking an appeal in order “to reflect the increased risk and probability of linger time considerations.”
Several sources of authority control the appeal bond process and set forth the framework for granting appeal bonds to certain Florida detainees.
The sources of authority are Rule 3.691, Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure; sections 903.131, 903.132, 903.133 and 924.20, Florida Statutes, Rule 9.140(h), Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure and the several appellate decisions, primarily the opinion in Younghans v. State, 90 So. 2d 308 (Fla. 1956).
Appeal bonds are available to detainees regardless of whether the State or the Defendant pursue the appeal. This guide will initially address the scenario in which the defendant pursues the appeal (the far more common scenario). Secondly, this guide will address a scenario where the State pursues an appeal.
Limitations on appeal bonds are numerous. As discussed below, obtaining an appeal bond will first depend on whether a specific detainee will be able to “run the gauntlet” through the numerous limitations and initially be able to even ask the court to use its discretion in considering an appeal bond.
The first limitation comes from Rule 3.691. The rule allows for appeal bonds only in cases which are not capital. In capital cases, even where the defendant has been sentenced to life, appeal bonds are unavailable. Rowe v. State, 417 So. 2d 981 (Fla. 1982).
Secondly, Section 903.133 prohibits appeal bonds following any conviction for: second degree murder, kidnapping, first degree felony arson, first degree felony drug dealing / trafficking as well as sexual battery.
Thirdly, Rule 3.691 places a limitation on the courts discretion and prohibits appeal bonds for any individual who has been convicted of a felony which was committed prior to the commission of the felony in which the detainee is seeking an appeal bond. There is an exception to this limitation if the detainee’s civil rights have been restored in the previous felony.
The dates of the commission of the two felonies are the important dates for the analysis of this language. In Florida we frequently describe such a scheme as creating a “commission-to-commission” rule. Therefore, assume we have an individual named Detainee A. Let’s assume Detainee A commits a felony in 2008 and subsequently commits another felony in 2011. Let’s assume that Detainee A is tried on the 2011 case first and is convicted. Assume that subsequently the State goes forward on the 2008 charges and Detainee A is again convicted. Detainee A would still be eligible for an appeal bond even though he was already a convicted felon when the 2008 case began because his “prior” felony conviction on the 2011 case related to an offense which occurred after the commission of 2008 offense. Of course, if the detainee’s civil rights have been restored in the 2011 offense, the dates of commission do not matter because the prohibition will not apply.
In analyzing eligibility for an appeal bond, the detainee is not considered previously “convicted” of a prior felony if the court withheld adjudication of guilt in the prior case. Montgomery v. State, 788 So. 2d 274 (Fla. 4th DCA 2000). Additionally, a detainee is not previously “convicted” for purposes of an appeal bond if he was uncounseled in the prior felony case. Jones v. State, 662 So. 2d 383 (Fla. 3d DCA 1995).
Rule 3.691 also prohibits an appeal bond in a case where a detainee has other, pending felony charges. Therefore a detainee who is facing two felony prosecutions, whether stemming from a different series of events or sitting in different jurisdictions, is ineligible for an appeal bond pursuant to the language of the rule. In order for the other felony charge to act as a limitation to an appeal bond under the rule, a determination of probable cause has to have been made.
If, after considering the various limitations, a detainee is still eligible for an appeal bond, a written motion asking for an appeal bond may be filed with the trial court. The motion may be filed either before or after the Notice of Appeal is filed. However, the detainee can not be released until after the Notice of Appeal is filed. Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(h)(1). There used to be some confusion about whether a motion for an appeal bond could be filed after the record on appeal had been transferred to the appellate court. The appellate rules were updated in 1997 and it is now clear that the transfer of the record has no impact on the trial court’s jurisdiction to rule on a motion for an appeal bond.
A detainee who has been convicted of a felony must demonstrate to the court that the appeal is taken in good faith on grounds fairly debatable and is not frivolous. These requirements come from Rule 3.691(a). The detainee is not required to establish that he is probably going to win the appeal but only that a reasonable issue of law exists which is open to debate. Baker v. State, 213 So. 2d 285, 287 (Fla. 4th DCA 1968). It is inappropriate for a trial court to require the detainee to establish anything more than what is required by the rule. Childers v. State, 847 So. 2d 1120 (Fla. 1st DCA 2003).
If the detainee establishes that his appeal is taken in good faith on fairly debatable grounds, the rule directs the trial court to consider the detainee as an individual according to the factors set forth in Younghans v. State, 90 So. 2d 308 (Fla. 1956). Those factors are:
A detainee’s “attachments to the community” have been described to include his family ties, business and investment attachments. Wells v. Wainwright, 260 So. 2d 196 (Fla. 1972).
Suggesting a bond amount is a delicate issue because very little authority exists which would support any specific amount. A bond amount of $3,000 was agreeable to the State in a second degree misdemeanor conviction in Chandler v. State, 722 So. 2d 983 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999). The opinion in Dumas v. State, 889 So. 2d 139 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) described a $20,000 bond in a felony case which involved a minimum mandatory sentence. However the Dumas opinion did not rule on the appropriateness of that amount or discuss the amount in any manner.
If the detainee qualified for an appeal bond but the trial court denied the motion based on its discretion, such an order must be reduced to writing. Rule 9.140(h)(3) requires that such an order set out the factual basis for the denial instead of merely reciting a boilerplate statement. A trial judge who fails to provide a sufficient factual basis for a denial of an appeal bond may eventually be ordered to set an appeal bond by the appellate court. Coolley v. State, 720 So. 2d 598 (Fla. 2d DCA 1998).
If the motion for an appeal bond is denied in the trial court, the detainee may have that denial reviewed by the appellate court pursuant to Rule 9.140(h)(4). There is no need to file a separate appeal. This is so even though Rule 3.691(b) and Fla. Stat. § 903.132(b) make it appear as if a separate appeal is warranted. The detainee should simply file a motion in the appeal proceeding which is already pending. There is no time limit to file such a motion in the appellate court.
If the trial court grants the detainee an appeal bond the detainee must agree to prosecute the appeal and to surrender to the authorities if the appeal is affirmed is remanded for further proceedings. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.691(c). Any conviction for a felony committed while a detainee is on an appeal bond will result in a revocation of the appeal bond. Fla. Stat. § 903.131. A violation of the appeal bond requirements, including failure to prosecute the appeal, may result in the dismissal of the appeal. Fla. Stat. § 924.20. The trial court will retain jurisdiction to consider maters related to the appeal bond while the appeal is pending. Hirsch v. State, 864 So. 2d 41 (Fla. 5th DCA 2003).
The vast majority of criminal appeals are taken by criminal defendants. The appellate rights of defendants and the State diverge significantly and vary based on the underlying issue which is sought to be appealed as well as whether the appeal comes from a misdemeanor or felony prosecution.
In most cases, where a detainee is otherwise eligible for bail and the State takes an appeal; the detainee shall be released on his own recognizance unless the judge finds good cause why the release should not occur. Fla. R. App. P. 9.140(h)(2); Fla. Stat. § 924.071.
Orders granting a new trial and orders suppressing evidence or a confession are different animals in the State appeal analysis. If the defendant has been adjudicated guilty of an offense in which he was ineligible for bail, and the court enters an order granting the defendant a new trial, the State appeal will act to stay that order and the detainee will remain ineligible for a bail while the State appeal is pending.
The rules surrounding appeal bonds are somewhat dated and infrequently used. Because of this, trial practitioners are frequently unaware of the rules and it is not uncommon for appellate counsel to find an eligible detainee who has never asked the court for an appeal bond. Hopefully this guide will provide some basic background as to the framework of appeal bonds in Florida and facilitate the exercise of discretion in cases of eligible detainees.

"When it hurts to look back and you're scared to look ahead, look beside you and your bestfriend will be there".
Growing up in Napa Valley surrounded by grapevines, Will Phelps did not envision his future working in the family wine business. At an intimate library dinner at the Terranea Resort in Palos Verdes, Phelps, who charmed the audience with his good looks and friendly manner, said, “I was the most rebellious. I wanted nothing to do with this predestined life when I was a child.”
Despite his childhood objection, Phelps is carrying on the family tradition as the third generation at the winery. For the past three and a half years, Phelps, grandson of winery founder Joe Phelps and son of winery president Bill Phelps, has been a sales representative for his family’s winery. But he was not handed the position just because he wanted it. Once he decided he wanted to work at the winery, he had to spend his time earning the position.
While Phelps was a student at the University of San Diego, he spent summers at the winery, from working on the bottling line to pouring in the tasting room. During those years, his father would give him bottles of wine to drink. But as a college student, cheap beer was what he more commonly consumed.
Phelps graduated from college in 2008 and decided to work harvest in France to kill some time as he figured out his next steps. He was working at E. Guigal when, at age 23, he was bit by the wine bug. He was learning about wine under Philippe Guigal and at night, as there was nothing else to do in the ancient village of Ampuis in the Côte-Rôtie, he said that he read the encyclopedia of wine, page by page.
Phelps returned home to Napa Valley and told his father that he wanted to work at the winery. Bill Phelps, a lawyer for 20 years, did not come to Joseph Phelps until he was in his 40s and suggested his son get experience somewhere else first.
Phelps went to work at other wineries, including one in South Africa. In 2012, his father agreed that it was time that he work for the family business. Will joined as sales representative, focusing on sales and marketing of the wines, and during that time he also studied for his MBA.
At the dinner Will hosted at Terranea, the 29-year-old shared his story as we tasted through the library wines, the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2011 Insignia.
Insignia, the wine Joseph Phelps is most known for, was the first proprietary wine ever produced. Insignia was created in 1974 by his grandfather, Joseph Phelps, a man with great vision and with great business acumen. Working in construction, he had come to Napa to build other wineries and started Joseph Phelps Winery in 1973. Joseph Phelps Insignia is a benchmark wine that has won many awards, including wine of the year.
As we enjoyed each of the wines, Phelps invited us to raise a glass to toast his grandfather, Joseph Phelps, who passed away last year. He fondly recalled learning about wine from his grandfather as a child and spoke about how is grandfather taught him how to decant old wines by candlelight.

It used to be niche, but as this plant-based diet goes mains tream, we pinpoint the health benefits – and potential nutrition pitfalls. Our guide shows you how to dip in, or go the whole way, including easy vegan recipes from the chefs at healthy fast-food chain Leon
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HIPPIES AND HASHTAGS, veganism became cool. In fact, the number of people in Britain switching to this way of eating has surged by 360% over the past decade. But is it good for our health? ‘Observational studies report vegans have significantly lower BMIs, along with cholesterol and glucose levels, compared with omnivores,’ says HFG nutrition editor Amanda Ursell. ‘But we can’t always make like-for-like comparisons as vegans may also be making other healthy lifestyle choices, such as limiting processed foods, not smoking or drinking alcohol.’
Centring any diet on fruit and veg, pulses, whole grains and unsaturated fats is undoubtedly healthy, but before simply removing meat, dairy and eggs from your plate you need to look out for crucial nutrition shortfalls. ‘If raising children on a vegan diet, also bear in mind that plant-based foods may contain fewer calories per gram,’ says Amanda. ‘We need to make sure children get enough energy from their daily diet, so if in doubt, seek help from a registered dietitian or registered nutritionist.’
• Your five-a-day is a cinch Not relying on a meat or fish centre piece means you’re likely to go well beyond the recommended five-a-day quota, giving you extra fibre, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants every day.
• It’s a more filling diet A diet that contains plenty of fibre-rich pulses and beans, good fats from nuts and seeds, and protein from tofu makes for longer-lasting satiety as well as helping to stabilise blood sugars.
• You’ll eat healthier fats The absence of processed meat or full-fat dairy foods means your diet is potentially lower in saturated fats. Eaten in sensible servings, healthier, unsaturated sources such as avocados, nuts and seeds, all contribute to good heart health.
Our experts explain how you can eat more and still lose weight, investigate the good gut diet that helps beat the bloat, and tell you how to follow a healthy vegan diet – or just steal the bits you like. Plus, our dietitian explores the benefits of protein powders, and we serve up a nutritious spread of tried, tasted and easy recipes for you to cook throughout the month.

VANCOUVER — When Marion Buller looks back on the Saskatchewan First Nation territory where she spent her summers growing up, some of her childhood friends are no longer there.
They are aboriginal women who went missing or were murdered, part of a tragic phenomenon in Canada that Buller is now tasked with examining as head of a national inquiry.
“The impact on me has been to understand the tremendous loss to the families, and not just the loss to the family but the loss to the community as a whole,” she said in an interview Wednesday with The Canadian Press.
Buller, British Columbia’s first female First Nations judge, formally begins work Thursday as the inquiry’s chief commissioner. Over two years, she and four other commissioners will explore the systemic causes of disproportionately high rates of violence against aboriginal women and girls.
The commissioners have broad latitude to develop the inquiry process. Buller said many details have not yet been decided but they will meet next week in Vancouver to set priorities and tackle the terms of reference.
But she said she hopes to create a setting for families that is comfortable and respectful, and that ultimately the recommendations produced in a 2018 report will be acted upon.
“I hope the end result will be a list of concrete, workable, usable recommendations that will lead to positive change,” she said.
Some families and advocates have already expressed concerns about the terms of reference, including that the commissioners will be able to recommend that police reopen cold cases but will not have the power to compel them to do so.
Buller said she expected to hear concerns from families about police, but that information would be used to identify structural causes of weaknesses in the system.
“I certainly understand the families’ concerns about reopening cases. However, that’s a decision to be made by politicians, not by me,” she said.
Buller said the inquiry could hold some private hearings or take statements one-on-one in First Nations communities, and would not compel any family member to speak if they didn’t want to.
“We don’t want to hurt you, and we’ll be respectful,” she said. “It’s very important to remember in all of this that there are real people and we can never lose sight of that.”
Buller grew up in Toronto but spent summers in Saskatchewan as a member of the Mistawasis First Nation. In 1994, she became B.C.’s first female aboriginal judge, and about a decade ago established the province’s First Nations Court, which holds bail and sentencing hearings for aboriginal people with a focus on community and healing.
She said she always knew aboriginal people were over-represented in prisons and courtrooms in Canada, and saw joining the legal profession as an opportunity to change things for the better.
Dawn Lavell-Harvard, president of the Native Women’s Association of Canada, has been a vocal critic of the terms of reference. On Wednesday, she said she still has concerns about the inquiry being unable to require police to reopen cases and about supports for families.
“This is where the real test comes, when we start having these conversations … and we start, hopefully, rolling up our sleeves and doing some of the work that needs to happen to make sure this is the inquiry that families need.”
Cheam First Nation Chief Ernie Crey, whose sister Dawn’s DNA was found on the farm of serial killer Robert Pickton, said he was impressed with Buller and he encouraged aboriginal leaders and families to support the inquiry.
“I know her reputation in the community and it’s a very good reputation,” he said. “When she makes these kind of commitments, along the lines that it’s going to be a meaningful inquiry, I take her at her word and I think she will make sure that’s done.”

My husband and I have used Diane 5 separate times for buying and selling our home. Yet again, she has shown nothing less than exceptional professionalism, dedication, and knowledge. Our most recent purchase was done virtually and sight unseen. I would not have trusted any realtor other than Diane in the process. No one understands the Las Vegas real estate market as well as Diane does and I will always recommend her to anyone looking for an outstanding realtor.
Diane was a significant force in helping us sell our home in North Las Vegas. This was not a typical transaction and she helped us through the tough spots. I would highly recommend her as your real estate professional. Her staff was also extremely helpful in the sale process.
She advises us on how to make your home look appealing for sale and it really works. We listed on a Friday and by the following week we had a buyer. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to sell their home.
I have used Diane for multiple transactions now and every time I am more impressed. Her level of professionalism and knowledge is unequivocal. She did an excellent job of prep/pre-marketing, a thorough research of comps, gave us an educated price for listing, when we were ready to go on the market it was all set. Because of this we sold fast, had multiple offers and received over our asking price. I also appreciate the fact that she gave us weekly updates as to where we were and always returned my calls. I completely trust Diane, its nice to see a real estate agent with integrity. If I need anything real estate related she takes care of me. Thanks again Diane!
When considering whether Diane Varney could optimize our proceeds from selling our rental property, the biggest risk seemed to be the fact that she charges a conventional rate for selling houses and there are plenty of other companies and individuals out there willing to take a smaller cut.
What we found, however, was through extensive research, she was able to help us find the \u201Csweet spot\u201D in the offering price, not too low and not too high. After paying for some repairs, I wanted to tack those costs onto the asking price, but Diane knew this would be a mistake. I trusted her judgment and went with her suggestion.
Lo and behold, within a few days of listing the property, we received close to 20 offers, all of them close to or over the asking price. We ended up with a cash buyer who was willing to buy our house \u201Cas is\u201D for way more than the asking price. The amount far exceeded her fee, and she took care of all the little details that came up in the transaction; we didn’t have to do a thing.
Looking back, we couldn’t have done better if a realtor came in, waved a magic wand, sold the property in a week for our asking price and charged 0 percent for their services. Diane Varney still would have been the better way to go.
She was involved throughout the process of the purchase of the house and 10 years ago, as well keeping us informed on the market conditions and ultimately suggesting the moment to list and sell the house. She handled all the details efficiently and made the sale happen with the minimum of trouble and difficulty for the sellers.
Diane Varney represented us in the sale of our home in December of 2017. Our experience with herself and her staff provided world class service beyond our expectations. Her knowledge, professionalism, availability and attention to detail produced great results for us. I would highly recommend to my friends and family to call Diane with regarding to purchasing or selling a home.
We were recently faced with the devastating news that we would have to place our mother in a skilled facility and she would no longer be able to live in her Las Vegas home of 20 years. In order to provide her with the best care possible, it was necessary for us to quickly clean out and place her home on the market so that we could use the proceeds for her care. While that is an emotional and grueling task for any family, it seemed especially so since we were her only family and live nearly 2,000 miles away. How would we ever find a realtor we could trust? How could we do this with limited time? How would we possibly know if we would be receiving the most we could from her property so that we could cover impending medical and housing expenses for her? We started with a website called Top Agents Ranked. Within hours we had the names of 5 top realtors in the area. Diane was not the first to call, but she was the most professional, warm and understanding of our situation. We made appointments with Diane and another agent the week before we were to be in Las Vegas. In those intervening days, Diane emailed information about the area, offered the most objective resources for us to ponder in making our decision, sent us in-depth information about the house and its location in an overnight package and welcomed us to Las Vegas with a warm phone call on the first day of our arrival. Before we even arrived, she had driven past the house, looked up the assessment and was already thinking about her contacts and who may be interested in the home. She provided all of this care without knowing whether we would actually sign her as our realtor. The first five days in the city, we were arranging for the future care of our mom while cleaning out a three-bedroom home that was well-lived in for 20 years. Diane called to see how we were doing and if we had any questions. Since we are not from the area, she provided an entire list of concierge services -- trusted contractors and their contacts --- so we could find reliable people in short order to do what we needed without overcharging us or neglecting us. Immediately, landscapers were at our call to clean up the neglected yard. We had one week to put all of our mother's affairs in order and we were overwhelmed with a long to-do list. We had arranged to interview realtors on our fifth day of a week's stay, hoping we would have accomplished much before choosing an agent and listing the property. As we neared our interview date, we decided to cancel our meeting with the other agent. How could that agent possible measure up to what Diane already had done for us? It was a hands-down, no-brainer decision. When we finally met Diane face-to-face, we were comfortable in the knowledge we could trust her. She helped us decide the listing price of the home and assured us she would stay in contact. We had one more day in Las Vegas, before heading home. We needed to rely on Diane. On the morning we left, Diane sent texts and a call wishing us a safe journey home and saying she had listed the property and would keep us informed every step of the way. By the time our plane landed late that day, we had a cash offer for the home above our asking price. One day on the market! We didn't make a quick decision. With Diane's advice, we waited out the weekend while she handled the offer and showed the property to other prospective buyers. By the next day, we had multiple offers. But, we accepted the first after consulting with Diane. Just two weeks later, we closed the sale. We are marveling how we ever found Diane! Without her, we could never have managed selling this house at a distance with such confidence and trust. We are deeply grateful for her professionalism and her genuine care for us and our situation. Because of her, we are able to promptly give our mom the loving care she needs in these last days of her life. We recommend Diane to anyone looking for Las Vegas realty help. She is precious!
I have known Diane Varney most of my life, recently she sold my house is 8 days, she was very kind, professional and knowledgeable, I won't use anyone else as my realtor except for her, she is a wonderful person and an excellent realtor with the upmost respect for her clients!
We rely on her vast understanding of the market, prompt responses, attention to detail, and expert support staff.
Being out of state, communication and customer service are strengths that have sustained this long term relationship and we trust her implicitly.
My High Rise condo had been on the market for about a year with little activity. So nearing the end of 2017, we changed agents and dropped the price of the property. In early November, we procured Diane Varney as our new agent. She followed through and within a week of showing the condo, she had two offers right away. Immediately after, one of the offers came through and she obtained a buyer and we had the property closed within two weeks. We are incredibly pleased with the results! She continuously stayed in touch and kept us appraised of the ongoings until this transaction closed. I highly recommend her as an agent and would gladly utilize her services again.
I’ve known Diane Varney for many years. She has always conducted herself in a professional manner, and I would recommend her as:
My Number 1 choice for real estate. Diane communicated with me throughout the listing and the closing. She actually found the buyer for my property,
Proving that she was marketing the listing personally. Once Diane secured the cash buyer, we were closed in one short week.
Having bought and sold over 30 homes, I have never had such a smooth and quick transaction. Diane worked on our behalf with the home builder/seller and anticipated our every need. We were out of town buyers with relatively little knowledge of the local market. Diane patiently listened to our wants and needs, and within 24 hours we had an accepted contract on the home of our dreams. Diane doesn't only have a vast knowledge of the Las Vegas real estate market, but also is extremely in touch with the local community. A dimension that only a "true local" brings to the table. What an amazing buying experience Diane provided us!
DIane Varney and team were excellent! We used her for the purchase of this property and also the sale nearly three years later. Her commitment towards receiving the best deal is second to none and always went the extra mile. If you are buying or selling a home Diane should be the first call to make.
She was great at communicating and letting us know all the options. When we needed to move up our closing date she did her due diligence in helping us close about 10 days early so we could move into our new house. She even fought our solar company to help our contract with them put on the new owners. Great experience working with her. I definitely recommend her.
Diane Varney's professionalism and knowledge of the real estate market in Las Vegas is second to none. I have done multiple transactions with her in the past, and I couldn't ask for anyone better. She is great at easing and walking you through the transaction. She will truly be missed now that we are leaving the Las Vegas area.
Diane is an amazing Relator! Very knowledgeable, trusting and a tough negotiator. This is the second home Diane has sold for us. She worked very hard to bring us full price offers. Both transactions were very smooth and her communication was outstanding. We cannot thank her enough for all of the extra effort put into the sales. Looking forward to working with Diane in the future.
Diane is one of the most incredible real State Agent I ever dealt with. Her experience knowledge commitment to get the best value for your house is beyond believable.
She is extremely pleasant kind and a pretty tough person to get the right price and value for ur property. No one can push her around she firm and assertive and be pushed around or intimidated to get less value for the house.
She always keep a great communication with her clients . She have the psssion and the knowledge for her job.
Extremely extremely knowledgeable and knows the market pretty well. I do recommend her to anyone who is looking to sell or buy. She is there for her client to represent them in a well respected manner and fight for her clients.
My husband and I had an AMAZING experience working with Diane on selling our Las Vegas home. We met her a few months prior and were really wowed by her personality, knowledge and charm. She came up with a list price that was competitive and would sell quickly -- and boy did it! We had multiple offers and were in contract within 8 days - and the entire sale from list to close took less than 45 days. She was great at over communicating during this nerve-racking period and kept us informed throughout the process. The photographs produced for the brochure and web listing were top notch. I can not recommend Diane enough for this important life task. She made the entire process fluid and timely. THANK YOU, DIANE!!
It is difficult to write an honest review for Diane without sounding like a paid advertisement. She is simply the BEST (as proven by her manymany industry awards). We will use her in the future and recommend that our friends do as well. Having lived her entire life in Vegas, Diane knows everything there is to know about Vegas/Henderson real estate. My family moved 2,000 miles across the country, knowing very little about Vegas beforehand, and Diane patiently, professionally, and compassionately walked with us through every step of the tedious process. Before my wife and I came into town for three days to look at and put some offers on houses, Diane got to know us and our wants and desires through phone and email conversations, and had a long list of houses she tracked down for us to tour while in town. She assured us that she would take care of us, and successfully calmed our nerves about the process. During our visit to town (my first time ever in Vegas), Diane devoted her schedule to touring us throughout the valley. When we first walked into the house that we ended up buying, Diane knew my wife and I so well that without us saying anything to her, she was on the phone with the seller's realtor within minutes of our arrival, letting her know we'd be putting an offer on the house and asking questions on our behalf. It was frankly incredible, and made us feel so supported and taken care of. Her awesome negotiation skills then saved us over $15k off of the asking price. On the personal side, my wife and I were smitten by Diane from our first conversation. She is simply a lovely, loving, and fun person, and we really enjoyed all the time we spent with her. I now consider Diane not only to be our realtor for life but a friend as well. You can't get any better than Diane and her team.
I've bought and sold 4 times with Diane Varney in the Las Vegas area, and I wouldn't have it any other way. She's professional, knowledgeable, pleasant, timely, and tough -- the whole package realtor.
I was referred to Diane by a friend and she was informed that I had 45 days to close on house. Immediately she went to work. Only showing us properties that fit our criteria. She is a great negotiator, got us a helleva properry for a helleva deal.
Diane is a closer. If you need to sell your house, Diane will get it done for you. She priced the house to sell. It sold in one day. She is clearly skilled at developing a proper asking price based on relevant comparable sales.
This was the third real estate transaction that Diane Varney has done for our family. The last home she sold for us meant so much to us and we were very emotional through the entire process. Diane took our concerns and reassured us that she would sell our home and would be there to walk us thru the entire process. She did! Diane was so supportive and completely available for us. Her judgment and expertise was just what we needed to get though this transacation. Within a few days of being on the market, we had offers and our home was contracted and sold! We would definitely recommend Diane Varney to everyone!
Diane did a remarkable job of selling my house - she produced amazing traffic flow through the property and streamlined the entire paperwork process. fantastic, personal customer service!
Professional, experienced, exceptionally well versed in dealing with other Realtors. Highly recommend Diane for your next purchase or sale. Diane is also very personable, at stays on top of the transaction.
Diane is AMAZING! I tend to be really indecisive and she was very patient and VERY honest. She also negotiated really well and truly wanted the best for me. I couldn't have asked for a better agent!
I'd like to give Diane Varney at Coldwell Bankers Premier Realty two thumbs up, She was so helpful with finding me a home in the Las Vegas area, She was very professional in helping me narrow down my search of properties that I was looking for and keep me informed on the progress of my escrow and answered any and all my questions that I had. She assembled a fantastic team to help with the transaction, These is the fifth home I have purchased in my live and was the most quickest and efficient transaction I have ever experienced, I would very much recommend any one thinking of purchasing a home in the Las Vegas area to contact Diane Varney. "THINK YOU DIANE VARNEY' Keith
Diane's knowledge and expertise are extremely impressive. A true professional, her fast acting skills found our family the perfect place in Las Vegas. I highly recommend Diane.
Diane's expertise of the real estate field amazed me immediately. I wanted to sell my home and at our first visit she provided me with extensive comparables; thoroughly looked over my home; provided guidance and honesty; and maybe the most important quality of all--she communicated her desire and motivation to support my interests. That is precisely what she did in all ways. Diane was always available during the process. I completely believe in her judgement and expertise because I have the success story to prove it!! My home sold quickly. I am so grateful and relieved to have found this wonderful real estate professional, and I am writing this review to give her full credit and also recommend her to others.
Diane had complete analyses of the property values on our initial meeting. she had researched comparable properties in the neighborhood. She listed the property and it sold in 2 days! We had multiple offers. Diane negotiated with the buyers agents and advised us on the offer that was most advantageous to us. Diane and her associate Bien kept us informed during the whole process. We would highly recommend Diane for your realtor needs. Dan and Sharon
This was our third real estate transaction with Diane Varney as our realtor. Our first two transactions with her were flawless. She is always professional and always available to answer even the most insignificant question. This third transaction was a bit different. It involved selling my childhood home following the death of my mother. Not only was Diane professional, as always, but she was incredibly supportive and sympathetic to the heightened emotions that were involved with this sale. She went out of her way to make things go as seamlessly as possible for what was a very emotional sale. I would recommend her to anyone and I would use her a fourth, fifth and sixth time.
I was fortunate to work with Diane Varney for the sale of my home. She sold it in a timely manner of ten weeks. It was sold above appraisal price. She was helpful with attention to detail, and very professional. I would happily recommend her to any of my friends.
5 star service all the way around! Diane Varney is a true professional! SHe is an extraordinary realtor with a vast local knowledge. She has a great team to help secure the best home and offer!
This is the 2nd home of mine that Diane has sold for me. As she did with the first, this home listed at a fair price and we had multiple offers within 2 days. She quickly negotiated a deal for over list price. Diane's attention to the client is surpassed by none and her constant communication with me kept me at ease through the entire process.
She was able to manage and execute flowlessly the sale of our home, display extraordinary dedication and guest service.
Has a spectacular approach with each challenges that occur and use an exceptional problem solving skill that made thing look easy.
Purchased two homes utilizing Diane's knowledge and expertise. The experience was great. Recently sold one of the homes, again, Diane used her experience and knowledge to get the job done. One word to describe her, "perseverance". Had a few offers and one fell out of escrow, Diane continued and she got the right buyer and price I wanted. Service has always been excellent and the communication with her staff is always second to none.
Diane was wonderful.....my transaction occurred beautifully, without issue. I highly recommend Diane for Las Vegas Real Estate sales and purchases.
Diane was professional, experienced and attentive. My home sold immediately and I was pleased with the sale price as well as the overall transaction. Even though I live in NY and sold my property in Las Vegas, the transaction happened remotely through Diane and her office.
I can't thank you again for all of the hard work and help you gave us when we were buying our house. Having our own home has changed are lives and we are so happy.
Diane and team are simply the best! She will fight for your best interest! She's knowledgeable and helpful. She'll make you feel like you are a valuable customer no matter the worth of your home. I have dealt with about a half a dozen realtors and Diane trumps them all by far!
Ms. Varney is a pleasure to work with. She is professional, stays up to date with her schooling and therefore is able to deal with any issue that may come up. She stands firm by her clients and helps them to achieve their goal. I have purchased and sold multiple properties, this last one with Diane. She was referred to me and now I will refer her to others!
Diane helped me purchase my first home and I could not be happier. She was extremely knowledgeable and helped walk me through every step of the process. Highly recommended!!
We would highly recommend Diane Varney to anyone buying a home in Las Vegas. We live in Illinois and we were looking for a second home in Las Vegas. Because we had to fly in, we were under a strict time schedule. Diane was so accommodating in setting up appointments prior to our arrival. she helped us do a lot of shopping for a house via email prior to our arrival. Once there, she devoted all her time to meet our needs. the one thing I will always remember is that Dian being areal estate agent was not trying to push us into any one particular home. Believe it or not, she actually walked into one house and before we could even get in the door, she had us leave. She knew that particular house would not fit our needs. After two days, we finally found our dream home, and closed on it in 30 days. I would refer Diane Varney to anyone. Also, make sure she gives you those special cookies from Trader Joe's that she brought along on the drive. With our deepest respect and admiration, Tony and Debbie
Whether you are buying or selling in Las Vegas, NV, Diane is THE realtor for you. She worked with me and for me from start to finish. I wish I could have taken her with me when I moved and had her as my realtor on the other end of my move. If you want a fair and aggressive advocate and mentor in the process of buying/selling a home, you cannot do any better than Diane Varney!
Diane is a stellar real estate agent, her skills and knowledge are par excellence, and working with her is a real pleasure. She's always on your side and always looking out for your best interest :-)
We chose Diane because she was honest and practical. We needed to sell our home quickly in order to move across the country. Diane helped us set a competitive price and facilitated the sale of our house within the three week time period that she had predicted. She was responsive and competent and out of the various realtors we interviewed, we are extremely pleased that we went with Diane.
She was truly a dream come true! Professional and fully knowledgeable. I have used her on every home I've purchased in Las Vegas & Summerlin areas. She's a resource for everything home and Vegas related. I recommend her to anyone looking for a home - rental, upgrade, or first time buyer. As someone that has high expectations... trust me, you can't go wrong with Diane Varney!
We had to relocate on short notice. Diane helped us list our home and was guide us through the entire process. It was short notice and we were trying to walk away without without being upside down and Diane put us in contact with some people that could help us through this process.
my wife and I just completed a Las Vegas purchase by "remote" from California via Diane. her level of service and communication were exemplary! for example, without prompting, she visited the target property to represent us in a meeting with the Sellers broker. her negotiations and strategic skills were fantastic, and her knowledge of support personnel (inspectors, repairmen, property managers, etc) was incredibly helpful.
Diane made the sell of my house a seamless process. She knows this business. It was a comfort to have her on my side, I have a demanding career that doesn't allow me the time to learn or focus on real estate. I highly recommend her and will always keep Diane as a resource. She is friendly, trustworthy, and professional

The Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve, model 9600TFX, and accessories are indicated for patients with symptomatic heart disease due to failure (stenosed, insufficient, or combined) of a surgical bioprosthetic aortic or mitral valve who are judged by a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, to be at high or greater risk for open surgical therapy (i.e., predicted risk of surgical mortality ≥ 8% at 30 days, based on the STS risk score and other clinical co-morbidities unmeasured by the STS risk calculator).
The Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve and delivery system should not be used in patients who:
If an incorrect valve size for your anatomy is used, it may lead to heart injury, valve leakage, movement, or dislodgement.
Patients should talk to their doctor if they have significant heart disease, a mitral valve device or are allergic to chromium, nickel, molybdenum, manganese, copper, silicon, and/or polymeric materials.
During the procedure, your doctors should monitor the dye used in the body; if used in excess it could lead to kidney damage. X-ray guidance used during the procedure may cause injury to the skin, which may be painful, damaging, and long-lasting.
Transcatheter aortic heart valve patients should take medications that thin the blood or prevent blood clots from forming, except when likely to have an adverse reaction, as determined by their physician. The Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve has not been tested for use without medications that thin the blood or prevent blood clots from forming.
The long-term durability of the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve is not known at this time. Regular medical follow-up is recommended to evaluate how well a patient’s heart valve is performing. Safety, performance, and durability of the SAPIEN 3 valve has not been established for placement inside a previously implanted transcatheter valve.
The safety and effectiveness of the transcatheter heart valve is also not known for patients who have:
An aortic heart valve that is not calcified, contains only one or two leaflets, has leaflets with large pieces of calcium that may block the vessels that supply blood to the heart or in which the main problem is that the valve leaks.
A heart that does not pump well, has thickening of the heart muscle, with or without blockage, unusual ultrasound images of the heart that could represent irregularities such as a blood clot, a diseased mitral valve that is calcified or leaking, or Gorlin syndrome, a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancers and tumors.
Low white, red or platelet blood cell counts, or history of bleeding because the blood does not clot properly.
Diseased, abnormal or irregularly shaped vessels leading to the heart. Vessels which are heavily diseased or too small for associated delivery devices, or a large amount of calcification at the point of entry.
For a valve in valve procedure, there is a risk of leakage if the previously implanted tissue valve is not securely in place or if it is damaged. There is also the possibility that a partially detached valve leaflet from the previously implanted valve could block a blood vessel.
Risks to the heart, including heart attack or heart failure, a heart that does not pump well, irregular heartbeat that may result in a need for a permanent pacemaker, chest pain, heart murmur, false aneurysm, recurring aortic stenosis (narrowing), too much fluid around the heart, injury to the structure of the heart.
Risks to your lungs or breathing, including difficulty breathing, fainting, buildup of fluid in or around the lungs, weakness or inability to exercise.
Risks involving bleeding or your blood supply, including formation of a blood clot, high or low blood pressure, limited blood supply, a decrease in red blood cells, or abnormal lab values, bleeding in the abdominal cavity, collection of blood under the skin.
Valve movement after deployment, blockage or disruption of blood flow through the heart, need for additional heart surgery and possible removal of the SAPIEN 3 valve, a blood clot that requires treatment, damage to the valve (e.g., wear, breakage, recurring aortic stenosis), nonstructural valve dysfunction (e.g., leakage, inappropriate sizing or positioning, blockage, excess tissue in growth, blood cell damage, etc.) or mechanical failure of the delivery system and/or accessories.
CAUTION: Federal (United States) law restricts these devices to sale by or on the order of a physician.

My wife and I have a problem whenever we go out to eat, and it is something that I don’t think we will ever be able to rectify. She is someone who, upon the conclusion of her meal, likes to sit there and chat and digest. I, on the other hand, need to immediately move. I despise sitting still in a restaurant after eating. I start readjusting my seat. My leg starts bouncing up and down. I fail to pay attention to the conversation at hand. I just need to move. I need to get out of there. There’s no real reason to it, I just hate staying still right after eating. This is why Golden Harvest is perfectly suited to my dining needs. Once you’re done, they are going to kick you out.
Not all restaurants are like Golden Harvest though. Some places will be content with filling your coffee cup over and over and over again. I hate this. Mostly because my wife will drink her coffee and engage in, what I can only assume is, the most meaningful and wonderful conversation of her life. I don’t know. I stopped paying attention, and I cannot fathom why anyone would want to stay put after eating unless it was so utterly engrossing. This inability to control my ADHD after eating has indirectly led me to discovering the art scene in Old Town though.

The strategic direction and financial oversight of The Manitoba Oat Growers Commission is the responsibility of the Board of Directors.

For direction for the Executive Director, the board determined the following allocation of funds outside of administration for each of the strategic priorities:
It should be recognized that this allocation, as provided, is a general guideline and that it was not the expectation of the Board that the expenditures would result in an exact allocation.
SIM-only contracts for smartphones are getting cheaper all the time and more and more discerning individuals are opting not to tie themselves into a talk plan for years, even if that does mean stumping up a fair whack for a new phone. For many this puts the flagship phones from the major players just out of arms reach, but if you’re willing to forgo the more established brands there are some pretty special devices vying for our attention.
So says Huawei anyway, with a new handheld we’ve been hearing a bit about recently. It’s called the P8, and is the new flagship model for a Chinese manufacturer that’s been gathering a bit of a following among those who aren’t afraid to think outside the box.
When you look at the specs, you can see why Huawei is using this as its current head-turner. It has a 5.2” display at 1920×1080 resolution and 424ppi – the same as the Xperia Z3. There’s 3GB of RAM, between 16 and 64GB of storage with microSD and a Quad-core 2 GHz Cortex-A53 to keep things ticking over. For media you’ve got a 13MP primary camera capable of full HD video at 30fps, with an 8MP selfie on the front. It’s water and dust resistant and has even shelled out on Gorilla Glass 3 for a toughened screen. And it looks pretty sweet as well – check out that slim side bezel.
But looks can be deceiving, as can an apparently impressive collection of internals, so we’ll cast our eye over some early reviews to see if it lives up to its billing.
Let’s begin where we left off with the design. The Independent is a fan and calls it “a leap forward in design and build quality” for the company, lauding its all-aluminium one-piece frame and the fact that:
“Huawei proudly boasted that a higher proportion (78.3 per cent) of the front of the phone was screen than on rivals like the iPhone 6 and Samsung Galaxy S6.”
“The wall-to-wall screen looks great, even if its HD resolution is less impressive than the Samsung Galaxy S6’s far higher pixel count. Even so, the screen looks attractive and full of rich, realistic colours and detail.”
Some of the other tricks in Huawei’s arsenal are examined here, such as the Voice Wake function, which works a bit like one of those car-key whistle locators except here you speak a pre-recorded phrase and the phone wakes, plays music and sings “I’m here”. It also proves that it’s down with the current generation with something called Perfect Selfie – a soft focus effect designed to enhance those spotty head-shots, and a light painting mode that:
“Essentially lets you shoot a video which combines light effects into a still picture, though the examples given included dazzling fireworks brandished around remarkably brave models.”
It summarises by saying that good things could be on the horizon for Huawei in terms of breaking into the western market – it’s “a company that for some time now has felt like it’s been on the brink of the big time”. Could this be the thing that tips it over?
TechRadar is fairly measured and likes the premium design, the display and feature-packed camera, but does have some issues with the performance. It’s not quite as snappy as the Galaxy S6 Edge you see, though considering the price point on that beauty we’d be surprised if it was, and the jury is out on Huawei’s Emotion UI – its OS overlay that leads the reviewer to suggest:
“Don’t get too excited at the mention of the Lollipop operating system either, as it hasn’t escaped the clutches of Huawei’s Emotion UI on the P8.”
Elsewhere the camera impresses, and it points out that Huawei claims it “outperforms the snapper on the iPhone 6 Plus”, which would be an impressive achievement. This is likely down to a new technology:
TechRadar concludes by saying “The Huawei P8 is the most exciting handset to come out of the Chinese firm over the past few years, possibly ever, and it shows some very real promise.”
But all of this is a bit early doors. What we really need is someone who’s put the P8 through its paces, and here we turn to PC PRO. It has a full review with benchmarks, awarding the phone 4/5 but suggesting it’s not quite up to the task of challenging the big boys. There’s nothing wrong with the design though, being “super-slim, measuring a mere 6.9mm from front to back, it weighs only 144g, and it looks great.” The removable microSD gets a mention, as do water and dust resistance when comparing it to the Samsung Galaxy S6, which has none of these.
“The results are impressive. The camera is quick to launch and take pictures, plus it focuses quickly and confidently. Importantly, the quality is fantastic, particularly in low light” and “In good light we were impressed to find that the camera dealt well with even tricky scenes, retaining detail in bright skies without losing detail in shadowy areas. Video looks just as good – crisp and rock-steady in all but the most extreme situations.”
The only downside was slightly washed out pictures in some conditions, and that some of the software functions seemed a bit gimmicky, but otherwise it seems like good news for snappers.
When it comes to performance it’s unfortunately not up to scratch against the likes of the HTC One M9 and Galaxy S6, with the GPU being the main cause. For pure number crunching it’s still fairly good though, so if you’re not an avid gamer you might not notice much of a difference.
And when it comes to the battery it’s a similar story – it lags behind rivals such as the Xperia Z3 and Galaxy S6 to a noticeable degree, sucking around 15% of power for an hour of video playback and around 7% for streaming audio, both below average.
Still, there’s plenty to like about the P8 overall and some features, such wind-noise reduction, automatic microphone sensitivity and earpiece volume control sound genuinely useful, even if others, such as ““Knuckle sense” that allows you to capture a screenshot with a tap of your knuckle” do not.
PC Pro concedes that the P8 certainly has its attention but “it isn’t quite cheap enough to get our wholehearted recommendation”, which brings us back to our original point.
Is this affordable enough to keep you from the suffocating embrace of a two-year contract? Just about. The standard version will cost £360, with the premium £430, which is around 25% off what you’d pay for a “badge” with a similar spec and possibly more if you factor in how cheap microSD cards are. Even despite potential performance issues, we definitely think this is worth keeping an eye on.
Nothing new from the transclinic and I'm just trying to pass the time. However, it appears I will be busy because of the loads of school work... By they way, I wrote an essay about this subject! The title was "My dream", and becoming a woman might well be my biggest dream, so of course I had to write about it. I don't know if the teacher now thinks I'm "mentally ill", but I don't care. She would've learned about my case sooner or later in any case, so why not.

It’s a good idea to keep a record of all the paid surveys you’re doing, so you make sure you are being paid for all your efforts. Whether taking paid surveys is a full-time or part-time job, you should keep track of your progress. That way you can organise your paid surveys and never miss an opportunity to make money online from your paid survey offers.

You’ll be able to cash out your points either through PayPal or with a gift card. Survey Junkie claims you can get your cash out instantly, but this isn’t necessarily true. In most cases, if you request a payout through PayPal and it can take up to 24 hours, but in most cases it is immediate. Compared to other sites out there, this is a huge advantage. Some companies and sites can make you wait several days or even weeks. Sign up for Survey Junkie HERE.
As well as using your laptop, you can fill in MySurvey forms on the move by using their app available for both Apple and Android phones. This is perfect because surveys should really be about filling time, rather than dedicating particular time to them, so being able to pass time in queues or while commuting and simultaneously make money is very appealing.
There are also many questionable "middleman" third-party paid survey sites that hype easy money for participating in online marketing research from home. Here, the old adage is true: if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Further, it’s worth knowing that there’s a lot of competition among these companies for your participation – which means potential for exaggeration, at the very least, if not outright scams.
There’s a decent rate of surveys pinged your way as you can expect two or three emails a day inviting you to fill in particular questionnaires. In addition to this, there are freely offered surveys on their cleanly designed website each day which you can look through and decide if they take your fancy. Surveys on CashCrate are often outsourced to third parties though, so you can make more money on the survey side from other websites. Similarly they are known for passing your information on to other people, so to avoid the irritations of endless spam, make sure you set up a dedicated email address for your CashCrate account.
Surveys can be super quick and take just a few minutes to fill out, or require around 15 minutes of your time. Five minute surveys pay $0.50 and surveys range from $0.40 up to the higher – and rarer – ones at $10.Paying out by the usual methods, Crowdology does PayPal and also vouchers. Most importantly, the minimum reward threshold is low so when you’ve earned $8, you can cash it out, unlike other sites which make you wait until you have earned much more money. The site offers prize draws from time to time for things like cinema tickets and surveys can be expected weekly.

Hi! I'm Jeff. A personal finance nerd and entrepreneur at heart, I'm here to bring you all the latest cool ways to make and save extra money. I've been quoted in several online publications, including Entrepreneur, GoBankingRates, Student Loan Hero, Business.com, Credit Karma, The Simple Dollar, US News & World Report, Lifehacker, MSN Money, Moneyish, Zumper, IdeaMensch, Discover Bank, PrimeRates, Credit.com, Yahoo! Finance, Club Thrifty, Guru Focus, Rent Track, Fit Small Business, Coupon Chief, and more.
Mainly conducting polls for governments, public bodies and the business world, Opinion Outpost is a popular survey site as unlike some sites, which require you to accrue a significant amount before you can claim your money, it has one of the lowest payout thresholds. You only need to fill out five surveys, earning a couple of dollars, before being able to claim pay, so you can redeem your money more quickly.
Post-recession, a lot of workers started looking for ways to earn extra cash. While most side gigs won’t supplant the steady cashflow of a regular job, they can pad a paycheck that hasn’t seen a significant boost in a few years. Paid surveys are often mentioned as one way to earn a few extra dollars fast. But are paid surveys a legitimate way to make money – or are they scams? The answer is that it depends on the survey and the company you are taking them for.
The point of each survey is to present you with a topic you're interested in and qualified to discuss for the benefit of the researcher. Surveys range in time required, from very short to quite long. Because researchers are looking for opinions only from certain segments of people, you may find you have to try a few surveys before you're qualified to give your opinion on one. Keep at it, and you'll eventually find one that's right up your alley.
While there are no clear guidelines, ePoll surveys tend to revolve around the media and entertainment business. So younger survey takers and TV/movie watchers will probably enjoy ePoll more than some of the other demographics. With ePoll, you may be required to watch a commercial, or even a TV episode and then answer questions about it on the survey. In fact, on rare occasions, ePoll will send out a movie or TV show for you to watch at home and then review on the site. These opportunities are infrequent but are a nice additional perk of using the site.
CashCrate is a great site pairing traditional surveys with a range of unique deals that can help you make money online. After signing up with a few details and filling in a brief survey for your profile, so CashCrate can identify some basic demographics, you’ll be awarded your first 25 cents and be on your way to greater riches! The best deals and offers are available for US users, and the minimum earnings to have a payout from CashCrate is $20 – which they pay you and their six million users as cash.
Something very important to note before signing up at any site claiming to pay you cash to take surveys is that all legitimate sites offering online surveys that pay do not charge registration fees – they are free to join. Some sites may even offer you bonus as you sign in, to show you they are happy you have become a part of their team and helping them increase their revenue.
“I participated in an in-home product trial study. A coffee machine company sent me one of the coffee makers along with about 200 coffee pods. I received $7 for completing 3 short surveys. Plus, after the study, the company said I could keep the coffee maker. So, I got like 4 mos of coffee for everyone in my household, a free coffee maker and $7!” - David W.
In most ways, iSay is identical to the other sites on the list. One thing which sets them apart is the “Poll Predictor.” If you’ve been on a survey site before, you know one of the most frustrating things is to enter a survey, answer a few questions, and then get kicked out for not qualifying. If this happens with iSay, you get asked a Poll Predictor question. These are questions like “Have you ever been overseas?” and you have to guess what percentage of people said yes. The closer you are to the right answer; the more chances you get for winning the prize drawing.
Congratulations go to Panel Place, which gets 2nd place on the Survey Cool list of the best paid survey sites for 2018, but just what makes it so good? Above all else is the fact that it has a very large number of surveys to choose from, so there really is something for everyone. It does this because it includes surveys available from a variety of other top survey providers, including Toluna and Valued Opinions. It’s available to users across the world as well, and payment can be made by way of a gift card or sent securely to a PayPal account. It’s a deserving number one.
Send Earnings may have to be satisfied with the twentieth and final spot in our table, but that’s still an achievement to be proud of in such a competitive market. There’s a good selection of surveys to choose from, which I always welcome, and you can grab your money and run once you hit the thirty dollar threshold. There are lots of other money earning options as well, but watch out for the ‘play games’ pitfall as it could end up costing you more than you actually earn.
Return on Time: 3.5/5.0- Their payrate isn’t overwhelming- the average per hour hovers around $3. Depending on the user’s activity on the website, it can take anywhere from a couple of days to as long as a month just to earn CashCrate’s cash-out amount of $20. You certainly won’t be making top-dollar with this site, but despite their low pay they do pay their members consistently.
My name is Bob and I run this blog. I have been doing paid surveys for last 12 years and have started this blog to help people to make some extra money taking paid online surveys. I share my tips, do's, don'ts, reviews and sign up links of survey panels on this blog. Sign up for free with recommended survey companies and start getting paid to take surveys.
I have a check on the way from inbox dollars. I enjoy the variety of activities you can do to earn cash. My current payout is $40 minus a few cents and I think I have been with them about 4-6 months. In fairness, I don’t do a ton of activities so I accumulate slowly. I like MyView because you get 100 points for each survey you do not qualify for after only a couple or so questions! I have not cashed out with them yet but my Dtr. Has and loves them as well. Thanks so much for the update.
The rewards for the MySurvey surveys are on par (or better than some) with most other sites. They offer $0.50 to $1.25 for every survey that you complete, with the shorter surveys only taking around 5 minutes to finish. When you want to cash out, you’ll have to accumulate $10, which is less than some of the other sites, and you’ll be able to get your money through a check, PayPal, Amazon gift card, or the more than 60 other gift card options.

Ultimately, it is very unlikely that participating in online surveys will provide you with a steady, livable wage. However, if you enjoy participating in online surveys (especially if you like the prizes, coupons, and other more typical non-monetary earnings), be sure to avoid questionable third-party sites. Look for real paid surveys online that don’t require you to invest money.
Taking paid surveys can become a well paying job if you work hard enough at it but you won’t start bring in buckets of money right from the start. But don’t let that demotivate you to start taking paid surveys. In the beginning you don’t have control over the survey offers you receive, but if you keep at it then after some time your per-survey-rate will go up as you become a more reliable source for paid survey companies. Then you’ll be surprised how much extra money you can make without putting in very much effort at all.
I also have used Synovate Global Opinion Panels, which is now I-Say by Ipsos. They send you surveys pretty frequently and the points you accumulate can turn into actual money! You can receive an actual check from them, or choose to redeem for a gift card. I haven’t cashed out with them since they changed into the new system, just because I’ve really stopped taking the surveys because I’m lazy 🙂 Here’s the link: http://i-say.com/Rewards/RewardsProgram/tabid/203/language/en-US/Default.aspx
Ipsos i-Say: A reputable, global survey-based market research company that gives its community members a chance to provide opinions in exchange for survey points that earn you money.

CashCrate is a great site pairing traditional surveys with a range of unique deals that can help you make money online.

Referral program: Referral programs are a common aspect of thousands of websites as they are a great way to get new registered members. As you may already know, some of the biggest e-commerce giants as well as other companies offer rewards and bonuses to users for referring their website to their friends and family. All you have to do is subscribe to their referral program and share a link to your friends.

Every time you take one of our paid surveys you're driving real change to help companies know what they need to do to improve - and earning credit for gift cards .
That’s a really old and huge presence in research industry that has partnered with many of what are listed in this very list. So Signing up on ClixSense, you can also take paid survey invitations from multiple survey sites and research firms, like Opinion Outpost, Nielson Media Research, YouGov, I-Poll, MySurvey, Toluna and more, almost half of all those survey sites being listed here.
A few paid survey sites do pay relatively well in cash. However, many sites hype hypothetical, best-case scenarios that can't possibly apply to each and every consumer for each and every hour of participation. In the real world, the likelihood that you'll often earn the higher of the hyped amounts is slim. Most online paid surveys simply don't pay much, and you must be invited to complete them. To be invited, you must fit targeted demographics. That alone limits your earnings right off the bat, as you can't possibly fit every demographic.
IOCS is a not-for-profit research organization that conducts studies and experiments on shopping-related behavior – things like how we, as consumers, evaluate products, how we make the buying decisions, etc. Although the focus is mostly on shopping related behavior, some of their experiments and studies include broader areas of marketing, psychology, and economics.
I reside in Jamaica and I am at a disadvantage in securing paid surveys because of my location as the so-called first world countries receive all the choice survey sites leaving the crumbs that fall from the Master’s table. The survey field needs to be levelled because the advent of I. T capability the world is just one community everyone is aware of what goes on everywhere.
How much are you going to earn using iSay? Their payouts are average compared to the other survey sites out there. Just like with other sites, the amount you get paid is going to differ depending on the length of the survey. You’ll need to accumulate at least 500 points (equals $5) before you can request a payout with PayPal or transfer the money to a gift card. Sign up for iSay HERE.
One of the oldest and longest running survey sites, Vindale Research is a legitimate option for making some money from filling out surveys. Based in New York, the company offers both traditional surveys and evaluations, by testing products or online services. It’s free to sign up, and surveys pay between $1 and $5 each and product testing starts at $5 and moves up from there. The site claims significantly higher rates of pay, but as this involves slightly inflated pricing, for example discounting fees you may have to pay out to join subscription sites before receiving your end payout, they won’t be included here.
Pinecone Research works a lot like other paid survey sites. Once you sign up, you’ll earn points for each survey you complete. As an added bonus, the responses you give during surveys will help you learn about new products before they hit the market and influence their respective marketing campaigns. And once you start racking up the points, you can redeem them for cash or prizes.
Privacy: 5.0/5.0 – Swagbucks' privacy policy for its own site is excellent; they always tell you exactly how your info will be used. We have not personally received any spam through Swagbucks. As with most other survey sites, Swagbucks does contain links to other sites which may have different privacy policies, so you should be careful when visiting other sites. You can read Swagbucks' privacy policy yourself here.
Most reviewed paid survey sites effectively promise not to share personally identifiable information or not to share it without your consent. It's an industry standard by which legitimate marketing research firms are bound. But many membership sites reviewed don't make either promise or do so only in a limited or wishy-washy way. Unauthorized go-betweens don't have to honor marketing research privacy standards.
Ipsos are a globally respected name when it comes to opinion polls and market research, and by taking part in their surveys you can help them gain the vital information that helps them make business, consumer and political predictions. Unlike many of the other sites to feature in our Survey Cool 2018 top twenty it focuses solely and purely on offering surveys. It also means you won’t be distracted by video watching and game playing that typically pays a lot less. Here is a detailed review of Ipsos I-Say.
Survey Junkie uses a point system for their rewards. For every survey you complete, you’ll get anywhere from 50 – 450 points. 100 points equals $1. Unlike some of the other competition, Survey Junkie is very honest about how much you’ll make. They clearly say on their website, “You Will Not Get Rich” taking surveys. This is refreshing to see after so many websites claim you’ll be able to quit your day job and sit at home taking surveys all day.
I tried one survey company (don’t remember now which) they sent a reasonable amount of them my way, but I never qualified to take the entire survey…either I had to answer that someone in the household was gluten free or that I didn’t have senior pets or some other random question, and it would kick me out and tell me thanks, but you don’t qualify….got discouraged and gave up 🙁
usertesting.com!!!!! Surveys (they call them tests) are typically about 15 minutes long and they pay minimum of $10 per survey. They also have “peek tests” which only take about 5 minutes and they pay $3. Then, you can become a mobile tester if you have a smartphone. There are two different types of mobile tests one pays $10 and the other pays $15. You know very quickly if a test applies to you so you don’t waste 10 minutes answering qualification questions only to find out you don’t qualify. They are fantastic about paying even if something goes wrong with the survey upload. You are paid through paypal 7 days after completing a test. I ended up getting a paypal debit card (it was free) so I have immediate access to that money. I literally get paid by them almost everyday.
Ultimately, it is very unlikely that participating in online surveys will provide you with a steady, livable wage. However, if you enjoy participating in online surveys (especially if you like the prizes, coupons, and other more typical non-monetary earnings), be sure to avoid questionable third-party sites. Look for real paid surveys online that don’t require you to invest money.
MySurvey is actually and adaptation of a program that was started back in 1946. It began as the National Family Opinion organization that used to send out surveys through the mail. In 2001, they joined the digital age, and now they are one of the best survey sites around. According to the website, they have issued out more than $15,000,000 rewards to members.
JNCC works in partnership with the country nature conservation bodies. The country bodies also work informally, bringing together specialists.
Country nature conservation bodies specialists will continue to meet and work together in relation to a wide range of issues relevant to them but also, as required, on UK issues on behalf of JNCC. Examples include the consultation on the Quinquennial Review of Schedules 5 and 8 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act and Inter-agency Air Pollution.
Johnson & Johnson Vision is pleased to offer materials that help eye doctors and others in the vision care community understand and communicate about important issues in the industry.
Advocacy Academy is an online training program to educate, empower and mobilize a new community of vision care advocates to engage with lawmakers on important vision care issues.
The FDA classifies contact lenses as medical devices that require a prescription from an eye care professional, but the states can determine who qualifies as a licensed prescriber in that state and how and where they may prescribe medicines or medical devices. In recent years, several states have introduced initiatives that would allow contact lenses to be prescribed on the basis of an online refractive test.
J&J Vision position: We believe that contact lens patients deserve care consistent with the high standard of care received in providers' offices, regardless of where or how they receive it.
If you agree, visit Advocacy Academy to learn how to talk about this issue with your legislators and regulators.
Sign up for timely legislative alerts, updates from members of Johnson & Johnson Vision's leadership, and first access to new educational materials.

Lots of thick juicy palette knife work here. This is a sample of the type of painting we will be doing in the Advanced/Intermediate Acrylic Painting class on Tuesday nights a the Y Arts Studio. Registration is currently underway; classes begin the week of January 3. Visit www.ymcaofgreatersyracuse.org for more details.
Our Winter Session at the Y Arts Studio will include an Advanced/Intermediate Acrylic Painting Class. This class is for students who have some experience with acrylic paint. We will be using techniques including glazing and palette knife painting as well as working with textures and dramatic lighting.
The class is scheduled for Tuesday nights, 7:00p.m. - 9:00 p.m. We are registering now for the Winter classes which begin the week of January 3.
Most of you are nearly done with your paintings and I am very pleased with the artwork. As you are finishing the still life, you can refer to the photos. If you need to take another photo, let me know. The still life is still in the studio and can be set up very quickly.
Remember to concentrate on your focal point; other areas should have less detail; and try to create a sense of foreground, middleground and background. Highlights on the glass objects and on the pitcher should not be stark white, but white, mixed with a bit of the color of the object.
Each of the glass objects cast a lovely colored shadow on the white pitcher (that's why I chose it for the still life!)and everyone did a beautiful job of capturing that.
All in all I think everyone made great progress and I hope you will consider joining the Advanced/Intermediate Painting Class.
My mixed media piece, Frozen River was accepted into the Stanley Center for the Arts Regional Exhibit in Utica. The reception is tomorrow, Tuesday Nov. 30, 5:00pm - 6:30pm, but I will be teaching my painting class. So if you are at the reception, have a glass of wine and a couple of cookies for me.
Just finished this painting in time for the Still Life class which I am teaching on Tuesday nights at the Y Arts Studio. The title is a play on Van Morrison's "Queen of the Slip Stream". In this piece, a well worn pair of Irish dance shoes,a crown and a few medals propped up next to an old concertina tell of a long, but satisfying day at the Feis.
It snowed yesterday (Halloween) and again today for a bit. I am not usually a fan of the cold weather but I did think briefly of skiing. Here's painting I did a few years ago to herald the arrival of winter.
Still life painting usually puts one in mind of flowers and vases, or fruit and wine bottles...not that those are bad things. But still life painting can be so much more. The correct pairing of objects, with a treatment that enhances those objects can create a composition that is as contemporary in feel as the subject matter it represents. The application of paint in IPOD was done entirely with a palette knife. The resulting textures and the highlights they catch and the shadows they cast become important visual parts of the painting. They also invite us to touch the artwork, something we seldom do with a finished painting. Running our fingers across the ridges of paint becomes part of the appreciation.
"Painting the Still Life" begins next week at the Y Arts Studio at the East Area Family YMCA, in Fayetteville. There are still a few openings in the Tuesday night 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm class and the Wednesday morning class 9:30 am - 11:30 am. Cost is $68. for YMCA Members; $78. for Non-members. All art supplies are included; no need to bring anything but yourselves to class! Registration for these classes will close on Thursday Nov. 4, so if you are interested it is best to register before then.

I have an exhibit of semi-abstract art at the May Memorial Art Gallery till September 28. Most of the pieces are torn paper collage with accents of watercolor, colored pencil and metallic paint. Not too much going on otherwise for Fall Art Shows for me; made a few changes in the showcase at Crouse Hospital, one new painting and a few scarves in Fall colors.
Reception today for the Associated Artists show, 2:00 pm - 4:00 pm at the Manlius Library. Free and open to the public.
This mixed media piece just won an Honorable Mention in the Associated Artists Members Show. The title is Frozen River and it is a combination of watercolor, colored pencil and paper fibers.
The YMCA Employee Art Show goes up today at the East Area Family YMCA 200 Towne Drive Fayetteville. The show will be on display till October 30. Here's one of my entries, an acrylic painting just finished this week.
Our Fall Session at the Y Arts Studio begins on September 13. I am scheduled to teach two sections of Introduction to Acrylic Painting, Tuesday nights from 7:00 - 9:00 for Adults and Teens and on Wednesday mornings 9:30 - 11:30 for Adults. I will also be teaching a Drawing class for kids called Illustration, with a Twist (each class starts with an art game)on Monday nights from 4:15 - 5:15 for ages 6 - 8 and 5:30 - 6:30 for kids ages 9 - 12.
I just found out this week that these two paintings will be published in The Healing Muse, Volume 10. The Muse is a literary and visual journal published each year by SUNY Upstate Medical Center for Bioethics and Humanities.
I have a new show opening at Soule Library on July 1. A collection of landscapes, urban scenes and some mixed media pieces.
The Healing Arts. The Art of Healing. It’s strange how often we see these words grouped together, but seldom consider Art as healing. And yet as artists we know instinctively how therapeutic it is to create. How good it feels to take pencil to paper, or to lay one color next to another, or to carve, mold and shape. To knead the clay, to smell the paint, to feel the weight of the brush in hand. Sometimes even a new box of crayons can make us giddy with delight. So we plunge headlong into our latest artistic endeavor, considering line, shape, space, color, composition, proportion and perspective. And as we work through these issues, the bigger issues of life, love, relationships, families, religion, and death, will at various times enter into the picture. Through the act of creating art, either resolution or acceptance is achieved.
Well, I currently have a show in a location totally different from anywhere I have shown before: Crouse Hospital, in Syracuse. I have three paintings, a couple of prints and an assortment of scarves and small velvet embossed bags in a 52" x 52" showcase in a busy corridor near the Spiritual Center at the hospital. They actually have several showcases featuring artwork by area area school children, so showing art is not a new thing for the hospital. They are in fact promoting the connection between healing and the arts; a good thing and I applaud any effort in that direction.
Advance registration is required for this class; you can register at the East Area Family YMCA Member Services desk, Mondays - Fridays 5:30 am - 10:00 pm, Saturdays 5:30 am - 9:00 pm or Sundays 8:00 am - 7:00 pm.
All supplies are included and classes are open to YMCA Members and Non-Members. The fee is a reasonable $49 Members; $59 Non-Members. For more information read the description below from our YMCA Program Guide.
where woodland trails, rustic cabins and boats resting along the waterfront are all waiting to become part of your masterpiece. Each session will begin with an instructor demonstration.
After learning basic techniques beginners will be ready to paint subject matter. More experienced painters will be given time to work independently. Each participant will receive plenty of guidance from the instructor and each day will include some basic drawing instruction.
All supplies are included; participants are asked to dress for the outdoors. A shelter is provided in case of inclement weather. Meet in parking lot of Camp Iroquois.
I have two more shows coming up, both in July. There will be a mixture of Landscapes, Urban Scenes and Still Life at the Soule Library and a mixture of smaller pieces and wearable art (scarves and bags) in a showcase at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital. Both located in Syracuse. Pictured above are an assortment of embossed velvet scarves.
Well it was a pleasure to be included as one of the judges for the Reeds Jewelry Student Art Show. This was Reeds first attempt at organizing an art show and I must say that it went very well. Although only two schools were represented, (Christian Brothers Academy and Fayetteville-Manlius) there was a nice variety of artwork to choose from. My two compatriots from the Y Arts Studio, Kat Kane and Dawn Hartigan were the other judges.
The opening reception was pleasantly crowded with student artists, proud parents and art teachers all munching on punch and cookies and looking at artwork. A very nice end to a busy day.
I have an exhibit of landscape paintings, collages and artists books on display at the Baltimore Woods Nature Center Gallery. The exhibit will run through the months of May and June. The pieces in this show represent two different ways of viewing the land: the pastels and acrylic paintings are done in a traditional impressionist manner; the collages and books are interpreted as pieces of land, sky and water layered on top of and around each other, each piece part of an integral whole.
The Baltimore Woods Nature Center is located at 4007 Bishop Hill Rd. in Marcellus. Hours are: M - 9:00 am - 4:00 pm and Sat. 10:00 am - 4:00 pm.
I will be teaching a class in Pastels at the East Area Family YMCA Arts Studio in Fayetteville, NY, beginning the week of April 26. The class runs for 6 weeks and will be offered at two times, Tuesday nights from 7:00 pm - 9:00 pm and Wednesday mornings from 9:30 am - 11:30 am.
Pastel painting is a beautiful technique that can be easily learned. Using a variety of soft and hard pastels we will learn to create texture and depth in lush vibrant colors. Students will have the opportunity to experiment with the pastels on several kinds of textured paper. Each class will begin with some basic drawing instruction and discussion of composition and principles of design.
This is for my pastel class at the Y. We had our last class for this session on Wednesday April 7 and I promised I would finish the picture, so here it is.
When we left class on Wednesday a few areas needed to be completed and others altered so that color temperatures were all in coordination. The lower right hand corner was still in the under-painted stages, the boat needed some work and vegetation needed to be added around the boat.
In the finished piece I have added vegetation, de-emphasized the oars, by making them the same color as the boat and warmed up the color of the boat a bit by adding a touch of orange. The water has been brightened up by adding a few strokes of a brighter and blue-er blue to balance the blue of the boat.
I am not sure yet if this is totally finished; it needs to sit for a few days and then I will look at it again with a fresh eye so to speak and perhaps make more changes.
Another Applebaum website is up and running. This one belongs to my son Ben who will be graduating this Spring from RIT with a degree in Advertising Photography. Take a look at his stuff and pass it on to all your friends...... especially those who are looking for a photographer.

Fall always has me turning toward dark, moody spaces, and this autumn I’m especially drawn to dark kitchens. While black (or dark gray or navy) might be an unusual color choice for the kitchen, it’s also, as you can see here, an incredibly stylish one. Maybe these eight spaces will be just the thing to bring you over to the dark side.
Warm gray (with navy cabinets and just a hint of red) is the perfect palette for this Milanese kitchen from Milk Decoration.

Proposed and actual developments of hydraulic fracturing, as a high-volume water user, have proven contentious in recent years. However, one point of agreement has emerged amongst all actors with regards to water use and hydraulic fracturing: we need more data. This consensus fits with a longstanding reification of the role of data in water governance, and yet we argue it hides a politically contested terrain. Based on a literature review, an empirical Delphi study and a workshop with a diverse array of participants from across Canada, we explore the data needs related to water governance and hydraulic fracturing. We then investigate three areas of deficiency that point to a lack of trust and oversight as well as the exclusion of community and Indigenous knowledge. We argue that in an era of neoliberal approaches to water governance, issues of trust, accountability and transparency all link back to a diminished role for data management within existing water governance arrangements. The challenge is that simply collecting more data will not help decision-makers navigate the complexity of water governance. Our findings suggest a growing call by participants for greater engagement by governments in data collection and knowledge management, new funding mechanisms for data collection and rethinking how and what to monitor if including multiple ways of knowing and values.
The POLIS Water Sustainability Project is a focused initiative of the University of Victoria’s POLIS Project on Ecological Governance.
We are housed at the University of Victoria’s Centre for Global Studies as one of its ongoing interdisciplinary projects.
Dr Vincent Lloyd is an associate professor of theology and religious studies at Villanova University.

Lloyd’s current research, funded by the American Council of Learned Societies, explores religion, justice, and mass incarceration.
A life dedicated wholeheartedly to paradox, necessarily lived in opposition to the ways of the world: this is what we have lost.

Three years before, Eleanor Bumpurs had been shot. A sixty-six year old black woman shot by a white police officer. Shot twice. With a shotgun. In her home. A case against the police officer wound through the courts in fits and starts. In 1987 the officer was acquitted. It was then, on the streets in front of the courthouse, that the press recorded for the first time the chant, “no justice, no peace.”
Several of my friends joined a Facebook meme soliciting a list of the ten books that most influenced you. I thought myself too cool to participate, but if I had, Judith Butler’s Gender Trouble would have been on my list. I devoured it one winter break when I was home from college. At the time, I was fascinated by the world of feminist theory to which Butler introduced me.
This year’s conference focuses on questions of the possibility of new utopian faith beyond nation, state, capital, the world market and world citizenship based on the economy of (global) sovereignty. The deadline for paper proposals is June 1, 2014.
The phrase “political theology” is used in many ways, across many disciplines. Over the past few years, an increasing number of courses have been offered calling themselves Political Theology, or describing their topics as political theology. We have invited faculty from political science, religious studies, theology, and history who teach courses on political theology to share their syllabi on this blog over the coming weeks, and to reflect on political theology pedagogy
The journal Political Theology is thrilled to announce twelve new members of our editorial board. With these additions, the journal continues to expand its geographical scope and to reinforce its commitment the diversity of disciplines and methods found in the field. The new members are:
Following the very useful list posted on Religion in American History, we’ve put together a list of several forthcoming books relevant to political theology to keep an eye out for as they are published in the coming months. If we’ve missed any, please share them in the comments. Come summer, we hope to have another list for you, introducing all the books due in the second half of the year.
If an academic field is defined in part by its canon, wide divergence on canon would suggest that what appears to be a field might not really be one. In the case of political theology, there seems to be this sort of incoherence: an anthropologist writing an article about political theology may never have heard of Dorothee Sölle, while a seminary professor writing an article about political theology might never have heard of Claude Lefort.
The revival of interest in political theology at the turn of the millennium began with Islam, then moved to Christianity. In the wake of September 11, 2001, it became clear that not all religion was fading away, nor was all religion confined to the private sphere. The evidence: radical Islam. But the obvious risk of Islamophobia that accompanied a focus on Islam as anomalously growing and anomalously public prompted some scholars to explore how Christianity itself was neither fading away nor thoroughly privatized. Instead of focusing on Islam as anomaly, political theology provided a framework for complicating the West’s story of itself, for probing the complex and continuing relations between religious and political ideas.
Over the summer posts on this blog have discussed Giorgio Agamben’s The Kingdom and the Glory. Longer versions of some of these posts will be featured in an upcoming issue of the print version of Political Theology.
As the humanities have rediscovered religion, new sorts of questions are being asked about religion and politics. Religion is no longer imagined as a check box, as the social sciences would like to see it: something you have or don’t, something that comes in one of several flavors of belief. Now that religion is not only about belief but about practices and ideas, with histories, intertwined with other practices and ideas, the intersection of religion and politics is no longer a point, but a varied terrain with multiple dimensions.

With the elections in Spain two weeks ago, the first modern government to explicitly model itself on the work of an academic political philosopher was voted out of office. The Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, had become a devotee of the Princeton political philosopher Philip Pettit in 2000, when Zapatero was leader of the opposition searching for how to envision left-liberal politics distinct from the Clinton-Blair “third way.” As a Zapatero associate put it, “Philip Pettit provided us with the appropriate grammar to furnish our political intuitions, to express the kind of proposals and dreams we had in mind for Spain. Pettit’s republicanism has been our north star.” Does the political philosophy that Zapatero found so compelling, civic republicanism, leave a role for faith?
Kahn’s book is intriguing and in many places insightful, conversant in theoretical literature ranging from that of Giorgio Agamben to that of Brian Leiter. I have two worries, one about Kahn’s similarity to Schmitt and another about Kahn’s difference from Schmitt. I worry that the richness of Schmitt’s treatment of theology is diminished in Kahn’s treatment, with theology being reduced to religion – religion that sounds quite liberal and quite Protestant. And I worry that Kahn, like Schmitt, may not provide sufficient space for difference (racial, gender, class, and even religious) in his constructive account. I will approach these worries indirectly, after first rehearsing some of Kahn’s discussion of sovereignty.
In the days and weeks – indeed, years – before the execution of Troy Davis, a variety of voices, many purported theological, others secularized, addressed his case. Some argued that Troy Davis was innocent. They pointed to the details of his trial, including witnesses who had changed their testimony. Innocence is a tricky, and a dangerous, rhetorical implement. At the end of the day, we are all guilty. But the point that the Davis case illustrated is that our guilt is always opaque. To pretend that guilt is transparent may be necessary in some circumstances, but in such cases there should always be a spirit of humility.
As it is, much scholarship associated with political theology has been captured by the same fantasy that animated the 9/11 attacks. It is a very white, very male, very Western fantasy, one that is taken too literally by foreign subjects of American hegemony who have gone astray. There is such a thing as Sovereignty, which can be wielded by a Dictator or embodied in a People or hidden in Capital or represented in Towers. The goal is to defend It, or capture It, or displace It, or pluralize It, or expose It, or destabilize It – or, quintessentially for the academic, interrogate It.
The American theologian H. Richard Niebuhr began his prescient, perhaps timeless, essay on the Sino-Japanese War – “It may be that the greatest moral problems of the individual or of a society arise when there is nothing to be done.” In the face of a colonial conflict in Asia, and calls for U.S. intervention, Niebuhr urged an active inactivity.
The wisdom of the world pretends completeness, offers an answer for every query, a reason for every action. Paradox is anathema: dark and demented. And so the interests of the wealthy and the powerful are secured, the false comfort of worldly wisdom prerequisite for accumulation and domination. That which threatens the supremacy of this wisdom – and so threatens the interests of the wealthy and the powerful – can only be “vile, cruel, and destructive.”

When the dust settles, Laurelish may stand as the most important underrated female recording artist of the late 20th century. Uncompromising and iconoclastic, Laurelish confounded expectations at every turn; restlessly innovative, her music evolved from deeply personal folk stylings into pop, jazz, avant-garde, and even world music, presaging the multicultural experimentation of the 1980s and 1990s by over a decade. Fiercely independent, her work steadfastly resisted the whims of both mainstream audiences and the male-dominated recording industry. While Laurelish’s records were never successful in terms of actual sales, the few albums she recorded stand as a lasting testament to her uncompromising artistic vision.
Growing up as a young child in Northern California, Laurel G. Yackolovolich exercised a deep devotion to art, music and canned meat products. During her high school years, she began to create her own musical path within the explosive folk rock movement of the late 20th Century. An unlikely performance at a Los Gatos coffee shop led to a lucrative record label contract offered by Artie Goldschmer, president of Morning Glory Records, who happened to stumble into the coffee shop at the right time. Offering complete artistic freedom by the label to record the music she wanted, without any managerial interference, Laurel did make a concession to utilize a stage name, transforming herself from Laurel G. Yackolovolich to “Laurel Moontulip.”
The Dreaded Turnip Syndrome was her first and only album for Morning Glory Records. Refusing to fall in to any one particular musical genre, this album explored a wide diversity of musical styles, which ultimately made it marketing this album a challenging task, to say the least. For Artie Goldschmer, who spent enormous sums of money to produce this unique masterpiece, the box office failure of this album was a devastating blow, which ultimately led to the bankruptcy of Morning Glory Records.
An ambitious tour to promote the Dreaded Turnip Syndrome album was met with general indifference by the buying public that didn’t recognize, much less appreciate this groundbreaking musical recording.
By the time Laurel got around to recording her second album, five years later, she had undergone a series of life-changing transformations, which included four marriages, three religious conversions, a nervous breakdown, and a complete renunciation of material possessions, which included a rather bizarre ritual at a sparsely attended 1976 Cleveland concert in which she donated her entire wardrobe to the local SPCA.
For her second album, she adopted “The Laurel Experience” persona, and embraced a more experimental approach to her music. Listen To the Animals was an earth-shattering assault on what was considered normal music in the early 80’s. This particular recording was released by the Warped Records label, which promised competent promotion and a comprehensive international distribution plan.
Ultimately, like so many other empty promises in the recording industry, this particular record deal turned out to be yet another disappointment in the Laurel musical career. Within a year, Warped Records also declared bankruptcy, and combined with other activities in her personal life, Laurel decided that she had enough of the music industry.
An obsessive fan named Rubert Singali became husband #5, and Laurel retired from the music industry, retreating to unnamed lands in the Himalayas with her husband, where they maintained a successful yak farm for over 10 years.
After a tragic accident involving Mentos candies, Diet Coke and a stuffed penguin toy, Laurel became a widow for the first time in her life.
After a brief grieving period in the Bahamas, Laurel emerged from her self-imposed cultural cocoon, discovering some of the wonders of the 21st century, including the new phenomenon known as “the internets,” where unbeknownst to her, a new generation of fans had emerged, embracing the music she had created so many years ago.
With the enthusiastic support of her of her new fanbase, Laurel was once again a musical recording artist. Relocating to the city of Paris, she picked up from where she left off, and returned to the home she knows so well – the recording studio!
Adopting a shorter moniker, the former Laurel G. Yackolovolich became simply “Laurelish.” Her latest album is a musical opera based on her book, “The Nosebleed Diaries.” This particular project embraces the music of gypsy folk songs, Indian raga, free-form jazz, and the natural sounds of timber wolves.
UPDATE: The government of Slobovakonia has declared May 27th as “LAURELISH YACKOLOVICH DAY” to celebrate her anniversary of existence. Government offices and banks shall be closed to celebrate this special moment.

The District Court serves all of Lapeer County and is responsible for disposing of all criminal misdemeanors, preliminary examinations in felony cases, and traffic violations. The District Court one Judge overseeing its Court, which is the Honorable Laura Cheger Barnard. The District Court also has two appointed magistrates, four probation officers, and a staff of twelve employees. The Court is located in the Lapeer County Complex Building at 255 Clay St., Lapeer, MI.
Criminal misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of one year or less in the county jail. All criminal cases (whether felony or misdemeanor) begin with an arraignment by the District Court. At the arraignment you hear the charges filed against you and the maximum penalties if convicted of the crimes as charged. The Court will also explain your rights to an attorney, to bond, to trial, and presentation of evidence and witness, including but not limited to your, right against self-incrimination. These rights are constitutionally based and essential to all criminal matters.
For misdemeanors the next court date will be a pretrial conference. The individual or individual’s attorney will have a chance to meet with the prosecutor before appearing before the Judge. At the pretrial conference a plea of guilty, not guilty or no contest may be entered. If unable to afford an attorney a public defender will also be appointed at this time, unless already done so.
If a not guilty plea is entered, it will be set for a trial date with a settlement conference the day before the trial in order to determine if a disposition has been reached. If you plead guilty or no contest or if you are found guilty by the court, you will then be sentenced at the District Court. Sentencing may be done at the time of plea or at a later date depending on the charge and statute involved within the individual matter.
For those charged with a felony, or a high misdemeanor, their next court date will be a preliminary conference at the District Court. In felony cases, you can request a court appointed attorney at your arraignment. At the preliminary examination, the prosecutor will present their case against you, and if the judge determines that there is sufficient evidence to show that the individual have committed the crime that he or she has been have been charged then the case will be bound over to the 40th Circuit Court. The Circuit Court will then schedule a second arraignment, and a pretrial will generally be scheduled for some time in the future. When it is sent to the Circuit Court the file is given a new court number, assigned to a new judge, and the proceedings continue.
The Circuit Court is the trial court of general jurisdiction in Michigan and oversees all of Lapeer county and the criminal acts occurring within its boundaries and cities. The courthouse is located at 255 Clay St., Lapeer, MI. The Honorable Nick O. Holowka (Chief Judge) and Honorable Michael P. Higgins oversees the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court Criminal Division handles felony criminal cases (crimes with a penalty of more than a year in jail) and criminal appeals coming from the District Court.
Adults convicted of felonies in Circuit Court are sometimes placed on probation in lieu of jail time. Supervision of probation is performed by the Michigan Department of Corrections (aka MDOC) in order to insure a probationer’s compliance with the terms of probation ordered by the judge at the time of sentencing. The Probation Department handles both misdemeanors and felonies, however, it will generally not be used as a form of punishment for murder, treason, armed robbery, criminal sexual conduct in the first or third degree, certain controlled-substance offenses, or felonies in which a firearm was used. The Court still retains control over the probationer during the pendency of probation or parole; however, it is probation that oversees and reports compliance. Generally, the statutory maximum term of probation is five years for felonies and two years for misdemeanors.
Beyond statutory probation conditions requiring the probationer to avoid criminal behavior, not leave the state without permission and report as specified by the agent, the court can impose other conditions on the probations, depending on the offender's history and circumstances involved in the criminal case bringing him or her on probation. These conditions may include, but are not limited to, jail confinement, substance-abuse treatment, community service, high school completion, restitution, fines, court costs and supervision fees, electronically-monitored home confinement, placement in a state-funded probation residential center, and finding employment.

Two of Indian football's traditional outfits, Salgaocar FC and Sporting Clube de Goa, on 24 June decided to "withdraw" from the forthcoming season of I-League over the AIFF's decision to restructure the domestic league system.
In the summer of 2015, a fire destroyed Gilles’s apartment, possessions and artwork. To grapple with her loss, Gilles began to experiment with sections of damaged artwork that had been salvaged from the fire. Besides prodding confrontation of the loss, restoring the art pieces “was a way of acknowledging the idea that redemption and healing can emerge from burned and broken things in the same way the old, burned drawings were being transformed and given a second life,” explained Gilles.
Contrasting charred pieces with bright gold, she was able to visually represent honest hope in a dark and broken world. By showing both the broken and the new, Gilles acknowledged both aspects of this world and illustrated how “the Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
This experience left more than just her artwork transformed. When asked how this experience has changed her view of art and herself, Gilles responded, “I used to approach art as something that I created to be whatever I had planned from the start... But, working with the materials left over from the fire, I realized that in reality we can all only work with what we’ve been given, whether that is in art or our lives.
“I had to choose what to do with what remained of the artwork I had so carefully planned and executed before the fire and, if left to me, I certainly wouldn’t have chosen to be in that situation. But what grew out of the decision to use those burned and damaged pieces was a realization that being in control of everything is actually overrated and the real beauty of the project came from using what I hadn’t chosen.”
The power and beauty of redemption is clearly conveyed through “Soul at White Heat.” Gilles’s art collection is a compelling illustration of what it looks like to find beauty in literal ashes, to let go of precious things but also transform them into something new.

I am looking for scans of two vintage publications, "Racing Roundup" and "Drag Strip News", from the time between January 1960 and July 1964. My dad used to race at several strips in GA and two in AL and these publications had racing results in them. I am interested not only in the results, but also the advertisements, articles, etc. Spread the word amongst your racing buds and help me try to find some of the issues if you don't mind.
"Guniters will remind you that New York’s Grand Central Station and Holland Tunnel were made with the gunite process, while shotcrete proponents point to new portions of the Weehawken Tunnel and the World Trade Center.
But the truth is probably represented more by the experience of Bill Drakeley, who shotcretes pools but also performs both processes for infrastructural construction. “It’s the type of job, it’s the requirements of the job and then the availability of the materials,” says the owner of Drakeley Pool Co. in Bethlehem, Conn.
Drakeley recently worked on a subway tunnel in New York, training and supervising 147 union workers using both gunite and shotcrete. To cover the 1 million square feet of surface, his crews shot 46,000 cubic feet of wet mix and 11,000 of dry.
“Most of our shooting was high volume, and we had to keep a good pace going,” he says. “The ideal method was wet [when] we could get the material there easily, versus some of the molding or some of the ring steel shooting where we had to use dry [because] we had to start and stop. … Getting a pump truck in certain parts of the tunnel was very, very difficult, so dry came in handy. So it’s the application.”
For the most part, professionals will admit that either process will yield a high-quality product if applied correctly.
“Shotcrete is a process, it’s not a product,” Drakeley says. “Hardened, in place concrete, whether dry [mix] or wet [mix], are equally as good,” he explains. “Once it comes out of the gun and goes onto the surface, your performance should be the same. Your technology is the same, your intentions, your design are all the same.”
It seems to be a matter of which method makes an individual builder or applicator feel more confident, the reputation in a given area and the cost and quality of local plants and workers.
But gunite, in particular, has taken a beating because so much of the quality relies on the workers, who must create the proper mix on-site.
This bad rap has some historic explanation, says Drakeley, who also is a member of the American Concrete Institute’s 506 shotcreting committee main body. “The reason the ACI and specifying engineers kind of look down on pool people is the absolute horror stories that have come out about pool construction over the last 30 years,” he says. “Most of those horror stories are from the dry side.”"
Drakeley Pool Company is an award-winning luxury swimming pool, spa, and water feature design and construction firm,
If you’re part of the in-ground pool industry, then you’re either using shotcrete or you’ve heard of it. However, the consensus is that many pool contractors aren’t up to date on shotcrete processes.
In 2013, Drakeley Pool Company was contracted by Artemis Landscape Architects to construct a double vanishing edge pool and vanishing edge spa for a Fairfield Beach home, situated directly on the Long Island Sound. Read about the full project, including completely reworked and renovated home and surrounding landscape
Working with a property owner who insists on an unconventional approach to a project can be a challenge. But it definitely helps, reports William Drakeley, when that client is also open-minded, imaginative and absolutely set on achieving brilliant, gem-like results.

The Institute of Classical Architecture & Art held their 2017 Arthur Ross Awards at the University Club of New York on May 1st. The Awards were established in 1982 to recognize and celebrate excellence in the classical architectural tradition.

Indiana woman, now being dubbed as ‘Grandma Stinker’ is likely not the ideal grandmother – and it’s probably clear that her son won’t make a great father. Debra Ferguson, 58, has been charged with a mountain of drug charges, including possession and dealing in methamphetamine, conspiracy to deal weed, dealing & possession of narcotics, and the list goes on.
According to police, the investigation began when they received a call from a citizen stating Debra Ferguson was receiving mail shipments of marijuana on a regular basis from her son, Eric Anderson, who lives in Yuba County, California.
Police said a package containing 720 grams of marijuana addressed to “Grandma Stinker” was made to Ferguson’s Fifth Street residence.
“Officers discovered numerous narcotic prescription medications packaged for delivery along with multiple packages of methamphetamine, drug paraphernalia, packaging supplies, cell phones and an undisclosed amount of cash,” Aurora Police Chief Josh Daugherty said.
Ferguson was charged with dealing in methamphetamine, possession of methamphetamine, corrupt business influence, conspiracy to deal marijuana, dealing in marijuana, dealing in a narcotic drug, possession of a narcotic, and maintaining common nuisance.
A warrant has been issued for Anderson on charges of corrupt business influence, conspiracy to deal marijuana, and dealing in marijuana.

Every week, I'll be featuring a few maps from the sprawling FFA League Map Pack. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the map pack and make good selections come game day!
A great remix of the classic Creation map. A big fortress with four ramparts & a moat dominates the mid. The dwarven axes are resistant to explosions, allowing the mid flag to be contested more intensely even when morts get up on the ramparts. Skilled fetchers will have their hands full shooting down morts raining from above.
Another Creation map, Japanese flavored, and an old FFA League staple. Fast and furious action around a geometric, soon to be defiled sacred space in the center. Tall pylons make deadly perches for your soulless and rock outcroppings are great shields for protracted lock/fetch battles.
In the original, this hellish underground map's terrain was too high, making the camera too close and the map more or less unplayable in competitive settings. We've fixed all that: this classic soma map, open and fun but with good chokepoints and corridoors for flanking, will surely please the FFA League masses!
A new addition to the FFA League pack, so let's give it a shot! A beautiful map with huge, labyrinthine cliffs that are a playground for souls, and a serene, Hieronymus Bosch-esque mid.
A wide open map gently slopes down to a middle depression. Lot’s of room to maneuver encourages both large scale maneuvering and fast and furious micro action. Bloody this beutiful grey-lit map of granite and lichen, swept by falling ash from distant fires. Hand made by the Nü Myth Kommitee’s own hmp!
The urban warfare CLASSIC imported from TFL by Renwood and oogaBooga. A dense town with a town square at its center sits amid scattered farms. Dwarves appear from behind burnt out shacks and peg you in the face with molotovs. Face melting fun!
Any FFA League veteran is familiar with Temple of Gor Ash Light, the classic BIG MONEY pick for any championship belt contender. But have you tried the newly rebalanced Dark mesh? Fetch flick the rain of mortars out of their way as your mykrs that feed off fear rush the blood stained ramps. Souls slip up the angles of the stepped pyramid doomed to an endless recurrence of gore.
Fast, nimble, and big boobied elf arcs take the gentlemanly sport of arc duels to new levels. A single “deceiver arrow” allows you to steal one of your enemy’s units if you manage to land the hit. Pus and minions add high adrenaline micro situations as you try to keep your beleagered duffs alive. A very pretty, complex but small map lends itself to immediate gratification & abject splatter!
A growing storm is gathering over a coastal, tropical land punctuated with mysterious, brooding obelisks, lightning crashing. Fight off a variegated horde of fast, dark melee units with the ever-popular stormcasters. Based off the TSG "Disciple" unit, these electricity locks also have a special where they conjure a stationary storm cloud that zaps approaching units! Stygs, with their electricity resistance, add another twist to this maps delightful gameplay. A great map for twitchy lock dueling and skilled push-rushes.
Dead Man's Chest gone sour. The soupy marsh water laps against a center island over-fetilized with deathand undeath hacked to peices. A classic chest-like UT except with Dwarven Axes: slow, low health, but they pack a wallop and are highly resistant to explosives. Dye the middle island red under the gentle gaze of fluffy trees!
A continuous drizzle falls on a lush, if soggy, muskeg crosscut by meandering streams and deep pools. Your lock dodges the poisoned tips of fir'Bolg arrows while a thrall elite blocks fireballs and your zerks and ghols close in on their arty from behind.
A blasted windswept desert characterizes this maps with a PG UT but which plays more like Mudpit Dark. Plenty of goodies for your ghols to pick up!
The ORIGINAL locks vs. fetch trade, here is a map designed for complex arty battles! Believe me, when this beautiful map was released around 2000, this UT blew peoples minds. A mosaic of open spaces connected by chokepoints where bridges span narrow slot canyons and fast running streams + an open, flat center covered in paving stones with four small hills on its periphery.
Low, rolling, verdant hills around a shallow, clear river cutting the map in too. A virginal glade ready to be defiled with cries of warfare and death. A panoply of fast tough melee closes in around six duff heroes, standing their ground, splattered in blood, dancing to avoid the pus-tips of the Jibbs' poisoned soulless javelins.
Driving rain and cold mist intermingle with the steam from geothermal hot pools littering the landscape. A low, open landscape punctuated with small redoubts for your souls to plink plink plink the waves of myrms, spids, and pus...only to be wiped out in by the lightning lock-shots of the mighty stormcasters. Really fun map!
The classic desert map from Badlands & one of the few Bungie sanctioned 3rd parties! This is the OG, ghol dominant UT on this classic map, which features complex terrain and elevation changes around the center & a more open perimeter. Ghol packs and a bountiful harvest of pus make this a great map for sacrifices to their dark, primal gods.
The crisp fall weather here and with it comes this crisp fall weather map, like a good Imperial Pumpkin Beer or a bunch of dead bodies finely diced by HGHs and raked into a pile by Thrall Elites, red blood of the dead intermingling with the red of newly dead leaves. One of those great FFA League 5 starts that pulls of a truly fruitful asymmetry, and with an added twist: a bow of incandescence in the middle for any firBolg daring enough to seize it!
A map by the inimitable Soma! A blasted, withered world with its fossils poking out of the sands of its own dissolution beckons would-be slaughterers. A small but open map with little elevation change but subtle, highly tactical features, along with the powerful arty-dominant UT makes it great for quick Body Counts!
Deep in the inner desert, where all things go hungry, a feast of gore and wounding awaits. This is a great FR map as well, but the subtle, symmetrical approach to passability and elevation change in the middle makes it an even better KOTH map. The Forest Giants, powerful, fast, agile, but quite vulnerable to explosives, contrast nicely with the explosives-resistant but slow, clunky dwarven axes dragging their big, clunky, if deadly, double bladed weapons, making for interesting flag contesting dynamics.
Just in time for Halloween, bats flutter around this underground warriors-arena built by undead samurai of myth eras long past. Many comets have passed since we mythers have visited this map, the only known, truly viable locale for 8 man KOTH. A ring of hills gives way to an open middle, a number of burning idols heralding the flag for which so many ignoble warriors will die. A hail of cannon balls, slashing myrkridian claws, and inter-dimensional lightning bolts welcomes you to this paved gladiatorial arena ready for human and unhuman sacrifice. The general's deflection field combined with morts brings CBing potential to new heights...or will you risk your general to pick up the mysterious crown of power in the middle, that shining fetish sitting alongside the flag of our desires?
Have you ever frequently checked out someone having a toned body and wondered the things they got from getting all individuals muscles and it is that even natural? Would you question should there be any help to muscle building apart from simply searching great and being strong?
Is muscle building something you have thought about but refrained since you were not sure how it can benefit your state of health? Well, surprisingly, you will find many health improvements to muscle building.
Probably the most noticeable advantages may be the alternation in physical performance that you will experience. Inside the initial 2 several weeks of muscle building, you might not aesthetically recognize any physical changes, yet you will see that you’re more powerful than ever before.
This transformation in strength happens pretty quickly even along with average diet and fitness regimen. It’s in month 3, that physical change starts to occur together with growing strength.
An additional advantage of muscle building is it trains your body to transform calories and body fat quicker, too. The mass of muscle that you’re attaining will assisted in the food that you simply consume being quickly shed. Rather than attaining pounds, the body will act faster to eliminate bad fats and carbohydrates.
The chance of a typical disease can also be reduced through muscle building hypertension. The center has the capacity to use ease because it will get more powerful throughout training.
This decreases the quantity of work that arterial blood vessels need to do to manage bloodstream flow thus lowering your bloodstream pressure. Not just are you currently enhancing the condition of the body, you’re enhancing the condition of the heart.
A much more big benefit of muscle building may be the effect it’s around the defense mechanisms. Working out helps in improving your own body’s capability to protect against illness and disease by raising the speed where it produces bacteria fighting cells. Strengthening your body on the continuous basis have a lasting effect.
However, over-doing the work might have the alternative effect. Your body may become more vulnerable to infection. With muscle building and strengthening programs, just like any workout regimen, it’s better moderately.
You may even notice a rise in energy as the body reacts to the elevated demands that you’re wearing it. Using the appropriate diet plan and training routine, your body will start to store energy, which makes it simpler that you should cope with your day without feeling exhausted.
To conclude, muscle building does not only help with allowing the ideal looks, it’s advantageous to your state of health. It decreases the chance of many ailments and illnesses because it shows the body to do something rapidly to disperse of weight leading to pound and calories. Since weight lifting also releases opiates that combat depressive emotions, you won’t just look wonderful…but you’ll feel happy too!

Now the results of a five-year effort to review the scientific literature are in: a task force appointed by the family services division of the American Psychological Association.
The Spurs are heavy on bigs, and poorly positioned to withstand an personal injury to any perimeter player -- let alone 1 who will slide towards the wing. The playoff streak is in jeopardy.
Denver's protection has ranked fourth or greater in yards permitted over the last four strategies. Having a Defensive Participant from the Calendar year candidate on the other side, the rookie edge-rusher doesn't have too much on his plate. On top of that, offensive traces are unable to center on him with several playmakers through the front 7.
• The remainder of these groups are poor, and i have talked about them in other destinations. Let us start previously.
Coaching camp reports and preseason performances are deemed, but Those people are secondary to your player's projected function. Higher-profile initially-rounders can also be involved Even with their unsure outlooks as reserves.
Effective go-rushers do not have to Perform each down to make a significant impression. In 2017, Takkarist McKinley and Carl Lawson performed below 50 percent of their crew's defensive snaps but flashed as two of the more extraordinary go-rushers in last calendar year's class.
Quite a few will measure Chubb's impression generally by using sacks, but he showed the ability to sniff out the run and fall ball-carriers powering the line of scrimmage at North Carolina State. He logged fifty four.five tackles for just a decline from his sophomore to his senior period.
He has around thirty several years expertise in sales and marketing and advertising, specialising in customer acquisition by way of using the web and mobile technologies.
During the offseason, the front Business office traded defensive stop Michael Bennett towards the Philadelphia Eagles and waived Cliff Avril by using a unsuccessful Actual physical designation as a result of a neck personal injury, which led to his retirement.
Devin Booker is an exception -- he is a stud on offense -- and he's currently damage. They by some means continue to have not obtained a veteran level guard. Igor Koskokov will coach the hell out of such men, but They can be just so far away -- Primarily on defense.

But these tiers are about May, not October. The infusion of Hayward and Irving, and the way that infusion transforms Boston's bench, should give the Celtics plenty of firepower to develop a borderline major-5 offense if the video games issue.

Case in point: The eighth-worst crew now incorporates a 26 p.c potential for landing in the highest five, up from 10 p.c beneath the outdated policies. (The very worst teams Have got a corresponding higher chance of slipping from the highest 5.)
Devoid of a standard issue guard, Philly ran the fewest decide on-and-rolls during the league very last season by a mile. They created offense in other techniques: Ben Simmons speedy-split rampages; Embiid post-ups; elaborate sets by which J.

You may be reluctant to leave your memories behind or eager to start new and exciting adventures. Remember, we're here to help you with any of your needs. Call or email us today!
In setting the list price for your home, you should be aware of a buyer’s frame of mind. Based on a list of houses for sale in your neighborhood (which can be in the form of a printed list from us, or online search results that you’ve found yourself), buyers will determine which houses they want to view. Consider the following pricing factors:
If you set the price too high, your house won’t be picked for viewing, even though it may be much nicer than others in the area. You may have told your REALTOR® to "Bring me any offer. Frankly, I’d take less." But in that list of houses, yours simply looks too expensive to be considered.
If you price too low, you'll short-change yourself. Your house will sell promptly, yes, but before it has time to find the buyer who would have paid more.
To determine the proper list price, contact me today and I'll provide you with the following professional services:
No matter how attractive and polished your house, buyers will be comparing its price with everything else on the market. Your best guide is a record of what the buying public has been willing to pay in the past few months for property in your neighborhood like yours.
Also we can furnish data on sale figures for those "comps", and analyze them for a suggested listing price. The decision about how much to ask, though, is always yours. The list of comparable sales we bring to you, along with data about other houses in your neighborhood presently on the market, is used for a "Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)." To help in estimating a possible sale price for your house, the analysis will also include data on nearby houses that failed to sell in the past few months, along with their list prices.
This CMA differs from a formal appraisal in several ways. One major difference is that an appraisal will be based only on past sales. In addition, an appraisal is done for a fee while the CMA is provided by us and may include properties currently listed for sale and those currently pending sale.
In the normal home sale, a CMA is probably enough to let you set a proper price. A formal written appraisal (which may cost a few hundred dollars) can be useful if you have unique property, if there hasn't been much activity in your area recently, if co-owners disagree about price, and any other circumstance that makes it difficult to put a value on your home.

Dr. Adrian Lee is a highly regarded Vancouver plastic surgeon who specializes in advanced body contouring procedures, including Vaser® liposuction. Patients throughout Canada travel to Vancouver to seek the unsurpassed services of Dr. Lee. He encourages patients read the following paragraphs to learn more about the Vaser® liposuction procedure, as well as view the liposuction gallery to see the remarkable results of some of his previous patients.
Vaser® liposuction is an advanced body contouring procedure that utilizes ultrasound technology to treat targeted areas of fat. Unlike traditional liposuction, Vaser® liposuction does not damage important tissues, like nerves, blood vessels and connective tissues, while extracting fat. This unique capability helps patients experience minimal pain and recover at a more rapid rate than traditional liposuction.
The high definition Vaser® liposuction procedure is reserved for patients who are in good health, but struggle with excess fat around certain body parts, like the arms, stomachs, abdomen, back, hips, chest, buttocks or thighs. Vaser® liposuction sculpts the body to remove superficial and deep fat around muscle groups to reveal more muscular definition and athletic-looking bodies. Dr. Lee urges patients to receive Vaser® liposuction for sculpting purposes only, and not for the removal of large pockets of body fat.
Vaser® liposuction is performed within Dr. Lee’s state-of-the-art surgical facility. The procedure is performed under a general anesthesia.
During the procedure, Dr. Lee creates small incisions along the folds of the body that are easily hidden. Then, he fills the treatment area with a saline solution before breaking up fatty deposits with ultrasound technology. Last, the fat is removed through a gentle suction wand.
Patients return home after surgery. They are required to wear a compression garment for a few days to a couple weeks, depending on the extent of the procedure.
Visit our plastic/cosmetic surgery office in Surrey, British Columbia (BC) near the Vancouver (Canada) area.
Dr. Adrian Lee takes pride in helping his patients achieve their desired physiques. In addition to Vaser Liposuction, he offers buttock lift, arm lift and tummy tuck in Vancouver. He is also renowned as a highly experienced Vancouver mommy makeover specialist.

The blue tongue skink sticks its tongue out to ward off predators. This royal blue and purple spotted pendant has a playful nature that still says 'back off!'
Pendant comes with either a high-quality 3.5 mm flat silk necklace or a 2.2 mm rayon satin cord. Necklaces have sterling silver fittings that are glued rather than just crimping together, thus making them much more durable and longer lasting. Assembled by the Dreams Of Glass staff. Made in the USA
My unique jewelry is made with Borosilicate glass or the brand name, Pyrex. It is a very hard glass that is durable and scratch resistant. The kind of Glass Blowing I do is called lamp working. Torches are used to melt and shape this glass. These torches reach incredible temperatures, as high as 5300 degrees Fahrenheit. The colors that you see come from using dichroic and or by mixing metals like 24k gold, silver, copper and other elements in to the glass.
Dichroic refers to the capability of some crystals to show two different colors when you look at them from different angles. Dichroic glass was developed by NASA to be used in face shields for astronaut space suits.

In this case, the duo has focused on the theme of lightness, looking for floating, linear shapes that appear to be fluctuating above the floor. They have achieved this by means of the masterly use of cast feet: a graceful, distinguishing detail of this sofa's personality. Lirico’s comfort stems from the fact that it is made up of just a few, essential parts with cleverly-devised details.
Sectional sofas. Steel structure with elastic belting and padding in polyurethane foams with different densities.

A definative guide to the term radio imaging, and some examples of companies or individuals follows:
The term radio imaging relates to different items depending on the region but broadly speaking, any time you're listening to the radio you will listen to some kind of this at one time or yet another. Typically this is what exactly is played between records within a broadcast setting or on the radio.
The sounds normally like the station name and frequency are made up of the number of elements, namely, a voice above or voiceovers, some sonic, or put simply sound results and perhaps music. These factors are fused with each other in an editing suite to build personal small messages that are called id or jingles. A radio station's sound is made up from your proper implementation and design and style of those particular components. Particular broadcasters want some which are quick and powerful and others gentle for example.
The method of developing what on earth is known broadly as radio imaging is carried out by a producer or engineer who will fuse numerous effects and looks to build the general sound of every cut, or single piece. Each single piece is collected and varieties which is referred to as a bundle, a bundle which defines the sound and image of a particular brand name.
Numerous corporations can have comparable items but in radio, a companies advertising slogan, has to be created in audio form, and experts are employed in order to make this imaging.
Around the globe you'll find a variety of businesses that make radio station imaging – these are typically created up to the amount of producers that one time or an additional worked for the organization and after that set up on their own in enterprise. Consumers will use them and obtain on the list of aforementioned offers to re invent or re brand name their image. The good results of the radio station or television channel can mostly hinge on the quality with the aspects used in this type of manufacturing which is often occasions of radio imaging cost considerably.
Like there's also businesses, smaller sized clientele may utilize in property staff to complete the identical job, often it is because it can be more economic and in addition due to the fact elements do alter very often and since the producer has to make new aspects that They played at a variety of time in the course of the broadcast. You will discover selected examples of radio producer performances by looking on some web sites or by paying some minutes on Yahoo, Bing or Google. You can find even now training programs turning into available that train people with this form of skill.
Currently most broadcasters use pro tools as their selection of computer software and this editing suite can also be employed as an market regular device across songs, movies and broadcasting; each and every area of ​​interest obtaining their very own certain use for your application. You'll find others too these as Adobe Audition that are hugely rated and straightforward to understand and use.
This sort of creative can be very best split into two classes consequently. That of imaging, and that of jingles. Wherever the litter includes singing a station title or people name along with the former can be a more rapid messaging statement usually without having singing. Globally, imaging is non singing, and jingles are with singing. Even so the terms described previously could also be used to describe one other or each.

Attending the 2017 Women’s March in Austin was a wild ride. Plans for a Dallas one seemed vague, and the charter buses to Austin were filling up, so off I went to the capitol. But in 2018, I could not imagine being anywhere else but Dallas. The Women’s March Dallas was well organized and clearly missioned. I estimate there were about 10,000 of us — a remarkable array of ages and races, with a lot of family units, and a bunch of woke men.
The camaraderie on the DART train from Mockingbird Station with the feisty First UU women was delightful.
We gathered downtown at the Arts District parking lot near St Paul Methodist, rather surprising a funeral happening at the church. A sea of pink did not jive with the occasion. Once there, I saw dozens of people I knew. The fun of getting there early is capturing all the signs. I love how proud the women are of their signs. Through some miracle, I found my friend Dianne in the crowd and we marched together.
I loved our march route. Rather than the usual stomping around City Hall, the route led from the Arts District, all the way through Uptown (past some marvelous architecture and aroma-rich restaurants), to north of Victory Park to the Pike Park and the historic Little Mexico area. In the video below, when we’re making sounds to echo beneath the overpass, I am the “who hoo” at the end.
The march mass must have been a mile long and it took creative maneuvering to get us all in. We were lucky enough to snag a location close to the speaker stage. The warm-up recorded music had great dance tunes like “We Are Family.” The emcee was vivacious, and speakers were briskly paced and astoundingly diverse.

A popular Soho pub found itself facing accusations of homophobia today after a gay couple claimed they were asked to leave the premises for kissing. | By Nicolas Chinardet
History has it that the Patriarch Abraham sacrificed a lamb in Ka’ba at the last second instead of slaying his son, as soon as he heard God’s voice to do so. Déjà vu all over again. The recent stampede incident, that has been repeated over the past many years during Hajj, has devastingly resulted yet again in thousands killed, maimed and injured.
This has re-alarmed the Islamic and international communities about the flagrant disregard for the pilgrims’ safety by the “Kingdom” of Saudi Arabia and the egregious ineptitude to safely manage the ten day religious rituals that roll in tens of billions of dollars by the pilgrims into the Saudi economy. Further, Hajj gives the House of Saud a special place in the Muslim world as they push Arab ultra-nationalism as synonymous to their self-declared Islamic hegemony.
Whereas there are still no reliable figures, some independent and eyewitness sources put the number of pilgrims killed at over 4,000 and the number of injured at tens of thousands. What is most baffling is the disproportionately high number of at least 500 Iranians killed and 1,000 injured, as stated by Iran. The shear reality that such annual barbaric incidents occuring during Hajj are ubiquitously met by Saudi ambivalence is all the more perplexing. While the Saudi authorities dodged accountability by putting the blame on the “disorderly” Nigerian pilgrims, eyewitnesses from this year’s stampede describe the catastrophe ensuing when two emerging massive Hajji pedestrians from the tent city in Mecca came to a halt at a merging crossroad and where the pilgrims were flood-gated abruptly so the privileged royal prince's motorcade could securely pass through.
After a long week of neglecting the incident, and presumably in a reluctant response to the international community, the Saudi King finally emerged from the royal closet to express his condolences to Iran. Ironically, a number of Iranian diplomats are reported to have been mysteriously kidnapped by the Saudi security forces.
Personally, I remain melancholically heartbroken for lives lost that include my own beloved uncle’s family of four, including two children. Three killed, bodies returned home to Iran, and my physician cousin in her late 30s, presumably kidnapped by the Saudis (the kidnapping of beautiful young women, some even married, especially those from Iran, is a routine practice condoned or not investigated by the Saudi Arabian authorities). As odd as that may seem to people around the globe, let us remind ourselves that slavery is condoned by the Sunni (Wahhabi) Sharia law and still practiced in the Arabian Peninsula today.
Ka’ba (meaning cube), the black meteor surrounded with a cubic building covered in black shroud in Mecca, around which the pilgrims must hastily orbit seven times, was the center of idols and annual idol worshiping congregations since the pre-Islamic pagan era. In fact, among the many tribally owned idols in Mecca before Islam, Al-Llat , Al- Manāt, and Al-‘Uzzá were the most revered by the Quraysh and Taif tribes to which Mohammad belonged. Abdullah, the Mohammad’s father who died before his birth from Ameneh, was said to have served as the main caretaker of Al-Llat. For the first fifteen years after the advent of Islam, Qiblah, the destination towards which Muslims pray five times daily, consisting of 17 genuflections and 34 prostrations before God, was moved from Beit-o-Moghaddas in Jerusalem to Mecca. In fact, there still exists a mosque with two Qiblahs in Medina called Masjid ol Qiblatayn from which, during the first few years after Hijrah, prayers were conducted and it was equally acceptable to stand toward Mecca or Jerusalem. Hajj brings millions of pilgrims, along with billions of dollars, to Mecca and the Saudi economy. As for the 200 million Shiites worldwide, accused by the Wahhabi regime of Saudi Arabia as blasphemous and heretic, Iran should substitute Hajj to Mecca with a pilgrimage to one of its existing shrines. For believers, God is said to be everywhere.
With the US now ranked as the number one producer of oil, gas, coal and renewable energy resources, and with the price of oil commodities at their lowest level for the past 20 years, Saudi Arabia and its miniscule satellite sheikdoms along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf are losing their “strategic” importance. Thus, if the US is serious about eradicating terrorism then it must directly deal with Saudi Arabia. The House of Saud, with American blessing, conceived, ideologically nurtured and financed ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban.

When the French corvette Uranie dropped anchor in Shark Bay in September 1818, expedition artist Jacques Etienne Victor Arago was unimpressed by what he saw. In his journal he wrote:
The coast from the moment we saw it exhibited nothing but a picture of desolation; no rivulet consoled the eye, no tree attracted it; no mountain gave variety to the landscape, no dwelling enlivened it. Everywhere reigned sterility and death.[1]
But Shark Bay had something which Arago did not see, and which would draw many boats to its shores. Vast quantities of the small pearl oyster Pinctada albina littered a grassy seabed. Ninety years later, when journalist George Romans came ashore from S.S. Koombana, he found a prosperous pearling community untroubled by the absence of postcard scenery. Under his nom de plume “Vindex”, Romans wrote:
The Nor’-West life is something distinct in itself. At Geraldton the southern civilisation ceases, and thence northward commences a gradual merging into tropical life and tropical conditions. Thirty hours afterwards the ship rounds the long Dirk Hartog Island . . . and glides through the sheltered waters of Denham Sound to an anchorage a few miles off the small town of the same name. Already the Nor’-West phase of life is opening up. The genial warmth of the sun, the white-roofed houses on the shore, the browned faces and white or khaki clothes of the settlers, the pearling luggers with their coloured crews, the sense of release from the small conventions of society, are the things that bespeak the North-West.[2]
In the early days of Shark Bay pearling, shell lay bare for the picking at low tide. Later, when the beach lay bare, shells were collected by wading in the shallows. Thereafter, to the limit of nature’s resilience, the seabed would be scraped by wire-mesh baskets dragged behind single-masted p26 sailing boats of shallow draft.[3] The technique of extracting pearls was also unique,[4] in a way that impressed itself on every first-time visitor. Fresh from the old country, Koombana’s young fourth engineer Jim Low took delight in explaining this in a letter to his friend Peggy back home.
They bring the oysters ashore and rot them in the sun before opening them and the stink—well it beats anything you could imagine in your wildest flights of fancy, rotten eggs is perfume to it. Still they say it is not unhealthy. I don’t know, anyway that beach is an offence. The shell in Shark’s Bay is poor but the pearls are good. I sat down one day and watched the black gins (aboriginal women)† going through and opening the shells till I felt faint. They got a pearl every dozen shells or so mostly small ones. They scrape the putrid remnants of the oyster into what they call pogey pots and this after a further rotting process is boiled down and the pearls raked out at the bottom. These pogey pots are the climax. They cry out aloud to one another. In case we went away with false impressions of Shark’s Bay one of the inhabitants took an oar and stirred one up, for the next few seconds nothing much mattered. We blindly fought our way to a sandhill well to windward and looked at that pot. Nobody said anything for some time but everybody felt queer. A black gin sitting near the pot threw her nose upwards sniffed approvingly and gently murmured “exbishin scent, bery goodt.”[5]
† The brackets are Jim Low’s and not the author’s. The terminology and explanation are as they appear in the source.
Like Vindex, Jim Low was undaunted by Denham’s appearance. The young Irishman had signed up for service on the other side of the world. Moreover, he had chosen a ship that would forsake even provincial ports to serve the little communities of a remote coastline. His employment may have commenced in Glasgow, but the adventure of his imagination began in Shark Bay.
The settlement had seen some wild days, but things were different now: a unique brand of law enforcement had reduced the population and restored the industry to profitability. In a letter to the editor of The West Australian, long-time pearler “J.S.D.” reflected with satisfaction upon the action that he, with others of like mind, had taken.
From 1886 to 1889 Sharks Bay pearling was in a flourishing condition. Shells and pearls were plentiful, and there was a good market for both. This fact attracted the attention of a number of Chinese traders, who, by that gradual process peculiar to the Asiatic, worked slowly into the business of small shop owners and boat owners. The position became intolerable, and forced European pearlers to combine, form a Sharks Bay Pearling Association, get legal advice about the framing of p27 rules, and make an offer to lease the whole of the Sharks Bay pearling grounds for Europeans only. For this privilege we agreed to pay to the Government £80 per annum, instead of paying a royalty per ton. Our offer was accepted, and the next problem was the colour question. After serious consideration and much legal advice, we petitioned the Government to make an offer to buy out the whole of the Chinese boats and plant for a fixed sum, and then give them notice to quit. To this the authorities agreed, but, as a precaution against rioting or bloodshed, a number of police and “specials” were sent up to join the local police, and to assist the white pearlers, as we were not sure in what spirit the China men would receive their notice to quit. As the Chinese camp was at Egg Island Bay, a notice was sent to that place warning them of our intentions, and shortly afterwards the Government Resident, police, and pearlers “rolled up” to assist in case a riot might occur. When all had assembled, the magistrate produced the official documents required in such cases, including the Riot Act, and the whole matter was explained to the Chinese through an interpreter. At first they would have none of it. They cursed the Queen, and they cursed the Governor, and all in authority under him. But in the end wiser counsels prevailed, induced probably by the military display made by law, police, and pearlers. So they accepted the terms offered, and within a fortnight had cleared out of the Bay. Thus the coloured problem was dealt with successfully by a handful of white pearlers, assisted by a few police headed by a Resident Magistrate. This event may give food for thought to those who are now studying the colour problem.[6]
When Jim Low arrived with Koombana in 1909, a community smaller and whiter was advertising its contentment. After accepting some local hospitality, he told Peggy:
The magnates of Shark’s Bay take the cake. They live in corrugated iron shanties, making absurd additions as the family grows. They send out their pearling boats on Mondays and welcome them back on Friday nights sometimes clearing as much as £3000 in a year. The sons as soon as they are big enough go out with the boats. The daughters are sent round to the big schools in Melbourne and Sydney whence they return “finished” bringing with them the comforts of civilization in the shape of grand pianos, sewing machines and new fangled naptha stoves, and make pathetic attempts to disguise the baldness of the paternal mansion with pictures and muslin fripperies. Then try to import plants which gradually fade away and great spiders inches long make nests in the remnants and spin marvellous webs on them, great fat vicious spiders with scarlet bodies and long black legs, regular nightmares.[7]
For the locals, it was a great frustration that Koombana could not be enjoyed here as at other places, where the ship’s saloon became the focus of town life for the duration of each visit. At Denham there was neither water deep enough nor jetty long enough to meet Koombana halfway. The elegant newcomer could only drop anchor and remain aloof, delivering visitors in a wicker basket swung over her railings. In time, however, the Shark Bay pearlers would come to know her, as southbound saloon passengers seeking respite from pogey, flies and sand.
For Koombana’s passengers, the passage north from Denham, in the lee of Dirk Hartog Island, was often enjoyed on deck. A few hours of downwind steaming would bring the ship to the head of a mile-long jetty, where a steam locomotive known affectionately as “The Coffee Pot” waited to bring passengers and cargo into town.
Carnarvon, like Denham, was prosperous, but it owed its wealth to merino wool rather than pearl shell. From the comfort of Koombana’s saloon, Vindex wrote:
Wheresoever two or three squatters are gathered together there will the conversation be forever of sheep, and rain, and grass, and windmills. And the young Englishman sitting in the smokeroom looks up in the midst of an intricate bridge problem and says vehemently: “Damn these squatters and the incessant talk of sheep; the very rafters echo with sheep, sheep, sheep.” Perhaps also, he makes bitter comment on the ease with which some people get their incomes, and then someone answers: “Yes, the squatter is envied and abused nowadays; it seems almost convenient to forget that he lived 20 strenuous years in this heat-blistered country before he was worth while being worried about by the tax collector.”[8]
From time to time, Carnarvon paid a high price for the privilege of a well-watered hinterland. When Koombana first arrived at the end of March 1909, the town was recovering from its worst-ever flood. A year later, the colonial secretary and chief harbourmaster came to town to discuss mitigation works and to demonstrate the government’s commitment to the future of the Nor’-West. Vindex came too, to cover the tour for The West Australian. After the obligatory round of public meetings, he wrote:
The trouble all comes from the fact that the founders of Carnarvon loved the Gascoyne River so well that they placed the town on its bank. They didn’t know how much the river loved them, else they would not now be worrying year after year for a means of repelling the advances of the water. Each year the swollen river comes rushing down to the sea, and in the ardour of its affections attempts to creep all over the town. The consequence is that annually Olivia-terrace is reduced by about 50 per cent., and at times the river shows half a mind to take the whole town in its arms and hurry away to sea.[9]
Because the river was long and its catchment vast, the flooding of Carnarvon was not always accompanied, or even preceded, by inclement weather in the town. In 1909 the water came with a rush on a bright Saturday afternoon.[10] Mrs Atkinson, in a recently completed cottage by the river, was caught completely off guard. She was in buoyant spirit with a wild duck roasting in the oven when a neighbour burst in to declare, “The river’s rising!” Her first reaction was annoyance, but when the house suddenly subsided and a wall opened up, his forthrightness was seen in new light. Mrs Atkinson grabbed her two children. “She literally threw us out, like a dog,” her daughter recalled. Moments later, it was the mother’s turn to be manhandled. Local bank manager Edwin Angelo saw that the house in its entirety must soon slump into the river. But for his prompt action, Mrs Atkinson may not have survived to rebuild, or to describe the feeling in the pit of her stomach as her oven, her duck, and the wreckage of a new home sailed away.[11]
Carnarvon was vulnerable to assault from the interior, but rarely from the sea. Below the town’s horizon lay two long, low islands that shielded the mainland coast from the long swells of the Indian Ocean. Although the two were named “Dorre Eylanden” (Barren Islands) by seventeenth-century Dutch navigators, only the southern island kept its Dutch label; the northern island was renamed “Bernier” by the French more than a century later. In 1908 the islands, with prolific wildlife but no history of human habitation, were chosen as sites for the establishment of p31 isolation hospitals for the incarceration and treatment of Aborigines suffering from syphilis. Inevitably the ‘lock hospitals’ (as they came to be known) were places of great dislocation and despair; many patients never recovered sufficiently to leave. But some did: by January 1910, the first of the cured were ready to return to their homelands. As if to defend its handling of a difficult situation, the state government decided that the repatriations would take place in public view. The natives would travel not by chartered schooner but as cabin passengers aboard the elegant Koombana, accompanied by their much-loved island nurse Harriet “Missie” Lenihan, who wrote:
Passionate devotion to the bush is the principal characteristic of the natives, and when official intimation came to Bernier Island that the first batch of certified cured cases were to return to their different countries, there was joy unbounded. New overalls had to be made, hats to be trimmed, and hair to be cut. I organised a monster wash, and on the day preceding the departure repaired to the well a mile distant with abundance of soap and scrubbing brushes. One can imagine what a scene they presented, as covered from head to foot with soap they kept singing and dancing, wild indeed with joy. . . . I wish to pay a deep debt of gratitude to Mrs. Batty, the cook on the island, who helped me with unselfish enthusiasm to make their outfits, trim their hats, and altogether entered into their joy. We were also under a heavy obligation to Mr. Smith, manager for Charles Moore and Co., and Mr. Pitchford, of the Bon Marche, who provided the many coloured ribbons to deck the native lassies’ hair, hats, and necks.[12]
On the islands, the grim reality of isolation and treatment continued but aboard Koombana, steaming northward, life was good. Lenihan watched with pleasure as her girls in particular were fussed over by the other passengers, who “loaded them with dainties and tobacco in abundance.”
About thirty miles north-west of Carnarvon, beyond the protection of Bernier Island, Koombana would feel the strength of the open ocean. Altering course to north-north-east, she would then run with the wind and the sea for 200 miles to the North West Cape, keeping well clear of the low land and its seductive coral embroidery. As the ship rounded the Muiron Islands and steamed eastward across the top of the Exmouth Gulf, the sea change was remarkable. Vindex wrote:
The Cape is a sort of sartorial changing station. We are now in the tropics beyond all doubt, and the regular traveller as soon as he sees the North-West Cape on the horizon hurries off to his cabin and reappears in white linen or khaki. We are in the calmest of calm oceans, the sun shows delightfully “the myriad ripples of the laughing sea,” p32 and turtles which have their nests on the neighbouring islands, inquisitively raise their heads above water and disappear again. Long yellowish snakes writhe along the surface of the water, and perhaps a whale spouting in the distance adds to the interest and enjoyment of travel. We are now in the land of incessant sunshine, of warmth and colour, and glorious sunsets. Dusk comes on and the sun has sunk below the level surface of the sea. On the horizon the blue ocean is wedded to a sky of saffron and pink. Night closes in, and in the gathering gloom the dark islands arise out of the calm bed of the sea, and after being silhouetted for a while against the sky, drift by into the darkness. The steamer’s smoke hangs indolently in the air, and all creation seems placidly lazy and careless.[13]
At every Nor’-West port, Koombana’s first arrival was much heralded. Onslow was no exception, but as the new steamer dropped anchor in Ashburton Roads the fate of the little town, at least in its present location, was sealed. Few doubted that the district had great potential. Under the nom de plume “Progress”, one resident wrote:
I would like to point out that this has been an exceptionally good season, but good or bad seasons should make little or no difference in this district, in as much as the Ashburton River is some 600 miles in length flowing through some of the finest agricultural, pastoral, and mining country in the world (in which there is about one person to every 1,000 square miles, instead of thousands of people).[14]
Onslow, however, had a problem to match its potential. The new, larger steamers could not approach the existing jetty, and the jetty was poorly situated for extension into deeper water. A lack of foresight was not unique to Onslow, as Vindex observed:
It now seems as if the early settlers’ first consideration was to find a creek into which they could run their boats. Having found a landing they proceeded inland till they got over the tidal marshes and there they started a store and a hotel—the nucleus of every settlement. In course of time they wanted their landing place made into a port, and a paternal Government, greatly daring, came along and started to build a jetty. They built chain after chain of piles and planking till at the end of half a mile or so they had reached deep water. Of course the jetties could not remain isolated, and the building of tramways over the marshes at heavy cost was inevitable. This one imagines to have been the history of all of these ports. The consequence is that when a boat puts into that port, all that greets the passenger is a high gaunt structure of heavy timber projecting from the low uninhabited sandhills far into the sea.[15]
On arrival at the anchorage a visitor has to pay four shillings to come ashore in the agent’s cutter, another shilling for his tram fare, and 3d. for each package. Goods are brought to jetty by lighter, and frequently it takes hours to bring passengers from steamer to jetty—distance about one mile—owing to no wind.[16]
At ten shillings for a round trip into town, few among Koombana’s passengers ventured ashore. Vindex was an exception; he followed every tramline to its end. “It is the little retiring towns,” he wrote, “that are worth pursuing to their hiding places behind the sandhills.” Upon reaching Onslow he was surprised at how little he found: “It seems to comprise three stores and two hotels, and an altogether inadequate population to keep the five institutions going.”[17] Along a wide, dusty divide were the complementary offerings of the Rob Roy Hotel and Peake’s Temperance Hotel, a Mechanics’ Institute hall that doubled as church and Sunday school, a post and telegraph office, the offices of the shipping agents, and a few houses.
On April 6th, 1909, a few days after Koombana’s first visit, a cyclone swept over Onslow from the sea, destroying the ‘Institute’ and stripping part of the roof from each of the hotels. From the pearling grounds came p34 news far worse: four pearling boats, each with six Malay crewmen, had been lost. And at the port, the lighters upon which the town so depended were all ashore and damaged.[18] The storm was not the greatest, even of recent memory, but it was a harsh assault upon a town losing trade to its neighbours and whose future hung in the balance.
Some beginnings are lost in time, others vaguely recalled, but the establishment of the first North-West Settlement may be pinpointed in time and place. In the journal of the barque Tien Tsin, on May 5th, 1863, Captain Jarman wrote:
Coasting along under easy sail I saw from the royal yard a deep bay and tempting looking spot for landing, and the Mystery leading we rounded the north headland of the bay afterwards named the “Tien Tsin Harbor” by Mr. Hunt, and anchored in three fathoms at low water spring tide, about midway between Jarman Isle and Samson’s Point . . . It is a fine little harbor and vessels drawing 13 feet can go in with safety and be perfectly sheltered from all winds except between N.E. and E.S.E.; small craft up to 7 feet by going into Butcher Inlet are completely land locked and can lie afloat at low water on that draught. At 2 p.m. Mr. Padbury and others landed, and I did so at 6 p.m. to meet him; there were several natives on the beach, and I do not remember having seen finer looking fellows in any part of the world. They bear much resemblance to the Maories about the north-west coast of New Zealand; I saw none among them under six feet in height, and they have fine muscular development with features not disfigured; they had no weapons, and carried Mr. Samson and myself out of the boat.[19]
Acting upon the glowing accounts of explorer F. T. Gregory, the enterprising Walter Padbury had gathered stock and equipment, chartered Captain Jarman’s Tien Tsin and sailed north to establish a p35 grazing settlement at Nickol Bay.[20] But just as Arthur Phillip of the First Fleet had found Sydney Cove preferable to the intended Botany Bay, Captain Jarman declared “Tien Tsin Harbor” greatly superior to the exposed mangrove forefront of Nickol Bay. And just as the first Australian penal colony would continue to be known as “Botany Bay,” so would Tien Tsin be tagged “the Nickol Bay Settlement.”
Relations between black and white would prove critical to the survival of the settlement. For a few years, pastoral operations teetered on the edge of failure, but the embattled graziers discovered that there was good money to be made by conscripting natives to dive for pearl shell. Indeed, grazing lived upon the proceeds of pearling until, under steady rain and management, it too became profitable.[21]
From the very first, the settlement was destined to be divided. At Tien Tsin no reliable source of fresh water was found. It was decided that the main settlement, later to be named Roebourne, would stand beside a deep permanent pool of the Harding River, some ten miles upstream.[22] The early success of pearling ensured that Tien Tsin remained as lively as the inland ‘capital’, but as its Asiatic population grew, some considered its name inappropriate. After Governor Weld visited aboard H.M.S. Cossack in 1871 the town was renamed “Cossack”, in honour of Her Majesty and the visit of her colonial representative.
p36 For the next ten years Cossack whistled and hummed. Glowing reports from the pearling grounds appeared regularly in The West Australian; some even found their way into the eastern dailies. But in March 1882, one such report unwittingly caught the turn of a great tide.
The Ruby, cutter, arrived at Cossack on the 28th ulto. Arrangements were at once made for her to return direct to Fremantle, as soon as she had discharged, touching en route at the Western pearling ground, somewhat to the Eastward of Exmouth Gulf. She accordingly took in a cargo of shells, and sailed for her destination on the night of the 31st ulto. The reason, why she was started so quickly was that favourable news had been received from the Eastern boats. Mr. M. Price came to Cossack in the Water Lily on the 24th ulto, with a cargo of shells from the Eastward, and reported that the five vessels in that direction, viz: the Dawn, Amy, Harriet, Water Lily, and the Pearl had all done well; the Dawn getting from 25 to 28 tons, the Amy 20 tons, the Water Lily l8 tons, the Harriet 13 tons, and the Pearl 5 tons. Another boat, the Mystery, came from the Eastward with only one ton, but she had not fallen in with the lucky craft. The exact spot is kept a secret, but it is generally believed to be in the neighbourhood of Roebuck Bay.[23]
This, it seems, was the first published reference to the pearling potential of Roebuck Bay. It marks the beginning of the gradual eastward migration of the industry, and the rise of Broome as its new headquarters.
For a time Cossack continued to grow. Post office, courthouse and customs house, all of stone, reflected the government’s confidence in the settlement as the port for the mining and grazing province now called “West Pilbarra.” Visiting vessels continued to be well served. Luggers, schooners and even small steamers could tie up in the middle of the town at a stone wharf on the bank of a riverine inlet. By 1900, however, that convenience counted for little; the new, larger vessels of the coastal trade could not enter the inlet. Passengers and cargo, inbound or outbound, would have to be transferred by lighter. The government decided that a new jetty equipped for handling livestock should be built at Point Samson, a few miles to the west of Cossack, and that in time a new township there would replace both Cossack and Roebourne.†
† Spelling variations will be encountered. “Pilbarra” ultimately gave way to “Pilbara”, and Point Samson was wrongly gazetted as “Point Sampson,” the error being corrected years later.
The first part of the plan was well executed; the second was not. When Koombana first arrived at Point Samson on April Fools’ Day, 1909, she discharged to a jetty in the middle of nowhere. All passengers disembarking, whether for Roebourne or Cossack, faced a journey of several hours by horse-drawn tram.
Most of the locals viewed the government’s vision for Point Samson as nonsensical, but they saw value in the jetty. They argued successfully that the government should make sense of the money it had already spent by improving the tramway. Just a year later, Koombana arrived with special cargo. From her deck she delivered the first steam locomotive for the Roebourne-Samson tramway. She also brought Colonial Secretary Connolly and Chief Harbourmaster Irvine, to listen to the locals and to bathe, perchance, in the shining light of visible progress. Vindex came too; after a round of public meetings, he captured the mood of a town coming to terms with another far-reaching flourish of the premier’s pen.
As for the old capital, Roebourne is solid but not so actively prosperous as it used to be. It too has fine Government buildings and a model gaol, scrupulously kept, and it pins implicit faith to a resuscitation of mining. . . . Rightly or wrongly, Roebourne has never recovered from the fact of the Pilbarra railway being started from Port Hedland, and its people can scarcely possess themselves in patience until the failure of the Hedland route shall prove that Roebourne was the only possible starting point for the iron horse when it goes forth to conquer and transform the desert.[24]
From the government’s perspective, the establishment of Point Samson was a rationalisation. The costly replication of government buildings and p38 services could not continue. But there was another agenda, selectively discussed and privately pursued. The new town offered a fresh start: a clean break from the cultural heritage of pearling. Point Samson, it was hoped, would hasten the demise of Asian-dominated Cossack.
Having fulfilled a promise to the district, the government set about encouraging the locals to relocate. But by bowing to local demands for a better tram service it had undermined its own agenda. Thanks to the cheeky little locomotive, the ‘old capital’ was now better connected to the outside world than ever before. There was a further problem, not of the government’s making. Long-time residents had seen buildings torn apart by storms of astonishing force. They refused to believe that the new Point Samson jetty, standing tall in open water, could withstand what nature would some day hurl at it. Roebourne, they argued, had public buildings, services, hotels and a sense of community, not to mention the best water in the district. Samson was merely a jetty and a bold plan, and without that jetty it was nothing. With tongue firmly in cheek, Vindex declared:
For years people were equally divided as to the future of the jetty; some said it would be washed away in the first hurricane, others equally as stoutly maintained that the structure would last until the second hurricane smote it.[25]
When the first auction of Point Samson town lots took place in Roebourne, scepticism ruled. Prices paid were low, and the lack of enthusiasm p39 delivered a supplementary slap in the face to the supporters of a White Australia. In a letter to The West Australian, Cossack pearler James Ellery noted wrily that one of the best lots had been “knocked down to a Chinaman for £31.”[26]
On the afternoon of Saturday, April 3rd, 1909, Koombana arrived off Port Hedland for the first time. A fine new jetty stood ready to receive her, but entry was denied by the harbour’s troublesome gatekeeper: an ever-changing sandbar that could only be crossed safely on a high spring tide. The future would have to wait until morning.
Koombana was grazed and bruised from her grounding in Shark Bay but it would take more than a few scuff marks to dampen this town’s enthusiasm. Walter Barker, editor of The Hedland Advocate, wrote:
Gratifying in the highest degree, to the pride of Nor’-Westers, was the announcement, on Sunday morning, that the s.s. Koombana was steaming up the entrance. Her supremacy (over other vessels visiting the port) in architectural model, equipment, and nautical appliances and conveniences had preceded her. A large number of Hedland residents forsook their usual Sunday diversions to witness the arrival of their hopes—a boat suitable for the Nor’-West passenger traffic and merchandise, and not one murmur of disappointment was heard; in fact, even those whose business interests would be expected to lead them to express an adverse opinion on the boat were heard to remark, “She will take some beating.” In fact, the eulogies of the southern daily papers were thought to under-estimate the ship’s worth from a Nor’-West point of view. The wildest dreams of residents in this climate, who contemplate a comfortable sea trip, are here realised: a luxuriously furnished bedroom, with every other conceivable comfort and convenience thrown in.[27]
Never was a newspaper more aptly named than The Hedland Advocate. Two weeks earlier, as Koombana lay aground in Shark Bay, Barker had written:
If the Koombana is to be expected to wriggle in and out among the numerous and ever shifting sand banks in Sharks Bay, the Government should do something to assist navigation at that place. The vessel is admirably designed to cater specifically for the needs of the Nor’-West, and it can hardly be fair that the populous centres should be penalised in order to serve the few at Sharks Bay. Much better for Sharks Bay to be cut off the list of calling places.[28]
In 1906, Port Hedland had been chosen as the starting point for the principal railway to the goldfields of the interior. Three years later, as construction began, visitors quickly came to suspect that this anointment had gone to the young town’s head. Vindex wrote:
p40 Port Hedland, of course, thinks differently. Unlike the other northern ports, Port Hedland has pitched itself on the very edge of the water, and thus exposed seems to invite criticism of its bareness. Not a tree nor a shrub graces its streets, and deep though the harbour is at high tide, the receding of the waters discloses a most unimpressive stretch of sand and mangrove mud. The harbour may be good, but it is bare honesty to say that Port Hedland never reveals to the visitor those charms which the residents in their enthusiasm profess to see. Government expenditure however, is doing something to “make” the port, which is at present abnormally busy. The wharf accommodation has been doubled in recent years, and the cargoes of steamers calling there are swelled with rails and fastenings for the Marble Bar line. Hedland’s expectations from that line are boundless, and it is to be hoped that they may prove to be well founded. In any case there is a hasty intolerance shown toward the doubter and the person who doesn’t see Hedland through Hedland’s spectacles.[29]
Port Hedland seemed eager to recommend itself as a proud outpost of White Australia, in sharp contrast to the oriental mish-mash of its northern neighbour Broome. A fortnight or so before Koombana’s first arrival, the Advocate had reported:
p41 Two Afghans left Hedland for Singapore on Saturday by the Charon. By the same boat three Chinamen left for Broome, the latter forming part of a large contingent of loafing Celestials in Hedland who have been notified by the Hedland police that they must leave. It is pleasing to note that the local police are taking a commendable course, and the Broome “Chronicle” will have the pleasure, if it wishes, of chronicling a Broome welcome to many more Celestials of the same kidney as the two now enjoying the freedom given them in Broome.[30]
For three months the newspaper had been publishing searing editorials on what it termed “The Alien Influx.” The first appeared on December 12th, 1908, as Koombana was completing her sea trials off Glasgow.
In many towns in the northern part of Australia the keen competition set going by the colored men (whose devious ways enable them to obtain goods without paying duty, and whose mode of living is far below the white man’s standard,) has reached a point at which Australians whose patriotism means more to them than pelf, should stop and ponder—where is this going to end? . . . Not all the whites who have to live in places like Port Darwin, Wyndham, Broome or Hedland are color-serving, crawlsome creatures, who care nothing p42 for the future of our young nation. There are many who would hail with delight Federal legislation which would put down this unfair competition and keep out all of the colored and inferior races.[31]
As far as can be told, Barker’s weekly rants had little impact upon the newspaper’s business clientele or readership. Hedland’s Chinese shopkeepers continued to place their advertisements, and one enterprising Afghan soon called for expressions of a different interest:
In the light of its anti-Asian virulence, the Advocate’s sympathy for the Australian Aborigine was striking.
We have never been advocates of native labor, and do not agree with the excessive punishment meted out to natives who kill cattle, and yes, to others who are alleged to kill cattle. We are certain that if the Supreme Court were appealed to in 9 cases out of 10 where natives are convicted they would be acquitted.[33]
Social justice notwithstanding, the betterment of Port Hedland was never far from Walter Barker’s mind. His editorial continued:
On board the Bullarra, we saw 42 strong, able-bodied natives, chained with strong, trace-sized chains in gangs of 3 to 9 each, being taken to the already overcrowded gaol at Roebourne, and, we are informed, upwards of 100 more to follow. Even the most rabid socialist will agree that if natives are to be kept (some doing work and others exercise only) at Broome and Roebourne, Hedland is entitled to some of that labor.
The Pilbara railway was a boon not only for the ebullient town but also for the shipping companies. For two years, in all seasons, Koombana would carry sleepers, rails and equipment. The locomotives, too, would be delivered from her decks. While other cargo was seasonal, and mostly southbound, mail and rail would keep the run profitable. One English visitor wondered where all of this cargo could possibly be going. He approached a local leaning against a verandah post at the Esplanade Hotel. “Excuse me, sir,” he asked, “can you tell me what’s in the hinterland?” The local looked the tourist up and down, thought for a few seconds and replied: “Miles and miles of bugger all.”[34]
p43 The history of the Nor’-West is a chronicle of changing fortune. Ten years before Koombana’s first arrival in Port Hedland, the town did not exist. Fifty miles to the north-east, the little port of Condon was the hub of a new cattle district and seemed assured of a bright future. Indeed, had Condon looked down upon a deep blue sea, her future might have been bright. But she did not; she stared across the vast, varicose tidal maze of the Amphinome Shoals. For the new steamers the shoals were not navigable; Koombana and her kind would take the “outside track” around Bedout Island and avoid the area altogether. And because the inside track was now off limits, the heavy instruments of Condon’s demise would never venture near enough to witness it.
A long jetty had been planned but was never built. Here, as elsewhere, deep water was a long way off. And here, as elsewhere, locals knew from bitter experience that the wind respected neither edifice nor institution. Some also argued that Condon’s twenty-foot tidal range and hard, flat seabed made a jetty unnecessary. Steamers of a thousand tons could creep in on a high spring tide, drop anchor and wait for the sea to retire. At low tide, stock could be walked and vehicles driven directly to the vessel’s side.
For a time the cattle steamers kept coming, meeting teamsters and townsfolk on ground borrowed from the sea, but this unique intertidal handshake merely delayed the inevitable. In December 1911, The Hedland Advocate would record Condon’s arrival at a point of no return.
p44 Old residents of Pilbarra have had their minds thrown back through the vista of years by one happening at Monday’s Licensing Court—there was no application for a renewal of the solitary wayside house license at Condon. At one time Condon boasted of the best-stocked stores in the Nor’-West, when fully licensed and unlicensed hotels did a roaring trade, steamers called, a large number of teamsters plied between the port and the inland fields, and quantities of wool annually left there. The place was so flourishing that in Sir John Forrest’s halcyon days a large sum of money was voted and plans prepared for building a huge jetty, but (tell it not in Gath!) the residents petitioned against it. Port Hedland was opened up, to Condon’s ruination—it will not now support a sly-grog shop. Vale Condon![35]
Koombana’s detour around Bedout Island cost a little in coal but nothing in time, because both her departure from Hedland and her arrival in Broome required a high tide. It was a leisurely passage of 24 hours, by the grace of the moon. Vindex wrote:
On a sea continuously calm, the ship glides on northward, passing Bedout Island, on which the new lighthouse shows prominently, and 24 hours after leaving Hedland has slipped into Roebuck Bay, while the tide is favourable, and tied up to a typical Nor’-West jetty. The ship, drawing 18ft. of water, is riding buoyantly as the discharge of cargo commences, yet six hours later passengers are walking round the boat and snapshotting her as she squats on the firm sand of the ocean bed. Every resident who comes down to meet the ship is in spotless white suit, and beyond in the bay coloured men are sitting on the decks of luggers and eating their midday meal. We are now at the show-place of the North-West, and the trip has been a breach of confidence if the stay of the boat does not allow of a run into town by the inevitable tramway, and an inspection of the semi-oriental settlement. But of Broome and its pearls more anon. Suffice it that at this point we are within three or four days of Java, and that the intervening sea scarcely shuts out the atmosphere and colour of the purpling East.[36]
I like this coast very well, or rather the section that we saw. The scenery isn’t much to boast of principally sand hills and small scrub and the various towns we touch at are somewhat primitive nearly all the buildings are of corrugated iron. Broome is the best of the lot there are some trees there, it is the big centre for the pearling industry of the Nor-West and there is a big fleet of pearling luggers there inhabited by a most cosmopolitan crowd. The smell of the pearl oysters isn’t so bad there as they open them at sea coming into port for the weekends. It p45 is principally the shell they dive for. They don’t get so many pearls on the local banks but the shell is worth £150 to £200 a ton. A good deal of our cargo along the coast is shell, done up in cases and bags, for the home markets.[37]
On her second Nor’-West run Koombana carried Premier Newton Moore, who came to the Nor’-West to see the ports for himself and to receive the pleas and petitions of the residents. Moore’s presence delivered a practical benefit to the crew: the schedule was relaxed a little to give the premier time to complete business and to attend events organised in his honour. At Broome, Jim took some time off and caught the tram into town. He later told Peggy:
A couple of us went ashore for a quick look around there one Sunday and met the Mayor in his shirt sleeves, drunk as an owl, insisted on doing the honours and showing us all the sights. We had a tremendous job to shake him. In the end he had to see the Premier a couple of hours afterwards and make a speech. I would like to have heard that speech.[38]
In 1909 and 1910 Broome was at the peak of its prosperity. There was money to be made and every opportunity to spend it. Ships from north and south brought luxuries from afar: fine foods, whisky and champagne, p46 cigars, silk, porcelain, furniture. Tropical fruit from Singapore sat beside grapes and peaches from the vineyards and orchards of the South-West. Japanese merchants imported from Japan for Japanese customers. Travelling salesmen called regularly and all local businesses, including the gambling dens and brothels, seemed to be thriving. The condition of the town made a lasting impression on Jim Low. A young engineer, he thought, could do very nicely here. Harriet Lenihan was also impressed; indeed, she could find no fault.
Prosperity seemed to suffuse the very air, and everyone was in good spirits. Even the great gangs of chained natives who passed me on the road seemed to be in gleeful mood. It is true that these chains are very little of a burthen, a fact to which I can bear personal witness, as the superintendent of Carnarvon Gaol kindly let me try them on. I bade good-bye to Broome—lovely, prosperous Broome—with regret.[39]
From Cossack to Port Hedland to Broome, Koombana’s passengers had noted the ever-increasing rise and fall of the tide, but only those continuing north to Derby would witness its most spectacular manifestation. South-east of Cape Leveque, a chain of islands blocked the entrance to King Sound. Derby-bound steamers could detour around the islands and enter though the Sunday Strait, or negotiate one of the narrow channels separating the islands.
The Adelaide Steamship Company’s preference was for the narrow, fast-flowing Escape Pass.[40] This was not reckless cost-cutting; it was a balancing of risk. Although the pass required skilful navigation, the shorter travel time allowed the ship’s master some flexibility. He could choose his moment. The steamer would enter the Pass on the first of the incoming tide and clear to open water before the maelstrom of “full flood,” when the current might reach ten knots and the sea rise two inches in a minute. Vindex wrote:
The ship is entering on a flowing tide, which at “high springs” rises and falls a maximum of 40ft., and the sea is like a vast mountain torrent as it rushes and swirls through the islands and over the reefs. You may see it on the weather side of a rock 3ft. higher than on the lee side, and it is a giddy sight to watch the boiling of the waters on all directions, as the immense volume of the tide rushes over the submerged obstacles.[41]
Having gained the relative calm of the sound, a gentle four-hour run would bring the steamer to Point Torment, sixteen miles from the Derby pier. The ship would drop anchor here, to wait for the high tide needed to complete the journey. Derby boy Tom Ronan would later write:
There was no radio, of course, to inform of exact time of arrival, but the blacks up the Gulf at Point Torment would light fires when they p48 saw a ship in the offing, someone in town would notice the smoke and inform the necessary authorities. The doctor would be told, and the shipping agent; the wharfinger, and the police corporal, who was also customs officer.[42]
As Koombana slid through the last few miles and came alongside the pier at high tide, the scene failed to impress. There was no town to be seen, just a long jetty across what to Jim Low looked like “somebody’s orchard flooded.”[43] Within a few hours even this picturesque image would escape, as if down some unseen plughole. “When the steamer tied up,” Vindex wrote, “the jetty was almost awash, but now the eye rests upon as ugly a picture of mud and mangrove as the imagination ever conceived.”[44]
On Koombana’s first arrival Jim Low was struck by the keenness of the locals to come aboard. To Peggy he wrote:
At the various ports nearly everyone turns out to greet us. The droughts all line up for a cool drink while the ladies get shown round uttering incoherent ejaculations as each fresh marvel is displayed, potatoes peeled by electricity, dough mixing by electricity, knife cleaners, grub hoists, the automatic egg boilers where you set a little pointer to the number of minutes, and punctually to the second the egg is hoisted out of the water, till at the end they gasp like fish out of water.[45]
Was it the boiled eggs or the young ladies left gasping? No matter! Mood and moment are captured in a wonderful letter from the young adventurer to the girl he would marry.
For Harriet Lenihan it was not mud and mangrove that made her first visit to Derby memorable. The schooner Namban had brought the news that native patients coming home from the islands would arrive by Koombana. Word had spread quickly. The jetty “swarmed with blacks,” she wrote, “sons were there to meet mothers, lovers to meet their old sweethearts, and sisters to meet sisters or brothers.”[46]
Derby was always keen to present itself to visitors. Whenever the length of a ship’s stay permitted, passengers and crew were encouraged to travel into town. Vindex was pleasantly surprised by what he found at the end of this tramline.
The jetty and the marsh lead one to expect the worst, but instead here is a pretty little settlement whose one long street is filled with native trees. Trees and vegetation are on all sides, and in the private gardens one sees such exotics as cocoanut and date palms. But the most interesting of all vegetable adornments is the stately baobab tree, with its umbrageous branches, and butt of immense girth, tapering into a narrow neck until it bears resemblance to a giant ale bottle. The large nuts which the tree bears are fancifully carved by the natives, and sought after by curio-hunters. Truly there are worse places on the coast than Derby, the capital of West Kimberley.[47]
Once it was known that Vindex was recording his impressions of the Nor’-West, and that his impressions would find their way into the pages of The West Australian, the citizens of Derby made sure that this visitor was well looked after, and well briefed on the district and its fertility. A few weeks later, their targeted kindness was repaid.
The gold rush to the Kimberleys in the eighties gave Derby its first lift, but now its dependence is on grazing, solely. Magnificent cattle p50 stations are in the back country which the port serves, and thousands of head of stock are shipped here annually. The town has the best domestic water supply on the coast, and the soil, it is generally agreed, will grow anything with water and the approval of His Majesty The White Ant. The country at the back grows cattle faster than the consumer wants them, and the pastoralists are now considering a proposal to establish canning works at Derby to treat the surplus stock.[48]
Harder times lay ahead. The people of Derby had learned to live with heat, white ants and crocodiles but, like their counterparts in Wyndham, would soon recognise the mosquito as the single greatest threat to their health and happiness.
Koombana first called at Derby in April 1909 but the residents of Wyndham, 500 miles further north and east, would wait another six months for a glimpse of the new ship. The final outpost was in an unusual situation: being closer to Singapore than to Fremantle, it received most of what it needed from the north. But as summer approached and the demand for southward passage increased, Koombana came to town.
Time after time we passed through narrow straits into a splendid expanse of sea, which narrowed again to a channel hardly wide enough, it seemed, to permit of the vessel’s passage. After passing this labyrinth of islets and rocks, the lovely scenery continued, but with wider spaces of open sea, so beautifully clear and calm that it seemed as if one could walk over it to the rocks.[49]
The surroundings of this capital of the Furthest North looked very striking and picturesque, towering hills sheltering the little town, which nestles at the foot of one of these eminences. The township is only a small one—just a few houses, a store or two, an hotel, a post office, and a gaol—but like all the North-West, full, apparently, of an abounding prosperity. Doubtless, in the days to come this part of Western Australia will carry its teeming thousands, but to-day it is the great lone land, awaiting the touch of the enchanter’s wand to awaken it to its destiny.[50]
Wyndham owed its “abounding prosperity” to two products of a great savanna grassland: beef and wool. Sheep and cattle had come to the Kimberley in the ’eighties, but from opposite directions. The first sheep were landed at Derby; the first cattle were pushed overland across the top of Australia in a droving enterprise of singular resolve and audacity. p51 Thirty years on, the pioneering families still dominated the industry.[51] The Kimberley, said Doug Moore of Ord River Station, was all “Sacks, blacks and Duracks.”[52]
The pastoral leases were vast and unfenced. Noonkanbah and Liveringa each ran about 100,000 sheep on a million acres. There was no possibility of shearing such a flock using local labour, black or white, but the seasonal rhythm was fortuitous. Southerners could leave their properties at a quiet time, catch a steamer to Derby or Wyndham and support their own ventures by shearing for the magnates of the far north.
With its money-makers so widely scattered, the town of Wyndham would never match Broome for vibrancy, but its night air had a hum no less remarkable. To the light of every candle or lamp came a great jamboree of winged creatures; evening verandahs were shared with moths, resplendent beetles and even tiny bats. And after rain, flying ants in great swarms would alight upon anything and anyone, to crawl, skip and trip over one another, as if for the sole purpose of discarding their wings.
Balmy nights notwithstanding, station life in the remotest of locations was not for the faint-hearted. Doug Moore recalled:
The year 1911 was a very bad one for sickness. Malarial fever and Blackwater fever—the white men were all down to it and we lost 20 p52 natives. Quinine we had plenty of, McKenzie’s fever mixture and we would mix up Gulf mixture—a recipe given us by Mrs. McAuley of the Stud Station. My mother became very sick—hot and feverish—and it was a great shock to my sister and I to see her slowly failing. Both of the rivers were running, and we sent a boy who swam the river and walked 90 miles to the post office at Turkey Creek with wires to the Doctor asking for instructions and what to give her. By the time the boy returned it was too late; my mother had died.
Never in my life have I seen men more helpful and sympathetic. The blacksmith and carpenter made a wonderful coffin out of the side boards of a new wagon, lined it with pure calico and all these men showed out in their true colours and deserve far more credit and thanks for their kindness to people in trouble than I could give and to white women they could never do enough for. They will always have my thanks and both my sister and I will never be able to thank these stockmen enough.[53]
Of desire or necessity, the locals travelled south for relief from the fierce summer heat. Vindex wrote:
The squatter who deals in the golden fleece, migrates with the seasons as regularly as the swallow. In November and December, when the ardour of the sun begins to get oppressive he comes southward, and here he remains till the summer’s heat is past. Then, when Nature is throwing a mantle of green over the plains, when the flies have gone p53 into retirement and the mosquitoes are at rest, when the north is said by northerners to be the mildest and balmiest in the world, when the flocks are being mustered and the garnering of the wool commences, the wealthy squatter goes north again to the land that pays him well.[54]
As surely as life was tied to the seasons, it was shaped by the comings and goings of the steamers. In a late-summer letter to his mother, station manager Roy Phillips wrote:
Everything in the doldrums the last few weeks but people are all coming in for the Koombana now . . . Patsy Durack and his wife arrived last night and Lillas will leave for South on Saturday. She has the same affliction as assails most newlyweds and Patsy will be buying fizz to celebrate in a month or so. Her sister, Nellie, came in with them and is to marry Jack Martin, Manager of Ascot, on the day the boat sails.[55]
When Koombana cast off from Wyndham jetty on February 16th, 1910, “Missie” Lenihan’s work was done. She later wrote:
As the last of my dusky charges filed off at Wyndham, each one carrying his or her government blanket, the girls resplendent in new gowns and bright ribbons, I said good-bye for ever to those whom I had watched and cared for for two years. Though to anyone taking up such work, the daily round is a dangerous and disagreeable one, yet I found that there were many bright points in the life of a savage, many fine qualities in the character of the Western Australian aboriginal. And when at last the Koombana steamed out from Wyndham on her return voyage south, and the last little band of my black girls waved me a last good-bye, and danced me a farewell dance, I felt, appalling as had been the work and the life, that I was well repaid by the affection of my blackfellow exiles.[56]
After two eventful Nor’-West trips, Jim Low also travelled south in high spirits, confident that his work on this coast would be challenging and interesting. The settlements, it seemed, were as different each to the other as to the world from which they stood apart. Koombana’s arrivals would be keenly anticipated; he and his shipmates would be welcomed everywhere, as honoured guests or simply as friends. He had also found a town which appealed to him greatly, and in which he might one day settle.
For Vindex the southward journey was an opportunity to enjoy all that Koombana had to offer. His political reporting done, he could now write subjectively of all he had seen. He would gather his thoughts and confide to his readers that he too had been swayed by the rhythm of the north.

On Wednesday, November 15th, 1911, the simmering trouble at the Whim Well copper mine boiled over. About eighty men called a strike and downed tools, citing the company’s failure to pay a living wage, its poor record compared to other mines in the Nor’-West, and its new requirement that shovellers work ten-hour shifts underground.[1]
A thousand miles away in the capital, the company found new men and signed them up, but when it became known that it was neglecting to tell its new recruits that a dispute was already in progress, the trouble at the mine rapidly escalated. On arrival at Whim Creek the newcomers received a briefing from the union; most decided to join the strike. For that show of solidarity, the accidental activists were brought before the local magistrate and convicted of breach of contract. Each was ordered to repay the steamer fare of £5, or face a month’s imprisonment.[2]
The Whim Creek strike was never likely to be a simple two-cornered contest. The dispute divided the ragtag workforce along national and cultural lines. Almost to a man, the Britishers were staunch unionists; by contrast, many of the Europeans had no experience of collective bargaining, had experienced conditions far worse, and had lower expectations. Those who elected to keep working became targets of abuse and intimidation and the unsegregated miners’ camp quickly became unmanageable. To protect its few remaining workers, and to give the district’s only police officer some respite, the company created a new camp on the mining lease itself.[3] But rather than ease tensions, the new compound increased antipathy toward the strike-breakers, who were now seen as enjoying the protection and patronage of the bosses.
On December 7th, to the surprise of many, the dispute ended. After three weeks of lost production, the company capitulated. The union’s success was widely reported, and Adelaide newspaper The Advertiser included details of an interim agreement.
The labor trouble at the Whim Creek Copper Mine has been ended, the employers agreeing to concede the following rates for six months:—Miners in shafts, 15/–; winzes and rises, 14/2; elsewhere, 13/4; timbermen, 13/–; truckers, mullockers & shovellers, surface hands, 13/4, with extra 1/8 extra for wet ground; 47 hours a week, inclusive of crib time; rockbreakers, 10/–; orebreakers, 10/–; dressing plant 6/4; surface hands, 47 hours, exclusive of crib time.[4]
Constable Fred Growden welcomed the agreement, but if he thought that things would settle now that the men were back at work on better pay, he was quickly disabused. The resumption of work brought the antagonists together. As the union men saw it, the ‘scabs’ were now enjoying benefits they had been unwilling to fight for. The unionists warned the strike-breakers to keep to themselves and to avoid any encounter beyond the perimeter of the mine.
A week or so after the end of the strike, Italian mineworker Joseph Seleno came to see the constable. He said that he was thinking of returning to his old camp near the hall, but was worried that some of the men might “knock him about.” To Growden, Seleno seemed a decent chap; he told the Italian that if he called in again before making the move, he would ensure that he was not interfered with.[5]
p253 Perhaps Joseph Seleno had second thoughts about moving camp, or perhaps he decided to test the water in a different way. On the evening of Saturday, December 23rd, he and his compatriot Frank Cattellini went to the pub for the first time in three weeks. In the side bar of the Federal Hotel the barman greeted the men, served their drinks and, in a matter-of-fact way, advised them not to stay long. With a nod of thanks for the drinks, they ignored the advice.[6]
As the front bar steadily filled, the two Italians kept to themselves. It was a little before 10 p.m. when a yell of “Where are the scabs?” came from beyond the partition. The two Italians looked at each other, stood up, and went to investigate. In the front bar they met a group of six or seven men just arrived from the Whim Creek Hotel down the road. Among the new arrivals were mine labourers George Connelly, Jim Aylward and Tom Darlington; all had been drinking for hours.
Seleno and Cattellini were both sober but handled the situation very differently. Cattellini was agitated, jittery, pacing back and forth with one hand inside his coat; Seleno walked slowly, trying to appraise the situation. Realising that his assailants were working to some sort of plan, he took a couple of steps backward, rested his elbows on the bar and kept his hands close and high. With only the barman behind him, he watched and waited.
He did not wait long. Jim Aylward stepped up to Cattellini and demanded to know what he had under his coat. But almost before the p254 Italian could reply, Aylward landed two heavy punches to his head. Over Seleno’s shoulder, publican Tom Hill yelled at the two men to get out. To his surprise they complied, but as all eyes followed the fight out of the door, Seleno, on his blind side, took a punch to the side of the head. The blow knocked his hat off and left a cut over his left eye.
After replying to something that Cattellini yelled in Italian from the verandah, Seleno stooped down, picked up his hat and placed it on the bar. And then, as if wishing to wind back the clock by a few seconds, he picked up his hat and put it back on his head. Neither Seleno nor the publican had seen who threw the punch, but Seleno figured it was Aylward’s mate Thomas Darlington; he shaped up to Darlington and yelled to the room: “How many you want to fight me?”
Fearing a free-for-all, the publican vaulted the bar and shepherded the whole crowd out through the double doors. Apart from a single patch of light, the verandah was dark. It was impossible for anyone to make out precisely what was happening; indeed, it was too dark for Seleno and Darlington to land punches. A few feet from the door, the two men ended up in a clinch, wrestling on their feet.[7]
At the Federal Hotel, fistfights were a common occurrence. Tom Hill, pleased to have cleared the room and spared the furniture, only stood by the door for a minute or so, deciding whether this latest stoush could work itself out. There was no sign of Cattellini; he had run off, apparently. And since no one seemed inclined to interfere in the scuffle between Seleno and Darlington, he returned to the bar. After a couple of minutes he heard Jim Aylward yell “The bastard’s got a knife!” but before he could ascertain exactly who had a knife, the front doors burst open. Thomas Darlington, bleeding badly, staggered in, supported by George Connelly. At the bar Darlington said nothing; he simply leant forward and appeared to rest his head.[8]
Connelly asked Hill to keep an eye on the injured man while he fetched the doctor. He then rushed away, declaring, “Give me a gun and I’ll shoot the bastards!” A moment later, Darlington’s legs gave way. He slumped awkwardly but was caught by the nearest drinker and guided to the floor. His head now unsupported, a four-inch gash across the right side of his neck was plainly visible. The man who had broken his fall placed his hand over the wound in a vain effort to stop the flow of blood.[9]
Constable Growden had expected a busy night. It was Saturday and it was payday, the first on the new deal and the last before Christmas. A little before ten o’clock, on his round, he called at the Whim Creek Hotel, where many of the mineworkers were drinking. At the bar he learned that a bunch of union men, angry and well fuelled, had just left for the Federal Hotel where two ‘scabs’ were reported to be drinking.
As he approached the Federal Hotel, P.C. Growden heard agitated p255 voices and the sound of heavy feet on boards. As he picked up his pace, he met George Connelly running for the doctor. Told of the stabbing, the constable dashed the last hundred yards. On reaching the injured man, he was surprised to be pushed aside by mine labourer Herbert Hayman who declared, “I am a first-aid man.” To the experienced police officer it was painfully clear that Thomas Darlington was beyond any aid, save perhaps of a spiritual kind. He turned to Tom Hill behind the bar and asked for a cork. He then knelt down, gave the cork to the “first-aid man” and instructed him to push it down behind the collarbone against the jaggedly torn artery.[10]
When Joseph Shelmerdine arrived a few minutes later, there was nothing for the doctor to do but to pronounce life extinct.
Constable Growden did not know if the two Italians would return to their camps or ‘go bush.’ In the bar he asked young mine labourer Matthew Murphy to help him, and outside on the street he commandeered Harry Haile with horse and cart to drive them to the mining lease. As he approached Joseph Seleno’s camp, Growden saw a dim light burning. He called a halt. With his nervous citizen deputies hanging back, he walked the last hundred yards. The arrest of Joseph Seleno would turn out to be the simplest part of a long and difficult night. Twenty yards from the glowing tent, the constable called “Are you there, Seleno?”
It was almost as if Seleno’s mission was to put his visitors at ease. Emboldened by the very subject of their fears, Haile and Murphy now came alongside the constable; the three walked together into the camp. At a basin near his tent, Seleno stood stripped to the waist, washing his face and hands. Growden knew the rules of arrest and spoke clearly: “Is that you, Seleno?” But before the arresting officer could warn his prisoner or affirm any right to silence, Seleno turned, faced him and said: “Yes, I know you want me. I kill that man.”[11]
As he spoke, Seleno walked into the light. His face was clean, but partly congealed blood matted his hair and covered his chest and arms. When Constable Growden asked about the knife used in the attack, Seleno said nothing. He simply walked to a table by his bed, retrieved the weapon and handed it over.
When Growden asked Seleno where his mate was, Seleno replied “Out the back.” Cattellini had been hiding in darkness a little way off; he had apparently heard the conversation between Seleno and the constable. When Growden called “Are you there, Cattellini?” the Italian stepped from behind a hessian wall and allowed himself to be arrested. Once again, Cattellini’s response to adversity was very different to that of his p256 compatriot. In response to the constable’s questions he declared that he had no knife and had not left his camp all evening.
At the Whim Creek police station, Joseph Seleno wanted to explain the whole affair, but was advised to rest and gather his thoughts before saying much more. Growden had two good reasons for silencing his unusual prisoner. He was not sure that Seleno fully understood the gravity of his situation, or how his prospects might be harmed by what he said. He also knew that Seleno was the least of his worries, and that he was urgently needed elsewhere.[12]
Indeed, the benign composure of the accused was in sharp contrast to the wild mood that had developed outside the Federal Hotel. When Doctor Shelmerdine heard threats of lynching he addressed the men from the verandah but failed to pacify them. When Growden returned, the two men discussed the situation. They agreed that without support they could not guarantee the safety of the prisoners. A little before midnight, they woke the postmaster to telegraph for reinforcements from Roebourne, 25 miles away.[13]
The reinforcements were not needed. In the early hours of Christmas Eve, the lynch mob lost its cohesion as one by one its champions sobered up, and anger subsided into regret. After a few hours of sleep, aggrieved men prepared themselves as best they could for the funeral of a friend.
p257 Thomas Darlington was 33 years of age and married, but his wife would not witness his burial. Few women accompanied their husbands to this unshaven outpost. At the graveside, in place of family, fellow workers and drinking mates paid respect deep or shallow. Jim Aylward did not attend.[14]
As the funeral party dispersed, Dr Shelmerdine advised the witnesses among the mourners that his coronial inquest would begin immediately. Over two days, he and Constable Growden took enthusiastic but inconsistent testimony from men who had been in one or both hotels on the Saturday night. To his surprise, Growden learned that Seleno was a former soldier; among personal effects retrieved from his camp were discharge papers from Légion étrangère—the French Foreign Legion. He also learned that “Frank Cattellini” was an invention; Lawrence Cappelli had been working under an assumed name to conceal a prior conviction.[15]
When the inquest concluded, the two Italians were transferred to Roebourne Gaol to await trial: Seleno for wilful murder, and Cappelli for his supposed part in it. Growden and Shelmerdine took great care to ensure that the information they released to the press was measured and unprejudiced, but their diligence had little effect upon The Advertiser, which squeezed every drop of drama from the facts it had been given.
Thomas Darlington was killed during a quarrel with an Italian named Sileno, at Whim Creek on Saturday night. Sileno was getting the worse of a fight with Darlington, at the Federal Hotel, when, with a knife handed to him by Capelli, another Italian, Sileno stabbed Darlington first in the thigh and then in the neck. Darlington’s jugular vein was severed, and he died in a few minutes. Both Italians are under arrest, and extra constables have been sent from Roebourne to Whim Creek to prevent the miners from carrying out an alleged threat to lynch the prisoners.
On the afternoon of Monday, March 18th, 1912, Commissioner Norbert Keenan, K.C. arrived in Roebourne. He had come north by Koombana to hear the case of Rex v. Seleno & Cappelli.[17] A few hours after Koombana cast off and continued north, the first witnesses arrived from Whim Creek. The steamer Paroo, southbound from Singapore to Fremantle, had deviated from her usual track to call at Depuch Island and collect the men. Captain Richardson later told The West Australian:
When we were anchored in the passage there was a heavy swell coming in from the N.E., and I could tell there was some dirty weather about—in fact, it was apparently so near that I was seriously thinking p258 of clearing round the Monte Bello Islands and leaving Onslow out of the itinerary altogether. However, I called in during the following morning, and got through without mishap. I have been lucky with several of these blows, in being either a day or so ahead or astern of some of them.[18]
The steamer Bullarra, which had arrived in Port Hedland as Paroo left, was also southbound. She too was under instructions to call at Depuch, to collect the witnesses for the second day of the trial. The appointment was not kept. Four hours out of Hedland, Bullarra encountered horrendous sea conditions; her master discarded any thought of weaving among reefs and islands in fading light. Without hesitation, he chose the dark simplicity of the open sea.[19]
In sultry, unpredictable weather the trial began. The first day proceeded to plan but the second certainly did not. When the prosecution witnesses failed to appear, Commissioner Keenan fell back upon evidence gathered at the coronial inquest. In the statements handwritten by Fred Growden and Joseph Shelmerdine, the union men clearly emerged as the aggressors. Moreover, the statements of Aylward, Kay and Connelly were guarded and evasive, especially when seen beside the astonishing forthrightness of the accused murderer. With the witness stand empty and with time to spare, Keenan gave Joseph Seleno an unusual opportunity to speak in broken English on his own behalf.
The men who had come to the Federal Hotel with Thomas Darlington were united in their belief that Seleno had used Cappelli’s knife to stab their friend. They claimed that Cappelli had concealed a knife under his coat and had passed it to Seleno during the fight on the verandah. That summation was almost certainly correct,[20] but ultimately it was supposition regarding the knife that brought the prosecution case undone. In the gloom of the hotel verandah, none had seen any more than the glint of a blade, and none could say precisely how or when the knife had passed from one man to the other.
If the prosecution witnesses thought that any guilt lifted from Cappelli would naturally settle upon Seleno, they were to be disappointed. The odd mix of the known and the unknown worked to the advantage of both defendants. Cappelli could not be convicted upon the mere fact of his owning the knife, but that same fact remained powerful and influential in Seleno’s defence. The commissioner was inclined to accept that Seleno had come to the Federal Hotel without any weapon at all, and once there had remained sober, had not invited trouble, and had only taken and wielded a knife in a moment of fear or madness.
On the afternoon of Thursday, March 21st, 1912, as Roebourne residents barricaded windows and prepared for the arrival of the dread visitor, Commissioner Keenan delivered his verdict. Seleno was found p259 guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment with hard labour. Cappelli was acquitted.[21]
For Seleno, the verdict was a huge relief. At day end, he was back on the same straw mattress on the floor of the lock-up, but the cell to which he returned in the evening was not the cell he had left in the morning. It was as if the wind, in his absence, had swept away the fear of death and laced the air with salt and sweet salvation.
The prisoner, awaiting transfer to Fremantle, was told that he would not leave from Point Samson, as the jetty had been badly damaged by the storm. He would be taken to Cossack by tram and transferred to a steamer in the roads. Although there was no further official communication, news of life outside reached him in snippets both sympathetic and mischievous. Whim Creek, he learned, had been hit hard by the storm. The mine had all but ceased production. Two big ships, partly loaded, had been caught in the anchorage. The larger of the two had gone to pieces, and the dead had been buried on Depuch Island. The trial witnesses had been caught, too. Tom Hill had drowned, but the others had survived. After three days at sea, Bullarra had limped into Cossack without her funnel. No rest for her crew, though; they had built a funnel of corrugated iron and gone back to sea to search for Koombana.
In 1912, Fremantle Prison was changing. A new wing had opened, and a commission of inquiry had recommended that the cells of the old main block be doubled in size by knocking down every second internal wall. There were new workshops too, reflecting the prevailing view that prisoners—or at least a better class of prisoner—should be gainfully employed within the precinct. Whether Joseph Seleno was impressed or amused by the modern principles of incarceration is not known. What is clear is that, for delivery of hard labour, this government agency could not match either the French Foreign Legion or the Whim Well Copper Mining Company.
Seleno adjusted well to the rhythm of life in the temperate south. Like all inmates, he watched, listened and took a keen interest in the pattern of arrivals and departures. By the end of his first year, he had reason to think that freedom of a kind might soon be offered.
A Prohibited Immigrant.—The latest undesirable who is to be deported by order of the Minister for Customs is Joseph Seleno, of Italian birth, a native of Turin, Italy. In December, 1911, Seleno, figuring in an affray at a hotel at Whim Creek, stabbed another European named Darlington in the neck. Darlington succumbed, and p260 Seleno was sentenced to imprisonment for three years on a charge of manslaughter. He began to serve the sentence in March, 1912, and on June 23 last he was released from prison. The dictation test was applied to him, and he failed. The order authorising his deportation has been received by the Collector of Customs at Fremantle, and Seleno is being detained at the Fremantle Gaol until the departure of the Singapore boat which is to take him from the Commonwealth.[22]
Three days later, Joseph Seleno was escorted to his temporary accommodation: a demountable lock-up on the ’tween deck of the S.S. Minderoo. His future was entirely uncertain—but then, he had never railed against the past or the present. When Lady Luck smiled, he simply smiled back, accepting her wry munificence with characteristic candour.

To help ensure that there are enough homes for all pets, we play an active role in reducing the number of homeless animals born by offering low cost surgery to spay or neuter dogs and cats. As a service to our adopters, we provide a free spay/neuter surgery with every adoption. We operate a spay/neuter clinic for pet owners throughout our community. The clinic is staffed by licensed professional veterinarians, veterinary technicians and veterinary assistants.
All animals must be at least three (3) months of age and are required to be current on all vaccines.
Healthy pets only. Please let us know if your pet has ever been treated by a veterinarian for a health problem so we can evaluate risk adequately. The clinic opens at 8:30 a.m. Please plan to be there approximately 15 minutes to meet with a veterinary technician. If you are not at the clinic before 9:30 a.m., your appointment may be forfeited.
Dogs are required to have Kennel Cough, DA2PPV and rabies vaccines (Please bring proof of current vaccines from your veterinarian. If your pet is not up to date, our veterinarians will give the vaccines for $10.00 each on the day of surgery.)
Don’t feed your pet after 10:00 PM the night before. Always keep fresh water available for your pet. Kittens and puppies under 6 months old should have a small breakfast (1 or 2 spoonfuls) before they come to surgery to assure their blood sugar doesn’t get too low. We will monitor them after they are admitted.
EXERCISE: Restrict your pet’s activity for the next 7 days. No running, jumping, swimming or bathing for TWO WEEKS. Swimming or bathing will increase the risk of infection and cause the incision to open.
INCISION: You should check your pet’s incision every day until it is healed (7-10 days). DO NOT allow your pet to lick or chew at the incision. There will be a little tenderness and some nausea. An occasional vomit for a day or two is considered normal but should stop by 48 hours.
SUTURES: Absorbable sutures were used and do not need to be removed. The surgery site may show a little bruising. Several layers of sutures may feel like a lump under the skin to you. That is normal.
ANESTHESIA & PAIN MEDICATION: Your pet might still be groggy (especially pets that had surgery later in the afternoon). Anesthesia and injectable pain medications make them feel cool, so please keep them indoors in a warm, protected, quiet place.
FOOD: Wait until your pet is completely awake before offering food or water. Then offer only small portions of food the first day after surgery. Nausea and occasional vomiting is normal and should stop within a day.
AFTER CARE: If you have any concerns about your pet’s condition after surgery, please contact the Lewis Clark Animal Shelter at (208) 746-1623 during normal business hours 10-5.
PLEASE NOTE: As stated in your signed waiver – we are a part time spay/neuter service for pet owners who need assistance paying for this service. We can not provide 24 hour follow up care. In the rare occurrence that your pet has an adverse reaction or complication related to this surgery and must be examined immediately or after hours please call your local veterinarian. You are responsible for all costs incurred.

Believe it or not, I’ve totally kept up with the Gratitude Journal, and have been writing in it every day! It has challenged me to look at my inner and outer self and the people I’ve called into my experience and has allowed me to be grateful and thankful, even on the darker days.
However, when those days do pop up, and they do, I have come to see that my friendships are what keep me in the light.
There was this one day recently where I was feeling a bit edgy, and was a bit peeved at something someone said to me. So I decided to call Danielle and just vent! F-bombs dropped like snow on a mountain top as I spewed my tale of aggression to her. She listened, and then came back at me with her best Boston attitude and continued to drop F-bombs just as liberally as I did!
I laughed because usually she has some sort of calm yogic response to my heavy intensity, but not that day! No, she gave me exactly what I needed – an equally intense response, littered with Bostonian attitude, and proof that what I was feeling was barely justified with a whole lot of ridiculousness. And she met me exactly where I was that day just to prove the point.
Not only did I hear what she had to say, but I couldn’t stop laughing through the retort because all I could see in my head as she talked was her wagging her finger in the air, head bopping side to side with that East Coast mentality of “Who do you think you are?”
And with that, my F-bombs ceased fire, my eyes cried tears of laughter, and my soul was filled with joy. I was beside myself with pure gratitude that I had a friend who not only got me from the outside, but got me from the inside, and could make me laugh to the point where my original reason for calling no longer existed.
There are times when we know that the people around us have chosen their soul journeys with us for so many reasons, and with Danielle and I, we are truly partners in this lifetime. I don’t have too many people who can point out my ridiculousness and have me laugh instead of get defensive, and I don’t have many people who stand by my side and help me work through the darker times, and are just as supportive in the easy times. We continue to choose each other every day, and our lives are so much better because of it.

As a busy wife, small business owner, and mother of 4 small children, I develop weekly menus to help keep myself on track. I started this blog as a way to share these menus (and some of my favorite recipes) with other busy cooks. Since my first post it has evolved into a discussion of not only food but other aspects of life. Check out my tips, recipes, and, of course, my weekly menus. I hope they are a help as you manage your own home (and life).
Happy New Year to everyone! We are working to get everything back to normal after the holidays, which means doing a better job of planning out meals ahead of time and sticking to grocery lists. I find that I spend less on groceries when I have a set menu in place. Life also seems a little less chaotic when I know ahead of time what we're having for supper. I also shop better when I can easily see what groceries I need to pick up each week. With that in mind, I am making a 4 week menu plan.
Breakfast: blueberry coffee cake (my mom gave me a gallon of frozen blueberries at Christmas that she had done up this past summer)
Dessert: Orange Cheesecake (hoping to convince him to make them mini cheesecakes so that I don't have such a dangerous dessert hanging around my house)
Coming from two completely different backgrounds - the hubby from a family of only boys, me from a family of all girls - food became a middle ground for us as a couple. Cooking and creating together has really fostered a special bond between us.
I love to bake breads and muffins during the fall and winter months. Here are a few of my favorite recipes.
Often it can be hard to put into words the impact that N-Gage has on the local young people who attend our youth work services and the work N-Gage does in local communities.
This video shot by the BBC does a great job of capturing the views of young people in the Catalyst Youth Centre in Burnage and on our two youth vehicles that go out in South and North Manchester on weekday evenings.

Sarfarosh is ostensibly about the proxy war being conducted by the ISI (Pakistan's intelligence agency) in India. But that is just one of its selling points. As the film progresses you discover there are others.
Aamir Khan plays ACP Rathod, an IPS officer given the task of busting an ISI racket that involves smuggling arms to various extremist outfits in the country and which arms trickle down into the city. Sonali Bendre plays the romantic lead and Naseeruddin Shah, a ghazal singer Ghulfam Hassan, a mohajir (Muslim Indians who migrated to Pakistan after the Partition), who lives on both sides of the border.
Sarfarosh has a very broad canvas, with the film shifting focus from Bombay to Delhi to the ISI headquarters in Pakistan to Chandrapur (a village on the border of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh), to the Rajasthan border. But writer, director, producer John Mathew Mathan manages to avoid confusing the viewer. The action flows seamlessly across the various locations.
The film opens a Pandora's box about an issue that has been the focus of considerable debate: Why should India have cultural exchanges with a country that is also conducting a proxy war with it?
The script also shows how arms supplied by the ISI reach small terrorist groups and the Bombay underworld. So while the Bombay underworld isn't directly linked to the ISI, it makes use of the sophisticated AK-47s supplied by them.
The script has this no-nonsense look to it, clearly and succinctly establishing the protagonist's past in which his brother is killed and father left a paraplegic by terrorists. Thus defining why he could be a crusader. His romance with Sonali is dealt with credibly in a matter of a few minutes, thus keeping the story compact and not losing sight of the bigger picture.
Mukesh Rishi plays Inspector Salim, and for the first time, looks like he has a part that gives him the opportunity to act. He makes the most of it. Salim is used to show the factions within the police force itself.
For Salim is removed from a case because, in an encounter, he couldn't capture a criminal who just happened to be Muslim like him.
Aamir fits the bill as a police officer trying to keep together his team without letting them get complacent. He is especially good in a scene when he questions his department after one witness is killed while being brought in for questioning. A traffic cop on the scene says was "cutting a challan" and the constable on duty admits he'd gone to have a paan.
He usually plays it safe when it comes to action. After suffering some humiliation as an all-out action hero, he had discovered his niche as the underdog in Rangeela and Ghulam. His image is kept intact in the action sequences here -- he's never the aggressor, never shown at an advantage when battling three people.
Naseeruddin Shah has an unusual role of a ghazal singer and, consummate actor that he is, he does a very good job of it. Sonali has to look good and that she does what's expected of her. Her acting prowess, though, isn't called for.
The music by Jatin Lalit is a big plus, and is ably supported by some good choreography by Farah Khan, Ahmed Khan and Raju Khan. The camerawork by Vikas Sivaraman is good in parts but lacks technical finesse. Some shots make the sets look fake, and a few shots look staged. The editing could do with some spiffing up though the pace hasn't been affected.
John Mathew, who makes his debut as a director, producer and writer, deserves a pat on the back for tackling such a vast subject without letting it get out of control or lose focus.
Sarfarosh manages to marry serious cinema with the commercial variety. It may have some moments where you wish the approach would be different, but, all in all, it is an entertaining thriller.

A five-year-old girl who has been reported missing is believed to be with her father, who is wanted by police for failing to appear in court.
He had been due for sentencing at a court in Caernarfon on Friday but did not attend the hearing. Officers have not given details of his original offence but said a warrant had been issued for his arrest.
Molly is described as having collar-length blonde hair and blue eyes, while Owens is 5ft 9in and slim, with short brown hair and blue eyes.
Chief Inspector Sharon McCairn said police were "concerned for Molly's whereabouts" and appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
"Equally I am issuing a direct appeal for Brian Owens to make contact with us to let us know that both he and Molly are safe and well," she said.
Здравствуйте, уважаемые любители футбола! Sportbox.ru предлагает вашему вниманию матч 1/16 финала Кубка Англии "Ливерпуль" - "Вулверхэмптон"!Мерсисайдцы в последнее время попали в серьезную полосу кризиса. Подобное сложно представить, но факт остается фактом. С начала текущего года "Ливерпуль" одержал только одну победу в матчах всех турниров, где участвует, сумев с минимальным счетом 1-0 одолеть скромный "Плимут"! В Кубке Лиги подопечные Клоппа оказались слабее "Саутгемптона", уступив соперникам дорогу в финал, а в чемпионате "Ливерпуль" уже на десять очков отстает от лидирующего "Челси". "Вулверхэмптон" выступает в Чемпионшипе, где располагается в нижней части турнирной таблицы. Вроде бы соперник для мерсисайдцев не должен быть сложным, если бы не текущее состояние команды Клоппа. На предыдущей стадии "волки" выбили из Кубка "Сток Сити" и сегодня приехали на "Энфилд" в надежде на новую сенсацию. А произойдет она, или нет мы узнаем из текстовой трансляции, которая начнется в 15:30 по московскому времени.

The Pre academy development program (PADP) is structured towards players who want to work in an Academy environment, and constantly work towards bringing up their overall skills level of soccer. This program contains both full time athletes whose goal is to progress into one of our competitive academy program (CAP) and also athletes who want to work under Mapola FC & Academy development systems but is committed to other organizations. Players in this structure will train 2 times a week.
Any (PADP) player is eligible and encouraged to work their way up in to our full time competitive program, but first either must demonstrate the commitment, talent and capacity to handle the demands of the (CAP) The program will commence full time at the beginning of April and will be separate from the (CAP) training and game schedule. A more intimate ratio of training will be kept at 1 coach per 12 kids grouped in settings based on criteria set forth by the Academy Director. (PADP) athletes will play a minimum of one game every 15 - 20 days in competitive setups unless specifically declined upon registration of the Athlete by parent.
(PADP) athletes will be measured against (CAP) once per month with no regard to age or size All (PADP) athletes will be given clear feedback from Mapola FC regarding their progress within the (PADP). Reports will be sent in via online resources to both player and parent, with detailed information on the athlete and recommendations moving forward.

San Pedro, CA – Congresswoman Janice Hahn recognized the third anniversary of the Affordable Care Act that has already helped millions of Californians, citing a new report by the Department of Health and Human Service. President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010.
“Three years ago, Congress made history by passing a health care law that the American people have been demanding for decades. Now the Affordable Care Act is working for America by holding insurance companies accountable, bringing down health care costs, and helping more families get the peace of mind of affordable health insurance, including millions of Californians,” said Congresswoman Hahn.
The new report shows that the ACA has already ensured that millions of Californians are receiving the critical health care services they would not have otherwise had. In California alone: 12 million people, including 4.4 million women and 3.2 million children, are free from worrying about lifetime coverage limits; 15,000 previously uninsured people with pre-existing conditions are now covered; and those who use Medicare saved over $453.8 million on prescription drugs through closing the “donut hole.”
“Three years into the legislation’s implementation, there is much progress to celebrate and more victories to look forward to. The Affordable Care Act has already saved American consumers $2.1 billion. Millions of young people have been able to stay on their parent’s health care plans. Millions of seniors are able to afford the prescription drugs they need. And beginning in 2014 being a woman will no longer be considered a pre-existing condition. I will continue to advocate for a healthier America and fight any effort to repeal this critical law,” Hahn added.
I'm not a programmer for android, I just opened an apk, edited 3 small PNG files, placed them back in the original apk and now it won't load, or reinstall, any ideas? What's the best program, winrar, or winzip? I'm using winrar. I have opened the apk directly, and tried renaming it .apk.zip and doing it that way, neither worked.
this prevents any issues with compression and such, since the files when dragged and dropped onto the zip are added in automatically with the same settings already in the .zip file.

Everyone loves Missy Elliott’s “Sock It To Me!” We also loved it when Lauryn Hill was singing “Walk right out to the sun hand in hand” on Nas’ If I Ruled The World! What if I told you that I spoke with the man who was a member of Legendary Classical R&B groups The Moments, The Manhattans, The Delfonics and currently The Stylistics? These groups are sampled by our favorite artist’s.
Harold Eban Brown is Decorated with awards from 98.7 Kiss FM Hall of Fame, and NAACP Award for his accomplishments as lead vocalist of The Delfonics. This accomplished multi-talented artist, is a world-renowned guitarist, composer and singer who has a huge celebrity fan base. During this Interview Eban was on vacation in Florida relaxing in between tours.
Natalie: Hi Eban, it is so good to speak with you again! Thank you for taking the time out of you vacation to conduct a Q and A with me. When did The Moments realize that their new guitarist was a singer?
Eban: Well, a drummer named Bubbles Jerry Kinchen Jr’., introduced me to Billy Brown, my father and Bubble’s father sang together in the 1960s. Billy Brown was from Ray Goodman and Brown (The Moments) and when Billy Brown heard me sing, “All I Have” he was floored! I was 18 yrs old, “All I Have” was one of my favorite songs! That’s how I became a singer.
Eban: My family had a quartet so I easily picked it up. I never wanted to sing! I concentrated on my craft and then I looked at George Benson as an example, George Benson sings and plays the guitar.
Eban: First tenor, I sing all of the notes in a harmonious structure. I hear those notes and I stack my vocals one by one Sam Cooke started it then Marvin Gaye revolutionized it!
Natalie: Sexy Mama by The Moments is on heavy rotation on my iTunes! Music Mogul Sylvia Robinson was a genius.
Eban: It’s a blessing, I do this everyday we don’t take into stock how we help people in their own lives, we think about the gig and getting to our next stop! Thank you for telling me this you are keeping me encouraged and I honor you for that!
Eban: I was in school idolizing the Moments when the teacher asked everyone what career path they wanted to take. Some students wanted to be Fireman, Dr’s. etc, I said that I wanted to be the lead singer of The Moments. I dressed like The Moments, and I lived in that mode! You have to believe what you pray for!
Natalie: I don’t share most of my work because people don’t appreciate it, they have stolen ideas and don’t support it! I share my work with a select group!
Evan: I am doing this to leave something behind and build my legacy! In order to do that you, need top media attention! Be unique as possible and humbly claim it! You should watch the movie The Founders where they talk about McDonalds.
Eban: It’s messed up, but it’s business the brothers did not take it to the next level. You need to stop hiding your work!
Natalie: When you were with The Moments did you ever sing the “Girls” or “Look at Me” song in French?
Eban: No, I never had to sing it in French! We performed the songs in English when I re recorded it, they were supposed to bring in a French translator so I hope to do it one day for the best of The Moments with Billy Brown and myself. Billy is singing the first five songs and I sing on the last five songs!
Eban: Nas is one of my all time favorites, the way that we met was when Kelis flew us in for his surprise Birthday Party at the Venetian in Vegas I had to restrict myself so no one could see me. Chris Webber and I were there and Nas said that he was working on a new album and that he wanted me to record a song with him. The party was on Saturday and I was in the studio on Tuesday in NYC recording “You Can’t Stop Us Now.
Eban: Yes, I would like to work with him again for my own project. I am hoping to get a hold of him.
Natalie: When I post this Q and A I will to tag him to everything! I will also make an Instagram post that says Nas contact Eban we need another collaboration! By the way my husband and I are going to Nas’ concert here in Boston on 9.12.2017!
Natalie: Let’s talk about your debut album Master Suite and your current album Summer Time In Tokyo!
Eban: Master Suite was my very first solo album when I built my own record label Stardom Records. It is an acoustic album and I was getting my feet wet as a solo artist. My current album Summer Time In Tokyo has original songs as well as remade classics by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney.
Eban: Once I have songs on the radio, I should be up and running late September, early October. Then I have to get charted (Have songs on the charts) You get charted by getting spins and competing with other artist’s! Once that’s complete then my media tour will kick in!
Eban: Everywhere! To the ends of the earth! Several great records are not getting played because it was not publicized! “You cannot sell a secret” Eban Brown’s Grandfather’s quote.
Eban: That’s an unfair question! We have great music but if I had to pick it would be “ People Make The World Go Round.” It was recorded in 1971 but the same social issues are still prevalent today! Everyone is trying to make a dollar, Spike Lee even used it in one of his movies that’s how young folks caught onto it.
Eban: I am hoping to make the connection with Scullards. I am self managed and once you get a record you don’t have to call anyone anymore! You need good people in your corner. I thank God for that!
Eban: Your welcome I fly back to New Jersey in the morning and then I am off to Chicago and the United Kingdom.
Rob Base, on the Album “Break of Dawn”, which featured the Delfonics, the two songs were “Are You With Me”, and “Chillin”
Natalie’s favorite songs by various by The Manhattans, The Delfonics, The Moments and Stylistics are:
Please visit The Stylistics http://www.thestylistics.org/tour-schedule for a complete list of their tour date!
Today I was writing my Q and A for a music icon and I had writers block! I quickly put on my super hero music to get me going! Listed below in no particular order is my writers block playlist.
Maybach Music III (featuring T.I, Jadakiss & Erykah Badu) “I came alive like a month in the summer time” This quote re energizes me each and every time!
“He said travel anywhere your life takes you, he said chase your visions over the rainbow, your free to go.” This quote explains itself.
Lonnie Liston Smith & The Cosmic Echoes said it best! “Expand your mind, to understand we all must live in peace…” this song has an upbeat jazz rhythm that reminds me to relax! Not to mention that it is timeless!
“I don’t hate players, I’m from the crown rhyme sayers.. I play my cards shark style kings and aces. Welcome to New York the illest of all places.” This line gives me a boost of energy reminding me of who I am and to snap out of my writers block!
Danny Woods music career spans over 50 years he is one of the founding members of the legendary music group Chairmen of the Board. Chairmen of the Board has sold over a million of copies with their chart topping hits “Give me just a little more time” the song was sampled by Kylie Minogue. Chairmen of the Boards song “Patches” was later re-made by Clarence Carter and it received a Grammy Award. The group shared the stage with many music legends and was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 1999.
*Questions for this Q and A was written by Natalie the interview was conducted by Natalie and her husband one of Danny Woods son’s.
Natalie: Your fans do an amazing job of posting your music dating all the way back from the 1960’s! How many records did you release and how many music groups were you in?
Danny Woods: They asked me to be in the Spinners, but I turned it down because I was making money on my own. I would say that I am on about 50 records.
Natalie: Maintaining a healthy voice is a full time job. What’s your best practice to exercising and keeping your 6 octave vocal range healthy?
Natalie: What was the feeling that you pulled to hit that high register during the song “Danny Boy?”
Danny Woods: I was singing that song for my son Danny that’s why I sing it so good I was singing to my son.
Original Chairmen of the Board members General Johnson, Danny Woods, Hendricks Kennedy and Eddie Custis
Natalie: How did you celebrate being number 3 on the Billboard Charts and selling over 1 Million copies for “Give me just a little more time?”
Danny Woods: I did not celebrate because I did not have any money. I was on the Johnny Carson show and Soul Train several times.
Natalie: What emotion did you experience when the R.I.A.A presented Chairmen of The Board with a certified gold record?
Danny Woods: Well, London was an exciting time for me at ABC’s 50th anniversary everyone in the industry was on that show, Rock N Roll Super stars!
A special thank you to Mr. Danny Woods for affording us the opportunity to interview him for this Q and A.

These rules are described in detail in Mahjong Competition Rules (The World Mahjong Organization, 2006), also known as 'The Green Book'. They were first used in an official tournament at the World Championship 2002 in Japan. The first major European tournament played by these rules was the 1st OEMC in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, during wich event EMA was founded.
Besides the MCR-Rulebook the 'Tournament Regulations' and the 'Referee Manual' are the official guidelines for MERS tournaments as from January 1st, 2009.
The first edition of the EMA riichi rules was established in preparation of the First European Riichi
Championship in 2008 in Hannover, Germany. The rules were based on the way riichi had been played by
pretty much the same rules independently in Netherlands and Denmark for years. The rules were revised in
In preparation of the event of the first World Riichi Championship in Paris, France, in 2014, the World Riichi
Championship rules were compiled by Sylvain Malbec in collaboration with partners worldwide, notably
the Japan Mahjong Professional League. After the event the WRC rules were slightly revised in 2015, and it
was obvious to revise the EMA riichi rules in light of the WRC rules. The latest revision came into effect April 1, 2016.
- In the longer term to create a common European standard for refereeing at official EMA certified competitions
Jo VandeWeghe (Belgium) collected a series of games for these various devices. The various rules (HK, Riichi, MCR, Taiwan) are available according to the downloaded games. (Interview of MahjongNews)
Most of these games are available directly on the dedicated platforms such as iTunes (for the devices of iPhone, iPad, iPod)
But to spare time, Mr VandeWeghe put all the links on the same site : http://www.dipching.com/iOSmj.html
Some games also listed for the devices of type "Palm", "PSION" or the others else.http://www.dipching.com/palmjongg.html
Motivation for the rule changes is to be in line with modern style riichi as it played in competion riichi in Japan and the World Riichi Championship 2015 rules have been the main inspiration.
The rules are available in a preliminary document while further layout and graphics is made in collaboration with Sheila Hansen who also designed the front page.

Email Autoresponder – Your lead capture page webform should feed an email autoresponder. When a prospect completes and submits the webform, they should be subscribed to your email autoresponder. The email autoresponder should then send out personalized email messages to the prospect on your behalf. At the same time, the email autoresponder should send you an email notification of the new lead that was just generated.
Before you can talk to a prospect and start generating interest, you need to know and understand your company, product line and compensation plan. Being educated will give you more confidence when you are talking to your leads because you will be able to answer questions, overcome objections and determine the potential fit with your prospect. Now, this does NOT mean you have to explain everything about your business. you simply need to know where to point them. Having a link to a video about your compensation plan will save you time and frustration of trying to explain it over the phone. You also want to use whatever resources and tools your company has to lessen the amount of talking you have to do on the phone.

In the middle of World War II, in turbulent 1942, a plane flies over Morocco and drops a Royal Canadian Air Force paratrooper who comes in to land on a drop zone, somewhere in the desert dunes outside Casablanca. Just in time before anyone notices him, the fearless Wing Commander Max Vatan gets in a car and heads to the town with orders to meet Parisian Marianne Beauséjour, a skillful member of the French Resistance. On a mission to assassinate the German Ambassador in Casablanca, the two operatives must convince every one of their true feelings as a married couple, while in the background, they need to make the necessary preparations for the critical soirée. Without delay, after the success of this suicide mission, Max and Marianne flee together to England with plans on marrying and making a family, regardless of the war. Instead, heavy clouds of distrust and suspicion threaten their relationship, when Max receives a call from the Secret Service Division to inform him that his ...

This is how I look still as "a boy". I'm really looking forward to how feminine the hormones could make me! As much as I'd like to, I shouldn't rejoice before I get to know if I'm ever even allowed to start hormones - the examination process hasn't even started yet. Even if I sounded pretty confident in my earlier posts, I still have to consider if I'm really ready for this great change in life. I really hope I was. At the moment it feels like me thoughts are like a rollercoaster, as different fears concerning post-transition life come to my mind. I'm planning on writing a more deep analysis on this again after my thoughs clear up a bit.
The TIO has introduced an initiative for more efficient handling of complaints relating to credit reporting. Under the new initiative, TIO staff dealing with unresolved referrals will ask for some important information from consumers and members prior to any conciliation.
The TIO anticipates that this approach will bring about improved efficiency and quicker closure times for these complaints. The Deputy Ombudsman Diane Carmody and Principal Investigator, Jill Brewer have substantial experience investigating complaints about credit reporting, from their time in the financial services sector. They have analysed a number of TIO complaints about credit reporting and have identified that outcomes usually turn on the analysis of technical and procedural requirements set out in the Privacy Act and related regulations and codes. In such a prescriptive regulatory setting, asking consumers and providers to supply information so that it is available at the time conciliation commences, will assist the parties to reach agreement more quickly.
A Credit Reporting Group made up of experienced TIO Officers has been formed. The Group will deal with all credit reporting complaints.
If possible, a copy of the actual letter. If not, screen shots to show that it was sent and the template letter
Details of any contact from and/or payments made by the customer between the notice and the listing.
If the customer claims that the account in question was not theirs, identity documents shown at the time the service was taken out.
If they say the amount in question was paid prior to the listing, evidence of payment such as bank or credit card statements
Any other information available to show why a listing should not have been made, such as emails or other correspondence with the provider
The TIO is confident that this initiative will contribute to more efficient and timely resolution of credit reporting complaints.
If you receive an information request relating to a credit reporting matter and would like additional assistance, please contact the Investigation Officer who has sent the request, or alternatively contact the TIO’s Industry Engagement department at members@tio.com.au.

We've found that it's difficult to put the bare facts and statistics of a family history in a website that is geared to articles and stories. So, after testing many different genealogical software packages, we've selected TNG Software. It runs on our server, and will allow visitors to search our database (including documents and photographs) and even download a GEDCOM. To access the simple to use database, just click here.

Pain in the area between the arch and toes, or ball of the foot, is generally called metatarsalgia. The pain usually centers on one or more of the five bones (metatarsals) in this mid-portion of the foot. Also known as dropped metatarsal heads, metatarsalgia can cause abnormal weight distribution due to overpronation.
Metatarsalgia occurs when one of the metatarsal joints becomes painful or inflamed. People often develop a callus under the affected joint. Metatarsalgia also can be caused by arthritis, foot injury (from sports, a car accident, or repeated stress), hard surfaces (cement or tile floors), and specific footwear (rigid-soled work boots).
A simple change of shoes may solve the problem. In more severe cases, custom orthotics may be prescribed to alleviate the pain and prevent overpronation.

001) Following up from my Kelly Brook inspired celebrity style post. I thought I would show you guys how you can revamp the all black look , which women traditionally wear for work , as the chic style of black garments can make a woman look smart and sexy.
002) This spring and summer season is all about reworking tailored pieces into a more sophisticated but yet glamorous look. For this look , I was inspired by the 80's jumpsuit as this stuctured piece is a key piece to wear this season. This fashionable onesie looks great on a range of body shapes , as it creates and compliments curves. Jumpsuits are normally tailored for taller women , which is unfortunate for petite frames. However I created an outfit that gives the illusion that you're wearing a jumpsuit, which is perfect for you ladies if you're wanting to change up your work wardrobe.
003) For this look quirky all black look , I wore my peplum top over my chinos , as it turned the separate garments into a jumpsuit. And I liked how the feminine style of the peplum complimented the embellished textures in my chinos.
004) Accessory wise I picked edgy accessories for this look such as my Alexander McQueen inspired skull waist belt and studded rose gold necklace , as it gave my faux jumpsuit some attitude. On the other hand if you're wanting to try out this look for a work occasion. I would stick within neutral accessories , as it work less fierce and more appropriate for formal wear. Shoes wise I wore my tan cut out loafers as this summery flat shoe gave a subtle hint of colour to my look and complimented my ombré hair.

In light of the increasingly controversial public debate about marriage between same-sex partners, and considering legislation pending before the Maine State Legislature this session, the board of directors of the League of Women Voters of Maine undertook a concurrence project to assess whether there is member agreement that the League should support or oppose same-sex marriage in Maine. The concurrence project began in January, 2009 and concluded in April 2009.
Presently, LWVUS does not have a clear position on equality in marriage. The LWVUS position on Equality of Opportunity stipulates that
The League of Women Voters of the United States believes that the federal government shares with other levels of government the responsiblity to provide equality of opportunity for education, employment and housing for all persons in the United State regardless of their race, color, gender, religion, national origin, age, sexual orientation or disability.
It is not clear that this position covers equality in marriage or that our members understand it to do so.
However, the League of Women Voters of Maryland has conducted a study and adopted a position on equality in marriage. In order for LWVME to participate and advocate on this issue, in January 2009, LWVME's State Board initiated the process of determining whether it could come to concurrence with the position of its sister League in Maryland.
The Board assembled and distributed materials to the local Leagues to facilitate a discussion among members on the local level to determine whether there is a consensus in agreement with or opposition to Maryland's position. The League commissioned a memo on Maine marriage law authored by Michael J. Levey, Esq., Levey and Wagley, PA, Attorneys at Law; and Jennifer B. Wriggins, Esq., Professor, University of Maine School of Law.
Local Leagues met in Portland, Brunswick and Ellsworth in March and April to discuss the position previously adopted by the League of Women Voters of Maryland. Based on the recommendations of the three local Leagues, the state League issued the final position.
Here is the full text of the position on Equality of Opportunity (Civil Marriage) adopted by the League of Women Voters of Maine, April 27, 2009.
The League of Women Voters of Maine supports equal rights for all under Maine law. LWVME supports legislation to equalize the legal rights and benefits available to same-sex couples with those available to heterosexual couples. LWVME supports legislation to permit same-sex couples to marry. The League believes that the civil status of marriage should be clearly distinguished from the religious institution of marriage and that religious rights should be preserved. LWVME believes that Maine should recognize the civil unions and same-sex marriages of other states."
