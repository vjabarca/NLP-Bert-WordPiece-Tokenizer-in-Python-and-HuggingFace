Now we have the house to ourselves. Margot agreed to move into my apartment, we talked about it earlier today.
Soleil Whitaker 06/15/17 Yes, you can. You know my body better than anyone, of course you can help it.
You may be right about the whole 'transcends time' thing, but me saying that I love you most and forever isn't stupid.
I know it's your job to protect me, but I'm not entirely defenseless. You, of all people, should know that because you know who I am, what I am.
I'm sorry I angered you last night, Rhiannon. I hope you know I was joking about therapy. It was callous, and I wasn't thinking. But, I meant it when I said that you're all I want and need. You're absolutely everything to me.
Rhiannon. You know I love when you're assertive in bed, but I'm sensing something else is going on now.
Soleil Whitaker 06/12/17 I just, sometimes I try to have a tender moment with you, and it always backfires.
Soleil Whitaker 06/12/17 I own that apartment. I worked like a dog, played a couple shows to afford it.
It's no bigger than a shoebox. Total strangers have been renting it out for months now, it doesn't feel like home anymore.
If I were so fortunate to come back to this world after I die, I'd find you. In whatever vessel you've taken. I'd know you in any form.
I'm not so sure about that, but I'm certainly going to try. I already love Wilson, and we're still in the beginning stages of the adoption.
I just didn't have time. You know my past. It wasn't particularly conducive to time spent thinking about things like this.
I'm better about that, now. I just... I never thought I'd be here. I didn't have the time to think about getting married, about starting a family.
You're the best for me. You're everything I could ever ask for, and more. The love you show me day in and day out baffles me because never in my life did I think I'd find something so pure.
I'd rather sin within the confines of our own home, I suppose. Especially if it's that kind of outfit.
You have all of my attention, all the time. You're the only one I want to pay attention to, anyways.
My parents were Catholic. I've only ever known the Catholic church, although I'm sure it's changed some since I left.
I fell away from religion after the accident and sh*t, but meeting you, loving you? It's made me think that maybe there is a God.
The phrase is definitely not a thing. But, I would absolutely not oppose if you wanted to prove the act is a thing.
Soleil Whitaker 06/03/17 Soleil almost rolls her eyes at the sappiness of Rhiannon's words, but struck by their sincerity, she can only smile. She sits silently for a moment, allowing for Rhiannon's affirmations of love to settle in her heart. Finally, she replies, arms slipping around her wife's slim frame to pull her closer, "I don't know how I deserve you."
Truth be told, Soleil knows she’s not worthy of the angel. Rhiannon is too pure, too good for the mortal realm, and so her choice to remain present continually baffles the young Whitaker. Nevertheless, she is beyond grateful, and she recognizes that her own purpose on this Earth is not simply to be a part of The Order, but rather, to be a constant in Rhiannon’s life. To love, support, cherish her in all the ways she knows how. Perhaps it’s a trivial existence, but for Soleil, it is more than enough to get her up each morning.
Soleil was teetering on the edge of intoxication, and Rhiannon was using the night's high to her advantage. Not that the younger woman cared at all. She was too busy being mesmerized by the way her wife moved, and by revealing red dress she had on. It made saying 'no' admittedly very difficult.
"Let's sign before we return to Moscow." Although her mind and judgement might've been impaired by the booze and feverish dance music, Soleil meant it. She was ready to start a life anew with the woman she loved - she'd always been ready, afterall.
"Yeah, maybe. But, you --" was all she could manage before she was pulled into a fervid kiss. She blinked as Rhiannon pulled away, slightly discombobulated from being embraced so abruptly. Goddamn, this woman was hot.
She could only smile at what Rhiannon said next. Although she was getting better about her insecurities, Soleil still sometimes worried that her bride was unhappy in their marriage. Hearing Rhiannon vocalize her feelings, in that moment, in that particular setting, made Soleil beam with pride. "I'm really glad we're doing this," she responded, leaning in close to Rhiannon's ear, "It's about time we had a night out together."
She smirked as she stepped away, giving Rhiannon some space to breathe and to dance. She apologized half-heartedly - sorry for smothering and for being perhaps a tad too possessive, but not at all sorry for turning their dancing into a spectacle for all to see. Rhiannon was a very, very attractive woman, that was plain to see. So, Soleil was determined to make it clear to the world that Rhiannon was a married woman.
For the first time in days, Soleil felt comfortable. And happy. And at ease. Maybe it was the booze, maybe it was the heat of the club that left her feeling loose and relaxed. Either way, New York was finally starting to feel like a vacation.
Soleil sauntered over to her wife, the heavy bass of the music pounding in her ears. She'd had a few drinks, and now she was ready to dance. It'd been a while since she'd indulged in the nightclub scene but, she was in New York City with her gorgeous wife. How could she resist going out to show off?
She took Rhiannon by the waist and pulled her close, their bodies pressed flush against eachother. It didn't take much to let the music dictate her movements, and soon, the couple was turning heads. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught two men staring. "Looks liks we've got some admirers," she teased before pressing a long, searing kiss to Rhiannon's neck.

In the western Peloponnese, in an idyllic and peaceful valley, between the hill of Kronio and the confluence of the rivers Alpheus and Kladeos, exists, in antiquity, one of the most important Greek cities: the city of Ancient Olympia. Over the years, in addition to sacred religious ceremonies, the established races also attracted the interest and participation of all Greeks. The Olympic Games were held every four years in honor of Zeus and only those who were Greeks were allowed to participate. The ancient Greeks identified the Olympics with the ideals of sportsmanship and peace. Using these exact ideals; the region of Olympia in Elis was declared a sacred and inviolable space. The army was banned from entering the territory and this was introduced to stop wars and hostilities during the games. Ancient Olympia today remains a place of paramount importance and a center of global concern as the birthplace of the Olympic Games and the Olympic Ideal.
Tourists can enjoy many activities and visit lots of attractions in the mythical valley of gods. Also on the main street of Olympia visitors can have a great shopping experience. In the market of Olympia, Visitors can find: Greek handmade souvenirs, gold and silver jewellery, leather, clothes, coffee shops, pharmacies, super markets, restaurants and banks.
Visit Ancient Olympia and allow your senses to explore, feel the awe of the Olympic spirit. Be profoundly affected by mythology and enjoy a unique and unparalleled experience. Become an Olympian.

Nan has been playing piano for more than 50 years, and teaching for more than 40 of those years. Among other things, she studied piano at the University of Texas and also at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. She has taught all over the country and describes her teaching style as participative, involving the student in every aspect of the process to make a more engaging lesson.

Bobby has been playing drums for 45 years, and teaching drummers for more than 30. Bobby comes to us from New Jersey where he studied under teachers including Charles Marseca who taught Danny Seraphine of Chicago, and Joe Morello. He taught privately and as faculty at several music schools while living in New Jersey. Bobby tailors his lesson plan around each student’s needs. He plays rock, jazz, Latin, funk, fusion, and R&B drums, but he has been known to fill in on other genres as well.
Michele got her first guitar in 1991. It was a 12 string given to her by a friend as repayment for a loan. In 1993 she moved to Mississippi to attend Mississippi University for Women. While there, she met and began taking lessons from Dana Clark. Soon after, she got a job and began working in Dana’s store giving lessons. Michele graduated from MUW with a degree in Psychology and a love of singing and teaching music. She’s been working in a music store and teaching music for more than 20 years, and wouldn’t have it any other way.
Fun Fact: Michele is one half of the duo Sweet Music. She and her spouse, Dana sing some of the most beautiful harmony in Pensacola.
Jimmy is quite a versatile musician. He has been playing guitar for 33 years, bass for 20 years, lap steel and mandolin for 8 years, and banjo for 6 years. In addition to his on-the-job training while touring with several professional bands, Jimmy studied with jazz guitarist Ari Lehtela and also completed online courses with the Berklee College of Music. “To listen to what the students’ needs are and to help them achieve their goals” is Jimmy’s teaching motto. Jimmy plays in the popular band Cadillac Attack. He likes to play rockabilly, rock, honky tonk, and country music, but his experience includes all genres of music.
Fun Fact: Jimmy does freelance work both in the studio and live with other bands in the area. He is also active as a musician with the Pensacola Little Theatre.
Daniel started playing piano 16 years ago, and has been teaching others to play piano for the last 4 years. Before joining the staff at the Blues Angel School of Music, Daniel could be found teaching at the Time to Shine Center for Performing Arts. He earned an associate’s degree in Piano Performance from Chiopla College and a Bachelor of Arts in Piano Performance from the University of West Florida, where he studied under Dr. Hedi Salanki-Rubardt. Daniel uses method books in his teaching up through the intermediate level, and then gradually introduces repertoire to expand his students’ horizons. He enjoys playing classical music.
Fun Fact: Daniel’s playing ability comes from his long, flowing hair. Like Samson, if you cut Daniel’s hair, he will lose his powers.
Jahleel knows his way around orchestral strings. He has been playing violin for 11 years, viola for 9 years, and he’s been playing cello and double bass for 8 years. He has been teaching all of them for the past 4 years. Jahleel caters his teaching style to the needs of each student. He enjoys playing fiddle music, rock, worship, and alternative. Before teaching here, Jahleel taught with the Emerald Coast Honors Orchestra, where he still plays.

Al has been playing piano since 1963 and he’s been playing the organ since 1965. He began teaching both in 1967. During his career, Mr. Martin has taught at other music stores, churches, as part of after-school programs, and privately in homes. Though he is versed in traditional teaching methods, he tends to veer from this in favor of doing what is in the best interest of the student. “I find that this style [traditional teaching] is not always in the best interest of the student.” says Al. He wants to be sure the students are engaged and have the confidence to go anywhere with and through music. He studied music at both Pensacola Junior College and the Berklee College of Music. Mr. Martin has played in a variety of bands from Big Band to ensemble to solo. He is comfortable playing a wide variety of styles from classical to pop.
Fun Fact: Mr. Martin has been featured in several publications including the Pensacola News Journal and the Theatre Organ Society Magazine, among other.
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can.
In a situation of an interview or dealing with an ADA situation, I tell clients and students alike that one of the things they need to have memorized is the question “Can you perform the essential functions of this job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.” It is truly essential.
If an employee cannot perform the essential functions of the job they are not eligible for protection under the ADA. This was reaffirmed by a decision of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. In this case, according to Jonathan Crotty, of Parker Poe, a hospital was able to deny a position to an employee, even though he was disabled. To be a doctor at this hospital the employee needed to have passed licensing tests. The employee was unable to pass the third test. Passing this third test is a requirement to practice medicine in the United States. This individual was unable to pass, even though given three times to pass the test. He then resigned, but then sued for discrimination. The courts recognized that, even though accommodated with a third attempt, the employee was just not able to perform the essential function of the job, aka, passing the test, and they dismissed his case.
The ADA does not require that employers eliminate essential functions when considering initial employment or continued employment situations. The individual needs to be able to demonstrate that they can perform the essential function. If they cannot demonstrate that ability they can be denied the position. Of course, that opportunity to demonstrate needs to include a reasonable accommodation opportunity. What is reasonable is a whole nother conversation.
Don’t forget the documentation of the “interactive” discussion you are having with the employee about their situation. You will need to be able to defend your actions if need be. This case, however, shows that you don’t need to automatically cede to every request for an accommodation.
Can you perform the essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation? Will a reserved parking spot help?

COLLABORATE to raise funds to fight human trafficking and rehabilitate those rescued from sex trafficking, working with other non-profit organization so that together we can end sex trafficking.

The purpose of One Bread Foundation, Inc. is to give awareness to a multi-billion-dollar/year horror that stalks our children.
Specifically, we wish to bring to light the enslavement of children who are sold for commercial sex. This is not just an isolated, third-world problem. Unfortunately, this takes place right in our own backyards! These children are someone’s daughter, son, sibling, and grandchild.
Your donation is not just another dollar spent. It is another life saved! Through the Amazon, GoodShop and Groupon Affiliate Programs we put 100% of the funds raised back into the rehabilitation of these kids. We are not just getting kids off the streets and saved from sex trafficking – we are helping them to become part of our society!

We do understand that some people do not shop online, but would like to donate in other areas and with other means.

Child Ambassador from your own computer! Do you have a moment to simply share a post on Social Media?
Volunteer, if you are local, and are able, at one of our events. We have many areas where an extra set of hands can go a long way, from setting up tables, decorating, or even serving food.
Have you had a chance to shop on our very own Amazon Store? We are always looking for more items to add to our inventory! All funds earned from online sales are donated (100%) to the rehabilitation of teens and children. Nothing is too small! Please contact our office today by calling (888) 252-5939 to arrange for pick-up.
Do you enjoy giving back? And, would like to be part of a foundation that helps get youth off of the streets, rehabilitated, and ready to start a new chapter in their life? Some youth on the streets are without any aid or help, and therefore see no way out of their situation. If you have been blessed financially, please please consider a gift to us today.
Please consider signing up to give a monthly donation of $1 and help us reach our goal of recruiting 1 million supporters to raise awareness and funds for rehabilitation centers serving children rescued from sex trafficking in all 50 states.

Yeah, that's the Chevelle. It's been nice weather lately, so I have been taking it into work often. Had it almost 20 years, since I was 14. She was my first vehicle.
Trevor, The truck is coming along nicely. Do you have a color combination in mind yet? Your Chevelle is looking good. Love the Black.
I finally broke down and bought my gauges. Expensive, but wanted the look of our era gauges. They were 12 weeks out from working on them. Figured I better get on the list. New Vintage USA.
Black exterior with all the Cheyenne Exterior trim, Bright Blue Houndstooth Bucket interior. I know the Houndstooth didn't get put on buckets, but I like the Houndstooth and I think it wears better than the scroll vinyl buckets. I am a big lover of different color combos. Get tired of all the blacks, tans, and grey interiors of today.
That is one sweet machine! I've got some really fond memories of a 70 from a friends car back in high school. We missed an opportunity to buy a Cortez Silver 396 a few years back one of my buddies put together. Still a bucket list car for us..
Long old road with the inner roof, but have made a huge dent in it. Going to go with a 3M flexible foam or sound deadening foam between the layers which will also act as a glue.
I already started on the frame that’s under it now. Still haven’t decided if I am going to splice in my longhorn frame yet or not to this one. As far as putting the engine in the frame, I am waiting to get my cab done before I move on to the drivetrain.
Finally got my gauge cluster done. Glad that one is off the checklist. Only a few more large parts left.
I really like your gauge cluster. It's probably the closest thing to a stock appearing one I've seen yet.
Thanks guys, they weren't cheap I know that, but I wanted the truck to still have the nostalgic look and feel when I got behind the wheel.
Wow, everything is coming together just great. The truck is definitely gonna be a head turner. What did you use to dye the hub dials blue? I have a set of original faded yellow (almost white) spicer hubs on my Dana 60. I guess I could send out the metal outer parts and have them rechromed, I know yours were very nice when you bought them. Do you ever get anxious to finish the truck, or do you just take it one day at a time when you’re working on it? It really looks great. Kurt
I used to get anxious on finishing it, but after the surgery I just take it a day at a time and not stress over it. I still enjoy working on it, but will still redo items if I don’t like how it looks.
As far as the hubs go, I just clean my knobs and sprayed adhesion promoter and sprayed Krylon Fusion paint and cleared the knobs.
Trevor, forgive my ignorance, but what is the difference between a Cheyenne roof, and any other ‘67-‘72 roof? Is the inner roof skin different somehow? I was reading back through the thread and saw you mentioning something about Cheyenne roofs? Thanks.
Originally I was going to run 2 separate headliners, so I chose 2 cheyenne roof skins. They had the holes punch for the headliner trim already that the Cheyenne/CST/ Cheyenne Supers had. I eventually wound up switching to one big headliner instead, as the headliners didn’t quite fall where I thought they would. Trevor
I'm a big fan of the square bodies but I got a little bummed when you got sidetracked, ha. Read your thread start to finish and am very impressed with the work. Congratulations on the wedding and the remodeled house looks great. I bet the previous owners would move back in if they could see it. Glad you got your heart fixed up too! I look forward to following this truck to completion. Did you do a thread on your square CC?
Thanks LT7A, yeah the surgery really stopped my movement on the truck and then life happened with getting married. It will get done though, still have a couple big pieces left to puzzle to buy. The square body just needs a paint job and I'll have it on the road. I finally picked my color for it, and I will probably paint it early fall this year.

I set it up and it is off to the races. First impression of the iPad 2 was it is classy and sophisticated. It’s quick and clean. So, after setting it up, I let my wife take over. She played with it and messed around with it. She sure liked the layout and seemed to suit her well.
I offer affordable web development especially WordPress making your online presence look the best and most functional. I also work with you in designing logos, organic search engine optimization,...
I recently had the pleasure of working with Philo Computing to design my web site. I did not have a clue what was involved. The process is very overwhelming, and I did not want to just throw something online and call it my website. Phil was very thorough in helping me work through this process. I was so impressed that almost immediately he had a rough draft site up for me to review and refine. It was obvious from the draft that Phil had done specific research on the nature of my business. And even the "rough draft" was a beginning of a site that was very relevant I did not have to reinvent the draft. I only had to work with him to refine the content. The interaction between Phil and I resulted in a finished website, that took one week...from my first phone call to Philo to the last email when I was told it was LIVE. I would recommend Philo computing for any service they offer. Although I only worked with him on the website design/hosting side of things. I am very confident that the same great service is offered to all customers at Philo Computing. I think his work speaks for itself and I invite you to check out my site, http://baldmancoffee.com
The website is even better than I imagined. I especially love how it slides through the pictures and I love my new services page! You setup my Facebook and I'm bringing in more and more business. Thank you.
This web site is sick...you rock...and can I just mention for the record, you are doing an awesome job meeting/exceeding my expectations
Phil tried and fixed my system - unfortunately it died again. He retrieved the data and GAVE me a laptop! Who does that!?!?! Thank you so much!
Our Dell was dead. I had returned the system to Dell three different times - they told us they couldn't fix it. We gave Philo Computing a shot and he retrieved all our data and FIXED it!
I highly recommend Philo Computing. I thought I lost everything on my computer but Phil was able to backup all the data and fix the computer!
The first company I hired failed miserably. Phil took on the challenge and I couldn't be happier. His knowledge of business and how to integrate my website has been fantastic! I couldn't be happier!
We had no idea about websites - Philo came in at a very reasonable price and put together our ijiveespresso.com site. He setup our internet access and wireless access. He also setup our security cameras and the monitoring. Out site looks Great!

The second school we visited in New Orleans was John McDonogh #35, a former charter school struggling to serve its students. McDonogh #35 used to serve students who have scored high enough on an entrance exam to be admitted as a college prep school. They are trying hard to maintain that focus and trajectory, but it’s more difficult now. And we encountered a metal detector at the front entrance through which everyone must pass before coming in.
I can tell you with confidence I have never been in a school that had a metal detector before. I knew they exist, but being up close and personal with that reality was sobering.
McDonogh #35 has a long list of notable alumni, including many political figures and “firsts” among black leaders in our nation, from city council members and judges. We were once again escorted by Damon Smothers, who reminded the students once they gathered that they are part of a proud, strong heritage at McDonogh #35.
Since the school was holding state testing on the day of our visit, we only were able to meet a portion of the student body. They entered the auditorium with a lot of energy and excitement. Who doesn’t like getting to go to an assembly on testing day, right?
It was a completely different kind of experience for Ivan and me. We were joined at McDonogh #35 by our BNI franchise owner for the area, Tim Paulin, who sat in the front row with us.
This time, as Derrick spoke, there was a lot more chatter from the students as they interacted with him. He moved among them, reaching out to them with his voice and his gestures. They really connected with him and the message of encouragement he gave. “You never know who you are sitting with,” he said at one point. He went on to point us out to the kids and tell them that an
“international business mogul and his wife” were with them, because we wanted to learn more about what their needs are, so we can take that back out to our business associates to let you all know. Ivan and I are reluctant to take on this label, but have to admit that to the students, that is exactly what they think of us.
We had been hoping that some local media outlets would have picked up on our advance press releases and actually have attended the assemblies with us. Once we got there, though, we quickly realized that it was better for the STUDENTS to see us there without cameras and journalists. We do not want Business Voices to turn into a media circus. That would give the students an impression we don’t want to give, right?
We truly are coming in to their schools to meet them, to listen to what they need and to find ways to plug our BNI chapters and members into the equation so a real-time solution to their needs can be found. (The only reason I would be interested in any media coverage at all would be to give others the inkling that they can join our 5-5-5 2015 movement and help us improve schools 5 at a time.)
And then the most unexpected thing of the entire day happened. “Are you a leader?” Derrick boomed out from the front of the room. Like popcorn popping all around the room, the kids shouted out, “Yeah!” “You bet!” “Sure am.” He took it a step further, “How many of you think you can have leadership influence on others? Raise your hands. I want you to come up here with me. Come up here with me!” He invited them forward.
He knew going in that he was going to call out students for leadership. He thought maybe ten or 12 students would answer that call. Imagine our surprise when about 25 students surged forward and took their places in a line across the front of the room, facing their peers. Antonio sped up and down the line in his motorized chair and started giving them each a Stand Up wristband to wear.
Derrick turned and faced these 25 students. He shared with them that he was going to personally see that they received leadership training and skills to be the first Stand Up Youth Ambassador Program. And he was blunt. “Some of you are going to be kicked out. And some of you are going to really become leaders.” It was a powerful moment.
After the assembly closed and the students filed out, one young student, a junior, stayed behind. He came up to each one of us, looked us square in the eyes and thanked us one by one for coming, and then he hugged each of us. I think Derrick has his student leader for the Stand Up Youth Ambassador Program at McDonogh #35, don’t you?
What a transformational 40 minutes that was. The thing I like best about it is that it won’t stop with just that assembly.
The BNI Foundation’s partnership with Stand Up America will initiate the funding for the Leadership 1st Youth Program coming to McDonogh #35. And our local Executive Director, Tim Paulin, will be taking the needs of these students and the students at John H. Martyn Alternative School back to the BNI members to show the community that when BNI says, “How can I help you?” we really mean it!

After my post yesterday about the negative entries on my credit report, doingitallwrong suggested I send a letter to my creditors asking for a goodwill removal of the negatives from my credit history.
I have an ongoing relationship with one of the creditors, our credit union, where we have taken out two car loans over the past three years. I logged on to the CU site, and sent an e-message asking if they would remove the negatives. I based my letter on a template found on a link provided by doingitallwrong. Here's the response I received:
Thank you for contacting Credit Union via eMessage. We appreciate you taking the time to message us with your request. We greatly appreciate your membership with Credit Union and are happy to hear you have had such a positive experience with us. Although I am able to confirm you have had a very positive payment history with us in the recent past we are not able to reverse or remove late payments reported to the credit agencies unless they were reported in error. If the payments were reported late and it was not the result of an error on our part we are obligated to report them and are not able to remove them. Although we are not able to accommodate your request and remove late payments from your payment history, I would like to assure you that your credit history only reflects the last two years of your payment history. As the payments referenced in your previous message were between the years 2008 and 2011 they should no longer be reporting on your credit. If you have any additional questions or if we can assist you with anything else you are always welcome to contact us …
There is one other CC that has reported negatives. I cancelled that card a long time ago. I have no idea what my account number was. I do have a mailing address that appeared on my credit report, but the above mentioned credit union at least has the incentive of keeping my happy because of my continued business. The other company (Bank of America) really has no incentive to make or keep me happy. So, I doubt that I'll send a request to them.
I pulled my credit report yesterday. I don't pull my report often enough. I know that you can get a free report form each of the three companies once per year. So the best strategy is to pull each of the three every four months. I just don't do it often enough. It's probably been 12-18 months since I last pulled it.
What I've done is recorded the date and reporting company in the same spread sheet where I keep my budget, balance sheet, and amortization schedules. That way I can keep better track of when and where I pulled my last report, and keep on a better schedule.
I have a total of 17 negatives, from two credit companies on my report. The first has a string of 11 negatives ranging from May 2009 - March 2010, where I was 30 - 120 days past due. The other has a string from August 2008 - November 2008 where I was 30 - 90 days past due, plus March 2010, and October 2010 where I was 30 days past due. Note that I started becoming active on the SA forums around October 2010.
If negatives stay on a report for seven years, my first string of four will start dropping August through November this year. May of next year through March 2017 will see the end of the entire string from the other card, and the last negative will drop off October 2017. But, that's a long time from now.
According to my current Discover card statements, my credit score hovers between 720 and 725 any given month. It will be interesting to see how my score comes in as these negatives drop.
I also did something I should have done a long, long time ago. There were three open accounts listed that I don't use. One was a credit card I no longer use, one was a store card I opened when I bought a suit at a department store, and the third was an Amazon card I opened two Christmases ago. I called today, and had each of those accounts closed. We'll see what that does to my score.
She'll move on to the state contest three weeks from yesterday. There are six regions in the state, plus all of the second place regional winners compete against each other the day before the final competition, and the winner of that competes against all of the first place winners. So, there are a total of seven contestants in the finals.
We were very proud of her, of course, but honestly DW and I both expected she could win. However, we hold no illusions about the state level. The competition will be very stiff. Contestants are placed, and receive either a gold or silver award. We would be happy with a gold award.
Her contest is Thursday March 12, beginning at 8 a.m. Regions rotate speaking positions from year to year, and Region III (her region) speaks first this year. So, she'll get a bright and early opportunity to compete. We'll be there, the only question is whether we will drive early in the morning, or stay over the night before. DW has a sister who lives in the area, so we wouldn't have to get a hotel room. DD1 will be there as a participant in the convention, otherwise we would definitely drive the night before. The question in my mind is childcare for the boys, which we'll have to find someone to get them on the bus, because we'll be on the road when they get on the bus at 7:20 either way. I'm sure we'll figure this all out.
But, my daughter has made it to state level competition her first year out. Her mom did the same thing. There was no Jr. High FFA in 1992 (in Michigan, anyway). So DW started in FFA in 9th grade. She participated in what is called Green Hand Public speaking (for 9th and 10th graders in their first year of FFA), and she won it at the state level. So, there is precedent here in the family!
In my last post, I guessed my federal refund at $3,000. It's actually $3,395. I guessed my state refund at $1,000. It's actually $199. Added together, I was fairly close, but I was way off on the state amount.
I was submitting some expenses for my flexible spending account on Monday, and I thought about DD 1's possible braces. It occurred to me that at a minimum we might want to wait another year so I can max out my flexible spending account election, and at least get the full tax benefit if we do decide for the braces.
Speaking of DD1, she has made it to regional competition for Jr. High public speaking in FFA. The district competition was two weeks ago, and she took first place. If she takes first or second place tonight, she would move on to state level competition in three weeks. I'm clearly biased, but I think she stands a decent chance of placing at least second. I say that because I have judged Jr. High public speaking before, and as long as she performs to her ability, she is doing a better job than most in Jr. High.
I know it's mid month. Actually a bit past mid month, but I just figured my February net worth - it's $229,440, a $2,366 increase over last month.
We filed our taxes this weekend, and I can't remember our refund amounts, but it's around $3,000 federal, and $1,000 state. We still have that federal adoption credit working in our favor, but I'll plan on adjusting withholdings.
DW is still working on that freelance project. She hopes to have it finished by the end of the month. Once she's finished, she can bill for another $5,600.
It looks as if DD1 needs braces. That would be a $5,000 bill. If she gets them, we would probably time it so that she got them right after DW has received her freelance income.
Our dentist has fairly strongly recommended that she get braces. It's his opinion that teeth will touch each other, and cause future cavities. We took her to see an orthodontists, and oddly, he wasn't as strong in his recommendation for braces. He seems to think it would be more for cosmetic reasons. So, I'm not sure what we'll do.
We can easily wait for the freelance income, but there are lots of places for that money to go. We can get on a no interest 18 month payment plan. If we pay up front, we'll receive about a $200 discount.
DW had braces as a child, I did not, but my sister did. My teeth are a little crooked, and I could have had some cosmetic benefit from braces (I think). And it's clear to even me that DD2 will need braces after more of her permanent teeth have come in.

Health Insurance Thompsonville, MI | Online Health Insurance Rates Health Insurance Thompsonville, MI – Online Health Insurance Rates
Are you looking for an affordable health insurance in Thompsonville, MI? We can help you compare multiple health insurance providers. Enter your Zip at the top of this page and you will be provided with a list of best health insurers in Benzie county. Comparing quotes from multiple insurance carriers is a sure-fire way to guarantee that you are getting a good deal on your coverage.
No one enjoys thinking about getting sick. Even more than that, no one enjoys thinking about spending money they may or may not have an insurance that they may or may not meet. It gets incredibly easy to convince oneself that they don't actually need health insurance because they hardly ever get sick.
Of course, the simple truth is that health insurance is mostly for emergency situations. And when those emergency situations happen, it doesn't take long before you wish that you really had health insurance. The truth of that does not actually change the fact that health insurance can get expensive. Health insurance was certainly made easier to get thanks to the Affordable Care Act, but unfortunately the Affordable Care Act was mostly focused on helping those of low-income get health insurance.
If you make enough to live comfortably, but not enough to really put aside money into a savings account, then you may feel as though the Affordable Care Act hasn't helped you. This is a fair way of thinking, and speaks to problems that the Affordable Care Act has had since it was put into law. Unfortunately, knowing the problems of the Affordable Care Act doesn't change the fact that you do not currently have health insurance. So how does one find affordable Thompsonville, MI health insurance?
A lot of it depends on what state you live in. Unfortunately, there are a number of states where the state government has refused to implement the Affordable Care Act. In those states, it can be difficult to find cheap health insurance. This is because those states are not offering people the tax breaks that the Affordable Care Act promises for those who need health insurance.
If you live in one of those states, you may be out of luck. Your only real option is who consistently write your state government in order to tell them that you want them to implement the Affordable Care Act. Also, you may want to vote out the politicians that would rather use your health care as a political football game then actually ensure that you get what you need.
If you live in one of the states that has implemented the Affordable Care Act, and your options are much easier. Part of the Affordable Care Act is the Insurance Exchange, which ensures that people are capable of finding affordable health care quickly and easily. The Exchange is set up in such a way as to ensure that people can browse through the various health care plans, and see what's available without having to do a great deal of detailed research. The exchange also ensures that people don't have to know quite as much about how insurance works to get the insurance that they need.
The end of the day, getting low cost health care in Thompsonville, MI is done in the same way it has always been done. That is, you need to search around and see what's available and what will work best for you. But you have to make certain that you do that research. If you simply get the lowest cost health insurance plan available, you may not get the kind of care you need. That is not the fault of the insurance, nor the fault of the Affordable Care Act, but your own fault for not actually doing the research before you paid for insurance.
The amount of companies that offers health insurance coverage is very large. Individuals firms then offer a range of distinct well being insurance coverage ideas. You can make your research a lot more fruitful if you just take notes and properly analysis. Prepare for the selection by undertaking some investigation. The subsequent ideas will give some beneficial guidelines on how to find the greatest overall health insurance policies for you. To defray the price of health-related bills, you ought to carry overall health insurance policies. Even even though you may have a financial savings account, health-related expenses can even now wipe you out fiscally due to the fact they are frequently a lot more than any income you may have on hand. For instance, an appendectomy can price as significantly as $32,000 and heart medical procedures can be as high as $one hundred,000, relying on what you happen to be getting carried out. These are bills that would have to occur out of your pocket, if you do not have insurance coverage. If you and your husband or wife are each qualified for overall health insurance coverage by way of your specific workplaces, assess the two procedures to see which one will gain your family members most.

Operation Kid Comfort provides FREE photo-transfer quilts to children of deployed service men and women. If you wish to receive a quilt, or would like to learn more about how can support military families, please contact: operationkidcomfort@gmail.com.
Comfort. Create. Unite. Operation Kid Comfort creates comfort quilts and pillows for children of deployed service men and women, and offers an opportunity for America to unite in support of military families. Please take a few moments to scroll on down, look at our pictures, and read about our success.
Let me tell you about some of our young volunteers that Operation Kid Comfort is privileged to have on board.
Haven (age 12) and Avia Kinard (age 10) (Lyric’s darling daughters) donated the proceeds of a Fourth of July concert to Operation Kid Comfort. They took it upon themselves to plan and hold the neighborhood concert with Haven on the violin and Avia on the flute and raised SEVENTY-FIVE dollars to help us provide free quilts and pillows to children of deployed service men and women.
"I had plenty of fun performing and I am glad to know it was for such a good cause. I feel really sorry for all the children who's parents are at war and it's good to know that someone is helping and taking care of them. I know if my parents went to war I would nearly die of worry. Knowing that I am helping children like that makes me feel great."
Emily Newton, age 12, has made three Operation Kid Comfort quilts and a pillow cover this summer, and all for the same family! How great is that! Check out this picture of Emily with two recipients of her wonderful quilts!
Katie Newton (below) wanted to do a volunteer project over the summer. Filling a bag with our patriotic fabric scraps, she took them home and created a 40” square quilted wall hanging for an Operation Kid Comfort raffle as a fundraiser. Isn’t it beautiful! This is her first quilt other than Opertion Kid Comfort quilts!
If you would like to purchase raffle tickets for the quilt, at $1.00 each, please send a check payable to Armed Services YMCA ( noting the Operation Kid Comfort Raffle) to:
Please let us know if you wish us to return the ticket stubs to you (a self addressed, stamped envelope would be very helpful), or if we can email you the ticket numbers. The drawing will be on Make A Difference Day, October 22, 2005. You need not be present; we will contact you if you win.
Please join me in tremendous praise for these young patriotic volunteers. They are amazing young people who deserve a lot of credit for their unselfish efforts.
All together now… a round of applause for Haven, Avia, Katie, Emily and all our fantastic volunteers…or as we are fond of shouting here at Fort Bragg….Hooah!
And volunteers...please write in and tell us why you like to volunteer at Operation Kid Comfort? I'm sure you have some valuable advice and heartwarming tales of your OpKid workshop experience. We'd love to hear from you.

"I could kiss Smiley Bone for finding that map! I might even kiss Phoney right before I strangle him!"
The hero of the book. Fone Bone is a creature he is bone creature that was ran out of boneville because his cousin- Phoney
Fone Bone is the descendant of the founder of Boneville, Johnson Bone, something that was mentioned once in Out from Boneville. He is also the second-oldest of the three Bone cousins. When he was young, he and his cousins lived in poverty, to the point where Smiley had to steal pies off of windowsills just so they wouldn't starve to death. As the eldest, Phoney took care of them. Eventually, Phoney Bone gained a lot of wealth, though this led to him being frequently run out of town for his hare-brained schemes; Fone Bone often had to help him escape the angry mob, which led him to being also run out, a fact which often frustrates him. He often brings Smiley along just to torture Phoney.
Two weeks before the start of the story, Phoney set in motion his latest plan: a community picnic in the park in which he would announce that he would be running for mayor. This scheme ended in disaster, when the fifty-foot Phoney Bone balloon was blown into the crowd, taking the statue of Big Johnson Bone with it. The cousins were run out of town once again as a result, and into the desert.
Months after he first entered the valley, Fone Bone is seen collecting sticks to build up his makeshift home. We soon learn that during the winter, he was aided by a kind-hearted possum named Miz Possum. After delivering Fone Bone some more blankets and the news that she still had not seen either Ted or Thorn, Miz Possum goes off to visit Miz Hedghog, leaving a dismayed Fone Bone to babysit her three possum kids. The kids eventually run out of Fone Bone's house and in the clutches of the rat creatures. Fone Bone rescues the kids, and after a thrilling chase in which they tumble over a giant waterfall, Fone is cornered by the rats. At that moment, the Dragon appears and rescues Fone Bone once again. After a brief conversation between the two, the Dragon walks off, telling Fone Bone that the possum kids are at Miz Hedgehog's place. Before Fone Bone can figure out how the Dragon knew that it was Miz Possum's kids he was babysitting, Miz Possum, Miz Hedgehog and the kids turn up, relieved that he is okay. His story about the Dragon and the rat creatures is met with disbelief, as dragons are said to be make-believe. Fone Bone storms off towards a hot spring to wash off the soot (the Dragon had breathed fire at him!), where he meets a beautiful human girl.
Fone falls in love with the girl on sight. During introductions, Fone Bone discovers that the girl is named Thorn. At first he is overjoyed to have found her at last, but then is saddened when she reveals that she has never heard of Boneville before. He eventually reveals that he had met with the rat creatures. Though Thorn also does not believe in dragons, she certainly believes in rat creatures. She decides that they should quickly leave the spring, and takes the smitten Fone Bone with her to her grandmother's farmhouse.
Fone Bone wakes up and helps Thorn with the housework. During their rummage through his knapsack, Fone Bone finds the map he had followed to get to the valley. Upon reading the map, Thorn finds that the map reminds her of a dream she used to have.
Later that day, Fone Bone and Thorn are in the middle of baking an apple pie for Gran'ma Ben, when the house suddenly starts shaking: G﻿ran'ma Ben is racing one of her cows to the house. To Fone Bone's astonishment, Phoney Bone is riding the cow. After the race finishes with Gran'ma stopping the cow by the tail and sending Phoney flying into the pot in the fireplace, Phoney's attitude and Gran'ma's initial belief that the bones are just pets causes Gran'ma Ben let the bones sleep in the barn instead of the farmhouse. The chapter ends with Thorn catching Phoney eating the pie, and stuffing what was left into Fone Bone's mouth in an attempt to hide the evidence.
The Great Red Dragon is the son of Mim(Mim was the largest, most beautiful, and wisest dragon.She circled the world with her tail in her mouth.As long as the world was protected within her coil the Dreaming flourished and all life thrived).He becomes Fone Bone's protector of sorts,always mysteriously appearing at the last minute to save him from the rat Creatures and other threats.The Great Red Dragon kept an eye on young thorn during the Great war while Gran'ma Ben serched for a good hiding place. sometime in the past,however,the Red dragon seems to have let Gran'ma ben down
Fone Bone is reading Moby Dick to Thorn (who has built up a tolerance) while Miz Possum pays a visit. They have a long conversation about the aftermath of the race, and the rat creature attack on the farmhouse﻿. When Miz Possum leaves, Thorn and Fone Bone decide to return to the house. As they head back, they discuss Phoney's behaviour since the race. It turns out that he has once again come up with a silly scheme to get rich: Trying to get two chickens to have a 'date' to lay eggs.
That night, after another Fone turns around to find the Dragon instead, much to his annoyance. Fone tells the Dragon about his dream, after which the Dragon walks off, saying; "Welcome aboard, Ishmael."
Fone Bone is stunned, as he had never said that he had been Ishmael in the dream. He yells at the Dragon the stay out of his dreams and continues writing poetry. He is once again interrupted by Phoney Bone and Smiley, who mock Fone over his feelings for Thorn. They are then summoned by Gran'ma ben to kill a couple of hens for the dinner. The chapter ends with Fone and Phoney fainting over the idea of killing a hen.
That night, Thorn and Fone had no dreams. Everyone is woken up early in the morning to get ready for Lucius, Phoney and Smiley's return to Barrelhaven to work off their longshot bet. Fone is allowed to remain on the farm, as he was not involved in the scheme. Once Lucius and the two cousins have left, Thorn and Fone walk off to feed the chickens and to set up a little garden.
While setting up the garden, Fone and Thorn discover prayer stones half buried in the soil. Thorn tells Fone Bone about the stones' use in warding off the sinister ghost circles. A storm hits suddenly, and Fone and Thorn rush to the barn, where they proceed to discuss the dreams. During that discussion, they are surprised by Gran'ma Ben, who had overheard the whole thing.
A furious Gran'ma Ben storms off into the forest, pursued by Fone Bone and Thorn, who demand to know what Gran'ma knows about the dreams. When Fone Bone demands what she knew about the Dragon being in his dreams, Gran'ma replies knowing that he was supposed to stay out of them. During the argument, Gran'ma notices the presence of rat creatures. She silently takes them deeper into the forest to avoid the rat creatures.
Fone Bone, Thorn and Gran'ma hide in a small thicket of trees, where they once again start to argue over Gran'ma's secrets. When Fone Bone demands why she is so angry at the Dragon, Gran'ma accuses Fone Bone of causing all the trouble in the valley by waking up the Dragon. The argument is cut short when a rat creature scout approaches and Gran'ma has to sneak over to him and kill him. They leave the thicket and begin climbing up some rocks, where they are discovered by the rat creatures. After a quick chase, in which Fone calls out to the dragon for help, they hide behind some bushes while a large pack of rat creatures search for them. Just as they are about to be discovered, the Dragon arrives and scares them off. Fone Bone and Thorn persuade Gran'ma not to confront him, and they return to the farmhouse. Thorn tells Fone Bone that's it's time to show Gran'ma Ben the map.
The next day, Fone Bone and Thorn confront Gran'ma Ben while she is mending fences. Gran'ma apologises to Fone Bone for her earlier accusation, stating that the troubles in the valley started a long time before he had come to the valley. Fone Bone and Thorn then confront Gran'ma with the map. Gran'ma ushers them into the house, where she tells them the whole story: There was once a great war between the valley and the rat creatures, where the royal family in the city of Atheia had been killed, and that Thorn is actually Thorn Harvestar, the crown princess of the valley.
As Fone Bone and Thorn sit at the table, stunned by the revelations, Thorn tells Gran'ma about the cave dream. Gran'ma reveals that Thorn had been dreaming about her parents' murder, having been betrayed by a nursemaid. She also mentions a powerul, evil being called the Lord of the Locusts. During the discussion, however, it becomes clear that Gran'ma Ben is still withholding information. Thorn storms out and lies face down in the barn, while Fone Bone sits alone by the well.
Later that day, Fone Bone is once again greeted by Ted, who reveals that he had known all along about Thorn's past. Ted asks where Gran'ma is, and then heads off towards the farmhouse. Minutes later, Gran'ma has Fone Bone collect his things and head to the barn, where they take some things out of a trunk hidden under the barn. Gran'ma places a wrapped up object in Fone's knapsack and arms herself with a sword. Gran'ma reveals that a large army of rat creatures is headed this way, and that she, Fone Bone and Thorn must leave the farm house immediately. And so they leave the farm.
Fone Bone, Thorn and Gran'ma Ben spend days climbing up a large hill, so that Gran'ma can get a lay of the land. When they reach the top, Fone is stunned by the beauty and apparent peacefulness of the valley before him. When they reach the bottom again, Gran'ma is once again struck by the gitchy feeling, and seconds later, the two rat creatures ambush them.
Gran'ma Ben manages to drive the rat creatures off to a distance despite being in a dazed state. After sensing that something is going on after nothing happen after the ruckus they had just made, Gran'ma captures one of the rats and interrogates him. During the interrogation, they are attacked by Kingdok, the giant king of the rat creatures. Fone Bone is flung away into the woods, sustaining a head injury in the process, and finds himself lost in the woods. He frantically begins calling to the Dragon for help, though he manages to find his way back to Thorn and Gran'ma after hearing Kingdok's scream (Thorn cut off his arm with Gran'ma's sword). As they bandage up Gran'ma Ben, Gran'ma begins to tell some some more secrets...
Gran'ma Ben reveals that Thorn is a Veni-Yan Cari (the awakened one) and that the Lord of the Locusts is searching for her. Angered that Gran'ma had been lying to her all this time, Thorn storms off. Gran'ma gives Fone Bone her sword and dragon pendant before he follows her, leaving Gran'ma to run off in the opposite direction. Fone takes Kingdok's golden club with him.
Fone Bone eventually catches up with Thorn on the road leading to Barrelhaven. When they reach the town, they are surprised to find a mass of logs covering up the entrance, guarded by Jon. Fone is angered when Jon refuses to let them in, and then is astonished when he learns that Phoney Bone has become the new leader of the town.
Fone Bone is disgusted to learn that Phoney Bone has tricked the townspeople into following him by pretending to be a dragonslayer. A disagreement begins between the two, in which Phoney is dismayed to learn that Fone Bone will not be joining them when they head back to Boneville, as he wants to stay behind to find out the connection between the bone cousins and the valley. Fone Bone storms out of the Tavern, and discovers a baby rat creature cub scrounging in the garbage. He takes the cub to Thorn, waking her up from another dream in which the Hooded one attempts to capture her. Thorn is enraged to see the cub, as rat creatures killed her parents. She threatens to kill the cub, so Fone Bone quickly takes it out her room.
Fone Bone hides the cub in the barn and later takes Smiley to see it. Smiley is delighted to meet the cub and promptly adopts it as a pet. Smiley quickly hides the cub as Lucius enters the barn. Fone Bone explains to him everything Gran'ma had told them and what happened in the woods. Smiley is shocked to learn that Thorn is really a princess. They decide to go visit Thorn, and find her driven to tears over her dreams.
The next day, Fone Bone sneaks some food over to the cub, though he soon discovers that Smiley has been doing the same thing. Fone explains to Smiley that they need to get the cub out of town tonight, and then Thorn comes in. Smiley hides with the cub while Thorn tells Fone Bone that she intends to return to the farmhouse. When Fone Bone disagrees, she flings the sword to the ground and returns to her room. She doesn't answer when Fone Bone knocks on her door.
When night falls, Fone Bone and Smiley succeed in sneaking the cub out of town, though Smiley quickly runs off with the cub towards the mountains, despite Fone Bone yelling for him to come back. Exasperated, Fone Bone runs off after them.
Smiley names the cub Bartleby, and the threesome stop to rest in the mountains, where they are once again ambushed by the two rat creatures. After escaping the two, they encounter an enormous mountain lion named Roque Ja. Fone Bone mispronounces his name as Rock Jaw. Roque recognises the two cousins as the bon creatures the hooded one has been searching for, and takes them captive.
While Roque Ja is escorting them through the mountains against their will, he tells them the story of Queen Mim, which he dismisses a a fairy tale. They are interrupted by the unexpected arrival of the three possum kids and a baby raccoon named Roderick, being pursued by the two rat creatures. Roque Ja, who despises rat creatures, attacks the creatures on sight, which leads to the three of the toppling over a cliff. The bones reunited with the kids, and Roderick introduces them to his friends: a gang of babies orphaned by rat creatures eating their parents.
The group is forced to flee into a small tunnel when an enraged Roque Ja climbs back up the cliff and chases them. After a debate ove Bartleby (who is distrusted by the orphans) they reach the other side, where they discover an ancient rat creature temple. Fone Bone and Smiley wonder about Roque Ja's tale that the mountains themselves were created long ago when the Dragons fought and pushed up the land. As the Bones try to make their way back towards the valley, they encounter the two stupid Rat Creatures, but before they can give chase, Kingdok appears. He is angry at the two stupid Rat Creatures for deserting him, and attacks them and the Bones, forcing them onto a very narrow ledge.
Trapped on a narrow ledge with the ferocious Kingdok ahead of them, the Bones and the Rat Creatures are forced to edge their way to safety along a precarious cliff face after deciding to die rather than sell out their friends. However, on the way they are attacked by a swarm of locusts. Fone Bone stumbles and falls onto a lower ledge. The locusts try to carry him away, but the medallion given to him by Gran'ma Ben falls from his backpack and scares the locusts away. As the locusts flee, Kingdok vanishes into thin air, having been an illusion generated by the locusts' magic. Thanks to the orphans, the Bones realize the locusts could manipulate Thorn or even the whole valley with illusions, as they press on down the mountainside with a suspicious Roque Ja watching.
The Rat Creatures, the Bones and their friends make their way down from the mountains, unaware they are being followed and eavesdropped upon by Roque Ja. As they descend, the Rat Creatures reveal that the current unrest has only come about since The Hooded One arrived, bringing with him the locusts and the strange dreams. At that moment, Roque Ja reveals himself to the party and orders them back up the mountain. Before they can go too far, the real Kingdok arrives along with a pack of his minions and starts to fight with Roque Ja. The Bones use the opportunity to escape (minus the two stupid rat creatures because they tried to hand Fone and Smiley at the last moment and they got bitten by the orphans), fleeing from the scuffle and running down the mountain while Roque Ja gets revenge on Kingdok and seriously wounds him. Roderick, the possum kids, and the orphans split up and leave. Bartleby rejoins the pack and the Rat Creatures carry the unconscious Kingdok away. Fone Bone and Smiley make their way back to the forest.
Fone Bone and Smiley become lost in the large forest. While Fone Bone climbs a tall tree to survey the area, Smiley gets into a confrontation with a ground hog. On the way back down, the branch Fone is holding on to snaps, causing him to fall- right on top of the ground hog. Ted eventually finds them, having been searching for them for a while. The ground hog learns Fone Bone's name, and frantically runs off, saying that the bones were trouble. Fone Bone learns from Ted that there are rumors going around that Kingdok is dead, and that Fone killed him. He also learns that rat creatures have invaded the valley, and are burning every farm in their path. Fone Bone has Ted lead them back to Barrelhaven.
While Fone Bone, Smiley and Ted are trying to get back to the town, they are ambushed by rat creatures during a monsoon. The rats are at first skeptical of the rumors after seeing the bones' size, and decide to kill them, when Thorn arrives in the nick of time and hands Fone Bone back Kingdok's club. Now convinced, the rat creatures flee in terror. Thorn then tells them that Gran'ma Ben is waiting for them at Old Man's Cave, and points in the right direction. To the bones' surprise though, Thorn starts walking off in the opposite direction, telling them that there is nobody they can trust at the cave. Fone Bone and Smiley have no choice but to follow.
Thorn, Fone Bone, Smiley and Ted hide out in a hollowed out tree, where they play a game of spitting cherry seeds at each other before beginning a discussion over the Hooded One and his plot to free the Lord of the Locusts from the mountain using Phoney Bone and Thorn. When Thorn explains the consequences of the Hooded One's success, Fone Bone demands that they go to Old Man's Cave. Thorn refuses, and explains why she doesn't trust Gran'ma Ben: Gran'ma had told them that the night Thorn's parents were murdered, the nursemaid had betrayed them. However, a lot of Thorn's memories have returned, and she remembers now that they never had a nursemaid.
Fone Bone, Thorn and Smiley return to the farmhouse. While Thorn looks through the items left in Gran'ma's secret trunk, Fone Bone and Smiley discuss how they should go to Old Man's Cave and that Gran'ma can be trusted. They are distracted by a wolf calling in the distance, and note how sad and lonely the wolf sounds. Thorn emerges from the barn dressed like a warrior princess, hvaing already made arrangements for Fone Bone and Smiley to remain on the farm with Ted, while Thorn goes off to try and kill the Hooded One. Fone Bone and Smiley stubbornly disagree with this plan, and once again try to convince Thorn to go to Old Man's Cave. When Thorn retorts that they don't know what it's like to never know their parents, the two cousins tell her otherwise: when they were young, they had been orphans living in poverty, while Phoney was the oldest and took care of them, which led to him becoming the greedy bone he is today. Fone Bone reveals that while he tends to get driven crazy by Phoney's schemes, he knows that Phoney never means to hurt anyone; deep down, you know if you can trust someone. Moved by these words, Thorn eventually agrees to go to Old Man's Cave.
On the way to Old Man's Cave, Fone Bone, Smiley and Thorn collide with a naked Phoney Bone, who has just fled from a fight between Gran'ma Ben, Lucius and Roque Ja. Thorn draws her sword and runs to aid her grandmother, Fone Bone following close behind. In the ensuing fight, Roque Ja knocks Thorn unconsious and carries her off along with Phoney. Fone is disdainfully knocked aside trying to stop him. While unconsious, Fone Bone meets the Dragon in his dream. The Dragon tells him that the Dragon Council has forbade him from taking any more part in the war, though urges Fone to rescue Thorn and Phoney and gives him the dragon pendant. Fone Bone is woken by Smiley, and they both race to the mountain on the other side of the valley to rescue their friends.
They reach the place where all the rat creatures have gathered, and peer over the cliff to find Phoney Bone tied to an altar with the Hooded One watching over him. They soon discover to their amazement the reason why the Hooded chose to pursue Phoney: the fifty-foot Phoney Bone ballon had flown all the way across the desert and into the valley, where the Hooded One had percieved this as an omen that Phoney was a Veni-Yan Cari. Gran'ma Ben arrives and confirm this mistake. While the mountain begins to shake in the Locust's wrath, the locusts keeping the Hooded One (now revealed to be Gran'ma's sister, Briar, the person who had really betrayed Thorn's parents) alive leave her, and swarm Thorn. Fone Bone rushes over and places the dragon pendant on Thorn, dispelling the locusts. Thorn wakes up and leads the group in escaping the mountain.
Fone Bone and his friends are desperately trying to escape down the exploding mountain when they are attacked by an enraged Kingdok. While Gran'ma Ben fends him off, Fone leads the group into the same tunnel he and Smiley had used to escape Roque Ja days ago. As they travel through the tunnel, they begin to hallucinate once again: Fone Bone and Phoney become their respective Moby Dick characters. While Phoney panics over having one eye and leg, Smiley claims that the hallucinations are a result of the power of the dreaming. Fone dismisses the hallucinations as being from some kind of gas.
When they finally reach the surface, they are all stunned to find that the valley has now become a barren wasteland. Thorn tells them that Ghost Circles which Briar unwittingly unleashed are responsible for the destruction.

"In 2000, I went into carving and since then I have never regretted it. But I haven't abandoned painting completely either."
"At a tender age, I used to draw pictures from magazines with a pencil. During my primary education, I painted with watercolors, to the admiration of my parents and their friends. This gave me confidence and inspired me to continue. I knew I'd be a painter in the future, as I realized that the flair for painting was in-born.
"When I was in senior high, I used to visit friends who were in college pursuing courses in painting. I'd practice with them using acrylics on canvas – I didn't find it difficult. In fact, I started to paint for people in my neighborhood upon request.
"When talking to people whose livelihood was painting and learning the challenges they encountered in selling a single canvas, it set me to thinking about whether to pursue this dream of becoming a painter. Perhaps I should turn to a different field altogether?
"When I completed senior high, I used to visit a man by name of Musa at his workshop. He was into carving masks and sculptures. I'd observe him with his workers and saw the joy with which they went about their work. At the time, I was deep in thought as to what would be next for me. My love for the art field was so strong.
"After careful observation of their carving over a period of time, one day I went to the workshop as usual, picked a log of wood and started carving out a mask as I had observed them doing. This surprised Musa and he was willing to help me perfect the skill. I developed a love for this new skill I'd acquired and decided to pursue it further.
"Because of my knowledge in painting, I was able to help Musa in creating very beautiful designs on the mask. In 2000, I went into carving and since then I have never regretted it. But I haven't abandoned painting completely either – I still paint for people upon request.
"I am now self employed and there are five assistants working with me. In addition, I have taught seven other people how to carve, and they are also on their own now and doing well. When I get large orders, I call on them for their assistance. I look forward to training more people in this craft and also to continuing with my paintings."

Before his days with NOVICA, Buana sold his jewelry designs door-to-door in the tourist areas of Bali. Business was tough, and local store owners were often slow to pay. All this changed when he joined NOVICA 7 years ago.

The most common support requests received are due to problems with Section Breaks. Section Breaks in Word documents control page numbering, headers, page sizes, margins, etc. The Book Design Wizard sets up proper Section Breaks in your document. If you copy a Section Break from another Word document and paste it into the document created by the Book Design Wizard the settings from that Section Break will overwrite the settings created by the Book Design Wizard and you will have issues with page numbers, headers, footers, page size, margins, etc. These problems may also occur if you delete a Section Break created by the Book Design Wizard.
You should be careful not to copy and paste Section Breaks between documents and also not to delete them. To make sure you do not accidently copy over a Section Break you can run a find/replace in your original document and replace all Section Breaks with a Page Break which do not carry over settings. In your original document in Word press Ctrl + H to launch the Find/Replace tool. In the Find box type ^b and in the Replace box type ^m then click on Replace All.
The Book Design Wizard uses style definitions to set the first line paragraph indents for the chapter text which is the proper method. If you used spaces or tabs in your original document to create the first line indents and copy and paste them into the Book Design Wizard you will have the first line indent as set by the Book Design Wizard style PLUS the extra spaces and tabs you used resulting in the first line indent being too large. You should remove those extra spaces or tabs to have a proper first line indent. You can accomplish this by doing a find/replace on your document in Word.

One of the most common point of views concerning the initial Puffy Bed mattress was that it is a little to firm for some individuals’s taste. The additional 2inch layer on the Puffy Lux provides it an overall softer feel. According to The Puffy internet site the Puffy Lux has a suppleness level of 5.5 – 7/ 10.

Whereas for people who like a somewhat softer feel to their mattress as well as rest in a variety of positions after that the Puffy Lux may be matched far better to them.
If spending plan is not a problem after that we would recommend trying the Puffy Lux. There is quiet a huge rate difference in between both mattresses so The Initial Puffy perhaps matched to someone on a tighter budget.
The price difference could place some individuals off of acquiring the Puffy Lux yet it is worth keeping in mind that both mattresses featured a 101 night sleep trial. So if you do not like the mattress after that you can send it back within that time and receive a complete reimbursement.

Ella Sampson is a Londoner aged seventeen. One morning she wakes up to a number of surprises. In her bedroom is a wall that wasn’t there when she fell asleep. The decoration is now pink. When Ella sees her mother, her mother’s hair is white instead of brown. At college Ella finds she is studying science subjects instead of the arts subjects she was taking. Her old online profiles have disappeared. Her former friends are there at the college, but they are no longer her friends. In short, her entire existence has evaporated. Her parents think her puzzling new behaviour is the result of a car accident she had while her father was teaching her to drive. The questions posed by the novel are: what has actually happened? and which of Ella’s two lives can be classified as ‘real’?
Two very disparate cultures converge in Freeman’s book. It is impossible to read it without thinking of Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, who woke one morning to find that he had been metamorphosed into a giant beetle. But the book also leads to an exploration of the way contemporary quantum physics (with particles being located in two places at once) leads to the concept of different and co-existing universes. Freeman also raises the interesting question of the extent to which each person’s identity is shaped by the company that person keeps.
This is a book of startling originality and consummate story-telling. Not many books for young adult readers have the courage to tackle the quantum. The ending of the book is clever, but perhaps unsatisfactory. It is a culmination that would appeal to Schrödinger, whose cat was simultaneously alive and dead. Freeman gives the reader three different possibilities, each one just as plausible as the others. One of the founders of the quantum said that he hated it and wished he had never studied it; one is inclined to understand what he meant.

The hypothesis for this thesis is that the numerous cairns that were surveyed in the hinterland of Palmyra in 2009 can be connected to a pastoral nomadic population on the Syrian Steppe in the Early Bronze Age (EBA). This hypothesis is based on the large numbers of cairns and the fact that there are few signs of permanent settlements. It is also based on comparison to similar areas in the region where a shift from urban central economies to more rural pastoral economies is evident in EBA. Because of the similarities, both in landscape and material, a similar development must also be considered for the research area of this thesis. Special attention will therefore be given to EBA and more precisely the second half of the third millennium BCE.
We typically get require quotes for carpet cleaning services, and every so often we get the “so and so is a lot less expensive than you". Typically we avoid responding with: “you get exactly what you spend for" or “low-cost prices indicate low-cost services"
Not all carpet cleaning business are created equivalent and numerous clients are puzzled about the service they are asking for. While most business assure quality service for a low cost, you may not constantly get it.
Little service companies have to have a hard time to compete in a challenging market that has numerous “on the fly" entrepreneurs that provide a bad reputation to those services suppliers that provide a truthful service.
The essential to providing a fair option is to inform our clients, no matter what service market you are in, education will make for smart clients.
Ask exactly what types of expert training a company"s service technicians have received. An expert carpet cleaning up company must utilize people that hold the Carpet Cleaning Specialist certification by the Institute of Evaluation, Cleaning, and Repair Accreditation. This is the most typical and well-known training body for the cleaning and remediation market in North America and in Canada. IICRC offers numerous other market accreditations. All QJS" senior service technicians are certified by the IICRC.
Knowledge comes not only with education, however experience. Ask the length of time a company has been in organisation and check their social networks sites/ evaluation sites for consumer feedback.
Our Company has been in organisation for over 25 years and has an exceptional 5 Star rating in online evaluations.
In numerous cities, little cleaning business come and go rapidly. Ask the company you call whether they are a signed up organisation. A cleaning company must bring liability and WSIB insurance. QJS is an authorized corporation and fully insured.
It most likely is if the cost sounds too good to be real. Price must never be the main factor for selecting a carpet cleaning company. Constantly check out the fine print on marketed specials. QJS is not the most affordable however definitely the very best worth for your money!
Pre stain Process: The application of the proper pre-treatment representative to loosen up soils from carpet fibers. QJS includes treatments such as enzyme for animal discolorations and high traffic location treatment.
Soil extraction: The most typical technique for eliminating soils from carpet is the warm water extraction technique, also understood as steam cleaning.
Grooming: Grooming of carpet assists get rid of matting of fiber and correctly distribute cleaning up representatives.
Drying: With normal temperature level and humidity conditions, carpet must take no longer than 24 Hr to dry. The ideal dry time for carpet ought to be around six to eight hours. QJS uses air movers and dehumidifiers to speed the drying procedure.
Numerous business use high pH cleaners on a carpet. Ask whether the carpet"s pH will be reduced or neutralized following the cleaning to assist it stay clean longer.

Creating a poster for Halloween and The Walking Dead was exciting and fun. Even the Goose became a zombie.
I recently gave a talk at the Provocative Plastics conference at the Museum of Design in Plastics at the Arts University Bournemouth. My presentation slides are online, and hopefully the video of the talk will be uploaded soon (as promised).
Currently, The Sound Spirals are made with some custom software fast-prototyped in Processing (yes I still like Java) where you can load in sound files and then “sculpt” them in very specific ways (scale, spikiness, complexity) to create 3D printable sculptures. They are the basis for my new part-time PhD research in Computational Art and Technology at Goldsmiths.
Part of the project has been to take all the field recordings I’ve made over the past few years and to find a better way of experiencing them. Many of them are insect sounds recorded at night in New York State, and anyone who has listened to the complex orchestration of the nighttime soundscape out in the country has probably sat and tried to make sense of all of the different rhythms beating out from an army of fluttering wings and serrated, scraping limbs.
This project has come quite far from a few years ago (2009-10!), when I was working on the Waving/Drowning installation and first discovered the yin/yang, joy/pain of laser cutting.
On a side note, Waving/Drowning also taught me that it’s much harder to sell my art than I’d imagined. Part of that was the naivete of thinking people would have space for larger works, such as the 6′ x 4′ (or 2m x 1.2m for my non-US readers) that now sits jauntily by my bedside:
This is what happens when you print a large work and have nowhere to put it. [Work titled: Untitled (Float/Fall/Sink/Fly) 2015 ]
It was a similar project in that I was trying to find a way to make sense of chunks of data that change over time, in this case hand gestures. I was working with the artist and visual effects maestro Marcus Lyall (alongside Adam Smith, half of the team behind the hypnotising, trippy, and slightly disturbing visuals for the Chemical Brothers) on a separate project where I hacked a sound card to send a live (and recorded) video feed to an oscilloscope:
At the time I was using the computer vision library OpenCV and some custom C++ code (based partially in OpenFrameworks) to create outlines of video images and translate them to audio for the oscilloscope. To test the system I used the simplest “object” I had laying around – my own hand. After looking at countless videos of my hand opening and closing I thought “Hey, that’s kind of cool… what if I took those images and tried to reconstruct that gesture as a solid, physical object?”
My first thought was 3D printing but this was before Makerbots and cheap desktop versions, and before easier software toolkits for constructing 3D objects. I was using Dave Griffiths’s fluxus to render 3D objects from swept hand gestures like waving, grabbing, swiping in the air, and they looked fantastic on the screen and in Blender when I cleaned them up, but they were impractical to print because of the incredible cost of printing solid objects on ZCorp’s 3D printers. You can see in the picture below my somewhat structurally unsuccessful but aesthetically pleasing attempt to create inner shells inside these highly complex objects.
On the other hand, laser cutters were more accessible – cheaper, faster. Cutting out a series of slices of a 3D object from 3mm plywood sheets seemed a much better option for prototyping.
Your material needs to be perfectly flat otherwise the laser will not focus on it and it will not cut
Regular plywood is cheap (I think it was £6/sheet) but takes quite a bit of energy to cut. Now that I’m more experienced, I should have used laser ply! (This is why you need a good technician, to tell you these things)
Make sure you know what version of the software your lab is using. If it’s Adobe Illustrator 4, make sure you use a template that works with it! (Correct color mode, correct bed size, correct colors to identify cuts and engravings etc.)
The sculptures were interesting, but I was never fully satisfied with the shapes. They were missing something… they were too “flat” in a sense, even though they stacked up to add depth. It’s interesting to look at Inmi Lee and Kyle McDonald’s later collaboration Mother which used the Kinect to record hand gestures and turn them into point clouds. If only I’d had access to some decent 3D software and could afford a to use a 3D printer back then!
I really like the more organic, bubbly nature of the forms and the way the fingers sprout from them at odd angles. It’s fascinating to think that we can turn ephemeral moments such as waving hands and vibrating sounds into solid objects and study them as if they were separate things.
I settled for more sculptural methods, turning these airy gestures into solid landscapes populated by tiny people going about their business:
Still, I got some good images out of the exhibition. You should see them printed on high-quality paper with metallic inks – quite lovely and with a great shine and colour depth. If you want to purchase one in the series, drop me a line!
A few years later I wanted to make unique bracelets for my mother as a birthday present and came back to this idea of laser cutting rings of data – in this case, the sound of her name being spoken.
You can see the results here – they have a lovely finish but were still hard to “read” and understand as discrete parts of a single, linear series of forms, and they were very brittle. Certainly not wearable.
I did experiment later on with some quick cardboard mock-ups that were larger and thicker. They had a very earthy quality due o the cardboard and you could pick out the sound details very easily from each individual ringlet, but weren’t very comfortable as bracelets.
Finally I found the motivation to start writing a program for creating 3D waveforms when I started teaching a class at Ravensbourne to the BA Design Interactions students called “Tangible Media.” For one of the assignments I had the students walk around London recording sounds and then we experimented with different ways of representing that data, from location-based online maps to graphs and other visualisations of the waveforms and sound data itself.
For a demo, I made a simple 3D render using Processing that took a waveform and unwrapped it into a spiral. It was very 1980’s – very chunky and pretty simplistic in how it mapped the audio data as blocky extrusions radiating outwards from a centre spiral form.
Still, as a prototype of what could be possible, it was pretty successful because I was able to (finally!) make a 3D-printable model from it, and along the way experiment with different aesthetics for the piece.
When you start sculpting 3D forms, it’s very different than carving forms from blue foam or wood or stone. When you carve into a substance, you remove material to reveal the form within. When you create a 3D form, you are inventing something completely new from sheer nothingness. You have to supply the (intellectual) material and then mentally carve away at it until you arrive at that inner form. You define the hidden constraints, the physics, the symmetries, and then change them at will.
Unless you want to someday bring your forms into the physical world. That’s where I found the most difficulty, because taking something intangible that lives between the panes of glass (or plastic) in your computer monitor and giving it a body means bowing down to the laws of physics, and more importantly, the craft of machine making. You have to understand every step the machine will take to assemble your sculpture and how your 3D form either enables or works against this process. For example, I found that trying to print such a complex shape that extruded in defiance of gravity at right angles required support material to keep the radiating spikes of volume from collapsing, but trying to remove all of them meant sitting for hours picking away at plastic scabs and leaving the final form with a rough, gritty finish.
What I needed was a method for printing a complex, free-standing spiral shape without any support materials. The forums at http://reddit.com/3Dprinting were a great resource because I found different test videos designed to test the angle at which the ribbons of hot plastic that make up each solid print would start collapsing under their own weight. I noticed that in videos of rounded, spiral shapes, that angle seemed quite steep, possibly due to having more of the surface area of the material in direct contact with itself in a rounded form than in an angular, rectangular form.

Take notice that until such time as you cease all logging and sourcing in the contested traditional territories of Grassy Narrows First Nation, or as long as there is community opposition to your operation in Asubpeeschoseewagong Netum Anishinaabek traditional territory (Grassy Narrows First Nation), we will be calling for a complete boycott of all Weyerhaueser products.
According to the Whiskey Jack Forest Management Plan, 324,000 cubic meters of poplar and birch is allocated from the Whiskey Jack Forest Management Unit each year to supply the Weyerhaeuser Timberstrand/Trus Joist Kenora mill. This is 42 percent of the total allocated timber harvest from the Whiskey Jack and a full 50 percent of the wood supply for the mill.
Your withdrawal from this territory will be a significant step in preserving what remains of the intact forest which is crucial to the Anishinaabe way of life, estimated to be only 30 percent of what it was before mismanagement by logging companies.
Grassy Narrows is trying to rebuild an economy and way of life that have been devastated by decades of severe environmental contamination and destruction. The people of Grassy Narrows have already made it clear that multinational logging companies like Weyerhaeuser are incompatible with their vision for the preservation and use of their territory.
We call on you to join forest products companies; Boise, Abitibowater, Domtar and Ainsworth, who have already agreed not to source conflict wood from Grassy Narrows territory.

From a country with the world’s largest population, Guo Pei is China’s only haute couture designer, with one of her pieces taking 50,000 painstaking hours to complete. Her 500 workers toil away with age-old embroidery techniques; all pieces, in the tradition of haute couture, are hand-made. And impossible to wear. “The piece Rihanna wore weighs 50lbs” Guo Pei giggles. It gives her a thrill to create these extraordinary works that she believes honour the female form but also challenge it, as the wearer teeters on Guo Pei’s-designed towering shoes.
Yellow is Forbidden is an unprecedented story exploring the history of Guo Pei's upbringing during China’s Cultural Revolution, born into a world of uniforms, propaganda films, and no access to the world beyond the limited arts, literature and news. Ultimately, this uplifting documentary takes the viewer inside the world where Guo Pei creates magic.

If the lowest bid is not selected, a strong reason has to be demonstrated as to why it was not (i. turnaround time, quality of sample products provided). As the Show literally has thousands of people handling its purchases, it is believable when Show officials hear that some vendors find it hard to determine how to submit bids or learn about upcoming projects. The Show is committed to improving that process. After this Show is complete, officials will review the process to see what improvements can be made (vendor seminars, Web site submission of information, etc.

1. Provide reasonable suggestions for production line of autoclave of users to yield the gratest efficiency of equipments.
2. Freely direct position, installation, debugging, and on-site training to use normally, and direct users to use autoclave safely, high efficiently, and conveniently.
1. Aerated Autoclaved concrete block (light block ) is the light and porous building material. It has light ,keeping temperature , Environmental protection,can't burn and other advantages.it has a wide prospect of market.it is the main building material in the future. it can be made into many kinds of bricks(for example:600×200×100,80×80×180,240×115×53,600×200×125),they could be used industry building and common building.they are more and more popular in the world.in the future,they will replace the Clay brick completely.
2. Areated concrete common conception.Common concrete density is usually 1600-2400kg/m3,but areated concrete are 500kg/m3,600kg/m3,700kg/m3.It has not the big grain,main use silicon material (for example:flyash,sand,stone dust and others ),through making the material small for example sand,they can be used directly if has enough degree of small (for example fly ash.Mixing calcium material lime, cement water to a special slop,then add the aluminum dust and the additive.Make the aluminum dust and the special slop have a Chemical reflect.then produce Hydrogen to make the concrete slop to expanding or swell,foam.Next,put them into the curing room to concreting cutting steaming curing,last,there will bacome the light brick,the porous rate is 70-80%.
It has highest thermal rating in the industry….R30! Thus provides well insulated interiors, keeping out warm air in summer and cold air in winters.AAC reduces Air conditioning cost by 30%.
Earthquake forces on structure are proportional to the weight of the building, hence AAC shows excellent resistant to earthquake forces. Regions of high seismic activity like Japan exclusively use AAC. It has been proven to withstand wind loads of category 5 tropical storms.
Use of thinner blocks (6" instead of 9" exterior walls) because of its excellent water barrier & insulation properties leads to an increase in floor space area between 3-5%.
Being lightweight AAC drastically reduces the dead weight of building, resulting into reduction in steel (up to 27%) and cement (up to 20%) structural cost saving.Being 8 times the size of a clay brick, AAC wall construction involves 1/3 the joints, thus an overall mortar saving up to 66%.
Its automatic manufacturing process gives AAC an exceptional dimensional accuracy & smooth surfaces, eliminating need of three-coat plaster walls and allows for a final 6 mm skim coat (putty/POP).
Best in class fire rating of 4 hours. The melting point of AAC is over 1600 ºc, more than twice the typical temperature in a building fire of 650 ºc.
Autoclave is key equipment which has a widely application in building material factory to autoclaved cure different kinds of building materials. It is also used in areas of chemical, textile, wood, Glass, Brick, metallurgy, Rubber, military industry. Convenient operation, security and reliable are its advantages.
Autoclave belongs to pressure vessel which has explosion risk. According to the supervision regulation on safety technology for pressure vessel on divide standard of pressure vessel, the product is part of first and second class pressure vessel.

When we transform our thinking, our future presents us with something altogether more compelling!: Who is Listening?
Our perceptions form our view of the world through the quality of our relationship with our thoughts. All personal change, optimal performance, mastery and learning begin and end there!
Of course we all recognise this thought provoking quote – and one of the thoughts that sprang up for me today was to do with our Internal Dialogue.
Now in this regard I’m not talking about what some refer to as our Conscious – Unconscious Dialogue. I’m really referring to what is perhaps colloquially known as Self Talk.
A dialogue essentially involves two or more ‘voices’ shall we say. It is a conversation, a discussion, an exchange of thoughts and ideas expressed in words. Within the same linguistic stable there is monologue – where, as we understand it, there is only one voice.
Children, from around the age of two, can be observed talking to themselves - particularly when at play. Starting first with the work of psychologists Jean Piaget* and Lev Vygotsky*, there have been extensive observed studies and researches concerning the emergence of self talk or ‘private speech’ in children.
By the time we are 7, say, we have become very well practised in the art of self talk – and by that age this facility has also become much more internalised. It seems that through constant daily usage and practice we have bonded together our thinking with our self talk, so much so that they are barely discernible and appear to be one and the same.
Of course, for there to be a dialogue there has to be two or more voices, and here I would describe our internal dialogue as having an active voice and a passive voice. Thus far I have explored the emergence and use of the active voice – yet, what of the passive voice?
Now – simply in terms of labelling at this point, I would describe the passive voice as being that of the Self Listener.
Once we have the facility to listen, we develop our facility to Self Listen. And part of that development is this - as we internalise our self talk so we also internalise our Self Listening.
By the stage we are merging our thinking with our Self Talk, we are ‘hearing’ our thinking with our Self Listening.
Through our developing cognisance and the vehicle of language, we are able to recognise and understand our thoughts. We now have a fully developed Internal Dialogue – and we have a complete understanding of who we are at any given moment.
And it is quite easy to see how we can fully accept the premise behind Rene Descartes’ famous quote Cogito Ergo Sum: I think therefore I am.
On a purely sensual level, every sound we hear in every moment of time makes up a vast array of incoming auditory data. The same applies to all other sensual data as well.
We have AND develop a mental facility to filter that data in such a way that our processing capacity is not overwhelmed. It is a facility that runs at both an unconscious (involuntary) level as well as a conscious one. It is a function that takes place within the reticular activating system (RAS) and is located in the brain stem adjacent to the Thalamus.
Now, one of the amazing functions of the brain is the facility to take internally created images, sounds, feelings and other sensory data – and to treat them as if they were real. The internally sourced data passes through the sensory gateways (or filter) in the same way as externally sourced data. Our imagination, our dreams, visualisations etc are all formed of internally sourced data – yet they are presented to our perceptive apparatus as being as real as the external experience.
So if we examine our Self Listening, we can easily understand how our thoughts, the words from that nagging little voice in our head, can seem as real as if they were on “the outside.”
Now one of the functions of the RAS is that we can play a conscious part in directing the filtering process. We are, therefore, not totally at the mercy of whatever data is coming in – both from outside and, more to the point here, from the inside. We CAN moderate what we pay attention to in terms of our Self Listening.
The Judge evaluates incoming data in terms of how to respond. At the involuntary or unconscious level, this takes the form of responses to stimuli – we respond to touching something hot, we jump in response to a loud bang, we shield our eyes in response to a blinding light, and we recoil in response to a vile smell or a sharp, acidic taste.
At the conscious level we respond in a whole variety of ways, PLUS we add in markers which we label EMOTIONS. The emotions make each experience more vivid. The emotions get filed away in memory along with the data that makes up the experience, and the emotional markers enable quick and easy recollection of the experience. As we know, whenever we remember something with a vivid emotional marker, the entire experience of data + emotion comes flooding back.
It is The Judge in us that decides not only what we respond to, but also what kind of emotional markers are going to be used. At the conscious level, The Judge makes decisions based upon our beliefs and values and also our sense of self, or what we assume as being our sense of Identity.
And when it comes to our Self Listening we find The Judge is also there, evaluating what is being said in our Self Talk.
When we are critical of ourselves, or self-demeaning, or verbally beating ourselves up, The Judge then becomes the Self Talker. If we are driven to self-harming, then our behaviour is a response to the Self Talk of The Judge.
Now if we want to make a change in some part of our lives in terms of the way we behave, or the way we respond, or the way we perceive things – then there are a number of ways we can do this. However, each and every one of us has a unique make-up – so the best ways of making changes that would work for me are not necessarily the best ways for you.
Well, we know that if we ask our family, friends or indeed even someone in the street, then the reply we’d get would probably start like this:
However when a client comes to see me then this kind of response is never going to get them very far! What I need is to get a picture of the Self Talker, the Self Listener, The Data and The Judge. We’ll have a conversation and I’ll ask some questions to enable me to get a handle on their Thinking and their view of how the World works – remembering of course that it is only THEIR World. I’ll also get a really good view of their expressive language, both verbal and non-verbal, for their language is the vehicle that conveys the workings, meanings and purpose of THEIR World.
In order to make some meaningful changes, my client knows that The Data is not completely controllable. Life and the World will always throw things in our paths from a deep pile carpet to a rocky road. He can change some of his Beliefs and Values and get a different perception of his sense of Identity –this will alter how The Data is filtered, and will also adapt the response criteria for The Judge. He can moderate his Self Talk – which is his Thinking – and change his perception of HIS World that way.
If my client listens to himself, pays attention, then the only route left open to him is all the remedies I’ve just mentioned – this is what I would call the “fire-fighting” approach.
He is there – in his own metaphorical forest – and as the trees of Self Talk regularly fall he will hear them, judge them, process them and respond to them. The trees will keep falling, rather like the weather just keeps on coming.
On the other hand, if as a Self Listener he is not in the forest, then the trees will fall in perceptive silence. His thoughts will rise up and fall away, form as clouds and then evaporate. There will be much less ‘noise and clamour’ going on, there’ll be a lot more perceptive clarity. He will, to coin a phrase, start to “see the wood for the trees.”
Life and the World will still present data to him, and his attention - and he can still manage his attention to deal with matters pertaining to all THAT data.
In terms of the Internal Dialogue however, his Self Listening has changed. With less or no data coming in from Self Talk, immediately the role of The Judge has changed too.
There’s a simplicity to changing the nature of our Self Listening that is woven into the fabric of how we manage our attention.
When we are attending to something we allocate to it a portion of our total awareness. The more attention we give – the greater proportion is dedicated to that something. Meanwhile, we are paying less attention to other things. This allocation of attentive “bandwidth” is a very simple equation – rather like “Task Manager” in a computer’s operating system software.
Now the moment we become really absorbed in one thing, the amount of bandwidth that is allocated to “other things” becomes very much diminished. When we’re really in The Zone or a Flow State, for instance, then we pay no attention at all to “other things.” Time slows down or seems to be suspended, and our Ego – our sense of Self – is nowhere to be found. As part of that sense of Self, our Self Talk and Self Listening are not in evidence, and neither is The Judge. The external data is still streaming in and being processed, but all the internal clutter has gone.
Self Listening, along with other ego-oriented processes, takes attentive bandwidth. If we are really worried about something then we find it extremely difficult to do anything else. We describe this as “I can’t get my head around it. I had other things on my mind. My head was in another place.”
Sound familiar? It’s because we’ve allocated so much bandwidth to the worrying and not enough to what we were actually doing.
Take a look at the people you know who seem very calm, grounded, unflappable, are good at what they do yet always seem to have time for others. Consider how it is they manage to do so much, so well – without getting burnt out, worn out or stressed out.
Maybe they were born with it, maybe they’re on something, or maybe they just stopped listening to their Self Talk?
Next time you are worried or dogged by an overload of thoughts hold your tongue for about 30 seconds. Or hold out your forefinger and try balancing a pencil on it.
Or firmly grip a coin between your thumb and forefinger, stand up and hold it out in front of you as you stack all those errant thoughts onto it. Feel the coin getting heavier – and when you are ready and cannot hold it any more, then just let it go.

However, while bidding $1,000 on every keyword and ranking #1 for every relevant search sounds nice in theory, most businesses have to play a balancing game between ranking higher and paying too much for clicks. After all, if it costs $17.56 to rank in position #1, but you can only afford to pay $5.00 per click, bidding $1,000 on a keyword to guarantee yourself the #1 position would be a great way to bid yourself out of business.
Knowing which pages visitors go to directly gives you an opportunity to design those pages so they accurately and quickly address visitors' needs. For example, if you sell clothing and your new-arrivals page is a popular destination, you want to be sure the content is always fresh, and you want to provide easy access to the full department represented by each new item. Who wants to see the same items week after week on a page that is supposed to represent the cutting edge of your inventory? And if you're featuring a new raincoat or bathing suit, you want to let visitors also easily see your whole line of raincoats or bathing suits."
But search ranking is competitive, so naturally, it’s not easy to claim that top spot in organic search. That’s why many marketers and website owners pay to play, and why so many people choose the Pay Per Click (PPC) route. It’s fast. It’s effective. It’s high-visibility for your business. The caveat? You stop paying, and your visibility goes **POOF**.
In 2014, Cisco stated that video made 64% of all internet traffic. In 2015, Searchmetrics was releasing a white paper quoting that 55% of all keyword searches in the U.S. return at least one video blended into Google’s web search results and that 8 out 10 of those videos belonged to YouTube. And in 2016, Cisco was also sharing that online videos will account for more than 80% of all consumer internet traffic by 2020.
Website owners recognized the value of a high ranking and visibility in search engine results,[6] creating an opportunity for both white hat and black hat SEO practitioners. According to industry analyst Danny Sullivan, the phrase "search engine optimization" probably came into use in 1997. Sullivan credits Bruce Clay as one of the first people to popularize the term.[7] On May 2, 2007,[8] Jason Gambert attempted to trademark the term SEO by convincing the Trademark Office in Arizona[9] that SEO is a "process" involving manipulation of keywords and not a "marketing service."
Billions of people search the web every day. Search engine marketing (SEM for short) is how you can get your ads in front of these future customers where it counts: in premium spots on the first page of search results. You set your own budget and are charged only when your ad is clicked. This makes SEM an affordable way to reach more customers for businesses of all sizes — including yours.

Using this data can help you identify additional “buyer” keywords to target and what keywords to stop targeting. Keyword research, content marketing, and link building are things that you need to constantly be doing, even when you reach the top of the search rankings. Many businesses think that they can slow down these efforts once they reach the top, but easing up on your SEO strategy will see your competition take over the top position if you are not continually improving your search engine optimization effort.
Getting seen by people who are interested in your niche or brand helps you boost your brand’s visibility. Which indirectly affects the amount of business you get. Even if a lot of people are not immediately clicking on your ads, they may search for your product in the future. Either way, the paid ads will help immensely in terms of getting in front of your target audience and filtering out anyone who is not a part of it.
Additionally, there are many situations where PPC (a component of SEM) makes more sense than SEO. For example, if you are first launching a site and you want immediate visibility, it is a good idea to create a PPC campaign because it takes less time than SEO, but it would be unwise to strictly work with PPC and not even touch search engine optimization.
Organic content marketing is a potential boon for your business, as it involves providing the material that online users are looking for. But it’s a slow process that involves a long-term commitment to producing high-quality material while constantly interacting with customers through various online platforms. It isn’t enough to post a few articles a month. If you want to benefit from potentially over three times as much traffic, you need to publish at least 16 articles a month. If you handle your campaign in the right manner, there’s a chance to see sustainable growth in your brand and a deeper level of engagement with your customers. But this resource-intensive approach may require that you outsource work to stay relevant and get the results you need.
Back end tools, including Web analytic tools and HTML validators, provide data on a website and its visitors and allow the success of a website to be measured. They range from simple traffic counters to tools that work with log files and to more sophisticated tools that are based on page tagging (putting JavaScript or an image on a page to track actions). These tools can deliver conversion-related information. There are three major tools used by EBSCO: (a) log file analyzing tool: WebTrends by NetiQ; (b) tag-based analytic tool: WebSideStory's Hitbox; and (c) transaction-based tool: TeaLeaf RealiTea. Validators check the invisible parts of websites, highlighting potential problems and many usability issues and ensuring websites meet W3C code standards. Try to use more than one HTML validator or spider simulator because each one tests, highlights, and reports on slightly different aspects of your website.
Great topic Rand! I have found that being well-versed in PPC and Content Marketing have not only helped my expertise grow as an SEO, but are also great options to fall back on when offering solutions to clients, depending on the SEO opportunity available. It will be interesting to see if Organic Search Traffic will continue to drop or bounce back overall though. Solids tips and insight, and glad to see you back for a WBF!
Optimize for opt-ins. Make sure you lead to something more than your content. What this means is that when people read your content, they must know where to go next. This may come in the form of a call to action or your offering of additional content, appearing perhaps as a PDF. Growing organic traffic is important, but it doesn’t matter if you are not converting those viewer into leads. Your business doesn’t pay its bills using raw traffic.
Now, it is not that these sites are not interested in Google users. In fact, they have hired us to help them increase their share. However, they are getting so much traffic from sites like Facebook that it seems there is less urgency about attracting this traffic and less willingness to change the site to meet organic standards. Not long ago, sites would urgently and unquestioningly abide by Google’s standards to court that traffic.

There is a spot in the French Quarter that you won’t find on any tourist map. No hotel concierge recommendation brings people here. This place is on the corner of Chartres and Iberville - north of the river and just south of the Acme Oyster Bar next to a couple of disgusting looking strip joints - in a rather seedy side of the Quarter. But despite an entrance that without knowledge seems most uninviting, the Jimani provides a can’t-miss slice of the New Orleans drinking scene.

George Gillespie was a Scottish theologian. Gillespie was born at Kirkcaldy, where his father, John Gillespie, was parish minister.
He studied at St. Andrews University as a “presbytery bursar”. On graduating he became domestic chaplain to John Gordon, 1st Viscount Kenmure (d. 1634), and afterwards to John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. His conscience did not permit him to accept the episcopal ordination, which was at that time an indispensable condition of induction to a parish in Scotland.

Tomorrow morning…or more accurately in a few hours, I’ll wake up and drive over to Ed Cash’s studio and for the 5th time begin recording a collection of songs that I have the privilege of playing around the country and now around this globe. The wonder of that is not remotely lost on me.
These are songs that elevate our perception of God, as He could not be lifted any higher than He is already.
The AB Community has many heroes and because we practice inclusion not separation from the greats with our accomplishments, The Albinism Alliance Group salutes individuals making a difference by following their dreams.

“And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.”
We know the story well, of the little businessman from Jericho, Zacchaeus. One day when Jesus was walking through his city, Zacchaeus wanted a particularly good view of the man causing all the stir in his town and country. Wanting to stay out of the line of site and get above the crowds, he climbed up in the Sycamore tree in the direction the crowd was going.
Perhaps Jesus just happened to glance up in the tree, or else something drew Him to look up. But Zacchaeus caught the attention of Jesus, and there was something supposed to happen that Zacchaeus could never have avoided. Zacchaeus thought he was there that day to get a look at this man, but Jesus had other plans.
Jesus can see right through the leaves of any Sycamore tree you are hiding behind. That day, Zacchaeus met someone that completely changed his life. Christ can completely change your life. He will do it just the same today as He did for Zacchaeus. Perhaps you have already encountered Him, and you need to become reaquainted with Him. He knows just where you are sitting.
There He was, the Word of God, manifested to this Zacchaeus. Down out of the tree he come, quickly, to repent. Zacchaeus, businessman here tonight, remember, you cannot hide under fig leaves. He knows just exactly where you're setting. He knows you. He knows who you are. He knows your name. He knows why you're here. He knows all about it. That's right. And we who have met Him, and know Him, and become His disciples, we know what He is and what He does for the people. We know that He remains the same. Zacchaeus come down, in a penitent attitude. He said, "If… Lord, if I have cheated any man, I'll pay it back. I'll take my money; I'll give to the poor." See, he had already found that Pearl of great price. He had found something that was more than his business. He had found something, that Something. And all men tries to achieve something. But if you lose Eternal Life, what all your achievement done for you? The greatest treasure that a man can find is to find release.
With φ an inner function and $M_{φ}$ the multiplication operator on a given Hardy space it is known that for any given function f in the Hardy space we may use the Wold decomposition to obtain a factorization of the given f (not the Riesz factorization). This new factorization has been shown to be useful in the study of commutants of Toeplitz operators.
We study the smoothness of each factor of this factorization. We show in some cases that the factors lie in the same Hardy space (or smoothness class) as the given function f. We also construct an example to show that there are bounded, holomorphic functions which have factors that are not in a given Hardy p-space. Many of our results are produced by studying a natural class of positive measures associated to the given inner function.

It can accomplish a big aboriginal consequence on visitors and be active in allowance you feel apple-pie and refreshed.

“Whether you’re accepting accessible to advertise your home or planning to break for years, a simple ablution brace every few years makes sense. Trends in colors and accouterments change, so accomplishing some quick updates keeps things adorable modern,” says Tolles.

If you like to accumulate added towels and items out of the closet, use appealing baskets or catchall containers that are adorable back on display.”
Consider replacing your bore and battery faucets, anhydrate bar and chiffonier knobs or pulls, and accept a constant new accomplishment (brushed assumption and white are currently hot). “These accomplish a apparent amend to a ablution and are almost aboveboard to about-face out. Try to aces the aforementioned style, but in an adapted archetypal or new finish,” says Greene, who addendum that some manufacturers alike accept analogous accouterments kits.
“The appropriate bulk of lighting is important to advice brighten claimed admonishment and architecture application, and newer ablaze accessories will amend the room’s look,” says Greene. Replace over-the-mirror lighting, fluorescents and old accessories with sconces, pendants and accessories even to the bank that accord with your added hardware.
“Try a admirable axis mirror instead of the accepted frameless mirror alert to the wall, which will instantly dress up your ablution in a actual archetypal fashion,” Tolles says.
Additionally, try charwoman the adhesive amid your tiles, abacus new blind art and countertop adornment to the room, and installing a new battery blind and toilet seat.
Be able to appoint the pros for a cogent advance if your ablution has been through 10 to 15 years of abrasion and tear, if your accouterments is giving you problems or if you apprehension arresting baptize accident or absurd tiles, suggests Christian Lacroix, buyer of Handyman Connection in McKinney, Texas.
“The acceptable account is that do-it-yourself makeovers can absolutely brace the allowance for actual basal amount and are usually bare alone every three to bristles years,” Lacroix says.

Traveling is innerwork. In a sense, you have to jump into the void. You don�t know what you might encounter. It�s an adventure of self-reliance and faith. An adventure for the soul. Sometimes you find horror, other times wonder, a fresh look, renewal. Paradigms for digestion.�
We deviated from our travel schedule one afternoon in Flagstaff by driving to the Grand Canyon for sunset. Only 45 minutes away. Perfect.
The setting sun seemed to melt tension; the golden light on the flat scrubland was a tonic. Destination on the horizon, two scouts looking west, conversation light. We pulled into the park just at sunset. A snowless winter�s eve, heading for the east rim, the closest side to us.We parked and quickly sped to the canyon rim. As I neared the edge, I was struck suddenly by a force, an emotion that overwhelmed me. Unprepared, I fell to my knees. My eyes flooded and I began to cry, dumbstruck by the beauty, the magnificence, the majesty.� Purple, blue, red, orange striations of age and depth. I was so humbled and yet ennobled that I could feel so deeply, be so humble in front of this divine canyon, this Grand Canyon. There was a presence. Silent, womb-like, holding the wisdom of the age. Numinous, she was there in front of me.

White hat SEO is the safest and most recommended (at least by us) way to go about your search engine optimization practices. These are the safest search engine approved ways of getting to the top of the rankings. Labeling your site properly, making it accessible, creating good webpage design and having a lot of content can be a great and organic boost to becoming an authority on a subject. In creating your content in natural and approved ways, you are ensuring that your site will stick around and not be banned for a long time.
Black hat SEO is the opposite. These are all the things you can do to try and fool the search engines. A black hatter takes what he knows about the search engine algorithms and tries to utilize various effects to work their site to the top. A black hatter could probably get an online shoe store to pass Nike and Reebok for the top spots...for maybe four hours. Some do it quite well but when they get caught, POOF goes the site never to be seen in the results on that engine again.
Spinning- having a script that gives you a ton of different looking content from a few re-arrangeable sentences
Spamming- sending scripts to blog posts and filling them up with links trying to get link juice back to the original site
Gray hat SEO involves a mixture of the two. Someone in the gray will be using mostly white hat techniques while incorporating small amounts of black hat that the search engines might not penalize and usually don't ban for. For example, a site using a large amount of keywords on a page might make it read a little unnatural. This could be considered to have a high keyword density but not black hat keyword stuffing. This gray hat technique will probably get you higher in the ranks without the worry of a ban. But, you get a human viewer from Google on a bad day could result in a penalty for the site.
Some cloaking conditions may be a little more on the gray area, too. This is when you have a site dedicated to a lot of Flash or images and you are using keywords to describe what is in the flash so you can rank higher (without having too much text on your screen). Some cloaking is starting to be allowed for making mobile searching easier for phones and PDAs

There’s nothing quite like the feeling of driving the perfect truck. But as most truck owners can tell you, the perfect truck doesn’t just roll off the assembly line and onto the lot. The perfect truck often requires some attention and care from truck owners just like you, and that means truck accessories and modifications. Even if you love installing accessories and new parts yourself, you still have to buy them first, and especially if you’re looking for anything custom or just a little unusual, you may have a hard time zipping into your local store and picking something up

No matter how badly things go in Afghanistan, two arguments emerge: the moral need to defeat the Taliban and the security threat that would emerge if the Taliban once again allowed Al-Qaeda to operate in the Afghan mountains.
I have discussed the problem with the moral argument before- as long as we support the corrupt Karzai government, we have no moral standing among the Afghani people. In a fascinating Washington Post op-ed, however, former CIA Deputy Chief for Counter Terrorism Paul Pillar argues that allowing Al Qaeda a safe haven in Afghanistan is not as big a security threat as most people suggest.
Pillar points out, "The preparations most important to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks took place not in training camps in Afghanistan but, rather, in apartments in Germany, hotel rooms in Spain and flight schools in the United States. " We all ridiculed these monkey bar type videos when they came out. But now, Obama is essentially arguing that the ability to have these monkey bars warrants our continued occupation of the country.
It is unclear that the Taliban are interested in allowing Al-Qaeda to resurface- after all, incurring the wrath of the world is not in their self interest either. But Pillar asks the most important question yet- why does it matter that Al Qaeda can have a few caves in Afghanistan, rather than some other impoverished Central Asian, Middle-Eastern or African backwater?

In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, the People’s Republic of China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system. Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.

My little brother have been upsetting about survival single player (normal) since he can only survive against zombie and melee attacking mobs but died because of ranged mobs such as Skeleton. That gave me an idea: what if we can choose what kind of mobs we wanted to appear in Survival Single Player? We could choose for pigs, rabbits, cows, sheeps, spiders, zombies, skeleton, witch, enderman,... to appear or not appearing in the game. It would be Survival Optional.
yeah, for some unknown reason, the mobs duplicate themselves over time, causing extreme levels of lag that can bring you down to 1-0 FPS eventually. Thankfully this mob duplication glitch isn't available in Survival Multiplayer.

The Imaginary Journal of Poetic Economics: Private sector and long term responsibility for scholarly work? Nonsense!
In a recent letter opposing the U.S. Federal Research Public Access Act (FRPAA), Martin Frank writes: "Copyright is essential to protecting these works and to preserving incentives for the private sector to continue to invest in peer review, editing, publishing, and maintaining the electronic record of vetted scientific journal articles".
One issue with this sentence that I would like to highlight, for now: it is nonsense to suggest that the private sector has a meaningful role in long-term maintenance of scholarly articles.
A private sector publisher is completely within its rights to cease to exist, or change business operations, at any time. The public has no rights to ask a private sector entity to undertake a responsibility with an infinite time span. Has anyone asked publishers to undertake this role? If so, what were they thinking? This is not the traditional role of publishers, but rather the traditional role of libraries as a memory institution.
One of the benefits of the National Institutes of Health's Public Access Policy is that it moves the traditional role of the U.S. National Library of Medicine in preserving the medical research literature into the internet age, as well as sharing the burden globally through the developing PubMedCentral International network (with the UK and Canada up and running already). Academic libraries everywhere are busy ensuring the preservation of electronic collections, just as they have preserved print collections in the past (and present, of course).
For the latest on my research into the economics of transitioning scholarly works to open access, please see my research blog Sustaining the Knowledge Commons.

These are all of Zubairi's works that remain on the Poetry Pages. You can delete all of the original table of contents and create a new one. If you want to try to "organize" the poems according to the topics Z has originally set out you may try to do that, but it will be a tedious task. I'd be happy just to have a topic link list like you've been creating, but use your own judgment here. I think this one is going to take you at least three days...
I have tried to contact a radio station in Uganda that published an article mentioning Zubairi "http://radiokatwe.com/baruhazawasomi080723.htm", thanks to some great sleuthing by Gordy. I am hopeful that they will respond and I am most pleased that we have these works by him we knew as ZAN.
i also sent them an email but have not yet heard back, i also found a link to "the alumni" at the college he worked at and sent them an email as well...
Beside reading alot of the poems he posted here,.....most of them describing the trials and tribulations of living in Africa,.... and his enmity toward European intrusions there,.....Zan and I had discussed via PM's the commonalities between British
policies in Ireland,.... and Africa. I'm sorry he's no longer with us,..... but as with any good poet,...his words will germinate
in the minds of his people,... and one day cause the changes he so desparetly wanted. Rest in peace Zan.

The form factor set by Microsoft’s Surface Book is probably one of the best approaches to a convertible laptop. Why? Simplicity: the screen detaches from the body to become a tablet, then can… Read More

I have heard carp called “rabbits of the river”. I have heard they are bottom feeders. That they stir up the mud and disturb the habitat of our native fish. ‘Tis said there are too many in the River Murray. I have even caught a few and heaved them onto the river bank thinking I was making a small contribution to the local ecology. But I was unprepared for the sight that greeted me on a recent Thursday when I strolled down to the water’s edge.
I have been visiting Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island in particular for over forty years and rarely has the muddy bottom been visible like it is now. Where there is normally a meter or so of water, now there are several meters of flat gray mud along the shore line.
However, on Thursday the wind changed direction, pushing the water back creating a shallow covering a few centimeters deep. Here a dozen carp were feeding, plowing their fat lips through the mud. Most of them over forty centimeters long. Their sagging, unsupported fins and glistening scaly backs breaking the water surface. I ran for my camera.
Carp feed by sucking in the mud and filtering out the invertebrates and a little of the plant matterwhich they prefer. Here they were gorging themselves seemingly without fear of predators. Not a pelican within a hundred meters. “Are the pelican’s over fed?” I wondered.
On Friday when the waters retreated again, the evidence of their activities was exposed. If I had not been there to witness their foraging I would have been mystified at these strange thick squiggles in the mud. Here is the evidence of what a few carp can do in just a short time to disturb the riverbed.
At first I thought the Carp were gone, but as I scanned along the river I could see a several Carp breaking the surface in the distance. I had regretted not taking the opportunity to catch a few, for the benefit of the river as it were. I then tried, but the line was old and easily broke. I left frustrated but certainly intrigued by what our sadly depleted river had revealed.

You all know I have no problem working all night, and after all the apologies, I assured Anastasia it wasnt a problem, and we worked till midnight, with Anastasia emerging as another early candidate for Miss Bald USA. At a minimum, she should win Miss Wisconsin and Miss Congeniality, but probably not Miss Punctuality. Is Anastasia the BEST BALD CHICK EVER? Shes got my vote, and Im guessing she will win a lot of votes from our community!! Anastasias hair is long, silky Pantene hair, and its all coming off tonight!! Her figure is Miss America PERFECT, and soon she will be shaved to silky smooth perfection!! A GODDESS AMONG WOMEN!! What a way to celebrate the Fourth of July!! She loves her new haircut, and cant wait to show off her new BALD BEAUTY to her friends!! UPDATE ON THE NEW BETA PLAYER- 1,900 VIDEOS NOW SHOWING.

We plan to move over 500 videos from Channel 1, which currently contains 747 videos, to Channels 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to speed up loading. Channels 2, 3 and 4 now have 100-200 videos each with good loading speeds. Current plans call for Channel 10 to be used for Live Haircut Broadcasts. BIG SAVINGS ON ONE YEAR AND TWO YEAR SUBSCRIPTIONS, and the one month subscription of $33 is STILL CHEAP, so please help us if you can!! Zoey smiled as the clippers ran down the middle- later saying that was "the best part!" In a FIRST EVER, Zoey brought her own razor, and asked to be shaved with it. We had no problem with that, using her 5 blade razor!! Tune in tomorrow, same Bat Time, same Bat Channel. BRAVE BRUNETTE BOMBSHELL BECOMES BALD BEAUTY.

NOW SHOWING on the sub site. QUEEN DANIELLE III- LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!!
The cameras observe the same field of viev of 10x10 arcmin thanks to a dichroic placed before telescope focal plane. The observations are carried out following the programmed filter list for each of the two arms.
In the general design of the Nasmyth focus (above) we show the position of the two cameras: after the interface (in green) where the dichroic and the dither plate (which allows the infrared images to be shifted for sky subctraction) are located, REMIR (in red) is aligned with the optical axis, while ROS2 (in blue) is placed at 90 degrees after the dichroic reflection.
The two cameras have almost the same field of view, a square of 10x10 arcmin and co-centered by means of the orientable dichroic. Nevertheless, due to mechanical constraints we do not have exactly the same field center in the two cameras and the center of mechanic rotation around the Nasmyth rotator is not in the center of the fields. Moreover the rotating, tilted plate, which allows a proper infrared sky determination and automatic image reduction, shifts the rotation center (and the field of view) of Remir images a but more, and different in each tilted plate orientation.
The figure below shows the center of rotation of the frame by letting the rotator move during exposition. You see the Ross image with the cross at its center of rotation and the Remir images with a circle in their centers of rotation. The positions of the four infrared centers lye along a circular path due to dither plate movement. The centers and circular path are reported in every images of this comparison.
The mechanical redesign of the REM/Ross interface due this year will overcome these off centering problems.

Three Inconvenient complications: on the heterogeneities of madness and their relationship to disability
Thirteen UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: out of the frying pan into the fire? Mental health service users and survivors aligning with the disability movement
Fifteen Disabilities, colonisation and globalisation: how the very possibility of a disability identity was compromised for the ‘insane’ in India
Sixteen Neurodiversity: bridging the gap between the disabled people’s movement and the mental health system survivors’ movement?
This chapter is a transcript of an interview with Tina Minkowitz, who represented the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry in the drafting and negotiation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The chapter explains why members of the mental health user/survivor movement claimed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a necessary vehicle for advocating for their human rights. The terms ‘psychosocial (or psychiatric) disability’ and the reason for its adoption in the US context, is discussed. The chapter responds in detail to the concern that abolishing specific mental health legislation might lead to the criminalisation and/or neglect of people with mental health problems, arguing that criminal behaviour needs to be dealt with under criminal law and advocates for the transformation of the criminal justice system.
Keywords: disability, human rights, legislation, criminalisation, neglect, psychosocial disability, psychiatric disability, survivors

If you accept your function in the world of time as one of healing, you will emphasize only the aspect of time in which healing can occur.
Healing cannot be accomplished in the past. It must be accomplished in the present to release the future.
But if you interpret your function as destruction, you will lose sight of the present and hold on to the past to ensure a destructive future.
1. I have said you have but two emotions, love and fear. One is changeless but continually exchanged, being offered by the eternal to the eternal.
In this exchange it is extended, for it increases as it is given. The other has many forms, for the content of individual illusions differs greatly.
Yet they have one thing in common; they are all insane. They are made of sights that are not seen, and sounds that are not heard.
They make up a private world that cannot be shared. For they are meaningful only to their maker, and so they have no meaning at all.
Due to the strict prohibitions against proselytizing to Muslims, Christian missionaries in Islamic lands focused their efforts on Jews (and also on indigenous Christians in some areas). Aside from some briefs spurts in earlier eras, Christian missionary activity was mostly a phenomenon of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A notable exception took place in the decades following the expulsions from Spain and Portugal in the late fifteenth century, when Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries sought to convert the refugees in Morocco and to bring back conversos who were flee…

The Story of Leicester traces the evolution of this remarkable city. When the Romans arrived they developed an existing settlement into Ratae, an administrative capital. During the Tudor, Stuart and Georgian periods the town lost status, but remained an important market town. Industrialisation and population growth radically changed Leicester during Victorian times and it became prosperous, its economy underpinned by the hosiery, boot and shoe and engineering industries - the basis of modern Leicester. This popular history brings the story of the city up to date and provides new insights that will delight both residents and visitors.

The teenage son of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is competing in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Romania, where he has asked to be treated like any normal student, an education official said Tuesday.
Hafez al-Assad, 16, is one of 615 students participating in the annual competition, which this year is being held in the central town of Cluj-Napoca until Saturday.
He already took part in last year’s competition in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, where he finished in 528th place out of a total of 615.
“He wants to be treated like a normal student and he acts like one. He checked into a hotel alongside students from 18 countries”, Valentin Cuibus, head of the town’s schools inspectorate, told AFP.
Romania is one of the few European countries that still has an embassy in Syria, which has been battered by more than seven years of conflict that has left more than 350,000 people dead, millions more displaced and the country in ruins.
Romania is a popular destination for Syrian students, with thousands graduating from its universities in the last two years. (AFP)

It's been another busy season at Chesterland North, with a full competition schedule for Bruce Sr., the placement of several young sales horses into new homes and a new string of young talented home breds in work!
Bruce made good work of this season with his young competition horses, as well as showing off the talents of Keltic Lion and Here's Lola. Lola had a phenomenal season, finishing always in the top ribbons at every event....culminating with a solid win in the Open Prelim at Plantation, finishing on her dressage score of 26.1! Bruce also capped off the Plantation weekend with a 26.8 win on Copernicus (owned by Anna Kjellstrom) in the Open Intermediate division!
We said good bye to a few of our younger home breds: Congratulations go out to Gillian Clissold on the purchase of Kiss Me Good, to Christine Pitcairn on the purchase of Please Sir Oliver and to Lauren Wylde on the purchase of Fiona, half sister to Petite Flower (by Keltic Lion). Buck decided to that he wasn't going to let Bojangles get away, so he will continue to take the ride on Bojangles, who is out of Memorial Cap and a full brother to Chesterland's Image! We're always happy to see our home breds move on to their new homes, but we also enjoy watching Buck take our young and talented horses up the levels as well!! There is nothing more rewarding than producing your next upper level horse, as Buck has proven with Reggie over and over again.
Since so many of our young competition horses have moved onto new homes, Bruce has shifted his focus to several of Charlie's 3 year olds, who are under tack and showing early signs of great talent. Charlie's babies are imprinted with his amazing mind and a willingness to learn. Keep your eyes peeled for his string of 3 year olds in the competition field next season!!
Good luck to Buck, Carl and Cassandra Segal's BallyNoe Castle RM (Reggie) who are competing at the Pau CCI4* in France this week. Follow the event at http://www.event-pau.fr/en/homepage
I recently received the PDF of Bruce's interview for the pre-Rolex edition of the USEA magazine. I realize this is "old news" but well worth the read!!
American Kristi Nunnink will be making her debut at The Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials this afternoon with her mare R-Star - just one of five mares competing here this year. The pair has made their first trip across the Atlantic specifically to compete at Burghley.
Kristi (50) grew up and still lives in California. In her earlier years she ran a busy livery and training yard and was a regular competitor up to three-star level.
In 2004 having lost her top horse Kirsti never imagined that in less then ten years she would be back at top level. But that was before ‘Rosie’ arrived in the yard. The 11-year-old grey mare has taken Kristi back to the top of her game – although the journey has not been without it’s setbacks.
At the beginning of 2011 whilst competing at Lexington the pair suffered a rotational fall. Kristi broke her ribs and elbow and three days later, was in hospital for a planned hip replacement meaning the pair was out of competition for the summer.
During this time Kristi met up with former Burghley winner Bruce Davidson (1974 –Irish Cap) who offered to help the pair get back on their feet. Kristi drove Rosie the 3,000 miles to Bruce’s East coast yard where they stayed for two months before competing at Lexington in April where after a glance-off they were 23rd. They then won their next event the CIC3* at Kalispell and has been based back with Bruce for the four months prior to travelling over to the UK.
“Everything has come together for us both,” says Kristi. “I am super excited to be here and a little nervous but we really felt this was the right course for Rosie as she is super bold and this is a super bold course.”
Rosie who is now described as a ‘horse of a lifetime’ is an American-bred mare of Holstein descent. Her sire is the German-bred Riverman who was exported to the US as was her dam Marisol who is by Corofino. “Rosie is a lovely mover and loves to jump and to me is very special,” said Kristi.
Caroline Martin may be US Eventing’s answer to Reed Kessler, the seventeen year old darling of the show-jumping world; she’s young, talented and absolutely charming to boot. I met her at Richland and found out a little bit more about her horses, her plans for the future, and yes, she has been practicing hard for the bareback puissance at Plantation!
Everyone is excited for the Olympics, and we're hoping that at Chesterland we're bringing along the next crop of Olympic caliber horses and riders!! Our newest string of 4 year olds are really proving to be quality athletes, and we're having fun taking them to the horse shows.
Andrea, Buck and Jan were all on hand at the Horse Park of NJ to ride and prep the group of 4 year olds in the Novice division. Andrea rode Oliver and Kiss Me Good, while Buck rode Mr. Bojangles and Sugarfoot. Here's Buck feeling pretty confident over the bank aboard Bojangles, who finished 2nd on his dressage score of an 18!
Working student Zack Leamer rode his mare Say You Do in the Prelim and continues to have solid results at that level. Bruce rode Anna Kjellstrom's KER Marvin, aka Everest, in the Prelim and had an impressive 4th place finish aboard this horse.
Bruce hit the road to Rebecca Farm's great event in Montana to see his student Kristi Nunnink win the CIC 3* on her gorgeous mare, R-Star. Hearing rumors that Kristi had her eyes set on Burghley, I called her this morning to get an update & confirmed that indeed she has entered. It's always great to catch up with Kristi because she has such a huge appreciation for the support that she has received from Bruce and how he has brought back all of her confidence since her hip surgery.....and her dream would be to have him there at Burghley with her. There are over 100 entries and now she must wait until Monday to hear if she's been accepted, but we will be one of the first to know!!
While at the event Bruce also got to see Bee Hive, one of Chesterland's homebreds by High Scope out of Queen Bee (a 1/2 sister to Jam) who was sold out west to a student of Kelly Prather's. This young horse has come up the levels perfectly for his Jr rider, who finished 4th in the JTR division. Congratulations!
Bruce also has 2 other students in town prepping for Millbrook. He'll be traveling with Jennifer Taxay-Kelley, an advanced level rider from Ca., who will be going Intermediate this wknd at HPNJ on her horse Taboo. Maddie Blackman is also here getting ready for Millbrook on Gordonstown, and both ladies will be going advanced at that event. The barn is hopping!!
Jane Tuckerman (Susie's sister) was competing Summer (out of Windsor Bonnett and by high Scope) at HITS this summer & won great ribbons in every one of her Amateur jumper classes at HITS, capping off the show with a 2nd in a class of 80 horses!!
Caroline Martin owns a broodmare bred by Bruce (by Babomist) who's in foal to Charlie! Can't wait to see that baby.
Geriann Henderson and Kingslee took home the win in the PRO Tour Series Advanced Division at the Event at Rebecca Farm. They took three rails in the round, but were given plenty of breathing room by Heather DuBois in second place who also had three rails down. Geriann capped off what she described as an "unreal" weekend with Kingslee who jumped his heart out for her. As both are fairly new to this level Geriann plans to get more experience over the course of the summer and fall.
Kristi Nunnink led from start to finish to capture the Adequan USEA Gold Cup Series with her very talented Holsteiner mare R-Star. Kristie credits Bruce Davidson, with whom she has been training over the past winter, with giving her the confidence to really perform well at this level. Florence Miller and Tuscan Sun won the CCI** and Emilee Libby and Nonsensical captured the CIC**. For full results from Rebecca Farm follow the link.
Chesterland has a tremendous line up of young horses, from babies to 4 year olds who have just started their competition career. We encourage you to set up an appointment to come out & see these lovely young horses!
Bruce had a full dance card last weekend at the Spring HT at Flora Lea! He made quick work of the Prelim division by taking first on Lola, second on Charlie and third on Everest (KER Marvin)!!
The weekend was even more exciting due to the fact that he brought out 4 of his youngsters out for their first event in the Novice divisions.
We just finished taking tons of photos of all the young stock and these 4 year olds for the sales page on the website....so check back soon for that information. The whole crew at Chesterland is busy getting ready for Bromont, so we'll have plenty more news after next weekend!!
It was a beautiful day yesterday at the Willowdale races, with the weather God's shining upon us! There was a packed field in attendance to enjoy a day of racing, tailgating, shopping and spectating. The USEF generously helped sponsor the "Salute To Champions", which honored local Olympians & Medal winners who have represented our country over the years.
In attendance for the procession were several area equestrians including Bruce, Donnan Sharp Jones, Jane Sleeper, Jessica Ransehousen, Tod Flettrich and Michael Matz. They were paraded onto the course by the lovely 4 in hand driven by Mike Gracie, and each of the participants was honored with an introduction. Later they all came up to the USEF tent to sign autographs for fans of all ages.
Susie also had a very busy day up in her booth, where she showcased her exception art to many admirers. I think it won't be long before more people know about Susie's amazing talent with her digital art. I hope that she has clients standing in line to order custom portraits of their family and favorite four legged friends!!
Many thanks go out to Bruce for participating in the celebration. Here are some wonderful photos taken by infamous area photographer Jim Graham. Enjoy the slideshow!
The US launched the 2012 Olympic bid this week in New Yorks's Times Square. Timed to mark 100-days until the opening of the London Games, the event gave Americans a great start on the journey to the United Kingdom and Theault America was there to help with the occasion!
Lead role in this fabulous video features My Boy Bobby who has launched his new acting career!! Not a bad retirement gig.
Theault-America will be on hand at Rolex to show off their Morpheus, so stop by to check out the most innovative horse box on the market in the US!!
Bruce has a new ride on a fantastic young horse named KER Marvin, who is owned by his friends at Kentucky Equine Research. Those around the barn like to call this young horse "Everest" for obvious reasons, as he is a magnificently large young thoroughbred, who has led quite an interesting life thus far.
KER Marvin was purchased by Kentucky Equine Research in September 2006 at a public Thoroughbred sale as a yearling. During his tenure as a research horse, he was involved in digestibility and exercise physiology trials. He also was used in the development of KERx products DuraPlex and Nano-E. By all accounts, KER Marvin was a great research horse!
In the summer of 2010, KER Marvin was one of several research horses used in the filming of the Discovery Channel’s hit television series “Dirty Jobs” at Kentucky Equine Research.
Later that summer, he was transferred to the sport-horse division of the company to pursue a career in eventing. This season he has joined Bruce's line-up of top competition horses & it will be fascinating to watch "Everest" take on the eventing world!
Kentucky Equine Research (KER) is an international equine nutrition, research, and consultation company serving both the horse producer and the feed industry. Its goal is to advance the industry's knowledge of equine nutrition and exercise physiology and apply this knowledge to produce healthier, more athletic horses.
KER was founded in 1988 when Joe Pagan, Ph.D. realized that information generated from research was not disseminated to the individuals who needed it most: feed manufacturers and horse owners. Since the company began, filling that void has been a priority for KER.
The company accomplishes this in several ways. First and foremost, it serves as a consultant to feed manufacturers. KER nutritionists work with mill owners and managers to formulate top-quality feeds that complement typical forages found in the locale. KER works with feed manufacturers on six continents: Australia, Asia, Europe, South America, Africa, and North America. KER also produces a line of nutritional supplements for special needs horses.
I caught up with Bruce last night & he's certainly happy with the way all the horses are going early this season. They've had a good couple of shows with Lola coming in 2nd at both her Prelims and Charlie taking 2nd his last time out as well. Soon Bruce will be bumping Charlie (Keltic Lion) up to Intermediate, as "Charlie has his ears pricked & smiling the whole time out on XC." The plan is to take their time with Lola, who's just coming 6 and still a big growing mare.
There's a new addition to the competition line up with KER Marvin, who is owned by Ana Kjellstrom and Joe Pagan of Kentucky Equine Research. He's a striking big bay 6 year old who was originally part of their feed research program as a youngster. He's only been under tack for about 1 1/2 years, with Bruce starting to ride him 3 weeks ago. As you can see from this video, he's really quite a fancy prospect and won his first training at Ocala II and was 3rd at Rocking Horse last weekend. The plan is to take him to a few more training level events, then bump him up to Prelim during this season.
Zach, Lindsey & Hillary are working hard with their own horses in training this winter, soaking in a variety of experiences - show jumping at HITS, improving their dressage skills with the incomparable Gert Zuther & observing our nation's best event riders at the Florida training sessions. Hillary is aiming for the 2* at Ocala HP on 4/11 (along with Caroline Petty) and after The Fork they will take 3 loads of horses & head home to Chesterland in Unionville. Shortly after coming home, Bruce will head back to Rolex Kentucky with Beth Perkins and Kristi Nunink!
Over a week ago, Buck has had a bad color bone break while schooling, which has since required surgery. He went down to Tn to the USET’s orthopedic surgeon (Team Dr. Craig Ferrell) for the procedure & is recovery nicely, but the break was quite serious & required plates/screws. Bruce took over the reigns on The Apprentice to run him in the Advanced at Ocalla II. "He’s not a straight forward horse, but he jumped around nicely & got the Advanced completed which was needed to get him qualified."
On Monday night, Bruce participated in an event for the Make a Wish Foundation, which was held in Ocala. It was a big fundraiser and they succeeded in filled the stadium. 10 teams of 2 riders (a pairing of one western & one english rider) competed in a format where the western riders were required to jump a course & the english riders had to run a pattern & cut a cow. Aaron Vale's team won & Bruce's team was 4th.
We also want to congratulate Caroline Martin who completed her first Advanced at the Ocala II Horse Trials aboard Petite Flower!
Ocala in the Winter really does feel like the horse capital of the world. There is something horsey going on every day if you know where to look. The highlight of my one and only weekend in Ocala was watching Bruce Wayne, er, I mean....Davidson, riding the range. Bruce Davidson and Chuck Waters were splendidly mounted on two of Chuck's beautiful Western horses. Bruce had gone over to 'Waterworks' for a sneaky practice or two and on Sunday, he and Chuck were having a great time doing 'Ranch Sorting.'
It consists of two big roundpens with a gateway between them. 10 little cows come in, all wearing numbers on their backs from 0 - 9. The trick is to get the little cows through the gateway in the right order. One of the two man team parks his horse in the gateway and spins it right or left to either make a gate or a passageway depending on whether or not the right little critter is galloping toward them. This person also has to do a great deal of 'Ya Ya' with sufficient volume to turn the wrong little critters back! Meanwhile the second member of the team is cutting his calf out of the herd and chasing it's ass to the gateway and through. When you see a practiced team working together it's very fast and done against the clock. Wrong number goes through - you lose.
Originally I was meant to be flying back home on the Sunday but there was nothing going to make me miss seeing Bruce Davidson done up in his best Western duds and cutting cattle.
Bruce and Chuck did three 'sets'. The first one was OK, the second one was AMAZING and the third one had a few recalcitrant cows in the herd.
Here's our latest update from Whitney Weston, who bought our famous "Lusty" last year after a successful run with Boyd Martin. Whitney trains with Buck and also maintains her own lively blogspot! It's wonderful to keep up with the horses that Bruce produces out of Chesterland & their success is a true testament to our breeding program!
" Last year was fantastic. I had the best time truly bonding with Lusty and becoming a team. We took our time on the west coast, starting at training level and finishing the season at the Galway Downs CCI ** on our dressage score! I just love her feisty attitude, but she's also just the cutest thing! She is an animal out on course, but then such a silly girl at the barn.
The more we have gotten to know each other, the better we work as a team. She's very much a mare like that, I had to get her trust (but also she knows I'm not a pushover!).
I am so excited for this season. We are wintering in Ocala, FL with Buck ("uncle Buck") Davidson and Bruce ("papa Bruce") Davidson, as we refer to them in reference to Lusty's childhood :) We just finished Rocking Horse OI, and gearing up for Rocking Horse Advanced! Finally!!! ahh the anticipation….Our goal for this spring is to run Jersey Fresh CCI***.
Chesterland South is in full swing this winter season with a barn full of talented horses and clients in training. Bruce has been quite busy with clients coming in for lessons and with the continued training and conditioning of his competition string of horses. As always, the success of Chesterland is due to the combined efforts of so many people, including clients, owners and the working students.
Bruce is extremely happy this year with the positive attitudes & motivated efforts of his working students - Hillary Popiel (who has been a familiar face over the past decade), Zachary Ryan Leamer and Lindsay Elwell. Jan Smith also continues to be an indispensable part of Chesterland's daily operation and has also become 1/2 owner in one of the coming 4 year olds, Sugarfoot, which ensures that this talented young filly will remain part of Bruce's training program. Bruce has brought 4 young horses down to Ocala this year to continue their winter training & they are all showing great promise on the flat & over fences. More to come on our blog & website regarding the approaching foaling season & the progress of our current homebreds in training!
Firefly Farm, which is the winter home to Chesterland South, is owned by Kristina Watkins, who winters in Ocala, but hails from Harvard Mass. Kristina is 1/2 owner in the talented young prospect, Here's Lola who is another homebred of Bruce's, out of Our Staple (JJ Babu’s full sister) by the NZ stallion Heroisity, one of the few TB stallions that stood at Hilltop and was approved for warmblood stud book. This is one talented young horse for the future who finished 2nd last weekend at her 2nd Prelim start at Rocking Horse (with Buck in the irons).
Rocking Horse I proved to be a successful start to the winter circuit with Cruise showing his talent by taking 3rd in the Intermediate Division (with a glance off on XC) and Charlie finishing 8th in Prelim (1 rail in stadium). The plan is to come back for Rocking Horse Winter II on the weekend of the 17th, running Lola and Charlie again at Prelim and stepping Cruise up to Advanced.
Many thanks go out to Cindy Lawler (who I met last year at Rolex) who was lucky enough to be at Rocking Horse this past weekend & generously has shared her photography talents with us!
Gerd and Yvonne Zuther have joined us again this year, bolstering the training program at Chesterland South with world class dressage instruction. The combined efforts of Bruce and Gerd are an added perk to the clients who stay here during the winter months while Gerd is able to focus on the talented young rider Nina Ligon. Nina has joined us again this year with her string of 5 horses before heading to Poplar Place.
Fanny Lee is here again with her advanced horse, Hadley Harbour, and Louis, her 5 year old bred by Bruce. Fanny is a great supporter & always lots of fun. Bruce is also looking forward to working with Beth Perkins who has joined Chesterland South with 4 horses in training, and the goal of aiming Sal Dali for Rolex this spring. She will be joined by Kristi Nunnink and R-Star, who is also returning to work with Bruce, pre-Rolex. Kristin also has 2 other younger horses who are showing great promise for the Prelim level this season. Caroline Petty, from British Columbia is also joining our team in preparation for the 2* at Ocala this season.
So as you can see, there's rarely a dull moment around the barn. Bruce has even taken up a bit of cross training, finding time to learn the ropes of Cattle Sorting, a western sport that resembles team penning. 2 riders work together to herd and direct one calf through a gate. The riders collaborate and take turns on herding and functioning the gate....and if a calf gets through the gate out of order, the team is eliminated!
Please enjoy our second slideshow of pictures provided by close friend & horse woman, Yvonne Zuther.
We will be sharing stories shortly on our crop of young homebreds & also the current successes of those who have gone on to top competitive homes with other riders such as Whitney Weston (Rock on Rose) and Caroline Martin (Petite Flower). Stay tuned!
Come join Team Farmvet/Cavalor consisting of Bruce, Buck, Will Faudree, Aaron Vale (SJ) and polo player Kris Kampsen for a fabulous event which blends elements of XC Eventing with GP Show Jumping. Each team will consist of 3 event riders, 1 show jumper and 1 polo player......with all team members tackling an exciting jumping course under the lights in Wellington.
Needless to say the Thursday night Calcutta is quite the party to attend, and the 7 teams in competition are all star studded. Check out the promo video below and see you there!!

After it was over, with Trent announcing he would quit the Senate Leadership post he has held since 1996, former Senator Bob Dole said he could not understand how it could have happened. Dole was at Senator Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday party and with almost everyone else in attendance chuckled at the little joke Trent told on himself and Strom Thurmond, an old joke about Thurmond’s 1948 run for President as a segregationist Third Party candidate. Anyone who knows Strom and Trent and has followed their careers, knows they have survived as long as they have because they are gentle, good-hearted men without the mean-spiritedness that shows up in so many politicians.
Thurmond got elected to the Senate for a half century with the support of South Carolina’s whites and blacks because he not only changed with the times, but also because he was affirmative in wanting to bridge the racial divide in a way the extremists could respect. There is no black village or neighborhood in South Carolina that he hasn’t gotten to know through a genuine eagerness to do what he could to be of help and earn his political support. I’ve been a political friend of Trent’s for a quarter century, since I met him in 1977 as a congressional foot-soldier in Jack Kemp’s army of supply-siders. They comprised a quintet of backbenchers who called themselves “The Amigos,” the other three being Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Connie Mack of Florida and Vin Weber of Minnesota.
I’ve been especially proud of Trent’s passage from the Mississippi of yore – the most racist of states – to a steady, positive model of transformation. Northern whites and black commentators in recent days have excoriated him for speaking to the all-white, allegedly “racist” Concerned Citizen’s Council of Jackson in years past. But if a Senator aims to help bridge the racial divide among his own constituency, how can he do so if he does not speak to all-black and all-white groups who are suspicious of each other and of changing times? The fact that Lott was so easily re-elected with sizeable proportions of the black and white vote in Mississippi was scarcely mentioned in the media frenzy of the last two weeks.
To answer Dole’s question, how this could have possibly happened, the key is in the evenly divided U.S. Senate, which has been on a knife edge in Trent’s six years. He’s either had a one-vote deficit or a one-vote margin among Senate Republicans, having to deal with a Democratic President for four of the years and a Republican for two. Trent does not have any “enemies,” but because he has been forced to compromise with the other party every day in order to do the people’s business, his critics in the GOP are legion. Every day he is criticized for giving up too much to the other side. I’ve gotten along with him so well these last six years because I’ve always understood that he never gave up too much.
It is easy to say President Bush pulled the plug on Trent, but it really was the neo-conservatives in the GOP who were unhappy with Trent’s willingness to compromise with the Democrats on Iraq and who hope his successor, Bill Frist of Tennessee, will dig in his heels against the doves. The hawks were then joined by the Republican tax cutters, who have also complained that Trent has not fought for them with enough ferocity. When Trent’s old “Amigo” Jack Kemp blasted him for his “insensitivity,” it was a clear signal for everyone to pile on, including the White House. Then again, in the end Lott was responsible for his own demise by repeatedly apologizing for his joke instead of insisting it was a joke and refusing to apologize. Strom Thurmond has always refused to apologize for any vote or statement he has made in his career, always insisting that at the time he believed he was correct in doing so. That’s generally the position of the truly honest man. My father told me many times that he may not always have been right, but he was never wrong. He always did what he thought was right. I’m frank to say that I passively opposed a national holiday for Martin Luther King, Jr., for one reason or another, but can now see the wisdom in the decision to have it. Trent clearly followed the same track.
He has thousands of friends and he got thousands of messages of support and advice through the ordeal. I urged him to make it go to a vote of his colleagues, as he had done nothing wrong, and it is always a bad idea to resign from an elective office for something you did not do. I suggested in the process he could be a vehicle for a national conversation about the racial divide, and for a moment it looked possible. The White House, though, made it clear it wanted him out of the news. The message was delivered by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in a sharp blast at Trent for the old joke. That had to be a presidential decision, and Trent is too nice a guy to stand in the way of his party’s leader and his country’s President. Dole is right. It sure was quick.

A “Thai Police Certificate” or “Thailand Criminal Record Check” may be conducted as a condition of employment, volunteer placement or during an immigration process. It is usually the last step in the pre-employment or immigration process, and should be conducted only after the job offer is made and with consent of the applicant.
Thai Police Certificate is a Thailand criminal record check that will show any criminal convictions a person has received. This is the most commonplace type of background check.
Both Thai citizens and foreigners who ever live in Thailand for more than 6 months, you may require a criminal record check or a Thai Police Clearance Certificate from Royal Thai Police in Thailand for the following reasons:
• Employment – Today a wide range of organizations are requiring employees and to provide Thai Police Certificate. It is the last step in the pre-employment process, and should be conducted only after the job offer is made and with consent of the applicant.
• Adoption - Every child deserves to have a family of their own. Adoption is one way to bring together children who need families and families who want to parent children. Adoption is a legal and social process through which a child becomes part of a new family and families are given the opportunity to experience all of the rewards that come with parenting a child. Adoption is the permanent legal transfer of all parental rights from one person or couple to another person or couple. Adoptive parents have the same rights and responsibilities as biological parents, and in most cases the adoptive parents are required to obtain a Thai Police Certificate if they ever live in Thailand for more than 6 months.
• Immigration applications - When you apply to become a permanent resident or a citizen of any country, you and your family members must include a Thai police clearance certificate. When you apply as a visitor, student or temporary worker, the visa/immigration officers may ask you for a Thai Police Clearance Certificate.
Applications for Thai Police Clearance Certificate may be requested by you or by an agency/employer. However, they can only be conducted with your written consent. You have the right to see your Thai Police Clearance Certificate before it is given to someone else.
If you are under 18 years of age then you may need to have your parent or guardian consent to the Thai Police Clearance Certificate.
How long your Thai Police Clearance Certificate is good for depends on what immigration program or reason you are applying to. In most cases, the Thai Police Clearance Certificate is valid for 8 to 12 months from the issue date.

Below is a list of the types of services offered by nuisance wildlife control professionals. This line of work goes far beyond simple Florida animal trapping. A true professional performs integrated pest management – we identify the root of the problem, and provide a complete solution to the critter removal problem.
We specialize in urban and suburban wildlife removal and damage remediation for both residential and commercial customers.
We handle nearly all aspects of wildlife control, and resolve conflicts between people and wildlife in a humane and professional manner.
Wild raccoons are capable of causing an extensive amount of damage and mess to a home or property. They are known to take shelter in residential and commercial areas, commonly invading attics, crawl spaces, roofs, vents, ducts, garages, sheds, porches, and more. They use these areas to protect themselves and their young from harsh weather and cold temperatures; as well as, for breeding grounds and feeding.
Once raccoons are occupying a particular area of a residential or commercial property, they immediately begin their destructive tendencies. For instance, raccoons can chew through wood beams and electrical wiring, rip down attic insulation, and saturate dry wall, sheet rock, ceilings, and other areas of a home with urine and feces.
Many property owners are overwhelmed with the sight of their home or building after a raccoon infestation. Once they are professionally removed, what happens to the area that has been destroyed? Continue reading to learn about professional raccoon cleanup services and how they can help a property owner in distress following a raccoon infestation or disturbance.
When wild raccoons have nested, burrowed, and hibernated in a home or building for an extended amount of time, the chances of structural damage is high. Dry wall is ripped, torn, and saturated with animal urine and droppings; while attic insulation, ceilings, and more are also saturated with urine and ripped away for nesting and playtime. On top of these damages, extreme structural damage is likely too. Porches, decks, roofs, and more have to be gutted or replaced at times; depending on the degree of damages. In other cases, restorations can take weeks or months to complete because of the extensiveness of harm and destruction.
Want to know more about the ABC's of what this area under discussion has to propose to every human being who is willing to do things for themselves? During an inspection of the structure needing bat eviction I can determine the size of the colony and the best time of the year to remove the bats. During certain times of the year bats form nursery colonies. Depending on your geographical area the bats can only be removed when the young bats are able to fly. We like to use a one-way door or referred to as a valve.
These unidirectional escapes lets the bats escape not allowing the bats back in. This type of bat control eviction is approved by the organization Bat Conservation International. The utmost critical thing in bat removal from a residence is attention to all the little construction gaps. When closing all construction gaps, anything larger than an a quarter inch should be sealed. You have to seal the entire home to foil bats from getting back in. You will go as far as sealing any fault or construction crack. Ill need to exclude vents to keep bats out, let's start by closing off louver vents, attic vents, and ridge vents if bats can breach them using 1/4 inch screen. These can be painted to match, but I have found it blends in nicely left unpainted.
Inspect chimneys, bricks and mortar may be loose forming gaps. Look for gaps around where the chimney goes through soffit, carefully seal gaps and install a one-way door, if a bat way in is there. Ridge venting systems are feasible bat entrances. When looking at the ridge vent closely you'll usually find the plastic ridge vents deform leaving gaps, I've seen where varmints have chewed a gap in the vent. I will do away with the previous roof vent system and replace it. Primarily, you lay down 1/4 inch hardware cloth this keeps the bats, mice and squirrels from getting through. We will install a one-way bat door here also if the bats were using this area. Finally you'll finish the attic vent with a vent system referred to as Cobra vent, and then finish it with top cap shingles. We try to color match any calking, tin work and exclusion work to make it merge in as if we have not had to fix the construction defects. We use paintable caulking, the silicon based calks will tinge over time.
I build my own one-way doors. After ten years of bat control, I came up with an easy effective one-way valve for bat removal. You can purchase commercially produced bat cones but I personally think they are too short and have no airflow at the base where it is attached to the structure. These one-way doors are left on for about two weeks, to let bats leave. Then I can remove the one-way door and then block the entrance. After the bats have exited through the one-way doors the bats will try for several nights to get back in, by looking for another entrance, this is why sealing every possible entrance needs to be done. This is how to evict bats.Find out more by reading our other articles on this topic and other subjects we have written related to it.

Following is an e-mail by one of our compatriots who did what a TRUE Iranian would do, wrote the letter.
The following political activists have just received a deportation order from the Turkish government (city of Van) to return to Iran:
Messers: Ali Alamzadeh, Abolfazl Ajorloo, Mojtaba Vatanpoor-Nadrai, and Alirez Ranjbar all affiliated with the Iran's Party of Constitutional Monarchy (in excile).
Such deportation decision by the Turkish government is believed to be based on a recent agreement between Iran and Turkey regarding further control and deportation of political opponents in each other's countries. I, as an Australian citizen am appalled by this decision by the Turkish government as I am certain that the above people, if sent to Iran, will face the harshest penalties possible for their opposition to the Government of Islamic Republic of Iran. I feel extremely upset to see that noone seems to stop such deportation and the above activist are getting closer to death every day that passes.
I beg of you, the respective offices of humn rights in the city of Van in Turkey, the Turkish Embassy in Australia, and offices of the Australian Human Rights Commission to please, please, interfere in this matter and prevent further bloodshed by the Islamic Republic of Iran.
I will very much appreciate your response to this email and the follow up actions by your respectful offices on this matter.
With highest respects to the late Honorable Mostafa Kamal Pasha AtaTurk, the father of free and democratic Turkey.
With DuPont’s May 13th Annual Meeting just around the corner, we would like to thank you for your consideration in this very important election. In a few days, stockholders will have the opportunity to rejuvenate the DuPont Board with new directors who will work constructively with management to build DuPont into a stronger, more transparent and more valuable company.
Trian has a track record of adding value in the boardroom, and we believe our four highly qualified nominees have the experience, skills, passion, and independent insight needed to help make DuPont GREATagain. All three leading proxy advisory firms, ISS, Glass Lewis, and Egan-Jones, agree with us that change is needed at DuPont and that Trian brings the ownership mentality necessary to drive meaningful change and long-term value creation.
Trian’s core competency is our ability to be a catalyst for significant operating improvements and increased stockholder value at the companies in which we invest. As ISS noted in its recent report: “the extensive preparation of the Trian method—providing its executives who go on boards with extensive analytic support throughout their tenures—may not be simply desirable, but necessary to drive the appropriate change.”
The Trian portfolio companies at which Nelson Peltz has previously served on the board have OUTPERFORMED the S&P 500 Index by an average of 8.4% annually from the date of Trian’s initial investment through the present.1 If elected, all four Trian nominees will bring relevant skill sets and operating experience to the DuPont boardroom, along with strong track records leading high-performance organizations, fresh perspectives, and an openness to exploring ideas to create long-term value:
Nelson Peltz is CEO and a founding partner of Trian. Mr. Peltz is a director of The Wendy’s Company and serves as its non-executive Chairman. He is also a director of Mondel�“z International, Inc. and The Madison Square Garden Company, and has previously served on the boards of directors of Ingersoll-Rand plc, H.J. Heinz Company and Legg Mason Inc., where he was Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Peltz has 40 years of experience in investing, turning around and building companies at both the management and board level.
John H. Myers is the former President and CEO of GE Asset Management, where he was responsible for growing the business from $58 billion to $200 billion in assets under management over a decade. Mr. Myers, who also spent over a decade working on the industrial side of General Electric with Jack Welch, has experience balancing the power between division management and the parent company within a conglomerate.
Arthur B. Winkleblack is the former Executive Vice President and CFO of H.J. Heinz Company, where he helped lead strategic initiatives that transformed a 100+ year old iconic company by streamlining operations and returning it to consistent and profitable growth.
Robert J. Zatta is the former acting CEO and longtime CFO of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., a specialty chemicals company, where he led the turnaround and transformation of Rockwood. Mr. Zatta helped Rockwood achieve best-in-class margins by empowering division management, running a decentralized model with minimal corporate overhead and optimizing the value of the portfolio through M&A.
We greatly appreciate the support we have received from so many of you and urge all stockholders to vote for our FOUR nominees on the GOLD proxy card TODAY so that, together, we can make DuPont GREAT again.
Trian believes DuPont has tremendous potential, as evidenced by our significant investment in DuPont of approximately 24.6 million shares valued at approximately $1.8 billion, and the fact that even after we issued our White Paper in September 2014, we continued to acquire DuPont stock. We believe DuPont’s implied target value per share could be in excess of $120 per share by the end of 2017.2 By contrast, DuPont’s CEO has sold 54% of her stock since Trian invested in 2013, all at prices of $72 or less.3 While DuPont’s CEO speaks of her vision for DuPont, we believe the sales of her DuPont stock reveal her lack of confidence in the future of the Company. We grant stock to our senior executives in order to ensure that their incentives are aligned with stockholders, not so they can sell prematurely.
We believe that our nominees will bring a far greater level of engagement to the DuPont Board than the current DuPont directors who do not have a significant ownership interest in the Company. In our view, these directors do not have an ownership mentality, have been reactive in overseeing DuPont, and have tolerated consistent operational underperformance.
If elected, our director nominees will work with the other board members and management to address DuPont’s failure to grow earnings, its inability to deliver best-in-class financial metrics, and its failed portfolio strategies, which have led to long-term underperformance.
Failure to grow earnings: Operating earnings in each of 2012, 2013, 2014 and, according to management’s own guidance, 2015, all will be below earnings in 2011.4Had DuPont met its previously announced financial targets since 2011, EPS would be 51% higher than it actually was in 2014.5
Failure to deliver best-in-class operating metrics: DuPont is underperforming its peers in revenue growth and margins in five of its seven operating segments. Returning DuPont to greatness will require a commitment to achieving best-in-class metrics across all business units. Trian believes there is an opportunity to eliminate $2 to $4 billion of excess corporate costs.6Given DuPont’s current EBITDA multiple of approximately 10x,7 we believe DuPont could deliver approximately $20 to $40 billion of additional value to stockholders by delivering on Trian’s savings targets, but only if cost-cutting plans are well executed and the resulting savings hit the bottom line.
When DuPont sells businesses, buyers prosper: The same businesses that decline under DuPont ownership have prospered once free from DuPont’s corporate structure. When DuPont announced the sale of its coatings business (Axalta) in 2012 to a private equity buyer, Axalta’s revenue and profits were declining and management viewed the business as mature and no longer core.8 Under new ownership, however, Axalta quickly reduced overhead, invested in growth and more than doubled EBITDA.9 A business that was sold for net proceeds of $4 billion is now valued as a public company at approximately $11 billion.10 Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway recently became Axalta’s second largest shareholder and the company now trades at 30x forward earnings, a nearly 60% premium to DuPont,11 which is reflective of Axalta’s strong growth and margin profile. We believe what transpired at Axalta illustrates the value creation potential across DuPont’s portfolio.
When DuPont acquires businesses, stockholders suffer: DuPont acquired Danisco in 2011 for $7 billion. Since the acquisition, Danisco’s organic revenue growth has slowed to 3%,12 compared to the company’s 5%13 growth rate from 2006-2011 when Danisco was standalone and the 8-10% growth target set by DuPont.14 Under DuPont ownership, the operating margin is down by approximately 33% from 2010 (pre-transaction).15Stockholders should not tolerate flawed M&A execution like the acquisition of Danisco.
Long-term underperformance: DuPont’s management and Board argue that performance has been strong as evidenced by the total shareholder return (TSR) generated under Ellen Kullman. Such analysis ignores the fact that DuPont’s stock price when she took office in January 2009 was down more than 50% from the prior year’s high.16 It also ignores the fact that the stock is up significantly despite earnings being down since 2011. Every investor knows that sooner or later a company’s shares will trade based on earnings. DuPont’s shares have not traded based on fundamentals, but rather, in our view, on the expectation that Trian will be a positive agent of change.17 Disturbingly, despite the recent share price rally, DuPont’s stock price still remains below where it traded at the time of the Conoco separation in 1998.
The three days of greatest stock price outperformance versus the S&P 500 Index during CEO Ellen Kullman’s tenure occurred when:
3) ISS last week recommended changes to the DuPont Board and that DuPont stockholders vote the GOLD proxy card for Nelson Peltz and John H. Myers18
Meanwhile, the cumulative change in share price over all 32 earnings and guidance events since Ellen Kullman became CEO is a drop of approximately $12 per share.19 In fact, the share price has declined in response to seven of the last nine earnings and guidance events,20 which we believe suggests that trends are worsening.
DuPont has resorted to scare tactics and misleading statements regarding Trian’s position on key issues. DuPont characterizes Trian’s plan as “a high risk, value destructive plan to break up DuPont” that would add “excessive debt.”21 Trian is not dogmatic as to the best path forward regarding corporate structure. Our main objective is to ensure the operating segments that comprise DuPont achieve best-in-class operating metrics, including revenue growth and margins.
As previously mentioned, five of DuPont’s operating segments underperform peers today. We believe that Trian’s nominees, working as a minority of the Board together with DuPont’s other board members, will be able to assess the corporate structure to determine if management is capable of achieving best-in-class operating metrics with the existing portfolio or whether further portfolio changes are required. Regarding leverage, we are committed to maintaining DuPont’s investment grade credit rating. We find it ironic that we had proposed to DuPont in 2014 that Chemours remain investment grade,22 and DuPont management subsequently chose to make Chemours non-investment grade.23
We have been owners of DuPont for over two years and believe the company has tremendous long-term potential. Unfortunately, in our view, the DuPont Board has not been an effective fiduciary for stockholders. As ISS’s recent report noted: “[o]perating efficiency is not what it should be, yet instead of addressing the core issues, the board and management, at least in their communications with shareholders, are more inclined to obfuscation than accountability.”
Earnings guidance has been missed three years in a row from 2012-201424 – and management has already lowered 2015 guidance to the low end of the previously announced range after only one quarter.25
Last year, financial metrics drove a “zero” payout for the corporate performance portion of the Company’s executive bonus plan, and yet the Board’s Compensation Committee awarded 80-100% payouts for individual performance – sending conflicting and irreconcilable messages: according to the Committee, the Company performed poorly but management as individuals performed well.26
Axalta’s EBITDA and value more than doubled within two years of being sold.27 In fact, when Trian met with the Lead Director and CEO in December 2013, it was clear to Trian that the Lead Director was unaware of Axalta’s vastly improved performance since the sale. In our view, this was because management holds an “information advantage” over the Board.
DuPont’s Board, in our view, has been reactive and not proactive. Why did DuPont wait until it knew Trian had taken a position to announce a strategic alternatives study of Performance Chemicals (i.e. Chemours)? Why did DuPont wait until one year after Trian shared its White Paper and management once again lowered guidance before announcing the “Fresh Start” cost reduction plan? Why did DuPont wait until Trian filed a slate to upgrade talent on its board (i.e., Messrs. Breen and Gallogly)? Why should stockholders assume the Board will make the best long-term decisions for stockholders going forward once pressure from the proxy contest ceases?
It is time for change at DuPont. We need a Board that is committed to promoting transparency, holding management accountable for poor operating performance, eliminating management’s information advantage over directors, linking management compensation and performance, and helping create value for the benefit of all stockholders.
Help make DuPont GREATagain. We urge you to vote the GOLD proxy card today to elect Nelson Peltz, John H. Myers, Arthur B. Winkleblack and Robert J. Zatta. Your vote is important, no matter how many or how few shares you own.

As a follow-up of the LRE Map 2016 initiative, ELRA has processed the information on existing and newly-created Language Resources provided by the authors submitting at LREC 2016 Conference (http://lrec2016.lrec-conf.org). In order to increase the visibility of these resources, ELRA has allocated ISLRNs to 106 submitted languages resources. They distribute as follows:
The meta-information for these language resources is also available on the ISLRN website with a broad international audience.
As part of an international effort to document and archive the various language resource development efforts around the world, a system of assigning ISLRNs was established in November 2013. The ISLRN is a unique persistent identifier to be assigned to each language resource. The establishment of ISLRNs was a major step in the networked and shared world of human language technologies. Unique resources must be identified as they are, and meta-catalogues require a common identification format to manage data correctly. Therefore, language resources should carry identical identification schemes independent of their representations, whatever their types and wherever their physical locations (on hard drives, internet or intranet). Visit: http://islrn.org/.
Initiated by ELRA and FlareNet at LREC 2010 (http://www.lrec-conf.org), the LRE Map is a mechanism intended to monitor the use and creation of language resources by collecting information on both existing and newly-created resources during the submission process. Apart from providing a portrait of the resources behind the community, of their uses and usability, the LRE Map intends to be a measuring instrument for monitoring the field of language resources. The feature has been so successful that it has been implemented also at other major conferences like COLING, IJCNLP, Interspeech, LTC, ACLHT, O-COCOSDA, RANLP, in addition to the LRE Journal.

The European Language Resources Association (ELRA) is a non-profit-making organisation founded by the European Commission in 1995, with the mission of providing a clearing house for language resources and promoting human language technologies.

Hello! This is my first blog post in a long time. I have been busy finishing my Master's thesis lately, so I have mostly just made some quick Instagram posts of the stuff I've been making in between. Anyway, some of you like to see how my paper projects are made, so here I'll explain how to make colourful tags.
Making tags is a nice way use paper scraps. Here I've used Neenah cardstock, which is great for solid stamps and ink blending. It's not meant for watercolours, but a little touch around the edges works fine.
First I die cut the tags and stamped the ocean. I've used the layering stamp from Hero Arts' June 2018 Monthly Hero Kit, but you can use any other ocean stamp, or a stencil.
Then I stamped the animals in black Versafine pigment ink. I chose bold contrast colours for the sky, and blended them onto the tag with a sponge.
I stamped the sentiment on black cardstock scraps in Versamark ink and embossed with white powder from Hero Arts. The pieces were adhered to the tags with foam tape.
In the end I fixed the stamped images with a white gel pen and a black fineliner, as I didn't mask them off before adding the colours.
Stamps: Ocean, palm tree, mermaid, sail boat, dolphin, foot prints and sentiments - Hero Arts (My Monthly Hero Kit June 2018), Animals - Cats on Appletrees
That's all! Easy-peasy. The final touch takes a little bit of time, but otherwise this is a painless way to make cards.

Gambling can be defined as betting something of value when the outcome is uncertain. Gambling occurs in many forms, most commonly are: Pathological or Compulsive Gambling is identified as an impulse control disorder and has features similar to other addictive disorders, without involving the use of an intoxicating drug. What are the warning signs of pathological gambling? Gamblers' Anonymous asks its new members twenty questions: Did you ever lose time from work due to gambling?
Has gambling ever made your home life unhappy? Did gambling affect your reputation? Have you ever felt remorse after gambling? Did you ever gamble to get money in which to pay debts or otherwise solve financial difficulties? Did gambling cause a decrease in your ambition or efficiency? After losing, did you feel you must return as soon as possible to win back your losses?
After a win, did you have a strong urge to return and win more? Did you often gamble until your last dollar was gone? Did you ever borrow to finance your gambling? Have you ever sold anything to finance your gambling? Were you reluctant to use "gambling money" for normal expenditures? Did gambling make you careless of the welfare of yourself and your family? Did you ever gamble longer than you planned? Have you ever gambled to escape worry our trouble? Have you ever committed or considered committing an illegal act to finance gambling?
Did gambling cause you to have difficulty in sleeping? Do arguments, disappointments, or frustrations create within you an urge to gamble? Did you ever have an urge to celebrate any good fortune by a few hours of gambling? Have you ever considered self-destruction as a result of your gambling? Pathological gamblers usually answer yes to at least 7 of these questions. What are the effects of pathological gambling? Pathological gambling affects the gambler, their family, their employer, and the community.
As the gambler goes through the phases of their addiction, they spend less time with their family, spend more of the family's money on gambling until the bank accounts are depleted, and then may steal money from family members.

Cylinder & Slide Beretta hammers and sears are CNC EDM cut from billet alloy steel plate stock and finished machined on CNC machining centers. They are then heat treated to 50-54 RC completely through the part. The tolerances are held +- .0005. Each part is 100% inspected and checked for proper heat treatment. Each part comes with a certification of heat treat check and each part will have the tiny dimple imprint made by the diamond point on the Rockwell Hardness Tester.
The only difference between the low mass hammer and the match hammer is the physical weight of the hammer. The low mass hammer weighs less than the match hammer. The geometry is exactly the same for both hammers. The trigger pull sets will normally drop in at approximately 4.5 lb. single action trigger pull and 2lb. less double action trigger pull. You can easily set the trigger pull at 3-3.5 lb. for target use only with proper sear and hammer engagement stoning. I recommend that you start your stoning process by simply stoning a slight relief angle on the back edge of the sear nose and then check the trigger pull. Many times this is all that is required to reduce the trigger pull.
Our Beretta hammers and sears are being sold to several military match arms shops for use in their match pistols. We have designed these parts to meet their specifications. They requested that these parts be able to meet match ball gun specifications without modification.
i believe the year was nineteen eighty four. i was dating a punk rock girl super into the cure. and poetry.
when i got to santa barbara, true blue era, i couldnt believe that people were like seriously into you. like, no shes good tony. and when people ask me why i stopped taking acid its because people would play madonna records for me and itd freak me out and bad trip me.
my only solace, and i know you wont believe me but its true, and i write about it tonight, halloween night, because they were perfect for a night like tonight.
and i listened to pms play and even though they were a very nice punk rock thrash situation, that particular night they sounded like angels
im glad youre into kabalah and yoga and living in england and all that fucked up shit, if you were living down the street coming back from the blockbuster in your sweats you wouldnt be a rock star to me. youd be pavement.
which is a no-no. i promised myself that after anna k i wasnt gonna do celebs anymore and we were having lunch at the ivy today and these fucking ‘ratzis started speaking some fucked up language and commenced to take like a gazillion pics of she and i and instead of saying wtf she just blushed.
she knows my rule. she knows all my rules. a while back i got in a fight with this one girl who complained that my rules were obnoxious and contradictory so i went through them and sure enough the lil ho was right. so i edited out the ones that were incredibly unfair, as well as the ones that were contradictory. and last night she hinted that she wanted to go steady with me and i gave her the book and she read it and i know she read it all cuz she had lots of questions today before the cameras started blowing up.
so we had planned on going to west hollywood tonight to walk around with the freaks but now im a little mad at her because rule number two is no lying and i specifically asked her when we were at midnight tacos, just meeting, what she did for a living and she didnt say im a celebrity. she said she was a student.
maybe in norway things are different, or maybe theres another word for celeb there, but her english was pretty good.
i may have to spend this evening re-evaluating things because i didnt mind that anna was super famous, it was just a lot to have to deal with because she was always worried about her looks or her career or her weight or her clothes and i was all, why dont you worry about which tree we’re gonna do it up against, or worry about which fingernail polish youre going to apply, or worry about if youre going to buy thousands of shares of Sirius or tens of thousands. worry about normal things – jeeze!
the thing about anna though was she is a gemini and geminis are like having a hundred girlfriends. one day they want to squeeze out a few kids, the next day they dont ever want to be touched again, then the next day theyre dancing on your coffee table in a short skirt.
i kept thinking, this is scandinavian trouble, which is like a lion cub. trouble in another lifetime but not this one.
but as always i was wrong and there she is lying and im sure shes gonna dress up as the sexiest witch of all time and slithered under the crack in my front door before i even get home from work, but ive dealt with that before and i resisted it.
I remember the first time I read Tony Pierce’s blog because I’d only been working on Blogger for a short time, and the fact that I hadn’t heard of him was pretty bad from a first impressions standpoint.
But my fellow Pyrate (Sutter) tipped me off, and the first post I read was about how the newspaper in Hell is so bad. When I realized that for several weeks Tony had been writing his whole blog from Hell after having been escorted there by the spectre of Kurt Cobain, I was floored. From a “getting what this whole blogging thing can really be” perspective, it was a big moment for me.
Tony’s got a new book out called Stiff which collects all of his infernal posts into a choice of awesome covers. I just finished re-reading them this weekend and I couldn’t recommend it more highly.
the problem is i stay late so i always rationalize things, but as i age i would like to be known as a reliable man, and being on time is part of that.
this was a nice weekend. i was able to kiss a pretty girl, i was able to hang out with my best friend, i was able to watch both the raiders and the bears win. i got to see my buddy jeff and his lovely family. i got to eat chicken burgers in the park. i even went to bed early last night so i could wake up early and do my little thing (that would be this) before i headed off to work.
there are many benefits to the buzznet loft, but today im going to try my hand at the Laundry Room. nothing ruins a weekend more than having to do laundry on a sunday night. so since the loft has laundry facilities i was thinking about killing two birds and omg even folding my shit afterwards.
how this administration gets away with what it does is amazing. and being an avid reader of the blogosphere gives me the twisted idea that the american public actually supports it, but its obvious that no, thats just the righty bloggers who are just o’reilly jrs who either do it because they get paid to, or because they like the attention.
but today is halloween so lets reminice a tad. back in the day, growing up outside Chicago, one had to pick his halloween costume based on the weather.
you had to figure out how to dress up and stay warm, so one day i was Jake Blues of the blues brothers cuz i could put some long johns on under my suit, one day i was a hobo cuz i could wear lots of clothes at one time,
in isla vista i dressed up as a mexican which was weird because some of the real mexican adults waved and cheered at me, i dont know why. maybe i looked like someone historic.
and the last time i dressed up was, ironically enough, at the buzznet loft when mc brown threw a halloween party way back in 2002, pictured, with the lovely moxie.
some of you are not Buzznet members, and thats cool, but that doesnt mean that you cant have your pics on Buzznet. what i would like to do is have a little busblog Halloween gallery
so heres how you can participate: email your Halloween 2005 pics to tony.tony.halloween@buzznet.com and bam they will end up in my dealie.
if you have a good blog, you probably have a bad job. if you have a good web site, you probably have a dull life; if you have a good job you probably have a bad blog, and if you have a bad site you’re normal.
and i dont know about all that but i do know that this weekend has been terrific and if im asked about the weekend i start back with thursday and tsar and fall out boy and picture taking and sleeping late and friday and getting to work from home but working hard and meeting a nice girl at midnight tacos and driving her around tonight and just letting her go home just now.
so if youre ever worried that you might blog something full of shit and you think about it and you talk yourself out of blogging my advice is to look at those stellar righties on the technorati one hundred who arent the least bit nervous about being full of shit.
they just type and type and type as if nobody will ever notice that they were the biggest critics of clinton, not of his policies or his achievements but because of monica lewinski.
and so here they have a man named scooter lying gasp under oath to the american people and not about how big his dick is or who he banged but about matters of national security revolving around the outting of a cia agent.
i get interviewed all the time, i get emails every day, i get into conversations any time im at a party or introduced as someone who blogs, or recognized, and they always ask me about the power of the blogs, and lately ive been saying that if bloggers at the top dont stop being partisan echochambers and hypocrites then the blogosphere will never be known for being much more than and electric teleprompter from which the bullshit gets read.
so my friends when you are afraid that what you say isnt blogworthy just ask yourself, “will i be intentionally bullshitting the world?” and if the answer is no, then you know that what what you’ll be posting will be 100times better than the big boys and girls who get the majority of the hits.
picked her up just as the sun was setting and she showed me her condo and we went to this new italian place on hollywood blvd which was pretty much as youd expect it, not nearly as good as the old italian staple across the street
and we drove and drove and talked and stopped off for ice cream and we didnt know where to go or what to do because there werent any good movies playing or anything happening and king tut had left or we would have eaten shrooms and been dumb and she has the softest hair and i kept saying i know this sounds like a line but i have better lines than this but i really have to touch your hair again
which is the assumptive close fellas its a question but not really. youre closing the deal youre touching a sensitive part of her. in the 70s there was this book called the erogenous zones. and pretty much any part of her head is a good place to be touching and you should see how she reacts when you touch her there cuz people dont usually run around touching each others head or hair.
she blamed it on the drinking but someone had shown their hand which made everything that much more easier on yours truly which is good because sometimes everyone needs a little reassurance when youre out with a girl well out of your league and youre driving a ten year old car with a license plate holder that says my other car is the busblog.
got her back to the crib and we were sitting there on the couch as mazzy star spoke her little songs and i hadnt heard that music in a long time and i was working the angles but she wouldnt let me kisser.
pearl necklace freshly cut rocker hair everything pretty much together, except her eyeballs and her heartbeat.
she said some water please and i gave her the latest us weekly to read and i came back with a water for her a shot of rum for me and a stethescope
she said whats all this. i said we’re going to play a little game. she said ive heard of doctor and im not interested. and i said this isnt doctor, i barely got a poetry degree, youd probably kick my ass at doctor.
i said what you can do is pick one of the items on the tray but i get to pick one of the remaining ones. for example if you pick the rum i will probably pick the stethescope.
and i said i will do with the stethescope exactly what the stethescope is for, i will listen to your heart.
and she said what will you do if i pick the stethescope and i said i will drink the rum and i will bet you that your heart is beating faster than mine and if im right i get to kiss you.
and she gave a nervous laugh for i had checkmated her and people dont like to be checkmated even if its funny
what ever you do these next fourty five minutes doesnt count, as at 2am the clock goes back to 1am, thus erasing everything.
when i posted this picture on metafilter last night the very next guy said “when you win the world series you can kiss whoever you want.”
a good reader emailed me a link to ESPN.com today where Scoop Jackson beautifully wrote about the sorrow on the North Side and tried to hint at racism but its not racism, its baseball.
yes dummy the Cubs are on the predominately white North Side and the Sox are in the mostly Black South Side, but i grew up in the all-white suburbs of Hanover Park Illinois and if people chose who to root for based on race then there would have been zero Sox fans in our lily white township instead of the 50-50 split that i had to suffer through.
we cant even deal with this World Series bullshit. its like a bad dream that we will never wake up from.
and i cant even imagine all the fair weather fans who are suddenly wearing white sox caps in my beloved town.
something like this happened in the early 80s when the Sox made it to the playoffs. i forget about who or when – it was success for the Sox therefore of zero importance to my memory banks. but real Cub fans wore their colors, real Sox fans rubbed our noses in it and the fakers bought into the bandwaggon.
and then in 84 when it looked like the Cubs were going all the way we all remembered who had jumped ship and who had stayed true and there were alot of beatings going around in those days in the northwest suburbs and the most delicious went to those who had worn Sox hats and tshirts in 82 who suddenly found themselves under a Cubs hat
sure its nice that the Cubs have had some good teams but thats like having the cute girls tell you that they think youre fun. who the fuck cares about what they think, its the result, its the end result. it’s the ultimate result that you care about.
id have rather that 1984 never happened, no bull durham, no steve garvey, no rick sutcliffe, no ron cey.
dont get my hopes up. dont give me a taste of the mountaintop unless youre going to go all the way. ask houston what its like to be second place. its not how you play the game, its how you win it as the beasties said so perfectly. and i dont ever want the cubs on the cover of SI unless the words world series champs is over a heaving mass of cubbie pinstripes.
there is so much to hate about the new world champs that i dont even want to start the list because it will never end.
it starts with eddie gadelle and winds its way through greg luzinski wearing those shorts it goes through disco demolition and jimmy piersall calling all the sox wives sluts to every time the sox beat the cubs during interleague play.
theyre worse than the yankees because they dont even try to emit hate, just their presence makes you despise them.
if there was an earthquake in the midwest id want the epicenter to be no on the pitchers mound of US Cellular but in the home team’s locker room.
i didnt even watch the game last night because i knew what would happen. i would see dick cheeney on top of my mother, id see cops outside of my house with a megaphone and a battering ram, id see a special report broadcasting that prohibition had just been overturned again: id see that the sox had swept the astros in the world series, and not only had they won, but they won convincingly – against good teams.
in 84 after the Cubs lost in the playoffs i cried and decided that it would be my duty to manage them to a world series because nobody, obviously, gave a shit about it other than me.
here it is 21 years later and im kicking myself for not following that dream. how could the Sox of all teams get the monkey off their back before the Cubs? how? they dont even have any good players! podsednick, fine. buhrle fine. but seriously, who else? a few pitchers? every team has a few pitchers. bubba sparks as the closer? a double A drunkard?
the team that just bulldozed through the best of the AL and NL would not suprise me if they only went .500 next year. but it doesnt matter, the stink of champagne and theyre being measured for rings.
its like steve bartman all over again. its like bush being reelected. its like finding out theres not only no santa claus but youre getting coal in your stocking.
me and mc brown are gonna make some fliers which is funny because pretty much every company that ive worked with has handouts of some sort and the smaller you are the more fliers you make. i like that.
today we’re going to hand out fliers outside of the Fall Out Boy show at the Wiltern before we go over to Tower Sunset and take pictures of Tsar with the new Buzznet camera.
Best Buy took a nice chunk out of the Buzznet coffers and I was up all night figuring out the thing because im sick of taking shitty pictures and i always end up in the coolest situations and i want to report back to you as perfectly as possible.
so after the Tsar instore im going to get a burrito somewhere and then head over to see Tsar at the Roxy. i was funny yesterday when Steve Jones asked Jeff on the radio who was opening and Jeff said, you know.
Best Buy is a funny place. it doesnt matter if youre buying some blank cds to steal music or a fat expensive camera to change the world, the salespeople really dont give a shit.
I say bring back commissioned salespeople. When I was a lad making my way through junior college I sold tvs and stereos on commission and it not only taught me how to sell (and therefore how to get laid), but it taught me the importance of knowing the product, and how to give great customer service.
Life is all about commission. Life is sales. Coffees for closers, fuck. See this watch? This watch is worth more than your car!
Anyways the dude should have stepped us up to the bigger camera. He should have asked qualifying questions. He should have sold us some lenses and some lens cleaner and some lens filters. He should have asked us why we were using the camera and how fucking killer our company was. He should have said if you like this camera tell your friends where you got it. He should have said when you put the pics on your crazy web site remind them that Best Buy is everywhere and Jimmy sent you.
Instead he popped his gum and went to the back, brought out the box and said if we dont like it we have to pay a 15% restocking fee to get our money back.
He should have said if you dont like it its because youre grown men using this thing somewhat commercially, and when you come back to trade up I will waive the restocking fee if you ask for me.
For even in non-commission sales you should try to build a customer base, a relationship, because as those jingle jangle bells of Christmas quickly approach do you want to deal with 25 customers a day who are gonna ask you ridiculous questions based out of a lack of trust, or do you want to deal with 35 customers who say Jimmy thanks for letting us know that the new blah blah blah is in, goddamn do i love that cam, what i need is a little buddy that attatches to the lens cap so i dont lose it – oh and a plasma tv for my boom boom room.
tomorrow is Fitzmas and if i dont kiss a pretty girl tonight Lord knows five of them are gonna come running to my house to kiss me tomorrow.
Al Franken was on Jon Stewart the other day and Jon asked him who the courageous democrats were and Al thought and thought and came up with one in North Dakota and a few more and Jon said, I’ll wait.
And only after the break did Jon tell the crowd that Al said Barrack Obama but that may have been a joke.
But whats not a joke is the original George Bush said that outting a CIA agent is treason and if you committ treason during a time of war you get executed, so I will have to agree with Al who said that he doesnt think it would be good for the country if Rove or Scooter or Cheney gets executed.
Amazon.com has introduced a new subscription model for their Prime Membership benefits. Previously priced at $79 Amazon will be moving to a $7.99 / month pricing model. This will increase the yearly cost but they are adding so many more benefits.
Now why am I talking about Amazon? Well for small businesses who produce quality custom items Prime Membership shipping has been used in the past to provide huge savings in shipping costs. This in conjunction with Amazon FBA services can truly take your home based or small business to the next level. One of the biggest things from my point of view is the starting of Canadian FBA services.
Prime Membership free 2 day express shipping + Canada FBA = Huge benefits for home based and small businesses.
The last few months have been exciting ones for your Austin Expunction Attorney. The dust is starting to settle regarding what the new Texas expunction law means for Travis County citizens seeking expungement in Austin. More on that later, but for now here is the synthesized version of the two bills that changed the expunction statute as of 9-1-2011. This post covers only Art. 55.01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with a person’s right to expunction – who is eligible, what the new timelines are, and a few new restrictions on eligibility for expungement.
A few points about the new timelines for expunction – 180 days for Class C misdemeanors, 1 year for Class A or B misdemeanors, 3 years for felonies.
1) The new timelines for expungement that everyone has been buzzing about are of very limited utility. First, the new timelines apply only to cases that have not been filed – that is, where there was an arrest, but no indictment or information filed formally charging an offense to be expunged. This is rarely the case, unless either there was a mistake (which is covered in a separate area that was operable under the old law anyway), or a situation where, for whatever reason, the State dropped the ball and forgot to file the charges. In the latter case, requesting an expunction before the statute of limitations runs is akin to poking the State with a sharp stick, saying “ha, ha, I’m entitled to an expunction now” and basically daring them to file charges they forgot to file in the first place. Because the statute of limitations has not run, they can do that all day long and you shoot yourself in the foot.
2) Let’s say you get away with it – you request your early expunction and they don’t file the charges. Unless you get the prosecutor to “certify” that the files are not needed, they can keep their records, and so can the “applicable law enforcement agency”, under 55.02 Sec. 4(a-1). This could mean the arresting agency, but could also conceivably be any law enforcement agency named in the statute. So, without that certification, what appears to be an expunction is not an expunction at all. What’s worse, in order to make it a full expunction, you would have to wait until the statute of limitations runs and then petition for an additional expunction, which entails another round of court costs and filing fees.
3) Let’s say you wait out the new timeline, then get certification from the State. Isn’t that a benefit of the new timelines? Not really, considering 55.01(b)(2), a new provision that allows the prosecutor to recommend expungement at any time, regardless of any timeline or whether a case has been filed.
So in short, if you want to get an expungement without waiting until the statute of limitation runs, your best relief comes from the recommendation procedure in 55.01(b)(2), and not from the new timelines. I don’t know when you would ever want to file for the “non-expunction expunction” you would get under the new timeline without certification.
(a) A person who has been placed under a custodial or noncustodial arrest for commission of either a felony or misdemeanor is entitled to have all records and files relating to the arrest expunged if:
(ii) pardoned or otherwise granted relief on the basis of actual innocence with respect to that offense, if the applicable pardon or court order clearly indicates on its face that the pardon or order was granted or rendered on the basis of the person’s actual innocence; or
(2) the person has been released and the charge, if any, has not resulted in a final conviction and is no longer pending and there was no court-ordered community supervision under Article 42.12 for the offense, unless the offense is a Class C misdemeanor, provided that :
(A) regardless of whether any statute of limitations exists for the offense and whether any limitations period for the offense has expired, an indictment or information charging the person with the commission of a misdemeanor offense based on the person’s arrest or charging the person with the commission of any felony offense arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested:
(a) at least 180 days have elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a Class C misdemeanor and if there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested;
(b) at least one year has elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a Class B or A misdemeanor and if there was no felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested;
(c) at least three years have elapsed from the date of arrest if the arrest for which the expunction was sought was for an offense punishable as a felony or if there was a felony charge arising out of the same transaction for which the person was arrested; or
(d) the attorney representing the state certifies that the applicable arrest records and files are not needed for use in any criminal investigation or prosecution, including an investigation or prosecution of another person; or
(ii) if presented at any time following the arrest, was dismissed or quashed, and the court finds that the indictment or information was dismissed or quashed because the person completed a pretrial intervention program authorized under Section 76.011, Government Code, or because the presentment had been made because of mistake, false information, or other similar reason indicating absence of probable cause at the time of the dismissal to believe the person committed the offense, or because the indictment or information it was void; or
(B) prosecution of the person for the offense for which the person was arrested is no longer possible because the limitations period has expired.
(a-1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person may not expunge records and files relating to an arrest that occurs pursuant to a warrant issued under Section 21, Article 42.12.
(a-2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person who intentionally or knowingly absconds from the jurisdiction after being released under Chapter 17 following an arrest is not eligible under Subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)(a), (b), or (c) or Subsection (a)(2)(B) for an expunction of the records and files relating to that arrest.
(b) Except as provided by Subsection (c), a district court may expunge all records and files relating to the arrest of a person who has been arrested for commission of a felony or misdemeanor under the procedure established under Article 55.02 if:
(C) acquitted by the court of criminal appeals or, if the period for granting a petition for discretionary review has expired, by a court of appeals; or
(2) an office of the attorney representing the state authorized by law to prosecute the offense for which the person was arrested recommends the expunction to the appropriate district court before the person is tried for the offense, regardless of whether an indictment or information has been presented against the person in relation to the offense.
(c) A court may not order the expunction of records and files relating to an arrest for an offense for which a person is subsequently acquitted, whether by the trial court, a court of appeals, or the court of criminal appeals, if the offense for which the person was acquitted arose out of a criminal episode, as defined by Section 3.01, Penal Code, and the person was convicted of or remains subject to prosecution for at least one other offense occurring during the criminal episode.
(d) A person is entitled to have any information that identifies the person, including the person’s name, address, date of birth, driver’s license number, and social security number, contained in records and files relating to the arrest of another person expunged if:
(1) the information identifying the person asserting the entitlement to expunction was falsely given by the person arrested as the arrested person’s identifying information without the consent of the person asserting the entitlement; and
(2) the only reason for the information identifying the person asserting the entitlement being contained in the arrest records and files of the person arrested is that the information was falsely given by the person arrested as the arrested person’s identifying information.

Twitter announced yesterday that it will be axing its video-sharing platform Vine, four years after its launch.
Twitter has not yet given a reason as to why it has made this move but did announce it was cutting back its workforce following slow growth.
The reason for the slowed growth may be attributed to the rise in similar apps such as Boomerang and Viddy as well as Twitter's acquisition of Periscope.
Vine will close down over the upcoming months and it will be interesting to see if Vine stars such as Jerome Jarre and KingBach will take their work to other platforms and if so, where.
Twitter has announced it is to close its video sharing service Vine about four years after it launched.

I've been diligently (mostly - a couple of times there has had to be a bit of a catch up!) making a star a day since September 27, and I've made 65 so far.
I can't tell you how much fun I'm having with this project! Just the simple act of sitting down for 30 mins each day to make one simple star by hand is so calming, especially when worries come up.
I have a coffee at lunch at my favourite cafe and I make stars. I went home to Cairns recently and I made stars there too. I sit in waiting rooms and glue papers for the following week or make a star. I've made stars that other people have picked the fabrics for. I've made stars while I have breakfast.
I was making a Project 48 block last night where the instruction was to applique the EPP to a background fabric. It's something I do quite often in my EPP projects, but I find when I explain the concept to people, they sometimes don't understand how I do it, or how easy it is. So on finishing this block, I thought I'd do a little photo tutorial to show you.
(And I'll apologise now for the state of my hands and the macro shots. I've been gardening like a mad woman the last couple of weeks so my hands are a mess; and my little Canon camera has a mind of its own on the macro setting, giving me a horrible glamour filter each time. It's like a freaking Doris Day movie every time I look at the photos. Probably best given the state of my hands, but sorry about that.)
Give the back a bit of a press with a hot steamy iron. Don't push back and forth. PRESS. You want to put a permanent crease in those outer shapes, especially.
If you've glue basted as I have, take a cuticle stick (one of the wooden ones you get in packs of 3 at Priceline) and gently use it to lift the fabric from the paper. It will kind of pop.
If you have used a scant amount of glue, kept the glue away from the edge, and used a decent seam allowance, this will be easy. If you haven't, then you're doing EPP wrong. Sorry, but you are. I'll come by another time and show you how to EPP properly, I promise.
This is the back of the block after all the papers have been removed. Don't worry about the seam allowances that have lifted, because ...
... you'll get the chance to give them a bit of a press. Again, PRESS, don't move the iron back and forth. You want those seams to maintain integrity. If any of the seams move and go a bit skewiff, just use your fingers to re-position them and press them gently back into place (preferably without burning your fingers). Easy!
Grab your spray starch of choice. Mine is Crisp because I can get it easily at my IGA. Yours is probably something else a lot cooler and funkier. It doesn't really matter.
Give the front a quick spray of the starch and press with a dry iron. Do the same with the back, pressing so you don't dislodge all the fine work you have done with your seam integrity :).
Take your background fabric, and press it in quarters and open it back out so that you have registration lines for placing the EPP on top of it.
Roxanne basting glue is your new little friend. I use the one with the steel nozzle because it makes gluing minimal and accurate. Very important!
Fold your positioned EPP block gently forward at the half way line without moving it off the position you placed it in. Gently dab a little dot of glue inside the seam line, just on the corners will do it. This is where it pays to have a 3/8 inch seam allowance on your EPP. Trust me - you do NOT want this glue anywhere near where your needle will be because it when it is hard it is damn near impossible to get your needle through it and your will curse this technique forever and ever.
Now flip the bottom half back and dot with glue again. Don't forget to also add glue at the seam allowance near the centre line. Flip it back...
Find your best matching thread. I use Superior Egyptian cotton exclusively for all my applique because it's bloody lovely. And no one is even paying me to say that. I get it in the donuts in all the colours because I do so much applique in so many bright colours. But other people swear by Aurifil 50/2 cotton, or silk, or Superior bottom line. Use whatever you can afford and whatever suits the work you do.
As for needles I only ever use Clover Gold Applique No. 10. I tried the Hiroshima Tulip needles but they weren't as bendy for my style of applique (I swear by Tulips for EPP though). Again, use the needle that suits you the best.
Knot your thread and come in from the back. Start a little beneath the applique, and just catch a couple of threads at the seam fold.
I do a stitch every 2-4 mm. Depends on the curves an intricacy. But this is an EPP block with straight edges - every 4-5 mm will do the trick.
The points are important. Make sure you take a stitch at each one to secure it. If you don't, your points can invert when you wash or iron the block again.
Keep going until the whole block is appliqued. You can choose to cut the back out if you like, later. Just carefully trim 3/8 inch inside the stitching lines with sharp scissors, making sure you don't cut through the front part.
Please ask any questions in the comments below and I will answer them there. Hopefully you'll find this tutorial helpful!

We’re learning about dance in PE this half term and we have been following different movements with guidance from a BBC podcast. Unfortunately we had some technical difficulties and this wouldn’t work so instead we spontaneously made up our own lesson! First we paired up and mirrored each other’s movements, making sure we stayed in time. We then created larger groups and began rehearsing a dance routine to the tune of ‘Happy’. At the end of the lesson, we performed our routines to each other and spoke about what we liked about each group. What a lot of fun we had!
I in joyed the dance that I did when IT was PE time. My favourite part was when I did crab and when I did the tummy thing tat was really fun. And it was a paragraph.
Drill is a mesmerizing dance tradition dating back centuries - and is still performed at this school.

It’s been two years since the night that changed shley's life and two years of hell for Derek. When it all comes to a head at Thanksgiving, will these siblings be able to salvage their relationship? From the award-winning author of Some Boys comes an unflinching examination of rape culture that delves into a family torn apart by sexual assault.
It’s been two years since the night that changed Ashley’s life. Two years since she was raped by her brother's teammate. And a year since she sat in a court and watched as he was given a slap on the wrist sentence. But the years have done nothing to stop the pain.
It’s been two years of hell for Derek. His family is totally messed up and he and his sister are barely speaking. He knows he handled it all wrong. Now at college, he has to come to terms with what happened, and the rape culture that he was inadvertently a part of that destroyed his sister's life.
When it all comes to a head at Thanksgiving, Derek and Ashley have to decide if their relationship is able to be saved. And if their family can ever be whole again.
Ashley’s hated me for a couple of years now and it’s okay. I wanted her to hate me and did whatever I could to make it happen. Of course, that was before I knew what hate really meant. Now that I get it, I can’t change it, can’t undo all the shit I did, can’t fix what went wrong. So I suffer.
See, hate is a meaningless word. Everybody tosses the word around like it’s confetti, diluting it, rendering it about as effective as a Band-aid over an amputated limb to describe how they feel about every little thing that annoys them. They hate this song, that food, that person, or this movie. They hate homework, hate their teachers, hate their parents. They hate this team and that game. They hate every damn thing but nobody has even the smallest clue what hate really means unless they’re the object of it.
Hating somebody is more than you stop caring about them, and it’s more than not wanting to see that person ever again. It’s this need—an urge you can barely control—to make that person suffer. True hate goes all the way down to your bone marrow. Sometimes, it’s glacier cold and infinitely patient; other times, it’s surface-of-the-sun hot and bullet fast.
Ashley hates me in that glacier cold, slow-moving kind of hate. It leaves me permanently frost-bitten and has this really annoying habit of shadowing me around even when she can’t. Like right now—I’m surrounded by flyers. One was slipped under my dorm room door, another was stuck on the exit door of my building, the third was stuffed into my hand when I ordered some breakfast and this one is folded into one of those little tent cards and placed on top of every single table in the dining hall. I’ve been on campus at Rocky Hill University—several states and hundreds of miles away from my sister—for a few weeks, relieved to be away, to be anonymous, to be on my own. Mom and Dad wanted to come with me, set up my dorm room, have the big sloppy farewell like they did when Justin left for college four years before, but I wanted no part of that. I just wanted to be gone. Free. When Dad got the last of my crap into the car and asked if I’d said my goodbyes to everybody, I’d said yes.
I’d tried to say goodbye to Ashley. She held up a hand and said. “Just go.” It had cut deeply, but I knew I deserved it, so I did.
I’d climbed into the passenger seat. Mom came to the front door and waved as Dad pulled out of the driveway. Ashley stood behind her, freezing me with that same cold, dead stare she’d been saving just for me since the trial. I kicked back, happy to be rid of her for the next four years.
There will be guest speakers and live music and a candlelight vigil for all the survivors of sexual assault. I flip it over to read my favorite part: Are you a guy against rape? Join GAR today!
Oh, and the coach informed us the entire football team would don special uniforms for that game, showing our support.
I crumble up the collection of flyers into a single giant ball and shove my breakfast aside, my stomach churning up acid. I was already planning on being hurt, injured, or maybe both that day.
I glance up into the smiling face of Brittany Meyers, my girlfriend. We actually met in high school but didn’t hook up until we both arrived here. “Hey, Britt.” I sit up a little straighter, shove thoughts of my sister the hell out of my brain. Brittany’s hot in that girl-next-door way. Her long blond hair’s tied up in a loose knot with strands hanging loose. She’s wearing a tank top, shorts and flip-flops and her toes are painted an electric green and my mouth goes suddenly sand-paper dry. Happens every time.
“What’s this?” She indicates my balled up collection of flyers and I shrug. Understanding dawns a second later. “Oh. The rally.”
She slides into the chair opposite mine, covers my hand with hers and my whole body heats up. “Derek, you’re the best person to be at that rally. You get it. A lot of guys claim they get it and have no clue. But you do.”
I look into her big blue eyes for a minute and finally decide she believes her own bullshit. And then I decide she’s right. I do have a clue. In fact, I have the whole mystery solved. And because I do, there’s no way in hell I’m going anywhere near that rally because I don’t need the entire university knowing I’m Derek Lawrence, the guy whose sister is the Bellford High School Rape Victim.
Ashley was barely fourteen when it happened. A minor. So her identity was protected. But she took her story public, posting a detailed account to her do-it-yourself website. And she included my role in it. Now, everybody from feminist bloggers to Matt Lauer knows our names.
Yep. The Derek Lawrence that played a stupid game that got his sister raped and then told a court of law that to go easy on her rapist. The same Derek Lawrence who drove away and left her standing alone in an empty parking lot, putting the whole friggin’ ordeal into motion.
Self-hatred runs another ice cold finger across my bare skin and I shiver, reminding myself I deserve this…deserve every second of it.

Today, she’s the award-winning author of edgy, realistic, gut-wrenching contemporary and young adult romance.

Patty lives on Long Island with her family in a house that, sadly, lacks bookcases.

We were sitting in the pamnenert seats, on the fourth row ... and yeah, kind of on the opposite side from where you were. We thought about going down onto the stadium 'floor' and grabbing some seats there instead, but decided against it ... we wouldn't hear any better down there :-) and obviously we wouldnt be able to get close enough to see much more of the stage than we already did - we'd still be mainly watching the screen - in fact we might see a little less down there since we'd have a bunch of heads in front of us. :-) And as you know Ane9a is pretty tall so she likes bleacher seats better than floor seats; then she knows she isn't blocking anyone's view. (Sorry, operafantomet!! ;-)Yup, they had tote bags! And I got me one! When did you buy stuff? Maybe they were out by then and had taken the bag down off the wall? I bought my stuff during the interval, they seemed to have a pile of them then.Yeah, both Aftenposten and Dagsavisen wrote it up. But I totally understand the others boycotting it. I mean, 'now, in order to be allowed to do your job of providing us with free publicity, you must sign this contract in accordance with the laws of the State of California' - WTF?? Maybe they can pull off that shit back where they come from but I'm happy to know it's not flying here.I'm hoping it's management and not Cohen who's behind that unfortunate decision.
Nice idea with the scanning Rohan.My only coercnn would be the size of the files, especially since some internet conenctions abroad can be slow. I'd be more tempted to put the docuemnts in wordpad, or within the email as text to ensure you dont have any download issues.

Over three months after Austin Clay proved the second guy to smash up the current President's little piece of Hollywood Boulevard, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge gave the no-contest pleading vandal a day in county jail and three year's probation. NBC 4 reported that, in February 2017, James Otis pleaded no contest to felony vandalism in that case. According to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, Clay, a resident of Glendale, Calif., was sentenced to one day in county jail, 20 hours of community service, and three years of formal probation.
Clay is also required to go to counseling and needs to "pay restitution of $9,404.46 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce" in accordance with a plea agreement, the DA's office said.
Hollywood is no fan of Donald Trump and it seems that taking a pickaxe to the once Celebrity Apprentice host's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame will only get you a slap on the wrist.
"He was just, like, it was his business to be tearing up the ground", witness Patricia Cox toldCBS 2 News, adding that she thought he was a construction worker. Given not even a day in jail, the self-described activist was also ordered to pay $3,700 to the Hollywood Historic Trust and $700 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to fix the damage done to Trump's star.
"I think that the repercussions of it were only positive", he said. During Trump's presidential campaign, his star was spray-painted and surrounded by a 6-inch wall - a dig at his proposal to build a wall at the Mexico border - and smashed with both a sledgehammer and, yep, a pickax.

They start in the first Halloween episode in the middle of season two. I just rewatched the series, trust me, there is absolutely no point combing through any of the episodes before that for clues, they clearly had no clue who was going to be A until 2B. The leaves only like 12-ish episodes with clues and they're actually pretty obvious. Things like Mona hacking into the principal's computer, giving Hanna one of her old cell phones, and things she says that hint towards her knowing more than she lets on.
I know there are many times Hanna would ignore her or ditch her, Mona would get jealous and then A would set up one of the girls somehow.
I thought some of the hints could help us put together hints or theories for these last few seasons and Charles/all the villians.
When Mona sends out a song over the radio to Hannah from "your bff A". That is pretty literally correct.
When Spencer met with Wren and Hanna was in the car and the guy on the radio said this next song is for Hanna from her best friend A I don't need you anymore is a clue to Mona too.
When we saw someone in the boat the night Caleb had birthday we saw like there was someone in the water keeping an eye on Hanna's and Lucas' conversation and then we see Mona and Noel coming and they're wet.
In season one where A hit Mona, it was to Camp Mona where everybody should wear a hoody (A-hoody). Also pretty obvious since Hanna and Mona no longer were friends.
And I guess just being non-suspicious make you wonder. Lucas and Mona were shown as the nerds who were victimized by Alison. With Lucas, the writers made him overly angry, and with Mona, she seemed too calm and forgiving for someone like her who likes to complain.
I thought the gum was a weak clue. Many people chew gum (Spearmint). Just because there was a gum wrapper in the diary, it doesn't really pinpoint to Mona, but the writer had to find some way for Spencer to figure out it was Mona.
Did anyone actually suspect Mona? I didn't have a chance to guess because I spoiled myself on Wikipedia. (I had to read Wikipedia to make sure it wasn't a supernatural show, and I read too much. ;P)
I prefered Mona as A because she was really part of the show, we saw her in majority of episodes in seasons 1 and 2, not like Cece as Big A.
2) The motive was very weak. Given all the things she did to the girls, we can't get a better motive than "Because you stole Hanna from me"??
You mean in 6B, as this new Big Bad ?! Like an ultimate and desperate revenge against Charlotte, Alison and the Liars who will lie for her ?
Believe it or not, YES. I always thought it was Mona, but started having my doubts around the time of the reveal. Thanks to the misleading greenhouse scene, I assumed at the time that Paige was the best candidate. There is no way that Mona could have smashed the side mirror on her car with one punch...
Even so, the thing about Mona being "A" was that "A" did so many things that would benefit Mona. I read the first book by the time the show came out, but stayed away from the others until "A" was revealed. In the first book, I could tell that like in episode 1, Hanna was caught shoplifting but NOT Mona?... The Wizard of Oz theme with Mona was a huge clue, the "I Don't Need You Anymore" song from her best friend "A", the Jungle Red lipstick that Mona was flaunting to Hanna two episodes before the writing on the mirror in 1x04... Yes, Jenna had the same lipstick in the next episode, but MONA HAD IT FIRST.... It even got a callback in the UnmAsked episode when Mona was applying Toffee Tango lipstick in the school courtyard. The lipstick kiss smear on the tarot card in the homecoming dance was a give-away that "A" was a girl, and when Mona was angry at Hanna over the birthday dilemma, she got damn sloppy as "A".... She had "A" send Mona Vanderwaal a text message out of the blue to further her plans and make Hanna miserable. But more importantly, before this even happened, she gave invites to Camp Mona hoping to see all the girls there, then walks off. As soon as the girls tell Hanna they weren't going, "A" messages them and gives them a reason to show.
This was a big one for me, and PLL writers learned to not make this mistake again.... In the episode following Hanna being hit by the car, literally EVERY visitor looked suspicious except for the four girls and MONA.... I'm not even kidding, it was hilarious. The big suspect is Noel, they make Lucas look like "A" as he creeps into the room to see Hanna after hours, Sean drops off orchids but doesn't appear in the episode, Melissa seems suspiciously fake when she's consoling Spencer about Hanna being hit by the car, and Ian looked like he just didn't care about Spencer at all. EVEN HANNA'S MOTHER ends up sending the girls a text to see Hanna by a BLOCKED NUMBER, making her look suspicious as well. This leaves Mona, who conveniently waves a white flag and shares an emotionally tender moment with Hanna as they rekindle their friendship together... Mona apologized to Hanna, and "A" apologized to Hanna on the cast... SO many clues in that one episode...
When Hanna was recovering in the next episode, Mona throws Hanna a party. Hanna knows about the hidden lasagna cash, and while Noel looks suspicious of being the one who stole it, he is NOT the one who planned the party... Mona was... so the opening was hers.
We also got clues that the PLLs didn't... In Careful What U Wish 4, Aria's mom sees "A" and hands her the gloves and coat (it was a coat before it was a hoodie). Based on the way she interacted with "A", she didn't know her personally, and the size of the coat and gloves AND interaction implied that Ella was talking to a teenager. So someone who goes to Rosewood High... We meticulously lived through "A" texts to get a feel for how this person communicates... Mona is the only one who uses the phrase "clue me in". She said it to Hanna once in 1x10 "[...] got a text from 'A', whoever that is, cluing me in onto the real reason you got skinny last summer". And then, in 2x11, Emily got a text from "A" that said "Clue Ella in, and I'll let you out." These little details mattered before the dialogue in PLL started to repeat itself a little bit more in later seasons... We learn in that same episode that Dr. Sullivan's file on "A" puts her at about 17 years old, so that crossed off a huge amount of suspects. I think I noticed that the partial birth date was also close to the date that Mona hosted Camp Mona on.
Paying close attention to the Halloween episode was key. It was the birth of "A", so "A" was sure to be sloppy at first with no experience. Mona was tormented by Ali, and then later that day, "A" sends her a calling card of a threat with the same motive. Mona told Ali that Ali didn't know her, but that she WILL... We hadn't known of any indication that Mona made herself known to Alison... unless she did it as the person who contacted Alison that Halloween and was about to make her presence both known and feared. Mona's Catwoman costume was also black and chic similar to the style of "A" and Jenna.
New clues that I'm seeing after knowing the story (so I guess they don't really count) are that Mona and Jenna were friends... "A", Jenna, and Garrett were all involved with the game because of the events in Over My Dead Body where the girls were caught with the murder weapon. We knew Jenna couldn't be "A" and Garrett was not a teenager... so neither one could be "A". Noel started dating Mona, and when he was, Mona took him along for some of her schemes... In A Hot Piece of "A", she takes Noel for a dip in the lake conveniently while something terrible is happening to Hanna in the boat... You can see her leading Noel away after shrugging off what the PLLs said about looking for her FRIEND HANNA... Noel is notorious for doing a poor job at keeping his girlfriends' secrets... He spilled the truth about Emily being at a diner in the truth or dare game which screwed over Jenna... He sabotages them because the real person he's out for is himself, and Alison to a degree. Later, there's an odd scene with Hanna and Mona going out for some retail therapy, and Mona sees Jenna and Noel in a restaurant through a window... She looks nervous as all hell, and we have no reason to think why this might be the case... And then it becomes clear. She didn't want Noel spilling her secrets to someone as dangerously conniving as Jenna. Jenna knew Mona was "A", but wanted to get inside information from Noel to use it against her. This, and because Noel left her for Jenna, is why Mona tried to burn Jenna alive in the DiLaurentis house as "A". She knew too much and needed to be silenced, and it also worked well for framing Garrett since Jenna had possession of page 5 of Alison's autopsy report, and was a significant threat to him.
I could go on, but I'll leave you with one final giveaway: Mona sending "A" texts to herself was very random of "A" to do, unless it helped "A" infiltrate the PLLs' inner circle. Mona acted as if it was the first time she'd heard of someone named "A" sending texts, but I'll admit she could have forgotten about "A" from her birthday almost a year ago prior. Even so, she also seemed to be faux afraid of "A" to garner sympathy from the PLLs and join their group like Mona always wanted. Mona has moments of sheer brilliance and cunning, but then drops it all to obviously play dumb for the crowd. She was obviously braver than she let on, and when she meekly raised her hand to say she had an idea during a brainstorming session, it was obvious she was trying to look weak when she really wasn't. Speaking of which, she sent herself a ridiculously weak "A" text toward the end "Break up Hanna and her hottie or you go back to being a junior high nottie", making it seem like she was faking the texts to join Alison's friend circle. Do not even get me started on her saying to Emily that her days as Nerdy Mona was TWO personalities ago and that she's suddenly a master computer analyst RIGHT before "A" tries to get Caleb framed for hacking school files.
The gum clue was TERRIBLE when all these gems were there for Spencer to pick up on... But it was suspenseful all the same.
Fun fact: Ever notice this season 3 indication that CeCe was "A"? Throughout all of PLL ever since season ONE, we were aware that "A's" handwriting always used distinct letter "T's". Other characters used that writing style, but Hanna only ever made note of it ONCE... When the girls are reading Ali's biology notebook that she and CeCe were writing to each other in, Hanna said to ignore the "G" and look at the "T" in the handwriting... CeCe's "T's" are distinct enough to separate her handwriting from everyone else... which means she was a prime suspect for "A".
Just a question for you: Did you believe Mona's motive that she was over Alison, and that her motive for being A was because the liars stole Hanna from her??
In my opinion, there is little to no evidence to support this motive. You can say when Hanna ditched Mona, A would act, but doesn't A always act anyway?
The show was full of investigation into Alison's private life, and Alison being a bully. It seemed like A's motive had to do with what Alison did to him/her, and how the liars just went along with her. Just think about the key suspects (Jenna, Toby, Lucas, Melissa, Ian, etc.) - they were all affected by Alison. Then in the end, all there was to the motive was "I'm over Alison. This is because you stole Hanna from me."?? When were we shown any evidence that A became A really was about Hanna? Do you buy this motive?
Mona brought the liars back together by starting the game in the first place. Hanna got together with the rest of the girls not to spite Mona but because the girls were all being threatened by a common foe so they naturally rebonded.
To answer your question, I think Mona herself was confused of what she was really so angry about at the time... But no, Mona was NEVER over Ali. I didn't believe that ever since she hallucinated in seeing Red Coat Ali in Radley reading Lolita behind Hanna. Mona was obsessed with Alison, and that obsession was part of what made her become "A". The entire foundation of "A" has always been an obsession with Alison (for both Mona AND CeCe). Mona could have been wearing Ali's skin so to speak in order to throw the girls off, but if anything, it only made her seem even more suspect... The one person we would suspect of being downright obsessed with Alison DiLaurentis was the girl who clearly idolized her prior to her disappearance. Mona couldn't help it... Alison had taken over her life.
The Mona and Alison angle has every bit of depth as the Alison and Jenna angle... Ali and Jenna were two sides of the same coin, Ali and Jenna were ultimately in danger of becoming identical in personality. Jenna (what with her literally living in darkness, open fascination with evil, and endless deceit) is a living example of what Alison COULD have turned into if she embraced the sociopath in her and never changed her ways. Everyone Jenna uses or cares about gets taken away from her... And her being given her sight back only for her to misuse it ended up with her losing everything in the end. Karma follows her closely... Unless she changes, Jenna will end up in her own type of prison similar to how Alison almost literally remained in one.
As for Mona's fixation with Alison, it's prevalent in the show even after the MonA reveal. As I said, Mona hallucinates and sees Alison in Radley, and while drugged, she thinks she's doing everything Alison is telling her to... never bothering to question how Alison is there because she knows how she's still alive. When Hanna visits Mona in the next episode, the last thing we hear her ask Hanna about is Alison... Mona wore an Alison mask in the 3x13 Halloween episode, and whenever Mona is talking to her boss like in both season 3 finales, she seems quite happy to be working for her, despite the fact that this was MONA'S game, and anyone else trying to call the shots would have BEEN shot by MonA. If there's one thing we know about her, it's that she NEVER steps down... And much later in season 3 when Spencer asks Mona how she can know Alison was never pregnant, she briefly replied with "Ali told me" in that same admiring way that Nerdy Mona used to convey. It really came to a head in 5A when Mona was trying to preempt Alison's rise back to power. She outright admitted to Hanna that Alison scares her to death, even now. Paige put it very well when she said that Mona became the very thing she was afraid of... and in a 5B episode, Hanna recalls a flashback where she asked Mona what would happen if Alison ever did come back... and it clearly unnerved her enough to lie awake at night afterward.
The Alison obsession will NEVER falter... because Mona has a hard time changing from what Alison turned her into. Hanna even tried to prevent it from happening to someone else in the Christmas special because those kinds of scars don't heal, they can only be prevented. She said at the end of that scene that people don't change and that they just get better at hiding it... just like Mona did in the recent scene between her and Alison in the time jump.
You can spot signs of Mona genuinely feeling envy over Hanna's friends and being a bitch about Lucas when Hanna spends less time with her. In the Homecoming Dance, Mona warned Hanna not to choose her friends over her. In 1x10, Mona had high standards for her birthday that included Hanna being there for all of it... and when Hanna couldn't do it, Mona drew the line. She ended up ruining Hanna's reputation, uninviting her from her party, and hitting her with a car... So in Mona's mind, Hanna DID screw up pretty damn bad by not spending enough time with her... You also might notice that in the finale of season 1 AND the finale of season 2 both, Mona is walked out on by the PLLs for weak excuses... leaving her to say "So it's just me. Again." There's also 4x01 when there's no room for Mona to sit with the girls at the pew, and 5x10 when she isn't able to console Spencer or the girls the way the PLLs did when they found out Ali was trying to frame her for Bethany's murder.
So all in all, it's both. Mona will ALWAYS be obsessed with Alison, she will never be over the girl she idolized in her chilhood and who she was burned by in all the worst ways... It turned her into someone whose life has been (mostly) negatively impacted forever. And at the same time, Mona was jealous of the girls taking Hanna from her. When you're all alone, you suddenly have all the time in the world to think and scheme. Mona's so good at stalking people because she yearned to be with them... making it perfectly comfortable for her to watch people when they don't even know they're being watched.
She's had too much practice, too much heartache, and too much time to perfect her plans born from anger... all because of Alison's brutal rejection and the alienation by her peers.
Just rewatched a few episodes from Season 1. I now really dislike the "song dedication on the radio to Hanna" clue.
On more than one occasion (and not just to Hanna), A called the liars her "BFF's". The first time was when the liars were in the woods trying to build a shrine for Ali and they heard some noises. Then they all got a texts like "Listen up, BFF's. It's hunting season and I'm on the hunt for liars" (or something like that). Also, when Noel got suspended for cheating, Aria got a texts from A taking credit for it, and it was signed "Your BFF, A". Hence it wasn't just Hanna whom A referred to as her BFF.
A better way to interpret this is that A seems to be someone who wants to get in on the liars' friend circle, someone outside looking in. When Mona sent herself A texts so she could join in on the liars, that was a major clue. Also, A was pretending to be Ali, and Mona was obsessed with Ali.
In 2x02, the PLLs were ordered by Dr. Sullivan to spend some time apart to reassess their own individual lives. When they're forced to sit at different tables, they get a text from MonA saying "Look at you, all alone in a crowd. I win! xo -A" We know that the first time we chronologically see Mona is in a cafeteria where Alison shuns her to go sit at the "loser table". That was a huge clue as to "A's" motive... If THAT was what "A" considered to be winning as opposed to torture, then "A's" gripe was being treated like an outsider and being cast out by her peers or those she wanted to be friends with. The writers didn't dwell on this though, or the fans would have caught on for sure. ;)
Just discovered another very obvious Mona clue while watching Never Letting Go (the fashion show episode). Noel got all the suspicion pointed to him when he couldn't stop the "Bitch is dead" thing from playing, and also when he couldn't answer to Aria's accusation of "the unplanned finale". However, who told Spencer to give the CD to Noel? Mona! Such an obvious clue that I missed, even though I already knew Mona was A from spoilers.
Awesome find. Definitely a huge "the bolder the move, the less anyone questions it" moment that Mona no doubt channeled her inner Ali for.
To a lesser extent, when Mona walked the runway the second time, she looked much darker and edgier than usual, and the music that was playing takes a shift to actually warn the viewers that she's dangerous. Watch again to see for yourself. ;)
November is here -- and so are the fun festivities leading into the holiday season. From exhibits to festivals, and
Beautiful Booze, Beautiful Bars Okay we LOVE to drink in Chicago, but besides the beautiful booze, we also have some
It could very well be that I'm so tired of these characters after nine seasons that putting two strong guest stars (all right, fine, one guest star and one new series regular who's been mostly M.I.A. this season) on in the same week is enough to tip the balance of an episode to the win column.
The first guest star was Andrew Rannells of Book of Mormon and The New Normal fame, who injected some great energy into the episode as a devilish singer who likes to screw up the relationships of people he just charmed. (Nice touch: he bases his fake tragic backstory on the death of Disney parental characters, including Nemo's mom and King Mufasa.) It's not a character that makes any sense, but Rannells sells it so well, and the disruption grenades he lobs, pitting Robin against Lily and Ted against Barney over secrets they've been hiding, are a lot of fun to watch detonate. It doesn't hurt that he exits each devastating bit with a perfectly blasé line, "Later, skaters!" being my favorite.
About those revelations: Lily learns that Robin is on Marshall's side on the whole "judgeship versus moving to Rome" issue, and that Robin thinks Lily's been shifting the attention to herself all wedding weekend. Barney is genuinely hurt to learn that Ted was going to just skip town to Chicago right after the wedding without letting his (not really) best friend know in advance.
In a nice twist to tie things together, it turns out that The Mother knows Darren. In fact, she's in the same band of business-school musicians, and her role in the group keeps getting minimized by this guy from singer to glorified announcer; she calls Darren "The Devil," and has stolen his van but is too nice to really do anything to it. She explains all of this to Marshall, who gives her a pep talk about standing up for herself. She never has to, unfortunately. By the time she gets up the nerve to say something, Darren has accidentally broken a third bottle of very expensive scotch and gets punched by Ted. That seems a bit excessive just for breaking a bottle, but we have to assume the gang has already figured out that Darren has been pitting them all against each other. Otherwise, Ted must be drunk and crazy. Darren, sporting the world's least convincing pre-shiner, quits the band. Pleased, The Mother sends a double of very nice scotch to the best man, Ted, whom she has yet to meet. Like Rannells, Cristin Milioti funnels some much-needed new energy into each of her scenes. She's fun to watch; let's hope she doesn't disappear again.
And wrapping up (we hope) one of this story's more pointless storylines, Marshall finally gets to Farhampton. Rather than fight, Lily and Marshall do a callback to early in the show's history and put their argument on pause so they can embrace.
Ted Still Pines For Robin...Or Does He? It comes up again when Barney finds out that Ted is moving to Chicago the day after the wedding. At least Ted doesn't go on and on about it, but Barney can tell by Ted's face that Robin is the reason he's leaving.
Robin And/Or Barney Shows Signs Of Cold Feet Before The Wedding Nope; each of them was too busy having it out with Lily and Ted, respectively.
Guest Star From A Past Season Pops Up (Ex-Boyfriend, Old Boss, Ranjit The Cab Driver) Not so much this week, unless you count The Mother as a past-season guest star (she only appeared once at the end of last year, and is considered a series regular this season).
Baby Marvin Does Something Cute And/Or Disruptive) After being roughly jostled in his Baby Björn while Marshall ran toward Farhampton Inn, Marvin utters his first words in the van that The Mother stole: "Skunk junk." Now that's cute.
Gay Jokes About Barney’s Brother James Stinson (Wayne Brady)? No new James material this week, just a glimpse of him in flashback from a previous episode.
Ted Moves A Tiny Step Closer To Meeting The Mother Yes! Finally! The Mother picks up Marshall and Marvin and makes it to Farhampton Inn. She doesn't meet Ted, but she does buy him a drink, sight unseen, after he punches Darren.
Ted Is An Insufferable, Pretentious Prick About, Architecture, Wedding Etiquette, English Literature, Or Any Other Pedantic Bullshit Ted doesn't come right out and say it, but you just know that if he knew the scotch The Mother bought him was only 10-year Glen McKenna, he would have spit it out in disgust.
Public Transportation High Jinks The bus breaking down is what prompts Marshall to hike it to Farhampton and meet The Mother along the way.
Pop Song Montage Or Episode Outro Marshall runs to a new version of "Marshall Versus of the Machines" and the episode ends with Forest Whitaker's "Bad Books."
Barney Says Something Inappropriately Dirty About A Hot Woman Because, Come On, Barney Barney's been pretty chaste lately. No dirty talk this week.
"Legend…ary!", "Wait For It…," Or Any Pun On The Word "Bro" Barney calls going to jail for a bro, "Bro-ble, the most noble thing a bro can do for a fellow bro." He also gets a lot of mileage out of the catchphrase "That's the dream."
Retro Video, Instructional Tape, Book, Or Other Multimedia Project Starring Or Created By One Of The Main Characters (Robin Sparkles, Barney As A Fake Astronaut, Etc.) No, because we're not counting Lily's creation the Marshpillow.
Slap Bet The episode's tag concludes with Marshall winding up to deliver the fourth slap as Barney cowers and we get a "to be continued..." YES! YES! YES!
Unanticipated Wedding Hookup Not unless you count the perverse joy Darren gets from fucking with everybody's feelings.

DEMPSEY the dog has stunned vets by surviving a horrific attack in which he was stabbed 21 times, thrown over a garden fence and left for dead.
The “loving and gentle” terrier was not expected to recover from the vicious assault, described by his vet as the worst stabbing case he had ever seen.
But he has delighted his doting owner Claire Wilkinson by surviving three hours of surgery and recovering well enough to be allowed back to his home in Stourvale Road, Southbourne.
Dempsey was staying with Claire’s daughter in Malmesbury Park Road, Charminster a fortnight ago when the attack happened.
There was a trail of blood inside her home, but the six-year-old dog had been thrown over her garden fence and into the bottom of her neighbour’s garden.
It was only because her neighbour had heard the attack taking place that Dempsey was discovered quickly and rushed by police to the PDSA hospital on Castle Lane.
Claire said: “He had stab wounds to his diaphragm, to his pancreas and all down one side. They didn’t think he would last the night.
“I was in shock, I just couldn’t accept that somebody could do something like that to such a loving and gentle dog.
“I look at him now and I can’t help but think about what he went through that night, how he must have suffered. I just can’t imagine the trauma he has been through.”
“I cannot praise them enough,” she said. “The police were fantastic, they acted so promptly in taking him to the PDSA when he was in a critical condition.
“The staff at the PDSA were absolutely brilliant, their dedication was just remarkable and it’s down to that that he is still with us now. I’m so grateful.”
Uwe Holz, senior veterinary surgeon at Bournemouth PDSA PetAid hospital, said: “Dempsey arrived at PDSA having suffered 21 stab wounds to his chest and stomach, two of which were life-threatening.
“The injuries had caused serious damage to several of his internal organs and he was severely traumatised by his ordeal.
“I have treated a small number of stab injuries previously, but this is by far the worst case I have ever seen.

For business owners who are looking to take their business to the next level by going online, choosing a commerce shopping cart model for your online portal can be just as important as having great advertising and great SEO.

Most people need to apply for credit from a financial institution at some stage of their lives, whether it is to buy a home, furniture or other necessities. Some people may find it easy to obtain that loan whereas others may have trouble to qualify for credit. Many clients may want to apply for loans with a bad credit record.

Last year the I had this vision of creating a model maple tree that my preschoolers could tap and pretend to collect sap. I wanted the kids to have some first hand experience before we took them to a local sugar shack.
So I found the largest piece of cardboard I had, and got to work crafting a maple tree. Then I recruited my then five year old to help me practice collecting the sap. He was a bit dismayed at how slow the drips were, but once a puddle of 'sap' collected in the bowl he became excited about the process. As with many of our projects and experiments, I lost interest long before him. He continued to collect the sap for almost an hour and only stopped because his little sister started dumping the sap bucket!
One child gets to stand in the back of the tree and starts the flow of sap by using a pipette to push water into the tap.
The other kids watch as the sap drips from the tap, runs through the plastic tubing, and finally collects into the bucket.
To keep a group of kids interested in the activity, be sure to have plenty of funnels, cups, spoons, strainers, and tubing for them to explore properties of 'sap'.
When I led this activity in my preschool classroom the kids were eager to be the one behind the tree and a line formed as they waited their turn. So I put additional pipettes in the collection bucket and they played there until it was their turn to 'be the tree'.
This activity would be great to try at home. You could use any type of hose and a turkey baster! If you don't have cardboard to make a tree, you could use a grocery bag with a hole cut or a large oatmeal container.
I will do a couple of blog posts in March about the science of maple sugaring and will include sensory play & art projects...so check back!
** Check out the maple tree for yourself at the World Maple Festival on April 28th from 10 a.m. - 4 p.m. in St. Johnsbury, Vermont! The Balch Nature School at the Fairbanks Museum will be leading a pretend "Sap Collecting" activity in the Kid Zone area. More information about the festival can be found at www.worldmaplefestival.org
Such a neat idea! So many concepts can be discussed with the kids with this activity. Looking forward to your follow up posts.
April's passion is helping connect kids to nature. She is the lead teacher of the Balch Nature Preschool at the Fairbanks Museum in Vermont. April has an undergraduate degree in Psychology and a Master’s degree in Education. She is a Vermont licensed Early Childhood Educator and Reading Specialist. April and her husband, Stan, share a passion for spending time outdoors: hiking, gardening, and passing on their love of the natural world to their two young children. Shortly after the birth of her first child, April read the book, Last Child in the Woods, which inspired her to make playing in nature an important part of raising her children. April’s favorite season is early autumn, when the leaves just begin to turn golden colors and apples are ready for harvesting. Her family loves the local fall festivals and going for hikes to photograph the trees.

Changed forum colors and layout to somewhat Prinny colors... I hope some of you like it, if you don't I am sorry : :
Added Senpaiplz's Hitbox chat emotes (except for RIP because I wasn't sure if he wanted that) before WOLF did because I think it's been about two weeks since he asked him about these emoticons. YEAHHAHAHAHH WOOOOOOHOOOO.
If I resized them myself it would've lost the transparency so I asked him if he had smaller versions himself but I guess he missed that tweet or I actually didn't send it.
yo i got photoshop if you need re-sizing just send them to me via drop box or imgur and i will gladly do it quickly
Wow Wolf... When I made the banner I didn't interpret it that way but SURE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!!
A friend wanted an image of Ganesh – Apparently September 5th was a special day dedicated to Ganesh in India, There were many images that could have fit the bill. I liked quite a few, including this one.
I am hesitant to call Ganesh a ‘god’. Cultural differences are too easy to misunderstand. My take on a ‘Western view’ of Ganesh would be that He is regarded the way Roman Catholics regard Saints. They ask Ganesh for help overcoming obstacles, removing obstacles from their lives, blessing them with ‘good luck’.
I should have looked this up, but it looks like ‘Ganesh Chaturthi’ is a Holiday / Celebration Day dedicated to Ganesh.
My friend, Jim W., told me a story related to Ganesh. While he was working part time as a cleaner when he first became a permanent resident in Canada and could legally find work- one of the places he worked was an old textile mill that was in the process of being converted into a ‘Corporate Centre’ / Office Building. The building had some creepy areas, other people who were there at night reported seeing ghosts, experienced being touched and/or pinched when nobody else was in the building.
Jim began chanting “Shri Ram” – a chant he picked up from a recording of music popular with Sufis – which was attributed to Mahatma Gandhi- He said he could feel his own voice vibrating in his chest and then all around him (after several minutes) in an unusually relaxing manner and then received a ‘spontaeneous visualization’ in which Ganesh was dancing, walking along beside him as he dusted, mopped and wet-mopped the floors. A few minutes later his visualization had expanded to include a whole traveling group of Hindu Indian musicians, playing drums and other instruments as they walked along with Ganesh and Jim, clearing the creepy vibrations away with happy smiling feelings and light.
He said he’d never thought of Ganesh as a Dancer- but apparently most Hindu Indians know Ganesh as quite the accomplished dancer.

I’m always looking for new ways to see my world. Norman Vincent Peale was not my favourite philosopher. Sometimes he makes sense.
— Changing habitually resonating thoughts and thought patterns is not all that easy. If you’re fighting against what you believe are your own negative thoughts – you can try to combine those thoughts with the desire to improve and become more positive. Emotions happen quicker and more deeply that what we call “our thoughts” in the human psyche. Our ‘Normal Waking Mind’ tries to define our multi-dimensional world in two dimensional terms. Don’t give up. The negative, “You can’t win-“, “Give up-“, “You’ll never amount to anything-” thoughts that may have been planted in your young mind by egotistical people who don’t know better — are lying to you. — We have no limitations. We are alive here now to prove to ourselves that “Mind Over Matter” is Reality – Your indomitable Spirit, whatever you choose to call it – can overcome anything. { This has been the voice of experience. I seem to be unusually optimistic about this life and the human race tonight/very early this morning. }
— I read a quote on-line earlier, meant for writers – “If writing your book doesn’t keep you up at night – how can you expect that reading it will keep your readers awake at night, too?” { Or something quite near that if I haven’t remembered it 1,000% correctly – } & I think that was James A. Michener who I’ve just nearly quoted. But I’m pretty sure I got the spirit of his intent there –
& Now – the depressing stuff. While politicians are fighting against what would be best for the greatest number of people in favour of fighting to fill their pockets with currency and their egos with power – They’re helping the ‘bad guys’ kill the planet and destroy our future.
— A ‘Clairvoyant’ I met told a hippy who recounted seeing weird monsters standing next to people he knew – and he knew they were real live human beings – were not hallucinations. The ‘monsters’ were beings in another dimension, right here beside us – and some of them can influence our thoughts, feelings, even pressure us to go get drunk and pass out so they might jump into our bodies and have fun at our expense. “If this scares you, good. – Stop taking drugs, stop drinking alcoholic beverages, avoid any medicines that make you feel loopy or woozy – Pray a lot and hang around with positive, highly spiritual people.” — I waited until the doubting hippy left and asked that ‘clairvoyant’ where I could find any highly positive, spiritual people to hang around with and she wrote down a couple of book titles, said I should read them, and talk to her next time I saw her.
— I treasured all three – Reading Ouspensky’s book was a challenge – I felt like I had to restructure my mind and brain in order to stay with it and understand what he was saying. It felt like an exercise in overcoming normal human limitations.
— I read everything I could get my hands on about the Sufis and felt like they were under-cover agents for sanity in a very insane world.
— Then, reading the “Autobiography of a Yogi” felt like connecting with the ultimately merciful, and loving essence of the Heart of all Creation and made me feel like I was in constant contact with everything worth living for, no matter how strongly I doubted that.
— We’re here to get as close to “God” as we can and to do everything we can to help everything positive in all of Creation manifest Heaven on Earth.

I really was inspired to smile and think there just might be hope for the human race when Usain Bolt and Andre DeGrasse smiled and hugged after coming in first and second in their semi final 200 meter sprint.
— I am no fan of testosterone-poisoned athletes staring and glaring at each other, hoping to ‘psyche-out’ their opponents before games or ‘contests’ in which they try to prove themselves egotistically superior to everybody else in their sport.
— It was good to see the first and second place sprinters in the semi-finals looking like brothers who get along well enjoying themselves –
— Usain Bolt, a Jamaican, has now made history, winning gold medals in 100 meter and 200 meter sprints three times in a row. Tonight, if the Jamaicans win a relay race Usain Bolt will make further history turning his “Triple Double” Gold into a “Triple Triple”.
— And if you understand the above blurb about triple doubles and triple triples, you’re either a dedicated follower of Olympic athletics or someone who has a quick and nimble mind who enjoys learning anything and everything you can. 🙂
*** & When my friend, Doug, invited me to help him and his friends at “Aerendel” Communications with web problems he was having ( he’s dating one of my favourite cousins ) I hadn’t realized that there was another Jim who actually originated the web site(s) and ‘owns’ the name ‘Aerendel’ – which he says came into his mind as a mind-worm { something like an ‘ear worm’ } the first time he read “The Hobbit” by JRR Tolkein – and stayed with him until he thought “a small secluded valley in the sky” was a decent description for a web site, and later, a multi-player game. [ Castles in the Air? / A naive vision of “Heaven”? ] So I’m trying to relieve a bit of confusion by admitting that my birth certificate says, “Hermann James Van Arden” and too many people made fun of “Her-Mann!” and “H. James Van Arden” sounded too much like one of the Watergate crooks. So I asked Doug if “Jim d’Aerendel at Aerendel dot ca” sounded like a decent email name and he smiled. And apparently, the other “Jim at aerendel dot c.a.” didn’t mind – but a couple of my friends wondered why there were two different Jims here – So, now I’ll declare myself as, “h.j.d’a” and hope that doesn’t fry too many brains.

— It’s John Olerud’s Birthday – and it’s also Terry Seguin’s [ host of New Brunswick First / Information Morning out of Fredericton, NB “on CBC Radio One, local Cable TeeVee and live streaming on the web.” ] — Also a couple friends in Connecticut, Including Gail S. and a couple others who don’t want to be reminded that they’re getting older are either celebrating or trying to forget that today is their birthday. —
— We had a thunderstorm yesterday, and my malware program found a couple ‘potentially unwanted’ bits of schnarr in my files et cetera, which is odd, because that’s a computer I don’t connect to the internet much. But anyway, the “kabooms” were loud and I could feel them as well as hear them, so I shut everything down and then had a hard time getting everything back up and running. And when a browser that had been open to twitter came back up there was this photo – or whatever that is up there – that caught my eye, and I’m still checking in to see whose blogs need to have their plug ins and stuff updated, so I thought I’d change the sticky post on my eye candy blog.

Jesse Ventura quoting George Carlin – That probably couldn’t have happened while Jesse was a dedicated Navy Seal. But – you never know. Governor Ventura told us he poo-pooed conspiracy theories before he investigated what happened at the twin towers on September 11th, 2001. Maybe he always had a nearly conscious, but viable, B.S. meter and that one more thing woke him up?

Proposed motion suggests committee to report on alternatives to first-past-the-post system by Dec. 1
— While it looks to a lot of us that political slight-of-hand is alive and well in Canadian politics – Justin Trudeau – who’s been the Prime Minister up here for a little more than 6 months – appears to be keeping a campaign promise to come up with an alternative to the current ‘First Past The Post’ electorial system — by having a committee investigate the feasibility of weighted voting and other possibilities to make Canadian elections a bit more democratic and have the elected officials in the Federal Parliament reflect the over all vote and not just the winners from each ‘riding’.
— For instance: If – in a hypothetical Federal Election: the Liberal party received 35% of the vote, the New Democrats received 25%, the Conservatives received 22%, The Parti Quebecois received 10%, the Green party received 6%, and several smaller parties received the remaining 2% – Then – Sitting members of Parliament should more closely resemble those percentages. — Where the current ‘first past the post’ system might have populated the Parliament with something more like 52% Liberal, 20% Conservative, 18% NDP, 9% PQ, & 1% Green (depending on where the votes were cast and what the local races looked like). { I intentionally had one party get fewer votes than another while winning more seats than that party did in the above fictional results from a fictional election. }
“Maple Match” is a dating service advertizing that they can find Canadian mates for people who might want to escape from a nightmarish Trump Presidency.
— Earlier news items up here – reports from a couple months back – indicated that officials ( or residents? or somebody — ) in several provinces announced that they would be happy to welcome refugees from the U.S. into their communittees if they wanted to escape from the USA if and when DJ Trump became their President.
— New Brunswick’s (Liberal) Premier Brian Gallant announced a new programme to give low income New Brunswick students free tuition at New Brunswick Universities. It was later revealed that this program would benefit about 7,100 students while it took away current tax rebates from between 35,000 to 40,000 students. The new program would reportedly cost $25 Million while cutting the earlier program would save more than $50 Million. -I’m not sure those dollar figures would reflect yearly costs – but that’s my best guess here.

FORT MCMURRAY, Alta. – RCMP have seized some guns following the fire in Fort McMurray, but won’t be a conducting a mass seizure of firearms like they did after the flood in southern Alberta.
Sgt. John Spaans said Tuesday that officers have taken one or two guns found in public places, but are not going into homes looking for more.
& Internet outages have been reported in parts of Atlantic Canada. — Luckily, that hasn’t effected me (yet?)

The contractor has been instructed to complete at least 04 Towers (A2-01, B1-02 & B2-01) in all respects by the year end. He has also been instructed to complete all the external development works for his complete Package so that the Board could consider commencement of Handing Over of DUs of these four Towers along with 07 Towers of Package-I (total 11 Towers) to allottees in a phased manner. While the Handing Over DU in these 11 Towers is in progress the balance 04 Towers would be completed. The PDC for balance 04 Towers is 30 Jun 16.
painting works which are expected to be completed by the year end. The Board has taken up the work of water proofing in one of the lower basement walls which had shown signs of seepages at few places. A specialist Agency was engaged to undertake this work and the work was executed during the monsoon months (Jun-Aug) to check efficacy and the basements have remained dry.
(a) The Utterakhand Electrical Department has issued the contract for completion of overhead electrical works to provide supply from their distribution point to our Project. PDC for this works is likely to be Oct/Nov 15. Completion of this work will ensure availability of main power supply to our project.
(b)	All the external electrical works including the DG sets of 07 Towers have been completed. The work on external electrical (Sub Station & DG Sets) of balance Towers is in progress. PDC - End of the year.
(a)	Release of financial approval from Centre(Niti Ayog) to the State Government for construction of concerete bund adjacent to our project is still awaited. The mattrer is being persued at the highest level with State/Central Government.
(b)	Since the river water has changed the course of flow and is flowing alarmingly close to our boundry wall, the Board has decided to go ahead and construct a Gabion wall as a temporary measure to safe-guard the Project boundary wall. Similar preventive measures has been undertaken by the (PITICUL) electrical sub station on the adjoining plot.
1.	A site visit was undertaken by Principal Director (Works) on 29 Jun 15 to review the progress of works.
2.	Albeit slow, the contractor of Package � II has mobilized resources to complete the essential services. Works in progress include tiling work in the Dwelling Units of B2 towers, works on terrace mumties & lift machine rooms in B2 towers, misc works relating to sewage treatment Plant (STP), construction of approach road etc. Presently, manpower of about 200 labours is working at site and adequate material has been mobilized.
3.	Based on the current assessment of progress of works, the likely timeliness for completion are as under:
(a)	Completion of Phase-I � 10 Towers comprising of 07 towers of Type �A� and 03 towers of Type �B� along with the essential services by Nov 2015 (3rd / 4th Quarter 2015).

1.	Reference is made to a few queries of allottees regarding handing over of dwelling units for project at Prem Nagar Dehradun Phase-II project.
2.	As you are aware during the monsoons of 2013 the basements were flooded with catchment water as the covering of open areas were still being executed. This had resulted into complete halt in the construction activities in the basement and substructure. Also, the services have been adversely affected and the work for services like storm water drains, sewerage and STP (located in the basements) were delayed.
3.	Further the final decision from UPCL for granting the available electrical supply for the project is awaited and lines for the same are being laid. Due to this even after advance stage of completion of external electrification work in the project, energisation is still awaited. However, rigorous follow up is being undertaken by this Board to ensure the said availability at earliest.
4. It may be appreciated that it will not be prudent on our behalf to offer the towers (already in the stage of handing over individually) without provisioning for basic services to be provided for residing in the premises.
5.	In view of the above the completion of project fit for occupation and handing over is likely to be delayed to Oct/Nov 14. The Draw of Lots is also deferred accordingly.

San Diego, California-based Telecommunications and Semiconductors firm; Qualcomm has unveiled three new Snapdragon processors; Snapdragon 429, Snapdragon 439, and Snapdragon 632 SoC at the on-going 2018 Mobile World Congress in Shanghai – designed for smartphones and tablets.
The new processors are claimed to make dual cameras and a few other features more common in mid-range smartphones to help them keep pace with the bells and whistles of premium smartphones considering the fact that they are meant for entry-level devices.
According to the NDTV reports, Qualcomm announced that commercial devices based on Snapdragon 632, Snapdragon 439, and Snapdragon 429 SoCs are expected to launch in the second half of 2018.
“The introduction of Snapdragon 632, 439 and 429 builds off Qualcomm Technologies’ highest-selling mobile platforms and provides users with increased performance and power efficiency, superior graphics, AI capabilities and enhanced connectivity features,” said Kedar Kondap, Vice President, Product Management, Qualcomm Technologies.
Qualcomm has claimed that the processor brings mainstream gaming, 4K video capture, artificial intelligence, and fast LTE speeds.
According to reports online, the processor is built on a 14nm advanced FinFET process technology, boasting up to 40% higher performance thanks to the combination of the Qualcomm Kryo 250 CPU and Qualcomm Adreno 506 GPU.
The processors come with artificial intelligence capabilities that enhance the camera, voice, and security experience. They are built on a 12nm (2 times smaller than the 632 SoC) advanced FinFET process technology, and the processors improve CPU performance and power efficiency by up to 25%.
It worth mentioning that the Mobile World Congress (MWC) is one of the biggest events in the gadget calendar. With the official event usually taking place every February but occasionally, occurs in the first week of March at the Fira Gran Via venue in Barcelona, Spain. Then follows the annual summer event in Shanghai, China – the biggest mobile event in Asia.

Muslims must accept that freedom of speech is central to Britishness and should be preserved even if it offends people, says Sir Trevor Phillips. The chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) said we should "allow people to offend each other". And he suggested that Muslims who wanted a system of Islamic Shariah law should leave the UK. His comments follow angry protests against cartoons satirising the Muslim prophet Muhammad.
Sir Trevor told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: "What some minorities have to accept is that there are certain central things we all agree about, which are about the way we treat each other. "That we have an attachment to democracy, that we sort things out by voting not by violence and intimidation, that we tolerate things that we don't like." And that commitment to freedom of expression should also allow Muslim preachers to make comments about homosexuality that are offensive to broad segments of the British population, he said. "One point of Britishness is that people can say what they like about the way we should live, however absurd, however unpopular it is," said Sir Trevor.
He also rejected the idea of Shariah law in Muslim communities in the UK. "We have one set of laws. They are decided on by one group of people, members of Parliament, and that's the end of the story. "Anybody who lives here has to accept that's the way we do it. If you want to have laws decided in another way, you have to live somewhere else," he said.
From a review of "The Strange Death of Marxism: The European Left in the New Millennium" by Paul Edward Gottfried
According to Gottfried, we have witnessed in recent decades a gradual and accelerating evolution of the European Left away from doctrinaire Marxism and toward a multicultural substitute that bears little resemblance to the earlier creed. Essentially, no one on the European Left calls for nationalizing the means of production or looks toward a sweeping overthrow of capitalism at the hands of a class-conscious proletariat any longer. Why this should be is a complicated matter. Social, economic, and demographic changes in Europe have made substantial inroads into an ideology aimed at the working class. There is, also, reality’s stubborn refusal to conform to classical Marxist predictions of the immiseration of the proletariat; anyone can see that the working class of the Western world enjoys a standard of living of which even the nobility of yore could only have dreamed.
The European Left is, therefore, post-Marxist. As Gottfried puts it, “Looking at the legislation Communists have pushed center-left coalitions into supporting—from hate-speech laws directed primarily against the European Christian majority populations, through the criminalization of published or televised communications deemed to deny or minimize Nazi acts of genocide, to the sponsoring of multicultural programs, to the declaration of national commemorations for the deportation of Nazi victims, gay rights, and the raising of public subsidies for asylum-seekers—it is not clear how these projects fit into Marxist revolution.”
Inseparable from the modern European Left, Gottfried argues, is an intense self-loathing for all things Western (themselves and their ideology excluded, naturally), and particularly for the Western past. This pathology manifests itself in “the frenzied desire to repopulate the West with non-Western immigrants, some of whom are unmistakably hostile, and the propensity to exalt what is non-Western as a replacement for Western moral and spiritual impoverishment.” One is reminded of Robert Frost’s definition of a liberal as someone who refuses to take his own side in an argument.
Although American conservatives from time to time still write books and articles about the alleged problem of leftist anti-Americanism in Europe, Gottfried suggests that the “anti-Americanism” complained of by many on the Right is only superficial. Although European leftists have vigorously dissented from American Middle East policy, they deeply admire what the United States has become at home, finding “aspects of American politics and society they wished to import into their own country.” And unpleasant as it may be to admit, why shouldn’t they, given the leftist premises that dominate American political speech, even among many self-described conservatives? “Generous immigration policies, a culturally pluralistic, creedal basis for citizenship, and the readiness to employ government to banish prejudice were American trends that the European Left, particularly after the collapse of the Soviet model, ran to espouse.” Alain Minc, one of Le Monde’s senior editors, wrote last year that “no democrat can ever be anti-American, seeing that America is the land identified in an almost ontological sense with modernity and progress.”
In its never-ending “antifascist” crusade, the European Left is anxious to reeducate those backward souls whose religious convictions and bourgeois values could, they fear, easily give place to a fascist resurgence. Now any sensible person realizes that fascism is about as likely to return to Europe as the Bourbons are to return to the French throne. But the European Left sees fascism and oppression everywhere: in even the mildest expressions of nationalism and national identity, in insufficient devotion to multiculturalism, and in continuing allegiance to the bourgeois family.
According to Gottfried, “Whether fighting to allow unrestricted Third World immigration into Europe, gay marriage, the lowering of the legal age for male homosexual prostitution, the building of mosques at the expenses of European taxpayers, this Left is implacably hostile to those who think differently and trace this deviation to fascist sympathies.” Merely calling attention to atrocities perpetrated by communist regimes is frequently denounced as evidence of fascist tendencies, since cataloguing such offenses supposedly serves to divert attention from fascist crimes, the Holocaust in particular.
Sometimes the antifascist crusade even involves the criminalization of insensitive speech, as in France where the infamous Loi Gayssot, introduced in 1990, has been applied “to prevent or inhibit criticism of immigration, the growing Islamicist presence in France, and responses to attacks on the French Catholic identity.” Banning such speech is one of the therapeutic functions of the managerial state, staffed by leftists, whose task it is to govern in accordance with officially sanctioned victimology and to punish patterns of thought and behavior among the majority population that indicate a lack of penitence for past racism, sexism, homophobia, and other sins against officially protected groups.
Given the cultural and political dominance of the Left in present-day Europe, such that even alleged conservatives all too often speak in a leftist idiom, the continent’s future is, to say the least, uncertain. On the one hand, Western Europe is experiencing a massive influx of non-Westerners who are, quite possibly, religiously and culturally unassimilable and who, in many cases, lack even the desire to be assimilated into their new societies. On the other, Europe is dominated by a political and intellectual class that views this demographic revolution as a delightful source of enrichment for a Europe in need of redemption.
One hardly needs a crystal ball to predict the outcome of a clash between a determined and self-confident Muslim population and a European elite that lacks the will to defend itself—and worse, has long since abandoned the thought that Europe possesses much worth defending in the first place. Unless the continent’s political culture undergoes a dramatic transformation in the very near future, the suicidal ideology of the European Left practically guarantees not only that Europe as we know it will simply disappear amid the radical demographic shifts that the Left itself has engineered, but also that its trip to the graveyard will be accompanied by delusional hymns to multiculturalism, human brotherhood, and the glorious victory against resurgent fascism.
There are a number of reasons that "all-consuming" jobs are aversive to women. One reason, of course, is children. Seventy or eighty-hour (or even fifty or sixty-hour) work weeks are not compatible with the level of family involvement that many people, but especially many women, desire. Because women, on average, desire greater day-to-day involvement with their children than men do, intense career investment is more costly to them. Despite the fact that surveys find that women are as satisfied with their jobs as men are, they are less satisfied with the number of hours they work, despite the fact that they work shorter hours.
Not only are the psychic costs to women higher for participation in grueling careers, the psychic rewards may be smaller. Because women, on average, attach less value to being at the very top of their profession than men do, the psychic payoff to women from single-minded dedication to (or obsession with) achievement of professional status is often less than for men. That is, women are more likely than men to say, "If that's what this career requires, it's not worth it to me." In academia, a primary measure of status is scholarly productivity. Scores of studies of academic productivity have found that men publish more articles than women do, typically about 50% more (independent of whether they have children). This disparity is obviously not due to women's inability to publish more but rather to the fact that they choose not to.
Although one might argue that jobs should not be structured to require so many hours, the fact that some people (predominantly men) are willing, even eager, to work such hours, means that competitive pressures to be productive result in many other people working longer hours than they might like even in the absence of a formal requirement. The two most obvious solutions to this problem, if it is a problem, is to break the link between productivity and reward or to prohibit people, even those who are eager to do so, from working long hours. Neither of these courses of action is practical, of course. Even if universities stopped providing tangible rewards for scholarly productivity, the major status reward of scholarship is not in its tangible recognition by one's employer but by its reception in the scholarly community. As for limiting work hours, that is easy enough to do for factory workers, but not so easy for academics who may do much of their work at home or in otherwise unsupervised settings. Apart from practical concerns, there is, of course, the further question whether either of these responses would be desirable.
Black boys are victims of statistical racism says a leading criminologist who believes that yearly crime figures only reinforce the negative stereotype of young black men as `a problem' to society. Through extensive research Marianne Fitzgerald, a Professor of Criminality at the University of Kent has found that street crime is unrelated to ethnicity [It's just those racist police arresting innocent blacks, of course] but has everything to do with poverty and social circumstances. [So what causes poverty? Could it be ethnic characteristics?]
Fitzgerald who worked for the Home Office research unit for over 10 years was concerned about the way so called `ethnic' statistics were being used, particularly in the context of crime. She started by examining education statistics and then moved onto explore the notion `statistical racism' through the publication of crime figures. Her educational research led her to conclude that the education system (primary school to GCSE secondary stage) was letting down black children especially in poor areas. [Their own behaviour has nothing to do with their failure to learn, of course]
"In discussion, I'd see kids who we're unmistakeably bright but when I got them to fill in a short survey at the end of class, it was obvious they were being sent out into the world with a standard of literacy which was lower than that of my 8 year old granddaughter even though they were nearly twice as old and just as bright. "This meant their job prospects were poor; so their chances of legitimately earning the things they aspired to were very limited.
She added: "Yet, as I knew only too well, those in the poorest areas were surrounded by crime and opportunities for crime. Also very few of them were white but that was simply because these were areas that most whites had long-since abandoned." [And why would whites have abandoned them? Whites LOVE being victims of black crime!]
She has agreed with Trevor Phillips' admittance last year that black boys perform much worse in schools than white boys was true but pointed out that Asian boys from poor groups like the Pakistanis and Bangladeshis were also under-performing. However when you contrast, pupils of Indian origin (a group on equal social-economic terms as whites [And why would that be?]) they actually do better than average, with Indian girls too out-performing whites in secondary schools.
The common denominator which stands out is ethnicity rather than race. [A distinction without a difference?]
Fitzgerald says that Trevor Phillips suggestion that black boys be given separate treatment rings alarm bells about what has been referred to as `statistical racism'. When analysising prison statistics she says she was labelled as a `liberal' criminologist because she questioned the massive over-representation of black people but not `Asians'. At the Home Office all major police forces were told that from 1996 they would have to provide annual statistics on stop/searches, caution and arrests broken down by ethnic group. To Fitzgerald it was obvious which group would come out on top. [Obvious indeed]
She said: "In the long term I had concerns about ways these figures might be interpreted as a measure of the scale of `black criminality', even if this wasn't stated openly." She highlights there was "a very pronounced degree of disproportion in the prison figures from the start." Similar patterns were also apparent in the Met's arrest figures "which account for the bulk of any supposedly national statistics for black people anyway, because nearly two thirds of the total black population lives in London."
The solution to statistical racism in the long-term, is to identify all of the factors which produce these patterns in the figures and addressing the underlying causes - many of which have nothing at all to do with race and ethnicity. For example street crime as a result of poor housing, unemployment or even the pressure to have the latest designer labels. [How awful to be under such pressure! An excellent reason to mug people!]
Statistical information could be used to emphasise that government policies, for example police operations are having an adverse effect on members of the black community - most of whom will be innocent of any crime. "The immediate challenge is to stop the figures being read as if they told us some objective truth about essential differences between whole groups of people," she says. [Group statistics don't tell us about group differences??]
In recent months, medical research and animal testing has become an increasingly inflammatory topic in Oxford, England. The media interest has so far been in student fears and grievances, and the violent methods and intimidation of the animal rights protesters.
All acts of violence on the part of animal rights protesters should be denounced, and there are laws in place for this. Yet SPEAK, the non-violent animal rights group, is fully within its right to protest and make its case, however noisily.
There is little merit in being drawn into a debate about the methods of animal rights groups. This shifts the attention away from the key issues, which concern science, and our understanding of the role played by medical research in the advancement of human knowledge and welfare. Animal experimentation is an integral and necessary component of such research, and should be defended for these reasons.
With this in mind, a 16-year-old student set up Pro-Test, with the idea of defending the construction of the new Oxford animal facility. Pro-Test began with a small-scale counter-demonstration on 28 January 2006 with the slogan 'Support Progress: Build the Oxford Animal Lab'. In reaction to the positive response from Oxford students, local business owners and other people on the day, a website was launched: www.Pro-Test.org.uk. Today, Pro-Test consists of a group of students who are concerned above all with the promotion of science, medical research, reasoned debate, and human welfare. The goal of Pro-Test is to make the case for animal testing. It is generally well known that vaccines, antibiotics, transplant surgeries, medical devices such as pacemakers, and other developments would not be here today if animal testing had not been used. But animal rights activists want to stop all current and future animal testing.
Challenging this through a defence of scientific experimentation should not be just the particular concern of Oxford students, or of scientists. It is an issue that concerns society as a whole, and goes to the heart of how we understand ourselves, and what vision we have of humanity and the capacity for bettering human welfare through the pursuit of scientific research. Life as we know it would not be possible without experimenting on animals.
Animal rights activists often demonise scientists, pretending that they are sadists who enjoy torturing animals just for the sake of it. There are countless examples of the lengths to which scientists go to minimise the suffering of animals. But the simple point is that scientists are not sadists: they act in the way that they see fit, according to principles that they share with the rest of us.
Animal research takes place not because of the laziness of scientists, or because it is just the cheapest option foisted on to scientists by pharmaceutical companies that put profits before anything else. They take place because they are a necessary component of scientific research. At the early stages of biomedical research, alternatives to animal testing exist, which is why the majority of research devoted to finding new treatments is done through chemical, biochemical, biological and pharmacological assays involving DNA, RNA, proteins, and mammalian cells.
But in the end, drugs must be tested in an animal model in order to see the effects of a compound in the entire body, not just in a cellular environment. Testing drugs in animals before doing so in humans helps researchers find potential toxic side effects, as well as understand the metabolism of drug compounds and consequent effects seen throughout the body. This cannot be replicated in cellular assays.
As in all fields of human activity, errors have been made. Animal rights activists use isolated cases as reasons for stopping animal testing. In fact, looking more closely at such cases suggests the opposite conclusion: not less but more testing.
A famous example often cited by animal rights groups is thalidomide. Thalidomide was introduced in 1956 and marketed as a sedative. Within several years, its use had spread around the world and women began taking it to help combat the nausea associated with pregnancy. In 1961, several physicians linked thalidomide with birth defects they observed in cases of female patients who had been taking it. Very quickly, these results were confirmed worldwide, and thalidomide was taken off the market.
Thalidomide did initially pass safety tests in animals because the proper tests - namely, testing thalidomide in pregnant animals - were not performed. If a thorough battery of tests had been performed in animals, the birth defects would have been detected. Animal rights groups confuse an error resulting from an absence of testing with one resulting from conducting tests on animals. They claim, quite erroneously, that thalidomide did not cause birth defects in animals, only humans. Once the drug was pulled off the market, additional tests in animals were done, and it was found that mice, rats, hamsters, marmosets and baboons all suffered similar effects as observed in humans....
In contemporary debate, animal rights groups dominate the agenda. Those who oppose animal rights groups often concede on the principle, and argue only with the methods of animal rights activists. Yet the only way to challenge the climate of fear that currently surrounds the debate on animal testing is to win the argument. Confidence in the strength of their ideas will give people the will to stand up to the threats and intimidation. This can only come through a defence of animal research as a necessary component of scientific experimentation.
Pro-Test stands by the belief that the value of human life is such that these drugs should be tested on animals before they are tested on any human beings.
With the approval of the Bush administration, a company owned by the United Arab Emirates is poised to take over commercial management of shipping and stevedoring operations at six major American ports, located on the eastern seaboard and in New Orleans. When attention was suddenly drawn to this development last week, the urge toward public-safety questions was understandable. Not panic, but legitimate questions.
Sure as Dean follows Howard, though, understandable concern rapidly degenerated into calculated hysteria from poseurs seeking to claim the high ground from a president against whose measure they stand as national-security Lilliputians. Accelerating the downward spiral, the administration's initially temperate but unconvincing defense of the transaction devolved just as quickly into nauseating politically correctness.
Neither corner of the ring has distinguished itself. In one, leading Democrats and some Republicans are evidently shocked to learn that many of the nation's ports are managed by foreigners. Indeed, even as they railed against the prospect of this buy-out by UAE's Dubai Ports World, Inc., they skipped past the inconvenient fact that the seller, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, is a British concern. Naturally, they prefer to cast the issue as one of foreign port-terminal management because they lack the gumption to state that the problem is Islamic participation in what is a gaping soft-spot in our armor. Yet, as usual, such too-clever-by-half cravenness has landed them in a box. Terminals at the ports in question - like many others in the country - have long been under the management of non-Americans. Should we expel everyone?
Especially precious in this regard is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's newfound passion for port security. Fresh from throwing in her lot with partisan efforts to derail the Patriot Act and frame the NSA's surveillance of wartime enemy communications as a crime, the '08 stars in Mrs. Clinton's eyes have suddenly twinkled with a fond memory: namely, how her husband managed to win the 1992 election, in large part, by getting to the right of the first President Bush on what was that era's great global menace - post-Tiananmen Square China. So here she is, trying to elbow her way to the right of the current Bush administration on the scourge of al Qaeda . and hoping the rest of us are struck by amnesia.
You may recall, however, that, upon election, President Clinton proceeded to get tough with Beijing for, oh, about ten minutes. After that, there was no transfer of precious technology and no national security secret that couldn't be had for the right price. Oh, and guess who now controls several port operations on the West Coast? And has for years? Well, whaddya know? It's China.
Indeed, Chinese infiltration of U.S. ports would have been even more pervasive if Senator Clinton's husband had had his way. In 1998, the Republican Congress (led by Senator James Inhofe (OK) and Congressman Duncan Hunter (CA)) had to stop him from turning over management of a 144-acre terminal at the former U.S. Naval Station in Long Beach to the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company - a subsidiary of the People's Liberation Army linked to arms trading to Iran, Iraq, Syria, North Korea, Pakistan, Cuba, and even the street gangs of Los Angeles.
Of course, in the Clinton years, when anyone had the temerity to suggest that maybe it wasn't such a hot idea to give away the store to thuggish, democracy-crushing Communists, we were told such troglodyte notions were insentient to the alchemy of "constructive engagement." This was the very "why make friends when you can let them buy you?" philosophy that led these super-competent, obsessed-with-national-security Clintonistas to sell $8 billion worth of F-16s, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, other advanced weapons, and sundry munitions to - guess who? - The United Arab Emirates.
That happened in early 2000. For those keeping score, that's less than two years after al Qaeda blew up our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. It is one year after the Clinton administration had Osama bin Laden targeted at a camp in Afghanistan . but called the strike off because the al Qaeda chief was in the company of high UAE officials, including an Emirati prince. A few months later, while the Clinton folks were getting the UAE its new military hardware, the regime's friends at al Qaeda were blowing up the U.S.S. Cole.
So why do I have this crazy feeling that, in a new Clinton era, we'd be apt to find a lot more "engagement" than exclusion of the UAE (not to mention other dubious "partners") at our ports? In any event, now that Senator Clinton is all over this port thing, it'll be interesting to hear how she plans to tackle those dread Chinese foreigners managing California's coastline - not to mention her explanation of why the administration in which she figured so prominently thought it was okay to sell lots of stuff that goes boom to a country apparently not even fit to run a port terminal.
Meanwhile, President Bush, who has never, ever vetoed anything in five years - not campaign-finance "reform" that shredded core First Amendment protections, not bursting budgets they haven't built calculators big enough to tally, not a law extending Fifth Amendment protections to alien enemy combatants, etc. - has somehow decided that this, the great principle of equal-market access for checkered Muslim regimes, is where he draws his line in the sand.
The president is promising to kill any legislation aimed at derailing the deal, so offended is he by the suggestion that, in the middle of a war against jihadists, a tiny Islamic country with a history of terror ties, which lives in an unstable, al Qaeda-friendly neighborhood, maybe, just maybe, might be a smidge less suitable for port management than, say, a private company based in England. (England, for those with a short memory, is a country with which we have a bit of history, and which was, for example, patrolling the no-fly zone with us in Iraq while the aforementioned Emirati prince was cavorting with bin Laden in Kandahar.) I mean, does it get any more chauvinistic than that?
So while Democrats pander to our fears (and thus adopt the very cudgel they claim the administration has clubbed them with since 9/11), the president panders to what he takes to be our sense of fair play. He has he challenged lawmakers, the Wall Street Journal reports, to "step up and explain why a Middle Eastern company is held to a different standard" than a British company. Well, okay. The Middle Eastern company is wholly owned by an Islamic autocracy. The president says we need to democratize the Islamic world because autocracies are unstable. And this particular one, oil-rich but only about the size of Maine, has more non-citizens than citizens among its four million or so residents, is enmeshed in a territorial dispute with those famously reasonable mullahs in Iran (over the Tunb Islands and Abu Musa Island), and has been a hub for international narcotics trafficking and money laundering.
Nonetheless, the administration regards the regime - which does not show much promise of democratic reform - as both friendly and adherent to moderate Islam. As usual, "moderate" is in the eye of the beholder. For example, it is a crime punishable by imprisonment in the UAE for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man - because that is a violation of the meta-tolerant Religion of Peace's sharia law, which governs the realm. Muslim men can marry non-Muslim women (and more than one if they like), but you can get sent to prison for such crimes as urging Muslims to convert to other faiths.
Moreover, as my friend Frank Gaffney points out, the regime despises our close ally, Israel. The UAE promotes the idea of a one-state solution in "Palestine" (hint: the one state is not Israel), and may well be funding charities in Gaza and the West Bank - where "charities" are notorious for underwriting terrorism. It was also a key supporter of the Taliban - one of only three countries to recognize bin Laden's kindly hosts as the official government of Afghanistan. In fact, the UAE is the country through which bin Laden was allowed to transit when al Qaeda moved its headquarters to Afghanistan from Sudan in 1996.
All that aside, we are at war with jihadists who, more than anything else, seek to strike us domestically with weapons of mass destruction - including nukes if they can access them. Lo and behold, it turns out that the UAE has been used as a transfer-station for nuclear components in the conspiracy of Pakistani proliferator A. Q. Kahn, who was selling technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Obviously, the Kahn enterprise would have made other plans had it not believed it was on safe footing with the UAE.
Does all this mean the port deal ought to be scotched? I think it does, but I have a (slightly) open mind - as do a lot of other people who fret over our security. The Bush administration contends that the UAE has cleaned up its act since 9/11. There are reasons to be skeptical. The administration, after all, also counts Saudi Arabia and Yemen as cherished friends. It has set a laughably generous grading curve for Islamic regimes (and Islamic leaders) seeking the "moderate" diploma which qualifies them for the status of "ally" in the war on terror. Moreover, while the UAE has plainly taken some steps in the right direction, its facilitation of the enemy prior to 9/11 was substantial. It is not generally our practice to consider hardened criminals redeemed after only four years of good behavior - especially when "good" in this context is, to put it mildly, relative.
On the other hand, port commercial management is not exactly the same as port security. If it really insists on pressing ahead with this deal, the administration should have a chance to demonstrate why, at a time when our homeland is a target and it takes very few operatives to execute a massive attack, we should be comfortable with the UAE in such a prominent role at our borders - even if security remains primarily the task of the Department of Homeland Security. But the administration should make that case to Congress and the American people, not to a secret tribunal (the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) which is run by the Treasury Department - rather than the Pentagon or DHS - and for whom the promotion of commerce has pride of place over national security.
Which is all to say: This transaction needs a long, careful look. It doesn't need stone-throwing from opportunists who would be better advised to check their own glass houses. And it doesn't need bully-pulpit demagoguery. You don't need to be an "Islamophobe" to have doubts here. You just need to have an IQ of about 11.
Two weeks ago, a six-year-old boy was suspended from first grade for three days for "sexual harassment" because he allegedly put "two fingers inside [a] girl's waistband while she sat on the floor in front of him," according to an AP story. Sexual harassment at age six. Growing up kind of fast these days, aren't they?
"He doesn't know those things," the boy's mother told the local press. "He's only six years old." The woman said she "screamed" about the suspension.
Yeah, well, I'd scream too. The whole thing is stupid--children poking at one another and then being punished for it in terms of adult concepts, described with adult words.
We didn't have "sexual" or "harassment" In The Old Days (henceforth, ITOD) when I was in school. The words were in the dictionary, but adults did not say "sex" in the presence of kids. Uh-uh. Children repeated things like that. And I certainly never heard a teacher use a silver-dollar word like "harassment" to describe the human-nature orneriness of children stuffed into a schoolhouse all day. ITOD we called it "teasing" or "picking on (someone)." Let me translate "harassment" into a couple of situations at one of the country schools in which I matriculated circa Truman-through-Eisenhower.
One day after school I was unmercifully teasing and picking on Dixieanna Hamlin in the cloakroom. I had a serious crush on Dixie and she was not giving me enough attention. Cleverly, I decided that amusing monkeyshines and teasing--grabbing her scarf, messing up her hair, etc.--would further her regard for me. "Ned Crabb," she said, eyes narrowed, "you stop that right now or I'm gonna let you have it." Assuming my antics were too hilarious to resist, I didn't even slow down. And so Dixie slapped me right across the jowls. I was stunned. And humiliated; it happened in front of other classmates. They stared at Dixie and me for a few seconds, their eyes round in amazement, then they bee-lined for the school bus.
I didn't speak to Dixieanna for weeks; didn't dare look in her direction. Eventually, she made a point of saying hello to me even when I desperately tried to look at something interesting out the window, such as a crow. She was nice to me in the lunchroom and on the bus, and after a while we became good friends. She never became my girlfriend, but the friendship lasted until we were adults and I moved away from Oklahoma. I had so nurtured my own humiliation at the slap that it wasn't until years later that I realized my persistent antics (the cloakroom had not been the only incident of teasing) had humiliated Dixie. It was a lesson I still carry with me. Thank God Dixie and I had not had the intervention of teachers and principals or the exquisite modern horror of charges of "sexual harassment," followed, as is often the case, by "psychological counselors" and civil-rights lawyers.
Another lesson in "harassment" ITOD came the next year, when a tough farm kid who was a buddy of a guy I'll call Joe Bob Eubanks, the scariest student-thug in two school districts, confronted me in the hallway and said: "Joe Bob is gonna beat the [very bad word, especially then] outta you after school 'cause you drew a cartoon of him." Now that, to my mind, was real harassment, though we called it "going after (someone)" back then. Joe Bob was "coming after" me. If I could've sicced a psychological counselor or a glowering lawyer on Joe Bob I would've leaped at the chance, but we hadn't heard of those things either.
There was no way I could've told a teacher or the principal about my impending disaster, because such a thing would have been disgraceful in the eyes of the other kids; I would've been "yellow." Besides, I really had used my budding artistic talent rather offensively, portraying Joe Bob as a knuckle-dragging gorilla with a finger up one nostril. (It was an early work from my Goya period.)
After the final bell, the knuckle-dragger came after me in front of a collection of onlookers. In a bizarre moment of possible hysteria I ran straight at him, head down, little fists pumping. It was no contest, naturally. Joe Bob put a fist in my teeth. Hoo boy, that hurt. Then he picked me up and slammed me face down, rubbing my face in the dirt. Somehow, I managed to squirm away and stand up. "You ain't had enough, runt," he said. I refused to cry and I didn't run--I simply backed away with alacrity. And then, to my amazement, about a half-dozen boys walked over and stood in front of me. "It ain't fair, Joe Bob," one of them said. I had not run, and had taken my punishment for the cartoon. I had schoolyard cred. Most children do have an innate sense of what is fair and what "ain't," and they will, quite often, settle things themselves.
I wish I could say that Joe Bob and I also became friends. No chance. If I ever see that guy again--even if he's the male equivalent of Mother Teresa--I'm gonna punch him in the teeth.
Bolivia's Evo Morales solemnly invoked Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara, the patron saint of Latin America's woolly Left, in his presidential inauguration. An exhibit at New York's Center of Photography explores Guevara's fascinating afterlife as a marketing tool for all kinds of products, from watches to ice cream. Saint or gimmick, the durable Argentine adventurer lives on. Like Mickey Mouse, he sells and gets no royalties.
Guevara was slain in cold blood by the Bolivian army nearly 40 years ago. He had infiltrated Bolivia to test his theory that a few foci sustained by hard-core guerrillas would detonate the continental Revolution. It didn't work.
Freddy Alborta, a photographer from La Paz, took remarkable pictures of Guevara's corpse propped up on a laundry countertop. The intent may have been forensic, but the outcome was mystical. The shirtless Guevara looks like Jesus descended from the Cross or those images of the dead Christ venerated on Good Friday. The martyr's image at the moment of his sacrifice, seen by millions, opened the way to his apotheosis......
Guevara-worship may be naive or opportunistic, but there is something downright obscene in his promotion by capitalist commerce. Guevara simply was not a nice fellow. There is nothing benign about the real Guevara, pistol in hand, giving a cold-blooded coup de grace to the Castro regime's enemies at La Cabana fortress. Or his bloody repression of anti-Castro peasants in the Escambray mountains of central Cuba when the Castroite regime was 2 years old. Guevara's hands had much blood on them besides his own. In real life, he was a war criminal.
Guevara died a martyr's death while carrying out a fool's errand. He came to believe his own mythmaking. Cuba was no Vietnam and Castro no Ho-Chi-Minh. In Cuba, the corrupt and sloppy dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista imploded when it lost the support of the United States in 1958. Castro's genius lay in his ability to take control of the ensuing chaos; Guevara, who was along for the ride, read a proletarian Iliad into what was essentially a farce.
When he tried to replicate the Cuban outcome in Bolivia, revolutionary peasants were nowhere in sight. Castro's promised support did not materialize. The Bolivian military were supposed to join the people's legions or cave in like Batista's, but they did not. So Guevara died a delusional Argentine Robin Hood who, unlike his prototype, was not nearly as smart as the sheriff of Nottingham. Never mind -- pass the T-shirts.
Gay rights group are claming victory after anti-gay Muslim leader Sir Iqbal Sacranie pulled out from speaking at a London conference after gay protests. Sacranie was to have been a keynote speaker at a trade union-sponsored Unite Against Fascism conference at the weekend; however his views on homosexuality were widely condemned as echoing the anti-gay hatred of the BNP. "This climbdown is a victory for humanitarian values over homophobic prejudice. We want Muslim leaders like Sacranie to be part of the anti-BNP alliance, but only if they respect the human rights of gay people and other minorities," said Peter Tatchell of the gay human rights group, OutRage!, which helped coordinate the protests against Sacranie being invited to speak.
The conference organisers claim Sacranie withdrew because he had another engagement. But this is disputed by Peter Tatchell of OutRage! "Three days ago the conference organisers were adamant that Sir Iqbal would be a speaker," said Tatchell. "After being deluged with protests they are now saying he is no longer available. This is not a credible explanation. We believe the organisers realised they could not secure the acceptance of a homophobe at an anti-fascist conference, so they dumped him. "Sacranie's attitude to gay people is similar to the homophobia of the BNP. He should have never been invited in the first place.
Fellow OutRage activist and gay Muslim, Ramzi Islam, added: "Sir Iqbal is leader of the anti-gay Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). As well as actively campaigning to maintain homophobic laws like Section 28, he last month publicly denounced lesbians and gay men on BBC Radio, saying they were immoral, harmful and spread disease.
A community college student in Massachusetts faces possible disciplinary action for shouting "Remember Chappaquiddick!" during an on-campus speech by Democrat Sen. Edward Kennedy yesterday. Paul Trost, 20, a student at Massasoit Community College in Brockton, Mass., says he was upset by an introduction of Kennedy given by Rep. Stephen Lynch, D-Mass., in which the congressman noted how the long-time senator overcame hardship in life on his way to success. "Lynch said Kennedy had overcome such adversity to get to the place he was, and that's a bunch of bull," Trost said of the introduction, which occurred in the school's student center yesterday morning.
Just as Kennedy began speaking, Trost was walking out of the room when he shouted, "Remember Chappaquiddick!" "Most of the crowd gasped," Trost said. "Then I walked out of the student center." The student says a campus police officer went outside and stopped him. He also saw some state troopers go outside, the type who accompany Kennedy around the state to provide security. Trost says the cop took down his information and told him he would be hearing from school officials about disciplinary action. A spokesman with the campus police verified the incident but stressed that Trost was not arrested.
The student said one of his teachers confronted him after a class about the Chappaquiddick issue. "One of my teachers called me ignorant and told me this was an embarrassment to the school," Trost told WND. "She said to me, 'Can't you forgive him after all these years?' And I said, 'No, he killed somebody.' "If it had been me or any other person, we'd be in jail," Trost says he told his instructor.
Referring to his two-word shout, Trost said, "I did it because I know about Kennedy's past. I know what happened at Chappaquiddick. "I wanted to send a message to him that my generation still knows about it. We haven't forgotten about it." Trost said he was satisfied to know that students on campus were talking about the Chappaquiddick incident later in the day - some of whom, in fact, were not familiar with it.
In 1969, Kennedy was driving a car that went off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Mass. His passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed after the car landed upside down in the water. No autopsy was ever performed to determine her exact cause of death. At the time, Kennedy claimed he tried several times to swim down to reach Kopechne to no avail. He came under fire for not reporting the incident to authorities until the next morning. In the interim he reportedly made an effort to call a family legal adviser.
"I haven't yet found out what's going to happen to me," Trost said, referring to the warning from campus police.
A student slides a tray toward the cafeteria cash register with a healthy selection: a pint of milk, green beans, whipped sweet potatoes and chicken nuggets - baked, not fried. But then he adds a fudge brownie. When he punches in his code for the prepaid account his parents set up, a warning sounds: "This student has a food restriction." Back goes the brownie as the cashier reminds him that his parents have declared all desserts off-limits.
This could be a common occurrence at Houston schools when the district becomes one of the largest in the nation with a cafeteria automation system that lets parents dictate -and track - what their kids get. Primero Food Service Solutions, developed by Houston-based Cybersoft Technologies, allows parents to set up prepaid lunch accounts so children don't have to carry money, said Ray Barger, Cybersoft's director of sales and marketing. It also shows the cashier any food allergies or parent-set diet restrictions for his or her account, and the student is not allowed to buy an offending item.
Parents also can go online to track their child's eating habits and make changes. "If parents want Johnny to eat chips one day a week, they can go in and make changes to allow them to buy a bag of chips on, say, Fridays," said Terry Abbott, spokesman for Houston Independent School District, the nation's seventh-largest with more than 250,000 students.
Robin Green, whose 14-year-old son, Jerry, is in seventh grade in the Houston district, said she would probably sign up for the new voluntary monitoring system once it's implemented within the next year. Green was concerned that parents from low-income families without access to computers would not be able to participate, but Abbott said parents can go to their school and work with cafeteria representatives.
Barger said his company's system already is being used in schools in Arizona, Oklahoma, Michigan and Tennessee, as well as other Texas cities. Several other companies have similar cafeteria monitoring programs at other schools.
Prepaid cafeteria accounts have been around for five to 10 years, but programs that allow parents to say what their kids can or can't eat are a more recent development, said Erik Peterson, spokesman for the Washington-based School Nutrition Association. His organization did not have exact figures on how many school districts use such programs.....
Karen Cullen, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Children's Nutrition Research Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, cautioned that the system is good only if it sparks communication between parents and their children on healthy food choices. "Kids need to be able to make healthy choices," Cullen said. "Parents can't be in charge. Children need some freedom."
For the past three decades and more, many of the leading opinion makers in our universities, the media and the arts have regarded Western culture as, at best, something to be ashamed of, or at worst, something to be opposed. Before the 1960s, if Western intellectuals reflected on the long-term achievements of their culture, they explained it in terms of its own evolution: the inheritance of ancient Greece, Rome and Christianity, tempered by the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Enlightenment and the scientific and industrial revolutions. Even a radical critique like Marxism was primarily an internal affair, intent on fulfilling what it imagined to be the destiny of the West, taking its history to what it thought would be a higher level.
Today, however, such thinking is dismissed by the prevailing intelligentsia as triumphalist. Western political and economic dominance is more commonly explained not by its internal dynamics but by its external behaviour, especially its rivalry and aggression towards other cultures. Western success has purportedly been at their expense. Instead of pushing for internal reform or revolution, this new radicalism constitutes an overwhelmingly negative critique of Western civilization itself.
According to this ideology, instead of attempting to globalise its values, the West should stay in its own cultural backyard. Values like universal human rights, individualism and liberalism are regarded merely as ethnocentric products of Western history. The scientific knowledge that the West has produced is simply one of many "ways of knowing". In place of Western universalism, this critique offers cultural relativism, a concept that regards the West not as the pinnacle of human achievement to date, but as simply one of many equally valid cultural systems.
Cultural relativism claims there are no absolute standards for assessing human culture. Hence all cultures should be regarded as equal, though different. It comes in two varieties: soft and hard.
The soft version now prevails in aesthetics. Take a university course in literary criticism or art theory and you will now find traditional standards no longer apply. Italian opera can no longer be regarded as superior to Chinese opera. The theatre of Shakespeare was not better than that of Kabuki, only different.
The hard version comes from the social sciences and from cultural studies. Cultural practices from which most Westerners instinctively shrink are now accorded their own integrity, lest the culture that produced them be demeaned.
For instance, although Western feminists once found the overt misogyny of many tribal cultures distasteful, in recent years they have come to respect practices they once condemned. Feminist academics now deny that suttee, the incineration of widows, is barbaric. The Indian-American cultural studies theorist, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak gives suttee an honourable place in Indian culture by comparing it to the Christian tradition of martyrdom. Feminists once denounced the surgical removal of the clitoris of Muslim women as female genital mutilation. Lately, the procedure has been redefined as genital "cutting", which the literary and art critic Germaine Greer now argues should be recognized as an authentic manifestation of the culture of the Muslim women concerned.
Similarly, the Parisian literary theorist, Tzvetan Todorov, in The Conquest of America (1985), compares Mexican cannibalism to the Christian Eucharist, and the Australian postmodern historian, Greg Dening, in Mr Bligh's Bad Language (1992), declares Polynesian human sacrifice to be the ritual equivalent of British capital punishment.
Something is obviously going terribly wrong here. The logic of relativism is taking Western academics into dark waters. They are now prepared to countenance practices that are obviously cruel, unnatural and life-denying, that is, practices that offend against all they claim to stand for.
To see how decadent these assumptions have become, compare today's relativism to the attitude that prevailed when the culture of the British people was in its ascendancy. Sir Charles Napier, the British Commander-in-chief in India from 1849 to 1851, signed an agreement with local Hindu leaders that he would respect all their customs, except for the practice of suttee. The Hindu leaders protested but Napier was unmoved:
You say that it is your custom to burn widows. Very well. We also have a custom: when men burn a woman alive, we tie a rope around their necks and we hang them. Build your funeral pyre; beside it, my carpenters will build a gallows. You may follow your custom. And then we will follow ours.
The moral rationale of cultural relativism is a plea for tolerance and respect of other cultures, no matter how uncomfortable we might be with their beliefs and practices. However, there is one culture conspicuous by its absence from all this. The plea for acceptance and open-mindedness does not extend to Western culture itself, whose history is regarded as little more than a crime against the rest of humanity. The West cannot judge other cultures but must condemn its own.
A plurality of one faculty has brought about an academic coup d'etat against not only Harvard University president Lawrence Summers but also against the majority of students, faculty, and alumni. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which forced Summers's resignation by voting a lack of confidence in him last March and threatening to do so again on Feb. 28, is only one component of Harvard University and is hardly representative of widespread attitudes on the campus toward Summers. The graduate faculties, the students, and the alumni generally supported Summers for his many accomplishments. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences includes, in general, some of the most radical, hard-left elements within Harvard's diverse constituencies. And let there be no mistake about the origin of Summers's problem with that particular faculty: It started as a hard left-center conflict. Summers committed the cardinal sin against the academic hard left: He expressed politically incorrect views regarding gender, race, religion, sexual preference, and the military.
The original no-confidence motion contained an explanatory note that explicitly referenced ''Mr. Summers' apparently ongoing convictions about the capacities and rights not only of women but also of African-Americans, third-world nations, gay people, and colonized peoples." The note also condemned Summers for his 2002 speech in which he said calls from professors and students for divestment from Israel were ''anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent."
Although the explanatory note was eventually removed from the motion, it was the 400-pound gorilla in the room. Summers was being condemned for expressing views deemed offensive by some of the faculty. I personally disagreed with some of Summers's statements, but that is beside the point in an institution committed to academic freedom and diversity of viewpoints.
In the minds of at least some vocal members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, expressing such politically incorrect views is the academic equivalent of provoking Islamic extremists by depicting Prophet Mohammed in a political cartoon. Radical academics do not, of course, burn down buildings, at least not since the 1970s. Instead they introduce motions of no confidence and demand resignations of those who offend their sensibilities (while insisting on complete freedom of speech for those with whom they agree -- free speech for me but not for thee!).
Once the academic bloodletting began, it was difficult to stanch the wound. Everything Summers did, or did not do, became the object of criticism. Not only was the honeymoon over, the divorce had begun, at least in the minds of those determined to get rid of Summers. When he selected a new dean of Arts and Sciences, there were complaints. When the new dean resigned, there were complaints, some from the same faculty members who opposed the original selection.
When Summers recused himself from any investigation of his friend Andre Shleifer for investing in Russian companies while he was consulting about the Russian economy, he was condemned by some who would have condemned him even more vociferously had he not recused himself.
Summers could do no right in the eyes of his radical critics, who could never forgive him for his perceived original sins and who saw an opportunity to build wider coalitions every time Summers took actions that alienated other groups, as a president -- especially an activist and sometimes abrasive president -- will inevitably do. Some less ideological critics of Summers's leadership style then joined the radicals in a cacophony of strange bedfellows, but the core of the opposition always remained the hard left.
It was arrogant in the extreme for a plurality of a single faculty to purport to speak for the entire university, especially when that plurality is out of synch with the mainstream of Harvard. It was dangerous for the corporation to listen primarily to that faculty, without widely consulting other professors, students, and alumni who supported Summers. Now that this plurality of one faculty has succeeded in ousting the president, the most radical elements of Harvard will be emboldened to seek to mold all of Harvard in its image. If they succeed, Harvard will become a less diverse and less interesting institution of learning governed by political-correctness cops of the hard left. This is what happened in many European universities after the violent student protests of the late 1960s. It should not be allowed to happen at Harvard in the wake of the coup d'etat engineered by some in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The Left's latest attempt to destroy childhood happiness. Below is a transcript of the Fox News "Schools Banning 'Tag'" story -- lifted from The Locker Room. See also further commentary on The Locker Room
Bill Hemmer, host: It's a part of childhood in playgrounds all across the country, but now there is a push in some schools to ban the game of "Tag." From Seattle, Dan Springer's in right now. Dan, good morning.
Dan Springer, reporter: Yeah, Bill, how did we ever survive to adulthood? First it was dodgeball, and now an increasing number of schools in America are banning the playing of "Tag" on their playgrounds. The latest is Adams Elementary in Spokane, Washington. The principal claims the students were getting hurt and also were being coerced to play. Fearing lawsuits and hurt feelings, she put an end to "Tag."
Principal (Mary Weber, not identified by Fox): There's a bullying issue if students don't want to participate in something, and they're kinda being forced to by someone running up to 'em and shoving them and saying "You're It!" Um, we want all students not only to be safe but to feel safe.
Springer: The ban upset many of the students, and one decided to do something about it by circulating a petition. In just a couple of hours, third grader Kubby Boyd had 46 signatures. But when he gave them to the principal with a suggestion that anyone who is too rough be disciplined, well, the principal refused to budge.
Kubby Boyd, third grade student: I felt pretty bored when I came outside because we usually have nothing to do, and that's all we play, "Tag."
Springer: Some schools in California, New Jersey and Wisconsin have already banned "Tag," agreeing with the National Association of School Psychologists, which believes quote "There's a potential for some victimization" endquote. But others say not letting boys be boys is hurting them and society.
Christina Hoff Sommers: Our children are healthy. They're not fragile and in need of all of this zealous protectiveness, and we actually harm them when we deny them the healthy challenges of childhood.
Springer: Now while there is no more unsupervised "Tag" in the Spokane school, they do allow it in gym class, albeit with a Nerf ball. And in case you're wondering, football is allowed on the playground; however, there's a catch, Bill: you can't run. You can throw the ball, but no running with the football.

At the age of 11, Maegan Woods tried to stop a domestic dispute between her parents. She soon found herself staring down the barrel of her father's shotgun. She watched helplessly as the trigger was pulled. She is only alive today because the gun didn't fire--the safety was on. Maegan was abused and witnessed domestic violence in her home for most of her childhood. By age seven there had been knife attacks, punches, kicks, and more. It was hard to leave--the abuser was the one who earned the money, and the victim was unable to work because of a disability. On numerous occasions they looked for help to escape the abuse but were refused. Why?
Because in Maegan's family, the abused spouse was her father, and the battering and child abuse were perpetrated by her mother.
The California Battered Women Protection Act of 1994, codified in Health & Safety Codes Section 124250, et. seq., created funding for domestic violence shelter-based services. However, by defining domestic violence as something only experienced by women, the statutes exclude male victims from receiving state-funded domestic violence services, including shelter, hotel arrangements, counseling and legal services.
Meagan, now 21, and her father, David Woods, are the lead plaintiffs in a new lawsuit against the State of California and numerous state agencies and state-funded domestic violence service providers. Beginning in the mid-1980s, David was violently attacked on numerous occasions by his wife Ruth, who suffers from a bi-polar disorder which, in her case, creates a propensity toward violence.
On several occasions David decided that he and Maegan should get out of the house to escape Ruth's violence. However, with his disabling condition and inability to work, David had no money to provide for himself and his daughter. Numerous times he contacted a Sacramento domestic violence agency he had heard of in the media, WEAVE, but they always told him "we don't help men," and never offered him a referral to another facility. David tried churches and various programs, but all they could offer for men were homeless shelters with waiting lists. He found nothing for abused men and their children. David gave up and sank into a heavy depression.
By February 2003, Maegan began telling her father to find a place of safety from Ruth's violence. He again called WEAVE and again was told "we don't help men." Maegan, then 18, became so frustrated watching David being abused that she called WEAVE herself and insisted they help her father. According to Maegan, WEAVE said they do not help men, and that men are the perpetrators of domestic violence, not the victims.
That year Ruth finally began to seek professional help for her problems. David, loyal and a firm believer in his marriage vows, stuck by her. In January 2004, the two appeared together on the NBC's John Walsh Show and discussed Ruth's violence.
Domestic violence policies based on the woman good/man bad model kept David trapped in his violent marriage in a number of ways. The biggest reason David didn't leave Ruth was Maegan. She was frequently the target of Ruth's attacks, particularly when David wasn't around to protect her and take Ruth's blows. Domestic violence researcher Richard Gelles, whose groundbreaking work on domestic violence in the late 1970s was instrumental in bringing the issue to public consciousness, explains that current policies often trap abused fathers like David. They can't leave their wives because this would leave their children unprotected in the hands of an abuser. If they simply take their children, they can be arrested for kidnapping. Moreover, they would probably lose custody of their children in the divorce anyway, again leaving their children in harm's way.
These cases often have tragic results. In the highly-publicized Socorro Caro murder case, Socorro often abused her husband Xavier, a prominent Northridge, California rheumatologist, and once assaulted him so badly he had to have surgery to regain his sight in one eye. Trapped and not knowing what to do or where to go, Xavier endured the abuse, once telling his wife "one day you are going to do something that cannot be undone." A short time later Socorro shot and killed three of their four children. Their baby survived only because Socorro ran out of bullets. She was later convicted and sentenced to death for the murders.
While police intervention often works for abused women, abused men understandably fear that once the police are involved, their wives will accuse them of being the abuser and it is they who will be believed. Draconian arrest policies often direct police to make an arrest, and police are often pressured to arrest the man. The anti-male bias of police policies was evident in the Woods case. During the 1995 shotgun incident, Ruth called the police after David wrestled the shotgun away from her. Maegan yelled to her mom, "Tell the truth!" and Ruth told the police she wanted them to come because she wanted to kill her husband.
Nevertheless, when the police arrived and David opened the door to let them in, the officers immediately grabbed him by the wrist, wrestled him to the ground, and handcuffed him. They only uncuffed him after Maegan told them that it was her mother who had the gun.
What's needed are domestic violence policies tailored to the needs of all victims of abuse, regardless of gender. Decades of research shows that heterosexual males make up a significant part of the population of domestic violence victims. According to the most recent fact sheet released by the Centers for Disease Control, men comprise over 35% of all domestic violence victims. In a meta-analytic review of 552 domestic violence studies published in the November, 2000 issue of the Psychological Bulletin, psychology professor John Archer found that 38% of the physical injuries in heterosexual domestic assaults were suffered by men....
David Irving, the far-right British historian, sat stunned and open-mouthed yesterday when an Austrian court found him guilty of denying the Holocaust and sentenced him to three years in jail. "I'm very shocked and I'm going to appeal," Irving, 67, said as he was bundled out of the Vienna courtroom by armed anti-riot police. From the public gallery a British supporter shouted "Stay strong, David", before he too was led away.
But in Britain there was dismay at a verdict that could turn Irving into a right-wing martyr. Irving had pleaded guilty to denying the Holocaust in two speeches in Austria in 1989. He was arrested when he re-entered the country, where it is a crime to deny the Holocaust, last November, and had been in custody since.
During his seven-hour trial yesterday Irving sought to convince the jury that he had changed his mind and now acknowledged the murder of six million Jews by the Nazis. "I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz," he told the court. But the judge and jury were unswayed. One hundred and fifty-eight people have been convicted of Holocaust denial in Austria between 1999 and 2004, but only a handful other than Irving have been imprisoned.
Lord Janner of Braunstone, chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, was pleased by the conviction. He said: "It sends a clear message to the world that we must not tolerate the denial of the mass murderers of the Holocaust. The Nazis tried to wipe out an entire people . . . We must learn the lessons of the past to build a decent society for the future."
The verdict came amid a furious debate in Europe over freedom of expression, with many defending the media's right to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. The Arabic television station al-Jazeera broadcast the verdict to its Islamic audience.
Nick Griffin, the leader of the British National Party, was recently acquitted of making speeches inciting racial hatred. Abu Hamza, the radical Islamic cleric, was sentenced last week to seven years in prison for inciting racial hatred and soliciting murder.
In Britain there was alarm at the sentence. "Anyone who denies the Holocaust is off their rocker," Gerald Howarth, Tory MP for Aldershot, said. "But to send a man to prison for three years for something that he said sixteen years ago and has since changed his view - what are we coming to?" Anthony Beevor, the military historian, said: "However nauseating, these people should be confronted in debate rather than chucked into jail and turned into martyrs."
The verdict will end for good the career of a man banned from a dozen countries from Canada to South Africa for belittling the murder of the Jews and glorifying Hitler. In 2000 Irving was forced into bankruptcy when he unsuccessfully sued Deborah Lipstadt, an American academic who had called him a Holocaust denier. He was ordered to pay 3 million pounds in legal costs and had to sell his Mayfair home.
She said yesterday: "He should have been met by the sound of one hand clapping. The one thing he deserves, he really deserves, is obscurity."
"A few Austrians, such as Lothar Hobelt, an associate professor of history at the University of Vienna, believe it should never have been set up at all.
"This is a silly law by silly people for silly people," he said. "In fact, having a law that says you mustn't question a particular historical instance, if anything, creates doubt about it, because if an argument has to be protected by the force of law, it means it's a weak argument.""
My name is Robert xxxxxx and my wife and I are teachers in xxxxxx in Florida. My daughter is a 10th grader who also attends xxxxxx High in xxxxxx County. A few days ago, my wife got a phone call from their assistant principal saying Robyn, my daughter, was written up and sent to the office. Her biology teacher said that Robyn was voicing her disapproval of having a new Gay Alliance club at xxxxxx. Robyn said that by allowing this volunteer gay club, they were putting a stamp of approval on it. The biology teacher said that Robyn should respect student's right to be gay. My daughter, Robyn, said "You give those people that right, but you won't give my Lacrosse team funding or recognize it as a school sport." The assistant principal said if Robyn continues to "show disrespect" to Ms xxxxxx, she will face the consequences. My wife said, "I can't tell my daughter to change her belief or not voice it if it challenges her faith." "My daughter is a Christian." The API replied by saying, "I'm a Christian, too, but I must protect their right to sin."
My point is, "Where do we draw the line?" Should our concern for "political correctness" and civil rights/liberties govern our actions in daily life to a point that we entrust our minor children with important eternal lifestyle decisions? Sexual orientation, birth control, and abortion to name a few. Many children in high school are asked to make adult decisions that they are not qualified to make. And yet her school won't even fund or host the sport she plays so passionately. Where's the value system here?
My fear is that our "cradle to grave" government control of our children will result to a generation that will lack passion, drive, moral and ethical values, and will no longer view human life as valuable, precious, and irreplaceable. The truth is, God did! That is why Jesus died for us. I also fear that society will use our "right" to protect our "wrongs" to a point that 2+2 can equal whatever you want it to. I guess this philosophy will help with "standardized testing" but to what standards... The only standards that we can be tested on are God's standards as written in His word!
A contributor to Cornell University's "premier liberal voice" has been charged with stabbing a black student on the university's campus after using "racial epithets" toward him. According to the Cornell Daily Sun, Nathan Poffenbarger [Class of] '08, a regular contributor to the campus magazine, "Turn Left" was charged with second-degree assault, a class "D" felony, after allegedly stabbing a visiting student on West Campus during an altercation on Saturday (February 18).
Police said the attack stemmed from a racial incident. "Witnesses told police Poffenbarger was yelling racial remarks at someone else, when the victim, a black male student, stepped in to stop him. The victim's name has not been released," News10 reported. According to the Ithaca Journal, Poffenbarger is white.
Capt. Kathy Zoner of the Cornell Police Department, told the Sun that the current charges could be elevated to class "C" under hate-crime statutes "if racial motivations are proven."
Wayne Huang , the former editor-in-chief of "Turn Left," confirmed that Poffenbarger was a regular contributor to the magazine. Huang and "Turn Left" staff member Josh Perlman both said they were "shocked" to learn Poffenbarger had been arrested in this matter:
"He had written a lot of good news pieces for us," said [Perlman]. "I had spoken to him earlier that day about a new article he was going to be doing. He didn't seem weird or anything when I spoke to him, just enthusiastic to be writing as he usually was. I was extremely shocked to hear about all this. This seems really out of character."
According to "Turn Left's" website, its mission statement is to "uphold and maintain tolerant and respectful political dialogue on the campus, promote and practice an ideology rooted in the belief of equality and freedom."
Emergency workers took the victim to Arnot Ogden Medical Center in Elmira where he is in stable condition, the Sun reported.
Italy's highest court ruled Friday that a man who raped the 14-year-old daughter of his girlfriend can seek to have his sentence reduced because the girl was sexually active, news reports said.
The ruling provoked an outcry across Italy, was condemned by UNICEF and prompted other justices on the court to issue a statement saying the ruling was wrong and in the future would be cited as a bad example of a high court decision, the ANSA news agency reported.
The case goes back to 2001, when a court in Sardinia convicted Marco T. of sexual violence and threats against the 14-year-old daughter of his live-in girlfriend and sentenced him to more than three years in prison, ANSA said. He requested a reduced sentence, saying the crime was less serious because the girl had already had several sexual partners. His request was rejected, but Italy's high court said the judges should re-evaluate the decision because the girl "since the age of 13 had had many sexual relations with men of every age." "And it's right to assume," the ruling went on, according to ANSA, "that at the time of the encounter with the suspect her personality, from a sexual point of view, was much more developed than what one might normally expect from a girl of her age."
The suspect's lawyer, Andrea Biccheddu, defended the ruling, saying the episode between his client and the girl "didn't provoke any trauma," because the girl had had so many sexual partners. He said his client deserved to have his sentence reduced by two thirds, the agency said.
I reproduce below a news report followed by another article arguing that violent black music is dangerous and should not be beyond criticism
Earl Patrick McNeese, better known to Fredericksburg-area hip-hop fans as Praverb the Wyse, winced when he read the news about the fatal stabbing of Courtland High School junior Baron "Deuce" Braswell II. First, McNeese, a 23-year-old Stafford County resident, felt some of the pain experienced by the victim's family--and by the families of the six teens charged in the crime. Then the hip-hop artist grieved for the damage done to the image of a genre he's been trying to help liberate from the chains of a "bad boy" image. "Rap music already has a bad stigma and this incident adds more fuel to the fire," McNeese said.
Like many others, he read news reports that the stabbing took place while "Knuck if You Buck," a song popularized by the Crime Mob rap group, was playing at a Four-Mile Fork motel party. Crime Mob is made up of teens who were members of an Atlanta gang. The lyrics in the 2004 song make references to fighting at a party. The song is "crunk music," meaning "crazy drunk," and incites behavior similar to moshing and slam dancing, he said. Crunk, a bass-heavy type of rap music with risque lyrics, is hot right now and getting a lot of radio play on hip-hop stations. Turn the radio dial to any hip-hop station and crunk is there. Drive past the mall and it may be blasting from passing car radio speakers.
The genre originated in Memphis with the group Three 6 Mafia, but Atlanta has taken most of the credit with artists such as Lil' Jon and OutKast. McNeese wasn't at the motel party, but says he can guess what happened during what he calls "a sad incident, indeed." "Did the song spark the incident?" he said rhetorically. "In my opinion, yes. The song was intended to liven the party up--and it did, to an extent where someone got killed." "I just hope this incident draws people together, and it teaches teens that loyalty to your school or neighborhood is cool, but at the same time extreme loyalty can result in tragedy," McNeese said.
Lonnie B, a DJ, recording artist and hip-hop icon in the Richmond area, has different ideas. "You can't blame the music for somebody's actions," Lonnie B said. "If people are that ignorant and weak-minded, the problem is much bigger than the music." But he also said, "It's more likely to happen when you play crunk music, but it can happen to any type of music." He said: "Hip-hop is not music, it's a lifestyle. Hip-hop is the way you talk, the way you dress, the way you talk or slang. Rap is the words, the music. Crunk is a sound."
The suggestion that "Knuck if You Buck" might have had some small part in his murder is certainly generating letters to The Free Lance-Star. Some readers may feel that the idea of a link between the two clearly violates the most sacred rule of "political correctness"--that "gross" equals "good." Anyone who objects is likely to offend someone, with the clear suggestion that the offender is somehow involved in "hate speech," which of course is the end of all discussion--if not the end of all reason.
If we are looking beyond a mere inanimate song as the perpetrator of the violence, we might wonder about the kid with the knife. Perhaps he is responsible for killing Baron Braswell. However, we might also ask whether the kid with the knife would have stabbed Baron if his "nice" friends were not screaming "Mayfield Mob," beating Baron to the floor, and kicking him. Or whether the temporary thugs (as the "nice boys" were called) would have knocked Baron to the floor if the DJ had not chosen to play songs which he well knew would incite "dancers" to crash enthusiastically into each other--in keeping with the somewhat violent sentiments of the song.
Which brings us to another tenet of the Political Correctness Religion: "Songs (and those that sing them) are sacred." As long as it has a melody or, in the case of gangsta rap, a beat, any words or any behaviors are perfectly acceptable. In fact, if "nobody can understand the words," or if 100 percent of the people who listen to the song do not go out and stab someone, it must be okay, and should not be criticized. In fact, even looking at the lyrics might be a violation of somebody's First Amendment rights. One might also wonder if the guy with the new "gangsta" CD thought about playing "punchin' stompin' backbone-breaking" music in a dark room to stir up a crowd of kids who had recently been tackling each other on the footfall field.
To move further up the chain, one might wonder about the rich record producers in New York and Los Angeles. Think of how much money they've made by taking the most self-destructive, brutal, woman-abusing losers and making them multimillionaire heroes for our "nice kids" to copy--sometimes with fists and feet and knives and time in jail. Academics, students, rappers, and "experts" all say that "violent video games, and violent movies and TV shows" don't really have much of an effect on the society. But I guess Baron didn't know that.
And neither do the little boys who grow up hearing again and again that little girls are just "hos and b-----s." Or the little girls who think that's the way they're supposed to act. Or the five "nice kids" whose lives are now ruined because they have now experienced the Real Rule: "Garbage in, garbage out."
As a teacher who has been helping to supervise school dances for 40 years, I have found it instructive to watch what kids do in response to different songs--from tenderly dancing with their sweeties to slow love songs, to happily bouncing around to "YMCA." And then comes the instantly scary and awesomely disgusting stuff that goes on when a few of "those" songs are played in a row. We know firsthand that, contrary to the experts, music does affect behavior and so requires serious supervision by those more aware of consequences than 14- to 17-year-olds--and the "experts" who write books.
As the local police know well, any dance that continuously plays that stuff in a dark room is absolutely certain to have the same kind of behavior that just resulted in so many lives being ruined and so many people being hurt--guaranteed. Maybe we should wonder whether exposing our children to poison just to make rich guys richer is as innocuous as the experts say.
We seem to be part of a society that thinks that "Knuck if You Buck" and its associates are harmless ways to educate our children as to how they should treat each other. Maybe we're not much different from the Mad Mullahs who teach their little boys and girls to blow themselves up in the middle of their own people another harmless educational miracle.
Catholics must worship that stupid loser on the cross, I guess. Let's have some fun Jihad instead! In any case, you can believe -- as I do -- that homosexuals should be treated on their individual merits (I don't care where they put their dicks as long as it is not coercive) without also believing that defenceless children should be thrust into the midst of a perverted life
Governor Mitt Romney and a legislative leader yesterday delivered unwelcome news to the Catholic bishops of Massachusetts, who plan to seek permission from the state to exclude gay and lesbian parents from adopting children through its social service agencies. The governor said he was not authorized to give such an exemption, and State Representative Eugene L. O'Flaherty, the House chairman of the joint committee on the judiciary, predicted little support among lawmakers for any request by Catholic adoption agencies for an exemption from the state's antidiscrimination policies. ''I would say there would not be an appetite to entertain that," O'Flaherty said.
The comments were made a day after the Globe reported a plan by the four bishops of Massachusetts -- representing Boston, Worcester, Springfield, and Fall River -- to hire a Boston law firm to explore legal and political strategies for opting out of gay adoptions. Catholic Charities of Boston, the social service arm of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston, has in the past two decades processed a small number of gay adoptions in compliance with state antidiscrimination laws. The Vatican has stated such adoptions are ''gravely immoral." The bishops' plans are at odds with the 42-member board of Catholic Charities of Boston, which voted unanimously in December to continue the practice of allowing gays to adopt.
Yesterday, representatives of the archdiocese and Catholic Charities said the funds to pay the Boston firm, Ropes & Gray, to prepare a legal strategy for the exemption were coming from the budget of Catholic Charities of Boston. Some board members expressed surprise, and dismay, that the agency's funds were being used for that purpose. The members serve three-year terms and at the pleasure of Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley, several members said. ''I'm shocked," said Donna DePrisco, a board member. ''I find it hard to believe."
One board member, who asked to remain nameless, said the bishops' plans has angered many on the board. The board member said some on the panel may consider resigning if the bishops persist with the plan. Meanwhile, the bishops' hope of getting help from Romney, who is a strong opponent of gay marriage, was dashed yesterday. Romney said that when he read the story in the Globe yesterday morning, he asked his legal counsel to research whether he had the authority to exempt an organization from regulations governing the placement of children with same sex couples. ''My understanding is that any exemption would require legislation and would not be something I would be authorized to do on a personal basis," the governor said. He did not express his own view on the issue.
O'Flaherty said that over a dozen years ago the Legislature adopted the law barring contractors from discriminating against gay couples, and said lawmakers would be unlikely to entertain the bishops' request. ''This is a very divisive issue that I don't see making it onto agenda for a debate," O'Flaherty said. ''We have enough on our plate already." He said he would oppose granting such an exemption to any social agency that contracted with the state, although he said he respected the church's right to follow its own doctrine on the issue.
The bishops may also consider going to court to fight the requirement that they adhere to the state's antidiscrimination policy, on First Amendment grounds protecting religious freedom. In the past two decades, Catholic Charities of Boston placed 13 children with same-sex couples, a fraction of the 720 adoptions the group completed during that time. Those adopted were all foster children who were considered hard to place because they had special needs or were older. If Catholic Charities does not get an exemption, it either has to allow gay adoptions to continue or risk having its adoption license pulled, state officials have said
In portraying conservatives as "homophobic", American Leftists seem to have have forgotten how the Soviets treated homosexuals. The few reservations modern-day Western conservatives have about homosexuals ("marriage", adoption) are nothing compared to the Soviet response. I am old enough to remember Soviet officials actually claiming that homosexuals did not exist in the Soviet Union: Such behaviour was said to be "bourgeois" and "pre-revolutionary". It would do our current Leftist shriekers good to find out what REAL "homophobia" is
Plans to stage Russia's first gay pride parade have been vetoed by Moscow's city government on the grounds that the idea has caused "outrage" in society. Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's administration said yesterday it would not even consider an application for a parade, prompting Russia's gay community to threaten legal action in the European Court of Human Rights.
Gay and lesbian activists have been campaigning for permission to stage the country's first gay pride event on Saturday 27 May. The date marks the 13th anniversary of the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Russia in 1993. But the plans have drawn a furious reaction from religious leaders and been condemned as "suicidal" by other gay activists .
Earlier this week Chief Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin warned that Russia's Muslims would stage violent protests if the march went ahead. "If they come out on to the streets anyway they should be flogged. Any normal person would do that - Muslims and Orthodox Christians alike ... [The protests] might be even more intense than protests abroad against those controversial cartoons." The cleric said the Koran taught that homosexuals should be killed because their lifestyle spells the extinction of the human race and said that gays had no human rights.
The Russian Orthodox Church has called it "the propaganda of sin". Bishop Daniil of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk yesterday condemned the plans as a "cynical mockery" and likened homosexuality to leprosy.
The mayor's spokesman, Sergei Tsoi, said a parade would not be allowed. "[The plans] have caused outrage in society, particularly among religious leaders," he said.
In the Communist era Russian homosexuals were jailed for five years and their "condition" was classed as a mental disorder. In post-Soviet Russia public acceptance of homosexuality has been glacial. An opinion poll last year showed 43 per cent of Russians believed gay men should be incarcerated.
Sounds like she is a REAL idealist. She'll end up a GOP voter. Smith College is a private liberal arts college for women located in Northampton, Massachusetts. A highly selective institution with an undergraduate enrollment on campus of 2,500
I recently found my application essay for Smith from back in high school when I was applying to colleges. In response to the question, "Why did you choose to apply to Smith College?" I wrote, "I have a fervent interest in social justice. Your focus on instilling a spirit of diversity, acceptance and social responsibility excites me. The atmosphere of your school is welcoming. It is a place where intellectually curious young women can be fully challenged."
Last week, I attended the Hot Seat debate on the topic of whether the "Vagina Monologues" was empowering or demeaning. I came because I was interested in hearing both sides of the argument and I assumed other people were as well, regardless of their personal views about the play. The room was almost completely full, with people standing along walls even though new rows of chairs had been added in the back. From overheard conversation, I gathered the impression that most people were supportive of the "Vagina Monologues," but I still, assumed that they had come to be an attentive audience. After all, if you don't want to hear any criticism about the "Vagina Monologues," you can go to see the play or have discussions with like-minded friends. Why would you go to listen to a debate if you have an enormous opposition to hearing both sides?
So you can listen to your side attack the other, apparently, and so you can be rude from the anonymous comfort of your seat. While the debaters opposed to the "Vagina Monologues" managed to keep their points related to the text of the play and its possible influences, the debaters involved with the production of the "Vagina Monologues" accused the other side of "parroting" a Web site that they cited in their arguments. It was, no question about it, a low shot. In one word, they managed to communicate: "Not only are you wrong when you disagree with us, but you are incapable of forming your own opinions. We have our own opinions. We are better, and smarter, than you."
Never mind that a more disrespectful opposition might have, in response, accused them of "parroting" Eve Ensler and others involved in the formation of the "Vagina Monologues." I think they were pretty sure that the other side would not do that, and that if they did, they would be disparaged by the vast majority of the audience. How would the debaters from the "Vagina Monologues" know that the audience was on their side? Because the audience was seemingly incapable of silencing their scorn and contempt for those arguing that the Vagina Monologues are misguided feminism gone awry. While they managed to refrain from shouting, they constantly spoke in contemptuous tones, burst into conversation after everything the opposing side said and yet were miraculously quiet when it was their side's turn to take the microphone. Perhaps they misunderstood their role: in a debate, the debaters on stage are the ones invited to talk and express their thoughts. The audience consists of those invited to listen, and to later express their own thoughts during the question-and-answer portion of the event.
All this sadly confirms what I have noticed in my one and a half years at Smith College: Respect and diversity are very important qualities to the student body, as long as the people who want respect are on their side, and as long as their diversity does not include the diversity of opinion. Are you black, Asian, blind, gay or someone who speaks English as a second language? You'll be welcomed to Smith, which is how it should be. Do you think that modern feminism has gone a little overboard in recent years, that a fetus with a beating heart is a human life or that George W. Bush has ever said one single sentence that expressed a good thought? You'll be outwardly despised, your classmates will automatically assume that based on your belief in one area you hold an entire set of beliefs that may not accurately represent what you think and any signs you put up on campus - in places approved by the college - will mysteriously disappear. This is not how it should be.
I have a twofold theory as to the blatant disrespect on campus, though I'm not sure how accurate it is. The first part is that disrespectful people see their rudeness as "expressing their beliefs". Expressing your beliefs is fine. It's when you don't let other people express their beliefs, or when you denounce their intelligence for doing so, that the problem comes in. The second part is that, in the minds of some students, the opposition are not full people. They are Representative of What's Wrong With the World.
I have lived under a Latin American military dictatorship where daily life was freer than in Britain today. Of course, you couldn't go out into the street and shout "Down with Se¤or Presidente", at least not without dire consequences; on the other hand, you were considerably less surveyed, supervised and harried as you went about your business than you are in contemporary Britain.
The average Briton, we are told, is filmed 300 times a day once he steps out of his door. His home is hardly his castle, either. If he doesn't have a television he receives repeated menaces from the licensing authority, which may send an officer to inspect his house. And the form granting him the inestimable democratic right to vote comes with the threat of a 1,000 pound fine if he doesn't fill it (and he'll go to prison if he doesn't pay the fine).
Numerous officials have the right of entry, and his most private affairs are increasingly of interest to the tax authorities, who have de facto, though not de jure, dictatorial powers. When, as rarely happens, a Chancellor of the Exchequer reduces a tax, he is said by almost every commentator to be giving money away, which implies that we all accept, like the good slaves that we are, that the economy belongs to the Government, and the fullness thereof.
If the citizen should drive, he soon discovers that his vehicle confers anxiety rather than freedom. Slight infringements of the driving rules are photographed and he is fined. When he parks he soon discovers that wheel-clamping is the one public service that works with clockwork efficiency. Squeezing money from him is likewise the one task that the State takes seriously, for he cannot rely on the police to protect him, or the schools to educate his children, or the hospitals to succour him when he is ill, or public transport to take him anywhere without hitch. A bloated payroll does not translate into efficient services: on the contrary, it is incompatible with them.
The State is increasingly concerning itself with the individual's private habits, instituting a reign of virtue, chief among which is healthiness (we are approaching the situation of Samuel Butler's satire, Erewhon, a country where illness is a crime). Though not a single smoker is unaware of the dangers of smoking, and hasn't been for 30 years or more, he is now to be prevented from smoking in public, even when he is among other smokers only.
The pettiness of this official persecution of smokers (who are not prevented from paying a lot of tax) can hardly be exaggerated. The hospital in which I used to work instituted a no-smoking policy, so that smokers had to leave the building to smoke. To do this, one orthopaedic patient needed a wheelchair, but to hire a wheelchair he had to pay a 60 pound deposit, which he did not have. He grew so angry that he needed sedation.
Increasingly the citizen is asked to denounce his neighbour, for example if his neighbour is cheating social security. (Cheating it is the only rational response to so preposterous, impersonal and inhumane a system.) This official invitation to atomise society further by sowing mistrust among the population has not yet been entirely successful; but posters such as the one I saw last weekend in a bookshop - "Racism is a crime. Report it!" - engender a vague but nevertheless all-pervasive anxiety. After all, racism is a vague term, open to many interpretations, and there is an increasing tendency to treat complainants as if their complaints were self-justifying: you have been badly treated if you think you have been badly treated. Far from being a generous and compassionate principle, this attention to, or even encouragement of, complaint confers immense and often arbitrary powers on officialdom. It is not liberating, it is infantilising.
In many NHS trusts, bullying is defined as behaviour that causes a person to feel bullied. No objective evidence whatever is necessary, and the resolution of any complaint is at the discretion of bureaucrats, who thus assume Kafkaesque powers. More and more of us live in an atmosphere of vague and unseen surveillance that might at any moment explode into unanswerable accusation.
We also live in a propaganda state. No one believes what a government official says any longer because he is assumed to be a liar, ex officio as it were, even when he is telling the truth. We assume that all official information is self-exculpating, self-congratulating or self-glorifying in intent, that all official speech is therefore spin or political advertising. Those of us who work in the NHS - not a small number - receive expensively produced glossy publications from our employers, full of photographs of happy, smiling workers meeting happy, smiling customers, at the very same time as drastic cuts must be implemented to meet burgeoning debts and there are patients in casualty who have been waiting for hours for admission. One is reminded of the Stalinist images of flaxen-haired peasant maidens serving at banquet tables groaning with food of every description that were disseminated to the world in the midst of one of the most severe famines in history.
Let them eat lies! In this context, the proposal that we should, at all times, carry identity cards containing a great deal of personal information is particularly sinister. We all know that a suicide bomber is not going to be put off by the mere possession of a biometric ID card, and that the only thing that will deter muggers is efficient policing. Are victims of mugging going to be able henceforth to demand muggers' identity cards before handing over their cash at knifepoint?
But the requirement that we should carry such cards will no doubt give the police another target to aim at: 20 non-carriers a week, for example, producing 1,000 pounds in fines. After all, the immense outlay on producing the cards and the interest on the resulting debt will have to be paid for somehow. You know it makes sense.

There's actually some wisdom there. The dreamy lady says she is holding out for someone who meets her standards. The other lady reasonably replies "There's nobody there". Standards can be unrealistically high and feminists have laboured mightily to make them so
Some bright spark occasionally decides that Leftism is feminine and conservatism is masculine. That totally misses the point. If true, how come the vote in American presidential elections usually shows something close to a 50/50 split between men and women? And in the 2016 Presidential election, Trump won 53 percent of white women, despite allegations focused on his past treatment of some women.
Political Correctness is as big a threat to free speech as Communism and Fascism. All 3 were/are socialist.
The problem with minorities is not race but culture. For instance, many American black males fit in well with the majority culture. They go to college, work legally for their living, marry and support the mother of their children, go to church, abstain from crime and are considerate towards others. Who could reasonably object to such people? It is people who subscribe to minority cultures -- black, Latino or Muslim -- who can give rise to concern. If antisocial attitudes and/or behaviour become pervasive among a group, however, policies may reasonably devised to deal with that group as a whole
Black lives DON'T matter -- to other blacks. The leading cause of death among young black males is attack by other young black males
Leftist logic: There are allegedly no distinctions between groups of humans, yet we're still supposed to celebrate diversity.
'White Privilege'. .. Oh yes. .. That was abundant in the Irish potato famines. ... And in the Scottish Highland Clearances. ...And in transportations to Australia. ... And in Workhouses. ... 'White privilege' was absolutely RIFE!
Psychological defence mechanisms such as projection play a large part in Leftist thinking and discourse. So their frantic search for evil in the words and deeds of others is easily understandable. The evil is in themselves. Leftist motivations are fundamentally Fascist. They want to "fundamentally transform" the lives of their fellow citizens, which is as authoritarian as you can get. We saw where it led in Russia and China. The "compassion" that Leftists parade is just a cloak for their ghastly real motivations
Occasionally I put up on this blog complaints about the privileged position of homosexuals in today's world. I look forward to the day when the pendulum swings back and homosexuals are treated as equals before the law. To a simple Leftist mind, that makes me "homophobic", even though I have no fear of any kind of homosexuals.
But I thought it might be useful for me to point out a few things. For a start, I am not unwise enough to say that some of my best friends are homosexual. None are, in fact. Though there are two homosexuals in my normal social circle whom I get on well with and whom I think well of.
Of possible relevance: My late sister was a homosexual; I loved Liberace's sense of humour and I thought that Robert Helpmann was marvellous as Don Quixote in the Nureyev ballet of that name.
I record on this blog many examples of negligent, inefficient and reprehensible behaviour on the part of British police. After 13 years of Labour party rule they have become highly politicized, with values that reflect the demands made on them by the political Left rather than than what the community expects of them. They have become lazy and cowardly and avoid dealing with real crime wherever possible -- preferring instead to harass normal decent people for minor infractions -- particularly offences against political correctness. They are an excellent example of the destruction that can be brought about by Leftist meddling.
I also record on this blog much social worker evil -- particularly British social worker evil. The evil is neither negligent nor random. It follows exactly the pattern you would expect from the Marxist-oriented indoctrination they get in social work school -- where the middle class is seen as the enemy and the underclass is seen as virtuous. So social workers are lightning fast to take children away from normal decent parents on the basis of of minor or imaginary infractions while turning a blind eye to gross child abuse by the underclass
The genetics of crime: I have been pointing out for some time the evidence that there is a substantial genetic element in criminality. Some people are born bad. See here, here, here, here (DOI: 10.1111/jcpp.12581) and here, for instance"
Gender is a property of words, not of people. Using it otherwise is just another politically correct distortion -- though not as pernicious as calling racial discrimination "Affirmative action"
Postmodernism is fundamentally frivolous. Postmodernists routinely condemn racism and intolerance as wrong but then say that there is no such thing as right and wrong. They are clearly not being serious. Either they do not really believe in moral nihilism or they believe that racism cannot be condemned!
Postmodernism is in fact just a tantrum. Post-Soviet reality in particular suits Leftists so badly that their response is to deny that reality exists. That they can be so dishonest, however, simply shows how psychopathic they are.
So why do Leftists say "There is no such thing as right and wrong" when backed into a rhetorical corner? They say it because that is the predominant conclusion of analytic philosophers. And, as Keynes said: "Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back”
Juergen Habermas, a veteran leftist German philosopher stunned his admirers not long ago by proclaiming, "Christianity, and nothing else, is the ultimate foundation of liberty, conscience, human rights, and democracy, the benchmarks of Western civilization. To this day, we have no other options [than Christianity]. We continue to nourish ourselves from this source. Everything else is postmodern chatter."
The latter "joke" is not a joke at all, of course. It is a comparison routinely touted by Leftists. Both "jokes" are greatly offensive and unfair to the parties targeted but one gets a pass without question while the other would bring great wrath on the head of anyone uttering it. Why? Because political correctness is in fact just Leftist bigotry. Bigotry is unfairly favouring one or more groups of people over others -- usually justified as "truth".
One of my more amusing memories is from the time when the Soviet Union still existed and I was teaching sociology in a major Australian university. On one memorable occasion, we had a representative of the Soviet Womens' organization visit us -- a stout and heavily made-up lady of mature years. When she was ushered into our conference room, she was greeted with something like adulation by the local Marxists. In question time after her talk, however, someone asked her how homosexuals were treated in the USSR. She replied: "We don't have any. That was before the revolution". The consternation and confusion that produced among my Leftist colleagues was hilarious to behold and still lives vividly in my memory. The more things change, the more they remain the same, however. In Sept. 2007 President Ahmadinejad told Columbia university that there are no homosexuals in Iran.
It is widely agreed (with mainly Lesbians dissenting) that boys need their fathers. What needs much wider recognition is that girls need their fathers too. The relationship between a "Daddy's girl" and her father is perhaps the most beautiful human relationship there is. It can help give the girl concerned inner strength for the rest of her life.
A modern feminist complains: "We are so far from “having it all” that “we barely even have a slice of the pie, which we probably baked ourselves while sobbing into the pastry at 4am”."
Patriotism does NOT in general go with hostilty towards others. See e.g. here and here and even here ("Ethnocentrism and Xenophobia: A Cross-Cultural Study" by anthropologist Elizabeth Cashdan. In Current Anthropology Vol. 42, No. 5, December 2001).
The love of bureaucracy is very Leftist and hence "correct". Who said this? "Account must be taken of every single article, every pound of grain, because what socialism implies above all is keeping account of everything". It was V.I. Lenin
"An objection I hear frequently is: ‘Why should we tolerate intolerance?’ The assumption is that tolerating views that you don’t agree with is like a gift, an act of kindness. It suggests we’re doing people a favour by tolerating their view. My argument is that tolerance is vital to us, to you and I, because it’s actually the presupposition of all our freedoms. You cannot be free in any meaningful sense unless there is a recognition that we are free to act on our beliefs, we’re free to think what we want and express ourselves freely. Unless we have that freedom, all those other freedoms that we have on paper mean nothing" -- SOURCE
Although it is a popular traditional chant, the "Kol Nidre" should be abandoned by modern Jewish congregations. It was totally understandable where it originated in the Middle Ages but is morally obnoxious in the modern world and vivid "proof" of all sorts of antisemitic stereotypes
In his great diatribe against the pagan Romans, the apostle Paul included homosexuality among their sins:
"For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.... Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them" -- Romans 1:26,27,32.
Although I am an atheist, I have great respect for the wisdom of ancient times as collected in the Bible. And its condemnation of homosexuality makes considerable sense to me. In an era when family values are under constant assault, such a return to the basics could be helpful. Nonetheless, I approve of St. Paul's advice in the second chapter of his epistle to the Romans that it is for God to punish them, not us. In secular terms, homosexuality between consenting adults in private should not be penalized but nor should it be promoted or praised. In Christian terms, "Gay pride" is of the Devil
The homosexuals of Gibeah (Judges 19 & 20) set in train a series of events which brought down great wrath and destruction on their tribe. The tribe of Benjamin was almost wiped out when it would not disown its homosexuals. Are we seeing a related process in the woes presently being experienced by the amoral Western world? Note that there was one Western country that was not affected by the global financial crisis and subsequently had no debt problems: Australia. In September 2012 the Australian federal parliament considered a bill to implement homosexual marriage. It was rejected by a large majority -- including members from both major political parties. The tide turned in 2017, however, with a public vote authorizing homosexual marriage in Australia
Religion is deeply human. The recent discoveries at Gobekli Tepe suggest that it was religion not farming that gave birth to civilization. Early civilizations were at any rate all very religious. Atheism is mainly a very modern development and is even now very much a minority opinion
"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" - Isaiah 5:20 (KJV)
I think it's not unreasonable to see Islam as the religion of the Devil. Any religion that loves death or leads to parents rejoicing when their children blow themselves up is surely of the Devil -- however you conceive of the Devil. Whether he is a man in a red suit with horns and a tail, a fallen spirit being, or simply the evil side of human nature hardly matters. In all cases Islam is clearly anti-life and only the Devil or his disciples could rejoice in that.
And there surely could be few lower forms of human behaviour than to give abuse and harm in return for help. The compassionate practices of countries with Christian traditions have led many such countries to give a new home to Muslim refugees and seekers after a better life. It's basic humanity that such kindness should attract gratitude and appreciation. But do Muslims appreciate it? They most commonly show contempt for the countries and societies concerned. That's another sign of Satanic influence.
And how's this for demonic thinking?: "Asian father whose daughter drowned in Dubai sea 'stopped lifeguards from saving her because he didn't want her touched and dishonoured by strange men'
Islamic terrorism isn’t a perversion of Islam. It’s the implementation of Islam. It is not a religion of the persecuted, but the persecutors. Its theology is violent supremacism.
And where Muslims tell us that they love death, the great Christian celebration is of the birth of a baby -- the monogenes theos (only begotten god) as John 1:18 describes it in the original Greek -- Christmas!
No wonder so many Muslims are hostile and angry. They have little companionship from women and not even any companionship from dogs -- which are emotionally important in most other cultures. Dogs are "unclean"
On all my blogs, I express my view of what is important primarily by the readings that I select for posting. I do however on occasions add personal comments in italicized form at the beginning of an article.
I am rather pleased to report that I am a lifelong conservative. Out of intellectual curiosity, I did in my youth join organizations from right across the political spectrum so I am certainly not closed-minded and am very familiar with the full spectrum of political thinking. Nonetheless, I did not have to undergo the lurch from Left to Right that so many people undergo. At age 13 I used my pocket-money to subscribe to the "Reader's Digest" -- the main conservative organ available in small town Australia of the 1950s. I have learnt much since but am pleased and amused to note that history has since confirmed most of what I thought at that early age.

ISIS radicals planning terror attacks in Europe ARE entering the continent hidden among migrants, says German police chief
ISIS jihadis determined to carry out attacks in European cities are entering the continent hidden among migrants, a German police chief says.
Hans-Georg Maasen, a federal police chief, claimed ISIS extremists hardened on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria are blending in with the migrants and are planning 'combat missions' in Europe.
In the wake of the Paris attacks it was revealed several of the gunmen and suicide bombers - who helped slaughter 130 people - had reached the city via Greece posing as asylum seekers.
According to the Austria Press Agency, Mr Maasen said his office was aware of almost 8,000 Islamic radicals in Germany.
He said all of these extremists advocate violence to advance their goals, with some trying to win over migrants, and his office receives one or two 'fairly concrete tips' of planned terrorist activity a week.
He went on to describe ISIS extremists as 'combat-hardened professionals' more dangerous than those from al-Qaeda.
His warnings comes just nine days after it emerged eight migrants have reached Europe using documents almost identical to those carried by one of the Paris suicide bombers.
The passport, found near the body of one of those who participated in the massacre of 130 people, identified him as Syrian.
It showed he claimed asylum on the Greek island of Leros last month with the fake Syrian passport in the name of 25-year-old Ahmad Almohammad.
But nine days ago Serbian police revealed they had arrested a man carrying a Syrian passport which was almost a carbon copy of the one found on the ISIS bomber’s corpse.
Serbian officials said as many as six other men this year had entered the EU with virtually identical passports.
The discovery has heightened fears that all the documents are fakes made by the same forger in the Middle East to dupe authorities into believing the holders are asylum seekers.
And worse, it has sparked concerns that the bogus papers could be in the possession of jihadists now lurking undetected in the EU’s passport-free Schengen travel zone.
The shocking ease with which the terrorists who murdered 130 innocent people in Paris were able to travel across Europe has sparked a renewed debate about the open borders policy.
The development raises fresh worries over the potential security threat posed by 670,000 asylum seekers who have arrived in Greece this year after fleeing war and poverty.
Meanwhile, today Czech President Milos Zeman stated Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka was endangering his country by not fully recognizing the danger asylum-seekers are posing.
In an interview published in Thursday's edition of the Mlada Fronta daily, Zeman say that unlike the prime minister he considers the migrant wave 'an organized invasion'.
More than 400 suspected jihadis have returned to the UK from Syria. More than 100 are being ‘monitored’ by police in London alone, we are told.
‘Hundreds more’ are under surveillance nationwide. Yet only eight have been prosecuted so far, it’s reported. Why so few?
The fact that they will enjoy robust defence advice — paid for out of public funds, of course — is a factor. The police will be reluctant to bring cases that are not water-tight. Some civil rights campaigners feel that returning jihadis should not be prosecuted at all.
The argument is made that these prodigals might redeem themselves by providing valuable information about their erstwhile Islamic State commanders — a somewhat Walt Disney-like scenario. Does it seem believable to you?
Some returning fighters will claim they had joined Syrian opposition groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad. Can we prove otherwise?
Their lawyers can point out that, until recently, at least, Assad was also regarded as our enemy by the Prime Minister, David Cameron. So aren’t Assad’s enemies — the jihadis — the PM’s friend?
In Belgium and France, armed police are busily breaking down doors and dragging alleged Islamic State conspirators off to prison. Soldiers are patrolling the streets of Paris and there’s a three-month state of emergency.
When the fear and anger following the Paris slaughter dies down, as it surely will, we’ll hear again about the great British virtue of tolerance which sets us above cruel and backward peoples elsewhere.
But as the great philosopher Sir Karl Popper — himself a foreigner accepted by the UK and knighted by the Queen after a distinguished career — said in his book, The Open Society And Its Enemies: ‘If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.’
Popper suggests: ‘We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law. And we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.’
We accept the State’s suppression of intolerance when it involves racism. We are emphatically not allowed to discriminate on the basis of race, creed or religion.
Muslims here are protected by such laws like everyone else. It’s why some of them came to the UK in the first place. So why is it so difficult to prosecute those who live here — often claiming welfare benefits — who plot with like-minded fanatics abroad to do us harm and destroy our way of life? We parrot meekly that Islamic State’s murderous discrimination against non-Muslims is a perversion of Islam. But is that entirely true?
In Arab countries such as Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, non-Muslims are openly discriminated against. Not believing in Islam is a crime punishable by death, in law if not always in practice.
Do they hope that we’ll be terrorised into coming around to their point of view one day, which boils down to ‘accept Islam or die’?
Bombing Islamic State terrorists in Syria is justified, but pointless on its own. ISIS has to be encircled and destroyed, in Syria and everywhere else it proliferates.
The nations which have acted as its ‘enablers’ must be tackled, too. Lord West, a former Sea Lord, says: ‘We should confront states such as Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which have financed ISIS and bought its oil supplies on the black market.’
And here in Britain, surely it isn’t enough to ‘monitor’ those who actively support the aims of Islamic State? Or must we wait until they commit an atrocity before rounding them up? It’s in the interests of the overwhelming Muslim majority here who mean us no harm to remove those in their midst who give active support to Islamic terrorists.
That majority must understand — as Sir Karl Popper put it — that unlimited tolerance leads to its disappearance. Isn’t escaping intolerance the reason they, or their ancestors, came here in the first place?
It’s at times like this that I envy Roman Catholics. There was no airy-fairy Welbyspeak from Pope Francis, who said that using God’s name to justify the massacre was equivalent to blasphemy.
French ban on Muslim headscarves is upheld by human rights court after woman sacked for refusing to remove hers loses appeal
Europe's leading human rights court upheld the France's ban on Islamic headscarves in the case of a Muslim social worker who was sacked because she refused to take hers off.
Christiane Ebrahimian lost her job at a psychiatric department of a hospital in Nanterre because patients complained about her refusal to remove her head covering.
In 2004, the country banned the wearing of 'conspicuous religious symbols' including the Muslim face veil, known as the niqab.
The ban was eventually extended to schoolchildren and even parents who wanted to accompany classes on trips.
In 2010, the country banned face coverings of all kinds, including masks, niqabs and the full body dress known as a burqa, in public spaces 'except under specified circumstances'.
Ms Ebrahimian was born in 1951 and lived in the capital Paris at the time of the ruling, according to Dr Georg Neureither who founded the online religious platform, Religion Weltanschaaung Recht.
He said she was recruited to the hospital on a fixed term contract as a social worker. On December 11, 2000, she was told that her contract would be terminated because patients complained she would not take off her headscarf.
In May 2000, the hospital wrote to her to remind her that the 'the secular State... prevented public officials from enjoying the right to manifest their religious beliefs while discharging their functions'.
It added: 'Wearing a visible symbol of religious affiliation constituted a breach of a public official's duties.'
A local government in Switzerland imposed a similar rule this week by threatening to issue fines of up to £6,500 to women caught wearing the burqa in shops, restaurants or public buildings.
Officials in the state of Ticino, southern Switzerland, approved the ban after a referendum in September 2013 which saw two out of three voters backing the move.
Ticino government had wanted to ban burqas and niqabs as well as masks worn by demonstrators and balaclavas, it was reported.
The government must reconsider its decision to take an extra 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq in light of the Paris attacks, Liberal backbencher Cory Bernardi has said.
Bernardi told ABC TV on Monday he supported the initial cabinet decision to offer an additional 12,000 visas to refugees from Syria and Iraq, on top of the 13,750 existing humanitarian visa places.
“I do think that cabinet now needs to reconsider the decision to take in 12,000 additional refugees on the basis of evidence that’s come to light over the last week,” he said.
“In our previous refugee intake we’ve had examples where people who have been accepted as refugees have gone on to commit terrorist acts or planned terrorist acts in this country. Why do we think that suddenly this is going to be any different?”
Bernardi said the screening process for refugees was open to inaccuracies, as security agencies were unable to go to Syria to do background checks. He also objected to handing over the decision of who could come to Australia to the “bunch of unelected bureaucrats” at the United Nations refugee agency.
“A lot of the most persecuted minorities in the Middle East – the Jews, the Christians, the Yazidis – don’t even go to UNHCR camps, they don’t register there because they’re scared for their lives by the Muslim communities there,” Bernardi said.
“I do believe we should be reassessing our refugee humanitarian intake,” the Liberal senator said, adding his views were shared by many Australians.
“For many years I’ve been voicing my concerns about extremist elements in the country and the lack of political will to confront that and of course I’ve been called all sorts of names for my trouble by my colleagues and the media,” Bernardi said.
“But the point is I’ve been right about it and it is now a widespread community sentiment. We have extremist elements at work in this country. Why risk bringing in more to add to their ranks, even potentially, and bear the financial and social burden that comes with that?”
Bernardi’s call to axe the 12,000 refugee intake was promptly shot down by the attorney general, George Brandis, who reiterated the government’s determination to proceed during a statement to the Senate condemning the Paris attacks.
“These attacks give no reason to reduce our commitment to helping those who flee the barbarism of Isil and other terrorists,” Brandis said during question time on Monday. “Indeed, they demonstrate more graphically why it is necessary, both to stand resolutely against Isil, and also, to help as best we can its many innocent victims, including the 12,000 Syrian refugees we have rightly committed to take.”
The immigration minister, Peter Dutton, told the House of Representatives’ question time 2,800 Syrian and Iraqi refugees were in the process of having health and security checks as part of the 12,000 intake.
“The Australian government has in place the most robust security screening measures in relation to those coming in under the humanitarian program and we will not resile from that one bit,” Dutton said.
He said the government would cast aside any application of those seeking to come into Australia under the humanitarian visa system if the application presented security concerns.
The first five of the 12,000 intake, a Syrian family, arrived in Perth last week, in line with the government’s promise to resettle the first group by Christmas.
But the New South Wales refugee resettlement coordinator, Peter Shergold, told ABC radio on Monday morning the lengthy security process refugees had to undertake could mean the bulk of the 12,000 visa holders would not be resettled until 2017.
“I’m working on the basis that the vast majority will come next year, in 12 or 18 months, not six months,” he said. “I think it’s appropriate that screening, security, character checks are all done before they arrive.”
Political correctness is most pervasive in universities and colleges but I rarely report the incidents concerned here as I have a separate blog for educational matters.
American "liberals" often deny being Leftists and say that they are very different from the Communist rulers of other countries. The only real difference, however, is how much power they have. In America, their power is limited by democracy. To see what they WOULD be like with more power, look at where they ARE already very powerful: in America's educational system -- particularly in the universities and colleges. They show there the same respect for free-speech and political diversity that Stalin did: None. So look to the colleges to see what the whole country would be like if "liberals" had their way. It would be a dictatorship.
Greg Scandlen, below, makes many good points in telling us what the crusades were really about -- points which are accurate and well-informed as far as I can see. And I speak as someone who has made something of a study of the Byzantine period. He points out the basic truth that the Crusades were a response to the Muslim invasion of Christian lands, not an invasion of Muslim lands. The crusaders simply took back lands that had belonged to Christendom for a thousand years -- Biblical lands.
But the main point surely is to ask: WHY is something that happened a thousand years ago any excuse for something happening today? Why are the crusades any excuse for anti-Western violence by Muslims today? No-one would normally think that a sane proposal to make but when you are dealing with Muslims and their apologists reason flies out the window. If it were sane we would have Britons going to Germany and bombing Germans because Germans invaded Britain a thousand years ago.
The whole idea is a version of punishing children for the misdeeds of their parents, which is generally recognized as a breach of natural law: You should not be punished for something you didn't do
If we were to use Muslim reasoning, we should be making random raids on Muslim lands to steal their property, kill their men and rape their women -- because that is what the Muslim corsairs of North Africa did to coastal Europe right up until the 19th century -- until finally terminated by the French conquest of Algiers in 1830.
In light of President Obama’s recent remarks comparing the brutality of the Islamic State to the Crusades, it might be time to take a fresh look at those events. Were they really the one-sided Dark Ages barbarism we have been taught? Were they an early manifestation of Western imperialism and global conquest?
In his landmark book, “God’s Battalions” (HarperOne 2009), Baylor University social sciences professor Rodney Stark suggests otherwise. It is a well-researched chronicle, including 639 footnotes and a bibliography of about 300 other works, yet reads like an adventure story full of military strategy and political intrigue.
He begins in the final years of Mohammed and describes how a newly united Arab people swept through (Zoroastrian) Persia and the (Orthodox Christian) Byzantine- controlled areas of Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and North Africa. (Byzantine refers to the Greek-speaking eastern remainder of the Roman Empire.) Eventually Arabs took over control of the Mediterranean islands, most of Spain, and the southern part of Italy, and even reached as far as 150 miles outside of Paris before being turned back by the Franks, or early French.
The Muslims were brutal in their conquered territories. They gave pagans a choice of converting to Islam or being killed or enslaved. Jews and Christians (other People of the Book) were usually but not always treated somewhat better, and allowed to retain their beliefs but under conditions of Sharia subjugation.
"Perhaps the single most remarkable feature of the Islamic territories was the almost ceaseless internal conflict; the intricate plots, assassinations, and betrayals form a lethal soap opera. North Africa was frequently torn by rebellions and intra-Islamic wars and conquests. Spain was a patchwork of constantly feuding Muslim regimes that often allied themselves with Christians against one another."
Not surprisingly, there was intense Christian resistance and determination to take back lost territories. Especially effective were the Normans and the Franks in Spain and Italy.
Western scholars have often characterized this clash of cultures as an Islamic Golden Age versus a European Dark Age, but Stark demolishes this as a myth. He says the best of the Islamic culture was appropriated from the people Muslims conquered—the Greeks, Jews, Persians, Hindus, and even from heretical Christian sects such as the Copts and Nestorians.
He quotes E.D. Hunt as writing, “the earliest scientific book in the language of Islam [was a] treatise on medicine by a Syrian Christian priest in Alexandria translated into Arabic by a Persian Jewish physician.” Stark writes that Muslim naval fleets were built by Egyptian shipwrights, manned by Christian crews, and often captained by Italians. When Baghdad was built, the caliph “entrusted the design of the city to a Zoroastrian and a Jew.” Even the “Arabic” numbering system was Hindu in origin.
"However, rather than treat these works as attempts by Greek scholars to answer various questions, Muslin intellectuals quickly read them in the same way they read the Qur’an – as settled truths to be understood without question or contradiction…. Attitudes such as these prevented Islam from taking up where the Greeks had left off in their pursuit of knowledge."
Meanwhile, back in Europe was an explosion of technology that made ordinary people far richer than any people had ever been. It began with the development of collars and harnesses that allowed horses to pull plows and wagons rather than oxen, doubling the speed at which people could till fields. Plows were improved, iron horseshoes invented, wagons given brakes and swivel axels, and larger draft horses were bred. All this along with the new idea of crop rotation led to a massive improvement in agricultural productivity that in turn led to a much healthier, larger, and stronger population.
Technology was also improving warfare with the invention of the crossbow and chain mail. Crossbows were far more accurate and deadly than conventional archery, and could be fired with very little training. Chain mail was almost impervious to the kind of arrows in use throughout the world. Mounted knights were fitted with high-back saddles and stirrups that enabled them to use more force in charging an opponent, and much larger horses were bred as chargers, giving the knights a height advantage over enemies. Better military tactics made European armies much more lethal. Stark writes:
"It is axiomatic in military science that cavalry cannot succeed against well-armed and well-disciplined infantry formations unless they greatly outnumber them…. When determined infantry hold their ranks, standing shoulder to shoulder to present a wall of shields from which they project a thicket of long spears butted in the ground, cavalry charges are easily turned away; the horses often rear out of control and refuse to meet the spears."
In contrast, Muslim warriors were almost exclusively light cavalry, riding faster but lighter horses bareback with little armor, few shields, and using swords and axes. Their biggest advantage was their use of camels, which made them much more mobile than foot soldiers and gave them the ability to swoop in and out of the desert areas to attack poorly defended cities.
These differences provided Crusader armies with huge advantages, but what would prompt hundreds of thousand Europeans to leave their homes and travel 2,500 miles to engage an enemy is a desert kingdom—especially after the Muslim conquest of Europe had been turned back?
There had been long-festering concern about the fate of Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. After his conversion to Christianity in the early 300s, the Roman Emperor Constantine built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the site of what was believed to be Jesus’ tomb, and other churches in Bethlehem and on the Mount of Olives. These sites prompted a growing number of European pilgrims to visit the Holy Land, including Saint Jerome, who lived in Bethlehem for the last 32 years of his life as he translated the Bible from Greek and Hebrew into Latin. By the late fifth century, Stark reports, more than 300 hostels and monasteries offered lodging to pilgrims in Jerusalem alone.
But in 638 Jerusalem surrendered to Muslim invaders, and mass murders of Christian pilgrims and monks became commonplace. Stark includes a list of select atrocities in the eight and ninth centuries, but none worse than the some 5,000 German Christians slaughtered by Bedouin robbers in the tenth century.
Throughout this period, control of Palestine was contested by several conflicting Muslim groups. Stark writes, “In 878 a new dynasty was established in Egypt and seized control of the Holy Land from the caliph in Baghdad.” One hundred years later, Tariqu al-Hakim became the sixth caliph of Egypt and initiated an unprecedented reign of terror, not just against Christians but against his own people as well. He burned or pillaged some 30,000 churches, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the tomb beneath it.
Soon enough, newly converted Turkish tribes came out of the north to seize Persia and Baghdad (by 1045) and press on to Armenia, overrunning the city of Ardzen in 1048, where they murdered all the men, raped the women, and enslaved the children. Next they attacked the Egyptians, in part because the Turks were Orthodox Sunnis and the Egyptians were heretical Shiites. While the Turks did not succeed in overthrowing the Egyptians, they did conquer Palestine, entering Jerusalem in 1071. The Turks promised safety to the residents of Jerusalem if they surrendered the city, but broke this promise and slaughtered the population. They did the same in Ramla, Gaza, Tyre, and Jaffa.
Finally, they threatened Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Alexius Comnenus wrote to Pope Urban II in 1095, begging for help to turn back the Turks. This was remarkable given the intense hostility between the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Perhaps the pope saw an opportunity to unite or at least reduce tensions between the two Christian churches, but he responded with a call to create an army that would go to the Middle East.
I am not going to regurgitate all the battles of the Crusades themselves. It is a fascinating history well worth studying in part for its parallels and lessons for today. Let’s just say that the Crusaders were extremely effective militarily, often defeating far larger Muslim armies, despite having traveled some 2,500 miles into an alien desert climate. Their biggest enemies were disease, starvation, and political betrayal. Plus, the Crusades were expensive and home countries grew weary of paying the taxes needed to support them (sound familiar?)
The Crusaders ended up establishing their own kingdoms in the Holy Land, which lasted for about 200 years or, as Stark notes, almost as long as the United States has existed; but without ongoing support from Europe they could not survive constant attacks from the Muslims.
The current idea that Jews in Israel are usurping the rights of indigenous people is nonsense. This has always been a hotly contested area. In the Old Testament, the Jews wrested control from the Canaanites, then were overrun by the Assyrians, then the Babylonians, then the Persians, then the Greeks, then the Romans. The Romans of Jesus’ time were displaced by the Greek Byzantine Empire, then replaced by the Arabs, then the Egyptians, then the Turks, and finally by the British. For most of human history the wealth of a society was created by conquest and plunder. It is hardly unique to Christians, and certainly not to Jews.
Actually, the Crusaders were unique in that they did not seek to plunder or enslave. They didn’t even try to forcibly convert anyone to Christianity. Their sole interest was to protect the pilgrims and Christian holy sites. They sometimes sacked cities that refused to provide food to a hungry army, but they didn’t take riches back to Europe. There were few riches to be found. Rather than exploiting indigenous resources to benefit Europe, Europe sent money and resources to the Middle East. Pilgrims were quite lucrative for host countries, just as tourism is today.
War was a nasty and brutal business at the time, and had been for all of recorded history. Cities fortified themselves as protection against invading armies. A siege of a city meant surrounding the area and cutting off supplies until the population surrendered, often by starving. In the Bible, II Kings 6:24-33 relates the story of the siege of Samaria, in which two starving women agree to kill and eat their sons.
The rule of war at the time was that, if a city surrendered, the population would be spared, but if it resisted and the invading army had to take it by force all the inhabitants would be killed or enslaved. But Stark notes that Muslim armies often violated even this rule—promising sanctuary, then slaughtering the population that surrendered. (Before we get too smug and condescending about the savagery of these ancients, let’s not forget the rocket bombing of London, the firebombing of Dresden, and the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a mere 70 years ago.)
One way in which Muslim fighters today have advanced over their forebears is that during the Crusades they did not adopt new tactics to counter the technological advantage of the Europeans. They never used crossbows or shielded infantry, even after several hundred years of fighting. Today, Muslim warriors quickly evolve to make the most of Western technology, although they still never seem to develop anything of their own.
One final thought on this. As Stark indicates above, there is in too many Muslim countries a sense of obedience that precludes robust debate or new ideas, let alone technological innovation. In his classic, “The World is Flat,” Thomas Friedman quotes Osama bin Laden as saying,
"It is enough to know that the economy of all Arab countries is weaker than the economy of one country that had been part of our (Islamic) world when we used to truly adhere to Islam. That country is the lost Andalusia. Spain is an infidel country, but its economy is stronger that our economy because the ruler there is accountable. In our countries, there is no accountability or punishment, but there is only obedience to the rulers and prayers of long life for them." (pp. 400-401)
Friedman confirms that this is based on a 2002 report, the first Arab Human Development Report. This report, written by Arabs, found that Spain had a larger gross domestic product than all 22 Arab states combined!
I think Stark is closer to the mark than bin Laden. The problem is a cultural way of thinking that starts with the Qur’an and the Prophet and emphasizes unquestioning obedience. The very name of the religion, Islam, means “submission.” The thinking of bin Laden that emphasizes punishing poor rulers is a complete misunderstanding how progress is made. European cultures place a high value on questioning everything, even the divinity of Jesus Christ. Certainly there have been exceptions to this, but in the sweep of history it is an unmistakable trait.
So we have perhaps the starkest conflict of worldviews imaginable: on one hand, a robust and virtually unlimited spirit of inquiry, and on the other a fervent dedication to universal obedience and submission. How this plays out is the story of our times.
Marty Skinner asks: Syria has had a civil war for almost 5 YEARS. Why all the “refugees “NOW and why so all of a SUDDEN and why in such VAST NUMBERS?
With an Honors degree in History and a lifelong student of the subject, I smell a rat. This is a highly organized, well oiled, mobilized invasion of Muslims and Jihadists into the Western World. It’s been in their plan for a long time. Momar Gadhafi predicted and explicitly stated that Muslim domination of Europe would happen without a conventional war and he said it 30 years ago. 95% of these economic “refugees” many who have cellphones are men between the fighting ages of 20 and 40. Very few women and children from everything I’ve seen.
Odd that the 5 wealthiest Arab States including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait are taking “no refugees” thanks and feel quite self righteous about it. No guilt what so ever? They are even laughing at us for doing so.
Ask yourself, why would Germany Belgium, Holland, France, Sweden and others want to destroy their own cultures from within? It doesn’t make any sense? If this keeps up Europe will be burning daily within a very short few years if not months. Civil war in the streets between civilizations. Muslims vs Kefirs, that is to say, everyone who is not a Muslim.
Unfortunately, the reality is that Muslims are just not like any other immigrants. They don’t want to assimilate, they want to set up separate enclaves and implement Sharia Law. Another problem is that while the civilized West rightly abhors violence, conversely Muslims daily display their love of violence. They live it and embrace it. In many Muslim countries public beheadings and stoning to death for adultery for example. It’s a part of their culture precisely because Islam is, dare I say it, a death cult.
Islam is a supremacist, totalitarian, bigoted, fascist political ideology masquerading as a religion. It literally means “submission”. The Quran MANDATES death for blasphamy, for adultery, for apostasy, for family honor, for being gay, Jewish or a Kafer as well as ten other “crimes” many not even considered to be so in the West. Death for drinking alcohol or taking illegal drugs for example. Why let in vast numbers of these brainwashed people especially men of that age when past experience has already demonstrated the tragedy, not to mention the financial, social, and political costs of rampant multiculturalism in Europe. Ordinary citizens are against this immigration but strangely, their governments are not?
Someone or some organization is pulling some strings here is what I see. Is this invasion part of the New World Order’s plan to depopulate the planet? Maybe there’s not even any such an organization but it’s all over U-tube and other social media. The major media are implicit in selling gullible citizens of the West the righteousness of the “refugees” cause and openly siding against Western culture.
One drowned child’s picture in the right places sparks outrage and sympathy world wide for the movement and resettlement of vast numbers of Muslims. However the implementation of Sharia Law, No Go Zone ghettos in most countries in Europe and Muslim rape gangs go unreported. In radical Islamist countries honor killings, beheadings, stoning’s, cutting off limbs, whipping and torture, pedophilia, child bride marriages, rape and misogyny go unreported DAILY and are dismissed as culturally ingrained.
Where is the indignity and the outrage over people doing this every day to their own populations? Yet a staged picture a drowned baby on a beach sparks a world outcry? Muslim birthrates are 8 children per family while Europeans average 1.4. When these current millions bring in their multiple wives, children and extended families 85% of whom live on state benefits (England’s experience) you can multiply their number by at least 10x, maybe 20x or even more.
By 2050 Europe will be Muslim dominated just by demographics alone. When their numbers are sufficient they will legally vote in their own kind and then Sharia Law. Europe as we know it will be lost forever. Two thousand years of civilization will be destroyed by the same fanatical bearded, bigoted, brutal, boneheaded, belligerent bastards who are now slaughtering their own kind and blowing up ancient and irreplaceable world heritage buildings, monuments, books, manuscripts and other historically significant art treasures in Iraq, Syria and other conquered territories.
Canada (America) should not get sucked into this quagmire of political correctness just to show how polite, civilized. politically correct and Canadian we are. We should learn a lesson from our Australian counterparts.
Folks around Salem, Virginia, were ready to jingle the government’s bells after they implemented a ban on Christmas trees and religious Christmas carols in the public spaces of the local VA hospital.
The holiday hullabaloo began last week when workers received an email announcing that Christmas trees would no longer be allowed in public spaces at the Salem Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
“Trees (regardless of the types of ornaments used) have been deemed to promote the Christian religion and will not be permitted in any public areas this year,” the email stated.
According to the federal government’s telling of the Christmas story, not only did the three wise men delivered gold, frankincense and myrrh, they also brought along a Douglas fir adorned with sparkling lights.
The VA also warned employees that “public areas may only be decorated in a manner that is celebratory of the winter season.”
The VA went so far as to tell workers what kind of “holiday” music was permissible according to government standards.
“Music travels and should be secular (non-religious) and appropriate to the work environment,” the email stated.
The VA decided to go into full Grinch-mode and ban visiting entertainers from warbling any Christmas carol that included the words “Christ” or “Christmas.”
“They told me I could sing ‘Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer’ but I couldn’t sing about Christ,” Pastor John Sines, Jr. told me. “I couldn’t sing about anything that had the word Christmas in it. I could sing what they referred to as ‘holiday’ songs.”
The Rev. Sines, the pastor at Rock Pike Baptist Church in Forest, Virginia, was a bit flustered by the rules. All he wanted to do was entertain the veterans. “My agenda wasn’t so I could push Jesus on the veterans,” he said. “I just wanted to honor the veterans and to say thank-you.”
So the good reverend politely told the VA Hospital that he was not going to abide by the rules. “I let those folks know I wasn’t going to be bullied into their way of thinking,” he said. “We’re rednecks. We don’t have no problem standing our ground.”
Pastor Sines said he wasn’t trying to cause any trouble — he just wanted to do what the Constitution allowed him to do. “I have a Constitution that protects my freedom and I have God who said He would protect me from everything else,” the pastor told me.
In addition to Pastor Sines, the VA had to contend with outraged employees and veterans and the local townsfolk. So on Friday, they reached a compromise.
Pastor Sines said he was re-invited to perform and Christmas trees will once again be allowed in the public spaces — so long as other faiths are also represented.
They cited VA Directive 0022, titled, “Religious Symbols in Holiday Displays in VA Facilities.” The directive states that religious symbols may only be allowed in a public area if they display does not favor one religion over another, and conveys a primarily secular message.
“This compromise allows for the Salem VAMC to be in full compliance with Federal mandates that prohibit US government facilities, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, from ‘favoring one religion over another’ while providing the diversity and flexibility for employees and Veterans to celebrate the holidays according to their individual faith structure,” the VA stated.
The federal government may cite VA directive 0022 for its definition of Christmas, but I prefer to cite the holy Bible. And the Good Book declares that Jesus is the Reason for the Season, not a decorative mat.
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) spoke out Thursday on his concerns for religious liberty in America, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and the recent case of a football coach placed on paid leave for praying publicly after games.
“People of faith in the workplace and in public settings have become the new individuals who are targeted towards don’t ask don’t tell: If you have faith, don’t tell anyone, and don’t ask anyone if you have faith, and if you have it, don’t live it out publicly, because people don’t want to see it,” Lankford said at a Family Research Council event on defending religious liberty.
He voiced concern over the implications of the legalization of same-sex marriage for people of faith as well as concern over the “undercurrent of conversations” with the assumption that if you’re for religious liberty “you’re exclusive, you are divisive, you’re a person that needs to be isolated.”
Lankford gave some examples of recent challenges to freedom of religion, citing the example of Bremerton High School assistant coach Joe Kennedy, who was placed on paid administrative leave by his school district last month for praying on the field after football games.
He said that the school district in this instance “set a new principle that is very interesting for us as we deal with the issue of religious liberty.”
“The new principle that the school district set was: a school district employee cannot have a visual display of faith,” Lankford said, “because if they can see you practicing your faith, then they might take that as the school district establishment of faith.
“It’s an odd statement for them to make that no court has ever stood up but for this district they’re trying to push this one principle,” he said.
Lankford went on to argue that “universities in the country right now are dealing with a new norm as well” following the same-sex marriage ruling.
“A university in my state this year closed married student housing - closed it - understanding full well that there were gay students that would apply to the school and would immediately say I want to get in to married student housing,” Lankford explained.
“Because of the oncoming onslaught of lawsuits, they knew they would face and where they were as a school, they chose to just say we won’t offer married student housing at all,” he said.
“I don’t criticize them for that,” Lankford added. “They’re trying to figure out how do we actually function under a nebulous new court ruling.
“This is not a settled issue in America, and the way the Supreme Court settled this, it will not be a settled issue 40 years from now,” he emphasized regarding the same-sex marriage ruling.
“What is unresolved and what will be the unpacking now - and I think it’ll be first in the universities - is trying to force universities to be able to give up faith principles,” Lankford said.
“The weapons that they have in their tool box for the federal government is accreditation, is Pell Grants, and student loans,” he warned, “They have all three of those weapons in their tool box and say if you don’t do XYZ in your university and recognize XYZ, we’ll take away accreditation, student loans, and Pell Grants and your university’s shut.
“That’s the kind of stuff that accelerates now after this summer’s decision,” he concluded. “It’s the yes you can have any opinion you want as long as it’s ours.”
A career criminal nicknamed 'Monster' who mowed down a five-year-old boy in front of his mother has been jailed more than 10 years after the schoolboy's death.
Nawnee Mackin, of Manchester, knocked down and killed little Samuel Walker as the youngster crossed the road with his mother and sister.
Mackin then 23 - who had no licence or insurance - then fled the scene in a Mitsubishi Gallant which was used as a 'pool car' for the estate where he lived.
He was jailed for nine years today for causing death by dangerous driving after being found guilty at Manchester Crown Court.
The case was reopened on the 10th anniversary of Samuel's death in 2013 and Mackin was later identified as the driver of the Mitsubishi which had been taken for a joyride around the Merseybank Estate in Chorlton. He was also picked out by Samuel's mother Jacqueline Tocmak in an identity parade.
The court heard that Samuel had been crossing Hardy Lane in Chorlton in February 2003 with his 11-year-old sister - who also witnessed him being struck, as they made their way to his grandmother's house. He was thrown up onto the car's bonnet and killed instantly days before his sixth birthday.
Prosecutor Mr Henry Blackshaw said that Mackin had been seen 'wheel-spinning' and driving 'aggressively' before the collision.
Mackin - who had 30 previous offences on his record - drove from the scene after failing to stop and hiding his face as he went around a corner. The car was found abandoned after being reported stolen.
Mrs Tocmak said she never gave up on finding the man responsible for her son's death and would have 'fought for justice until the day I died'.
In a victim impact statement read to the court she said: 'Samuel was a wonderful child, he was bright and funny and he had a loving personality. He was observant and intelligent. As well as being my son he was my best friend.
'He was and always will be my angel. The day Samuel was killed my heart was ripped out. It is every parent's nightmare to lose a child.
'I have missed out on so many of the things that we as parents take for granted. My life was never the same again. He left my son in the road.
'There is not a day I do not think of Samuel. I often relive the events of that day. His sister then aged 11 saw him die. Twelve years later she still cries herself to sleep. Getting justice for Samuel has brought me a step closer for closure for my family and I.'
The judge said: 'You killed that little boy, something which you must have known was highly likely almost immediately. Nonetheless you drove on in the hope you would get away with it.
'You ploughed right through the group hitting Sam who at the last moment turned back towards his mother no doubt sensing the danger.'
The judge added that he had been witnessed committing the crime but was not reported to the police because of the 'moral code against criminals of no grassing'.
He added: 'This is as bad a case of death by dangerous driving as I have had the misfortune to deal with. The wanton driving, the callous disregard for life and the carefully orchestrated cover up are all matters which aggravate the offence.'
It may have been a deliberate sick joke or just another irony of history. But either way, it seemed symbolic that two of the terror attacks in Paris, including the bloodiest assault at the Bataclan theatre, took place on Boulevard Voltaire.
That Parisian thoroughfare is named after the eighteenth-century revolutionary writer Francois-Marie Arouet, known by his pen name Voltaire, who is associated with all the values that those Islamist terrorists despise. Most famously, Voltaire is widely credited with the historic declaration (actually formulated by his biographer Evelyn Beatrice Hall as a summation of his views) that ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it’. Those words ring down the centuries, encapsulating the Enlightenment ideals of free speech and tolerance with which IS and its ilk are at war today.
The appearance of the name Voltaire in the midst of last Friday’s slaughter was a reminder of that which we should hold dear in these times of conflict. It should also serve as a reminder that free speech remains the best weapon we have to defeat the enemies of freedom. That has often been forgotten in the rush to suppress ‘dangerous’ words and ideas in the aftermath of the latest Paris outrage, and of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January.
This war is not only a military conflict over territory in the Middle East. It is a cultural and political battle for the future of the West itself, for the soul of an ostensibly free and civilised society. The danger is not that IS or similar will destroy our freedoms – no terrorist has the power to do that. The danger is that our fearful response to terror will itself further undermine freedom; that we will not simply lose this war, but surrender without a fight.
Reactions to Paris have already illustrated the pusillanimous attitude that prevails towards liberties in general and free speech in particular among the West’s elites. They begin by reaffirming the need to defend our freedoms and values in principle. Then they swiftly cut to the chase and start attacking freedom of speech in practice.
Thus on Monday, the French authorities announced that they had launched more than 150 raids on ‘militant targets’ – not only to hunt for armed terror suspects, but also to round up people who espouse dangerous ideas. France’s prime minister Manuel Valls said that the government was using its special powers under the state of emergency ‘to question people who are part of the radical jihadist movement… and all those who advocate hate of the republic’. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said this offensive was the start of a crackdown that would lead to the ‘dissolution’ of ‘hate-preaching mosques’ across the country.
These raids followed on from the French authorities’ post-Charlie Hebdo campaign to silence ‘hate speech’ attributed to Islamist extremists and ‘Islamophobic’ racists alike. The crackdown involves new measures against ‘hatred online’, the deportation of radical preachers and tougher legal penalties for hate speech and racism.
After the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January and the related murders at a Parisian Jewish supermarket, notorious anti-Semitic comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala was arrested and convicted of ‘condoning terrorism’ for tweeting ‘I feel like Charlie Coulibaly’ – a mash-up of ‘Je suis Charlie’ with the name of the kosher supermarket killer, Amedy Coulibaly. Ironic joke or attempted justification for violence, it was only words, and only one word – Coulibaly – made it controversial. Yet it earned Dieudonné a suspended jail sentence. The French authorities thus made clear that they would fight to the death for the right of people to say things of which the government and the judges approve.
In the UK, the official response to Friday’s slaughter in Paris was to affirm the British state’s support for freedom, while warning of the dangers of taking free speech too literally and speaking out of turn. One foolish woman who posted on Facebook that her Oxfordshire beauty salon would no longer accept bookings ‘from anyone from the Islamic faith’ was not only pilloried by social-media users but also reported to the police and arrested for publishing ‘written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting with the intention of stirring up racial hatred’. Which might seem a heavy-handed state response for advertising your reluctance to do somebody’s nails.
Meanwhile Brit comedian Jason Manford’s Facebook account was suspended after he posted that the Paris attackers were ‘Fucking cowards. Slaughtering innocent unarmed people for what? In whose name? Cos I’ve got news for you, if you think your “god” is gonna reward you for this type of atrocity then your god is a massive cunt. You are a shit stain on all of humanity.’ Harsh but fair some might think, but apparently enough to have Facebook reaching for the ‘Dislike – and Take Down’ button.
Slightly higher up in the UK cultural stratosphere, Economist writer Edward Lucas penned a classic piece of contemporary nonsense in which he effectively argued that in order to defend our freedoms, we must ‘compromise’ (aka sacrifice) some of them, including free speech. Civilisation, declared Lucas, ‘is a cause. We should fervently sing its praises, practise its principles at home and promote them abroad’. And how should we ‘practise its principles’? By accepting that we will have fewer freedoms and more constraints on democracy. And by purging our enemies from ‘social media or the comment fields of mainstream news organisations’. Of course Lucas insists that his proposal ‘does not constrain free speech’ – a sure sign these days that it would do precisely that.
Meanwhile, a 21-year-old toddler from Todmorden in West Yorkshire was arrested for posting an infantile Facebook rant in praise of the terror attacks. The unnamed idiot wrote that ‘My brothers did well in Paris. Now we have proved that there’s a bit of intelligence, planning and synchronisation going into our killings. WE ARE ISIS, THIS IS OUR TIME NOW. Keep your eyes on Manchester, AALUUACKHBAAR! Rip Jihadi John.’
His post met with a robust response from other Facebook users, and disappeared after 45 minutes. In the meantime, however, somebody had reported the jihadi groupie to West Yorkshire Police, who arrested him ‘for publishing material intending to incite racial hatred…West Yorkshire Police take this behaviour seriously, especially in light of the recent events in Paris.’ Why West Yorkshire Police should take this overgrown boy’s behaviour so seriously is unclear, since it appears unlikely that ‘intelligence and planning’ about an IS attack on Manchester would be posted on Facebook from his mum’s back bedroom in Todmorden, and the only ‘hatred’ he seems likely to incite is of himself. Free speech is for fools and fanatics, too.
In the aftermath of Charlie Hebdo and the latest Paris atrocities, it might be tempting to imagine going along with government attempts to crack down on ‘radical’ opinions and censor extremists in our universities. Wouldn’t it be good if we could simply gag them with the UK’s 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, and kick them off campus and social media, if not out of the country, altogether?
But such simple authoritarian solutions to offensive ideas won’t work. Trying to defend freedom by banning its enemies, to uphold our belief in free speech by censoring those who disagree, would be both wrong in principle and worse than useless in practice. What we need to do is fight them on the intellectual and political beaches, not try to bury the issues in the sand. The big problem Western society faces is not how to stop radical Islamists espousing their beliefs; it is how best to make a compelling case for what ‘we’ are supposed to believe in. Free speech is the potential solution, not the problem.
This should not be seen as a concession to the enemy, either. In the war over the future of the West, free speech is the greatest weapon in civilisation’s armoury. Our culture’s internal arguments about values today are often characterised by confusion rather than clarity. How are these problems to be resolved? Not by being afraid of and trying to exclude some ideas on any side, but by open argument in which all points of view can fight it out. Not by creating ‘safe zones’ and restricting debate to the same blandly conformist opinions, but by letting speech run free in a no-holds-barred debate.
The fight for free speech has been key to the historic struggle that has brought humanity from the caves to something approaching civilisation. It is how we decide what we believe to be the truth. That is why the freedom to question everything has been central to the advance of everything from scientific progress to political democracy. Today we need it more than ever.
One word which has come up in many responses to the Paris attacks is ‘Tolerance’. Yet that powerful notion is often abused. ‘Tolerance’ has been turned into a call for censoring ideas deemed too offensive or extreme, through slogans such as ‘we cannot tolerate intolerance’. This is the opposite of true tolerance, which means tolerating the expression of opinions you fiercely disagree with – in order that you might then challenge them in a battle to the bitter end.
That was the spirit of Voltaire’s famous, attributed, motto about defending to the death your right to say things with which we disagree. Or as he put it in his own words, ‘Think for yourself, and let others enjoy the privilege of doing so, too’. Today by contrast, from the university campus to the post-Paris media, our culture is coming under the influence of those I call the reverse-Voltaires, whose slogan is ‘I know I will despise what you say and I will fight to the end of free speech for my right to stop you saying it’.
This is not about upholding an abstract principle. Free speech remains a practical weapon to deal with the enemies of liberty. The alternative, of seeking to ban them and get the genie back in the bottle, can only store up more trouble and lend them perverse credibility as victims of censorship.
It is a hard truth about free speech that the acid test is always standing up for ‘freedom for the thought that we hate’, at the same time as exercising our own freedom ruthlessly to challenge it. In the end it is only those ideas deemed extreme or offensive that need defending on free-speech grounds. The mainstream can look after itself. Nobody ever tries to ban an opinion for being too mundane.
Should we really be scared of speech from bearded Islamists or hair-teasing Islamophobes? Must we turn the whole of our society into a campus-style ‘safe zone’, where we are all to be protected from offensive words that are viewed as if they were automatic weapons?
If we are not going to defend the civilisation-founding liberty of free speech, then what are we supposed to be fighting for in this war?
The Labour MP studied politics there in the early 1970s before becoming a lawyer and, subsequently, a politician who — not long ago — believed that touring Britain in a pink van might dismantle the ‘patriarchy’ (otherwise known as civilisation, to you and I; something men created, but women have long enhanced, benefited from and now co-own).
Needless to say, she was wrong. On paper her approach may have had all the hallmarks of a PR success story, but in today’s climate it simply smacked of tired tactics. Still, by the University of York’s standards, it was probably A-grade stuff. After all, stale with esoteric feminist professors and their wacky take on reality, they too remain locked in Harman’s time-warped mindset.
Earlier this week, the college u-turned plans for a modest International Men’s Day (IMD) meeting — even though it coincided with a parliamentary discussion on the 19 November event.
Yep, rent-a-gob gender warriors — who, I often find, are some of the most privileged people in the world — decided that men responsibly discussing their collective issues (suicide, schools failing boys, fathers’ rights, violent partners, MGM, the life expectancy gap, etc) without feminist supervision was too risky of inducing a riot — or, at the very least, a hashtag.
Still, in an open letter signed by 200 people (many of whom were former students or, more worryingly, incumbent lecturers) they declared: ‘A day that celebrates men’s issues – especially those outlined in the university’s statement – does not combat inequality, but merely amplifies existing, structurally imposed, inequalities [sic]. Men’s issues cannot be approached in the same way as discrimination towards women, because women are structurally unequal to men.’
It continued: ‘We recognise that patriarchy is damaging to both men and women. We do not, however, believe that the university statement engages with these complex issues with sufficient nuance or understanding. The failure of the Equality and Diversity Committee to do so undermines their self-proclaimed commitment to gender equality, and leaves us deeply concerned that their supposed investment in women’s rights is mere lip service.’
It’s almost like competitive victimhood. Except, err, young women in further education are anything but victims, making feminism increasingly redundant for them.
Granted, this might be bittersweet news if you’re heavily invested in it’s ongoing survival, but, trust me, it’s ultimately a good thing. That’s surely what we’ve been working towards: men and women largely being equal, at least in terms of inequality, or lack thereof.
Perhaps somebody should tell campus feminists this because, judging by their poor level of enlightenment on the matter, they need some serious de-programming.
Earlier this year, spiked published the Free Speech University Rankings (FSUR), which highlighted the scale of the intolerance problem. They found that 80 per cent of UK colleges censor debate and expression; much of this is done by NUS officers preoccupied with Page 3, boisterous sports teams and Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines, rather than anything pertinent.
But why? Certainly not for PR purposes. This latest battle has been humiliating, with the likes of Leeds Becket University — which is hosting its own IMD event - instantly appearing demonstrably younger, smarter and progressive than York by default.
So what gives? Is it more that, like George Orwell once said, the war is not meant to be won, but to be continuous?
Christina Hoff Somers, academic and host of YouTube’s Factual Feminist, thinks so. When I interviewed her earlier this year she told me: ‘In the early 1990s, I — along with several other feminist scholars (Wendy Kaminer, Daphne Patai, Camille Paglia, Mary Lefkowitz, Katie Roiphe, to name a few) — went to battle against the hardline, sex-panicked conspiracy feminists like Andrea Dworkin.
‘My side won the arguments, but their side quietly assumed all of the assistant professorships. So colleges are now full of gender scholars who instruct students on the ravages of the capitalist, hetero-patriachal system and its “rape culture”. Everywhere we hear about “micro-aggressions”, “trigger warnings”, and the toxicity of masculinity.’
At the Battle Of Ideas weekend in London last month, she added: ‘We won the battle, but they won the war. The question now is whether they can hold on to that power…’
The fact there’s already a 1,000-strong petition to reinstate the University of York’s Men’s Day event suggests not. Especially as, rather brilliantly, it was started by a woman.
A news story in The Australian this morning indicates that the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Commission has found a preliminary “case to answer” in relation to a claim of sexual orientation discrimination against not only the Archbishop of Hobart, Julian Porteous, but also “all Australia’s Catholic bishops.”
We have known for some time that Greens political candidate Martine ­Delaney had made a complaint against Archbishop Porteous, but the additional feature of the decision of the Anti-Discrimination Commission is the inclusion of other Catholic Bishops from all around Australia.
The booklet distributed to parents of students at Roman Catholic schools by Archbishop Porteous is entitled, “Don’t Mess with Marriage,” and was produced by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference.
The booklet eschews all forms of “unjust discrimination,” and goes on to say, “some suggest that it is unjustly discriminatory not to allow people with same-sex attraction to marry someone of the same sex. Others believe that marriage is an institution uniting a man and a woman. We wish by this pastoral letter to engage with this debate, present the Church’s teaching to the faithful, and explain the position of the Catholic faithful to the wider community.”
It continues: “the traditional view of marriage, which the Church has always supported, is different. It sees marriage as about connecting the values and people in our lives which otherwise have a tendency to get fragmented: sex and love, male and female, sex and babies, parents and children. This view has long influenced our law, literature, art, philosophy, religion and social practices. On this view, marriage includes an emotional union, but it goes further than that. It involves a substantial bodily and spiritual union of a man and a woman.
“Redefining marriage to include same-sex relationships will have far reaching consequences for all of us. The world around us influences the communities in which we live. Cultural and legal norms shape our idea of what the world is like, what’s valuable, and what are appropriate standards of conduct. And this in turn shapes individual choices. That’s one of the main purposes of marriage law: to enable and encourage individuals to form and keep commitments of a certain kind. But if the civil definition of marriage were changed to include ‘same-sex marriage’ then our law and culture would teach that marriage is merely about emotional union of any two (or more?) people.”
The legal status of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, and whether it claims to represent, for example, the views of every Roman Catholic Bishop in Australia, is unclear. But it must also be said that it would be somewhat odd if a Tasmanian tribunal were legally able to exercise authority over Bishops who operate in other states of Australia.
The more important issue, of course, is whether the law will continue to protect the religious freedom of churches and believers to maintain and teach within their own communities the historical views of Christianity about marriage and sexuality.
These issues are brought sharply into focus when some of those supporting “marriage equality” consider this sort of attempted widespread suppression of speech and religious freedom a reasonable policy stance.
Megan Giles, who wrote the article I excerpt below, has a significant academic background. It is however a solidly Leftist one, so we cannot expect much in the way of balance or academic rigour from her. She mainly seems to be a do-gooder. Anyway, she knows a bit about history. And she parades that history as if it excuses or at least explains the current epidemic of Muslim violence. She spells out the tired old comment that Christians and Christian countries have been violent in the past too. As if nobody knew that!
But it is not history we have to deal with. It is the present. So why is the present-day world's flood of political violence coming from Muslims?
She seems to think that it is Muslims "getting even" with the West for colonialism. But de-colonization took place around 50 years ago. And, after some initial eruptions, the decolonized world was mostly peaceful. What has suddenly caused it to erupt? And why are Indo-China and other non-Muslim ex-colonies not erupting? And why are the people being killed at the moment overwhelmingly Muslim, rather than the wicked colonists?
Megan has not apparently thought of those questions. Her conventional Leftist hates are all she has to explain anything, whether they fit or not. She is a procrustean.
I and many others point to the way in which ISIS and other violent Muslims are just doing what the Koran says. Megan thinks that cannot be the explanation as Christians have been similarly vicious at times too. But that is a non-sequitur. A particular type of behaviour can arise from many causes. And that normal human selfishness has caused Christians to GO AGAINST New Testament teachings proves nothing. But Muslims don't have to do that. The Jihadis are not going against ANYTHING in their religion. Their deeds and faith are in harmony. So we at least need to note that.
And that makes a difference to what adherents of the two religions hear. Both Mullahs and priests tell their adherents to do as their holy books say. So Christian priests overwhelmingly preach peace and kindness while the Mullahs overwhelmingly preach conquest. And preaching can be influential. Why do it otherwise? For most people -- Christian or Muslim -- it goes in one ear and out the other. They usually accept the wisdom of it but don't act on it. But some do. So on the one hand we have the provision of Christian hospitals and schools while on the other we have gruesome violence.
So what the Koran says is indeed central to the Muslim problem -- because it is what most of the Mullahs preach -- and what the Mullahs preach is influential.
But why is it that we have the upsurge of violence now? Megan does not even attempt to tell us. She had no answers about the causes of Muslim violence at all.
But I think the cause is pretty clear. It is in that history that Megan thinks she knows about. It is a product of ham-fisted European intervention. A skeletal outline:
It all started with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Afghanistan had been a reasonably secular State up until then. But it was part of the Ummah, part of the Muslim world. So it was devout Muslims who chased the Soviets out. The invasion aroused the devout Muslims and eventually made them the only effective force in the land. And they used that power to transform Afghanistan into a Koranic State, a centre of Islamic righteousness and virtue.
And it might have stopped there except for the fact that the Afghan upheavals had attracted a very rich Saudi who became instrumental in defeating the Soviets: Osama bin Laden.
And Koranic virtue does preach attack on the infidel, the kuffar. So after helping to defeat the Soviets, Osama bin Laden was "feeling his oats" and sought new fields to conquer -- and consequently organized the attack on the exceedingly un-Muslim USA, with results we all know about.
And since then it has been push and counter-push. An Afghanistan-enmeshed organization -- Al Qaeda -- attacked the USA so the USA attacked Afghanistan in an attempt to root them out. And once the USA under George Bush was mobilized, they thought that the sabre-rattling coming from Iraq sounded dangerous too so decided that a pre-emptive war there was needed to avoid another "9/11".
But in both Afghanistan and Iraq, the Americans had no reasonable idea of an end-game. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, they assumed that destroying the hostile regime would enable them to give the grateful natives the blessings of democracy. But there is no history of democracy in the Middle East and no hankering for it. Instead there is a 4,000 year history of tyrannies. So the semi-democratic regimes set up by the Americans had no legitimacy in the eyes of the people and consequently had little control over anybody or anything. Instead we have had chaos.
But nobody likes chaos and many influential Muslims of the Middle East have put their hands up as the new tough-guy leader who will restore peace and unity -- and maybe even become the new Caliph. And that is what has been going on. Can it have escaped anyone's notice that 98% of the people dying are Muslims? Much of the the Middle East and North Africa is in the midst of a civil war to determine who the next tyrant will be. The people there want a strong tyrant not a wishy-washy democracy.
And amid those struggles aspiring leaders will do everything they can to acquire legitimacy. And attacks on the West are a good way of doing that. It enables the aspiring tyrants to claim Islamic righteousness. So what constitutes Islamic righteousness does matter. And we find that in the Koran.
And all the excitement of the struggle does catch the attention of people in the Western world whose ancestry is in Muslim lands. And a tiny minority decide that they want a part of the action.
So is it reasonable to target the whole Muslim minority of a Western country in some way? I think it is. But no half measures will do. Tentative measures will just exacerbate the problem. The small minority of radicalized Muslims can do a lot of damage and cause a lot of disruption, social and otherwise. And the populations of Western countries are becoming increasingly intolerant of that, as they should. We wouldn't accept such disruption from anyone else so why should we accept it from young Muslims?
But how can we get violent young Muslims out of our countries? How do we detect in advance who they are? We cannot. So the only way of getting the violent young Muslims out of our countries is to get ALL Muslims out of our countries. I believe it will come to that. Muslim populations ARE a breeding-ground for terrorists and that undisputable fact endangers their continued long-term acceptance in Western countries.
Hanson states that the New Testament, unlike the Qur’an, is devoid of any violence, as if the relative peace and prosperity enjoyed by the Western world is somehow solely attributed to the teachings of Jesus Christ.
Hanson and many others fail to recognise the context of time, place and circumstance that permits the usurping of Quranic verses for such violence.
They fail to scrutinise what it is that separates the millions of Muslims, and millions of others of faith, who can read their sacred scriptures in their historical contexts, from those that totalise and literalise religious doctrine and wrongly champion it as the impetus for their savagery.
In the late 20th century, regimes across the Arab world shaped and utilised Islamic ideologies to solidify and mobilise support against Western liberalism. And so it goes, on and on through history. Past contexts magically transforming to suit present and future contexts.
When we place blame we go directly to the original source, without acknowledging how that source has been manipulated to accommodate contemporary political objectives.
Though all of this, in our current debate, is near-irrelevant. Focusing on the details of religious texts will lead us nowhere since we have, right in front of us, countless examples that help us understand the rise of Islamic State and specific historical, albeit complex and multi-faceted, justifications for North African and Middle Eastern violence.
Indeed what is missing from mainstream debates about contemporary terrorism is the very heavy historical baggage it carries.
Tony Blair has apologised for “mistakes” made during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The US government’s hasty state-building policies after the disbanding of the Iraqi army left thousands of young men angry, armed and unemployed.
Unfortunately, only few commentators will reach back far enough into history to examine the brutal, incendiary and utterly destructive legacy of colonialism in the Middle East to understand contemporary violence.
While ‘we’ in the West have moved on from colonialism and want everyone else to just ‘get over it’, post-colonial states were never given space to – they live its continuity in the neocolonial economic policies of the Washington Consensus and the ubiquity of a militarised national consciousness where violence pervades and reproduces.
The late Algerian psychiatrist Franz Fanon has written passionately on the impact of colonialism on the colonised individual’s psyche, and its propensity for creating violent separatist and regionalist factions, long after independence.
“At the individual level, violence is a cleansing force. It rids the colonized of their inferiority complex, of their passive and despairing attitude… Violence hoists the people up to the level of the leader.”
Despite the horrors of history committed on every continent, our right to anger and grieve over the bloodshed in Paris is doubtless. It must be denounced with the loudest possible voice and responded to with the strongest possible deliberation and vigilance.
Good people lost their lives because they represented the freedom we all hold dear, no matter our race, nationality or religion. Though we must fall short of dismay that Middle Eastern wars have somehow spilled over onto a bystanding Europe caught up in the crossfire.
These wars belong to the Great Powers and they always have. As Gordon Adams has noted, “France has been a central arena for the confrontation between Islam and political-religious Christian Europe for 1,300 years.”
The proceeding centuries were characterised by a vicious brand of colonialism under the guise of exporting a concept of citizenship that was highly exclusionary at home, and anti-Islamic domestic policies leaving hostility an omnipresence weaved through France’s social and political fabric.
Adams states, “France needs to undergo a deep self-examination, and a fundamental revision of the current practice of sidelining its large Muslim population, leaving them disaffected, poorly educated, underemployed, and ripe for recruitment to terrorism.”
All religious texts have the capacity to unite or divide humanity. Our conversation must start centering on the dark, ugly side of human nature and the contexts that breed violent extremists of which our own states are often complicit in.
Social workers lied on under oath and doctored a report as part of an attempted 'cover-up' which favoured five children being taken away from their parents.
Judge Mark Horton said there had been a 'deliberate and calculated' alteration to the dossier and changes had been made by a social worker and a team manager.
Alterations of the report, which was an assessment of the children's parents, had completely changed its tenor and improved the case for removing the children from their parents.
In a family court hearing in Portsmouth, Judge Horton said: 'It is exceptional to find a case in which there has been deliberate and calculated alteration of a report prepared by one social worker in order to make that assessment seem less favourable, by another social worker and the team manager; the withholding of the original report when it was ordered to be disclosed and the parties to the alterations lying on oath one of them twice, in order to try to cover up the existence of the original report.'
The original report of the parents, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had contained 'positives and negatives' and had been balanced.
Proceedings started more than two years ago and the children, aged between three and 16, are currently living with foster parents as part of an interim agreement.
Social workers for Hampshire County Council wanted them to stay in foster care but their parents wanted them returned to their care.
But despite Judge Horton saying the children should stay within the care of the council and approving fostering plans put forward by staff, he was critical of the way the case had been handled.
'The reasons for the delay have been almost exclusively, the actions of employees of the applicant local authority.'
He said given the 'enormity' of what staff had done and the fact 'they still work as social workers' it was right that they should be named so that members of the public were aware of 'their shortcomings in this case'.
The judge indicated that some staff had left Hampshire council and moved on to other jobs since the case involving the five children had started.
Kim Goode had been Sarah Walker Smart's manager and 'was the person who initiated the wholesale alteration of the original report and who attempted to keep the truth from the parties and me', said the judge.
'Her evidence was deeply unimpressive,' he added. 'She made a 'hollow' apology to the parents during her evidence; she regarded a social worker lying on oath as 'foolish' and she failed to accept any personal responsibility for what had gone on under her management.'
He said she had gone on to become assistant director of children's social care with Lambeth Borough Council.
Judge Horton said he had concluded that at one stage the children had been illegally removed from their parents' care - and that a 'fair parenting assessment' had not been carried out.
He said a number of concerns had been raised about the way the children were being looked after by their parents.
But despite the quality of those relationships, the parents had 'difficulty parenting the children to the required minimum standard', he said.
The court heard that both parents had experienced 'very difficult childhoods', had an underlying 'chronic' mistrust of professionals and did not want to 'inflict on their children the experiences they themselves had as children', which had led them to failing to provide effective boundaries for the children, according to the judge.
He said this then led to appalling neglect of the older children's educational, emotional and social development and neglect of all of the children's health needs.
Hypocrisy of the cinemas: Film bosses ban Church's video of the Lord's Prayer - yet allow adverts for beer and violent video games to be shown to children
Cinemas have banned an advert encouraging prayer while letting children see commercials selling alcohol and ultraviolent video games.
The 60-second recording of the Lord’s Prayer was scheduled to be shown ahead of screenings of the new Star Wars film before Christmas.
But it was pulled after the company which sells advertising at the Odeon, Cineworld and Vue chains said the Church of England film could be seen as offensive.
Christian and Muslim leaders, MPs and even the outspoken atheist Richard Dawkins said the decision was ridiculous.
One 12A-rated film, which children of any age can watch with an adult, showed a sexualised perfume advert featuring naked models posing as Adam and Eve;
The prayer advert was pulled even though Digital Cinema Media, which sells screen advertising, had no written policy against it;
Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said: ‘This advert is about as offensive as a carol service or a church service on Christmas Day.’
He appears in the advert, walking through a park while voicing a line from the Lord’s Prayer. Further lines are spoken by children, police, weightlifters, a farmer, refugees and a gospel choir.
It ends with a link to JustPray.uk, a website featuring prayers submitted via social media. The advert was cleared by the Cinema Advertising Authority and rated U – suitable for all – by the British Board of Film Classification.
CofE spokesman, Reverend Arun Arora, said he was baffled by the ban, adding: ‘In one way the decision of the cinemas is just plain silly but the fact they have insisted upon it makes it rather chilling in terms of limiting free speech.
‘We are hopeful the leadership of Digital Cinema Media would have the strength to recognise they have made a mistake and change their minds.’
Yesterday it emerged that DCM, which controls 80 per cent of UK cinema advertising and is jointly-owned by Odeon and Cineworld, was so eager to host the advert in July that an agent offered the Church a 55 per cent discount.
But on August 3, he claimed the cinemas would refuse to show the clip, saying ‘our hands are tied by these guys’.
Executives later said that DCM had turned the advert down because its policy prevented it airing trailers ‘connected to personal beliefs’.
But yesterday DCM claimed its decision was based on its ‘policy of not accepting political or religious advertising content for use in cinemas’ – pointing to a document on its website as evidence.
Analysis by the Mail reveals this document’s creation date was last Friday – just two days before the farce was revealed by the Mail on Sunday.
Professor Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist who is an outspoken critic of organised religion, told the Guardian: ‘I strongly object to suppressing the ads on the grounds that they might offend people.
She added: ‘Somehow cinemas think it is OK to promote sugar, popcorn and fizzy drinks at children when we have a serious problem with diabetes in this country, but they won’t show an inoffensive and intelligent advert at a time when it is important to reflect on what our great world faiths, including Christianity, are all about.’
Yesterday Odeon and Cineworld screenings of 12A films were packed with teenagers and younger children. But all featured adverts for alcohol, including hard spirits, or violent 18-rated video games.
SCOUTS are set to dump the word “God” in its traditional promise amid claims the ­religious reference was making non-Christian members “uncomfortable” while turning others away from joining.
References to being “cheerful” and “thrifty” are also set to be axed, while a pledge to “doing my duty to Australia” will be canned to be more inclusive to other ­nationalities as part of a major review within the nation’s largest youth movements.
In a move set to irk monarchists, an optional promise to the “Queen of Australia” is also to be permanently given the boot as part of the modernisation of the movement.
Scouting families have until the end of the year to complete a survey on the new wording of the movement’s new “law and promise” that will then be recited by members from mid-2016.
A message posted on its website by Scouts Australia chief commissioner Chris Bates said the change of words was about making the Scouts more inclusive.
The existing promise includes the line “I promise that I will do my best to do my duty to my God and to the Queen of Australia”.
However, some younger Scouts were already reciting an adapted version of the promise, contributing to a “silo-effect” between its sections, Mr Bates said.
He said there was a strong feeling some of the wording was not consistent with members’ beliefs or their current use of language. “The result is we are either losing members or some of our members are using words they don’t actually believe in,” he said.
“After much research and discussion, we have provided some new wording for a revitalised promise and law that we believe young Australians will find easier to commit to, and to follow.”
One of the proposed ­options for the new promise includes a reference to being “true to my spiritual beliefs”.
The revised law ditches the need for Scouts to be cheerful, thrifty, courageous and helpful, while retaining the need to be friendly, honest, fair, loyal and trustworthy.
Founded in 1958, Scouts Australia is regarded as the largest youth movement in the nation with almost 70,000 members. Although the ­organisation is open to members of all religious faiths, those who refuse to make the promise to God are not ­allowed to become members.
The Scouts Youth Program Review said feedback from members found many parents preferred non-­religious activities for their children “and have expressed discomfort with the use of the word ‘God’.”
Scouts had the option to ditch the line about “doing my duty to the Queen” a decade ago, with only a few branches retaining the reference. But the review said most members felt the phrase needed to change, with less than 12 per cent wanting it retained.
As for revising the law, young people no longer used words such as “thrifty”. It said scrapping the reference to “Australia” in the promise was in recognition of the global nature of scouting, it said.
“The removal of direct reference of Australia was also seen as recognition of the global nature of Scouting, and making the promise more ­inclusive for citizens of other nations,” the review said.
Americans rejected him in the 2004 Presidential election but he is still hanging around like a bad smell
There's an age old quote often attributed to Mark Twain that says "better to be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt." Unfortunately, John Kerry's role as Secretary of State compels him to speak publicly on behalf of the United States, and he's spent the last several months sweeping up those last few grains of skepticism about his intellectual limits. As Jonah Bennett at the Daily Caller notes:
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry remarked Tuesday that the attacks on Charlie Hebdo are much more understandable and have a better rationale than the Friday Paris attacks.
Kerry flew to France following the G20 talks in Turkey and delivered remarks at the U.S. embassy on the Paris attacks, which left 129 dead, CBS News reports.
“There’s something different about what happened from Charlie Hebdo, and I think everybody would feel that,” Kerry said. “There was a sort of particularized focus and perhaps even a legitimacy in terms of – not a legitimacy, but a rationale that you could attach yourself to somehow and say, ‘Okay, they’re really angry because of this and that.’ This Friday was absolutely indiscriminate.”
Kerry's response is rife with the moral relativism and unseriousness that underlies modern liberalism. It's an incoherent view that is both condescending and generous. "In our Western society, we abhor violent retaliation for speech, but we understand if that's not how you do things in the Islamic world, and we're sorry if our insensitivity to your cultural preferences offends you." As Charles Cooke at the National Review put it:
Implicit in Kerry’s reasoning is the assumption that the perpetrators of the attacks against Charlie Hebdo had a clear purpose whereas the perpetrators of last week’s abomination did not. Or, as he put it, that in one case the killers were “really angry because of this and that,” but that in the other they were not.
But this isn’t true. In fact, both set of attackers gave reasons. With Charlie Hebdo, the killers’ purported motive was revenge against ”blasphemous” expression; in Paris last week, it was disgust at Paris’s reputation for “obscenity.” In consequence, there are only two choices here: Option 1) That John Kerry believes that killing people for speaking rudely is more understandable than killing them for being secular; or Option 2) That John Kerry doesn’t actually know what the most recent attackers used as their justification (and also doesn’t remember that at the same time as the Charlie Hebdo assassinations, associated gunmen targeted a market simply because its owners were Jews).
Although Kerry's logic is muddled, one thing is quite clear: this is an unserious man who is completely unfit to be America's Secretary of State.

All discussion relevant to Countdown that is not too spoilerific. New members: come here first to introduce yourself. We don't bite, or at least rarely.
I have a vague memory of hearing that you can go back on Countdown as a contestant if it's at least 10 years after your prior appearance.
Been stranded on an island for nearly a decade but might return to the motherland next year and this is literally the only possible enjoyable thing I can envisage doing while there.
If I suddenly have a squirming baby on my lap it probably means that I should start paying it some attention and stop wasting my time messing around on a Countdown forum
With it being you, I doubt you're serious anyway, but there's no precedent for letting a CoC contestant back is there?
I believe the official rule is no, but then again there are several returnees in recent years, so much so that it has de facto become such a rule. I would personally leave at least 15-20 years between appearances, and I am very surprised Zarte was allowed back on.
There will probably be a bigger surprise if I get back on for a third time..., but the precedent has been set, so nothing can be ruled out nowadays, I guess...
I still assume that that was an accident, so I'd say there's no precedent yet. And you're too loud to be an accident.
How do you find out if you can go back on? Do you passively wait for Damian to tell you, constantly pester him, constantly send in new application forms or what?
When I did it the first time, I was expecting it to be rejected/hear nothing more from it, so to be told I had an audition was great, even though the person who did my audition only knew of my past experience when I told her at the audition...
well I wouldn't say no! But I would be a big hypocrite, because I do think once you've made a finals that's your series on the show, shouldn't need a do-over. Would love to be on for a special if that ever came up, maybe we should have a fake wedding and get invited back ala Ryan/Michelle?
It's real. Would be great to see you back on there and I can't see a reason for you to be turned down. Go for it.

Your product may already be obsolete. You may not know that, yet. Product people need to be acutely aware of all the different technological shifts happening in the industry and consistently ask ourselves if and how these things actually affect us? This is not just some dry strategic exercise. If you don’t do it your business could die an awful lot quicker than you expect. Here’s what to watch out for.
Continuous delivery is all the rage now a days. Some teams still think – how could our system ever do that? Doesn’t seem likely, they say. While there are often several technical hurdles to overcome, practicing Continuous Delivery can also require significant cultural changes. Here are a few.
Often you come across situations where both senior and middle managers see the value in moving towards a team-based organisation and iterative incremental delivery. However, It’s a little more common for middle managers to hold onto the existing pattern. Why is that? Or Why not? Read on.
We are always on a look out for new and improved ways to grow more human centric, high performing workplaces. Sociocracy and Holacracy promise this. Sociocracy 3.0 is a free and open, principles based framework of patterns for people wishing to collaborate more effectively and benefit from agile principles at scale, regardless of their chosen approach to product development and service delivery. Have a look.
When you ask developers and engineering managers what their software product does, often they struggle. They regale details equivalent to explaining the production of electricity, starting from mining coal until the switch closes a circuit. It’s all about the technical how. But how about the customer perspective? Are you missing this all important perspective? Read on.
There’s no globally accepted vision of what perfect code is. Everyone has a slightly different aesthetic for code, meaning we each have our own idea of what perfect code looks like. But who defines perfection? Is it even achievable? Wouldn’t it be better to find an effective technique in avoiding team conflict is to stop aiming for perfect code? Read on.
Your team is stuck in analysis paralysis. The surveys, reports, and stats began to pile up. But they don’t seem to help. And despite the many meetings, task forces, brainstorming sessions, and workshops created to solve any given issue, the team tisn’t getting to a new decision. What to do? Read on.

The Lineup will return to Cube 37 again in May to showcase more young up and coming musicians on and around the Mornington Peninsula. Presented by the Little Theatre Company and hosted by James Reyne, the Lineup encourages aspiring musical artists from across the Mornington Peninsula and Frankston regions and gives them an opportunity to perform and mix with more established artists from whom they can learn skills, form friendships and develop a nurturing musical network.
Reyne is a Peninsula boy, as well as being renowned as the former Australian Crawl lead singer, an acclaimed solo artist and recently recipient of the Order of Australia Medal for his service to the Performing Arts. Having Reyne as both a patron and an amazing role model for the young musicians participating in The Lineup is once again a pleasure and a privilege for organisers.
This time ‘Foreign National’ will headline the event; a Melbourne band consisting of several local musicians from the area. Having leapt to amazing heights since their 2013 debut, the band have wowed fans as far away as Istanbul, London and LA, with two singles out already and a recent month long residency at Toff in Town.
Joining them on stage will be Black Pepper, the partnering local vocalist Ella Cannon and her brother Jack on guitar, with an amazing international backline who fuse funk and soul with a little Mexican salsa. Sian Crowe from Peninsula School will be bring smooth soulful lyrics with some tasty guitar licks provided by Jack Cannon. Collision from Woodleigh returns to show us what’s new in their playlist and Billy Goats Gruff, also a Woodleigh band, will be the surprise new package of three in addition to new band The Revelry Rats who will perform their debut live set.
Previous artists to grace The Lineup’s stages include Playwrite, Wishful, Snowy Belfast, Jackie Sannia, Kodo Motif, Ergonomic Poncho, Ricki and the Rants, Leagues, Collision, Midnight to Monaco, The John Pistols, Sam Saunders & Max Rowe and Sophie Ricca.

I'm in a slump! Tired of preparing AND eating the same old, same old. Looked in the freezer this morning...closed the door. We had oatmeal for supper...lol. Any ideas?? Help!!
Seriously though, there's just the wife and I in our house and we both work full time. She works straight day shift Mon-Fri, but my hours vary between days, evenings, and nights PLUS I have my own business on the side and occasionally teach classes. Thus, meal variety, convenience, etc are important.
1. Betty Crocker "Complete Meals" box suppers. Similar brand box suppers as well; just got some new-released Kraft "Bistro Deluxe" styles last week - excellent, and intro price of 3 boxes for $5.
2. Homemade pizza - Pillsbury crust (comes in a refrigerated tube), your favorite pizza sauce (I'm down to my last DelGrosso jar brought back from our October trip to Tyrone, but Ragu "PizzaQuick" traditional or home-style is excellent), and your favorite Italian cheese blend.
4. Get a bag of good-brand italian meatballs, put in a slow cooker, pour in your favorite sauce, let simmer overnight (or through the day). Make meatball sandwiches, add to pasta, etc; can make several meals with this over a few days.
7. Get some good brats, flavored sausages, etc. Cook/fry, have as sandwiches with fav toppings, or eat alone. Side dish as above.
8. Soup and sandwiches. Can have crackers with the soup, sandwiches as toasted cheese, lunch meat, etc.
9. A good salad, whatever type each person prefers. Maybe soup/sandwiches, as above, with the salad.
10. Frozen dinners - "family-size" or individual serving. Some really good ones, and quite a variety, in the freezer sections of grocers. Those Boston Market ones seem especially good, and are often on sale or at good price anyway (at least in our area).
I have the same problem. I dont mind cooking it is the planning and coming up with something different to cook thats the problem. Making homemade beef stew tonight with hot bread. Last night we had ham cabbage and potatoes. Just 2 things I havent made for a while so it was good and a nice change. Try broiling fish with some rice and a salad. Thats quick and good if you like fish.
I cooked some spaghetti. Sauteed green peppers, onions, garlic, Rotel diced tomatoes and green chiles, in butter ....served it over the pasta with grated parmesan. Made garlic toast and salad greens...it was good...HE SAID..ok...where's the beef?
Snyd... I love seafood... THE other two members of my house ...not so much lol. MMMMM...gimme crab, lobster, clams, and scallops.....heaven. Talapia and Blue Hake... Hey...speaking of fish.... has anyone noticed how HORRIBLE tuna is these days? OMG... I can't even open a can of tuna. The bagged tuna isn't any better. I used to make tuna casserole for my son about once a month.....I'm glad he's not here asking for it right now..lol......it stinks...and it tastes foul. YUCK.
We ate at Prime Sirloin today... hubby got what appeared to be a grilled cheese sandwich with his spaghetti... he took a bite and said...this doesn't taste right to me...try it. Like an absolute idiot.. I did. WELL....TUNA AND CHEESE. YUCK.....it wasn't Prime Sirloin's fault....its the tuna, although the thought of tuna and melted cheese is just gross to begin with. I just know they're putting something in tuna that doesn't belong.
ANYWAY...hahaha....when someone says.."eww...this doesn't taste right to me, try it" JUST TRUST THEM. Hahaha
Something-to-say, here it is almost 5 months since your post, and I must say you are so right! I opened a brand name can of tuna yesterday to make some tunafish with and the smell almost knocked me over! I went ahead and made the tunafish and ate a sandwich but it tasted like sh.........um, crap! I agree, somethings not right. It probably is from China and they're out to get us....
A mix of healthy greens including brocoli, beans, peas and avocado tossed in a pesto sauce. FANTASTIC!

Dates and venue for the nationals have not yet been announced. Newson, who stole singles in three ends of the final, finished 5-1 in the round robin, tied with the Daryl MacDonald rink from the Western Community Curling Club in Alberton, but beat MacDonald in their round robin encounter, earning the bye to the final. MacDonald lost the semi-final this morning, 9-5 to Inman, who had a 4-2 third-place win-loss record in the seven-team round robin.
Playing with Newson were third Corey Miller, second stone Patrick Ramsay, and lead Adam Arsenault, while third Calvin Smith, second Nathan Hardy, and lead Nick Blanchard complete the Inman team roster.
In the women’s event, the Debbie Rhodenhizer rink from the Cornwall Curling Club won two tiebreakers today to advance to the six pm semi-final game against second-place Tammy Dewar and her Montague team. Rhodenhizer downed Western’s Sharon Horne rink 9-2 in her first tiebreaker, but the second one, against Crapaud’s Amanda Holm rink was a lot tougher. The game was tied 3-all at the fourth end break, but Holm took one in the fifth and stole a deuce in the sixth for a three-point lead with only two ends left. Rhodenhizer tied it up with a triple in end seven, and stole a single in the eighth to win 7-6 and advance to the semi.
The winner of the 6 pm semi-final will face the undefeated Melissa Morrow rink from the Silver Fox on Tuesday, and would have to win two games – at 10 am and 2 pm, to take the championship, while a win in either game would give the title to Morrow, as the rules state that a team who goes through the round robin undefeated has to be beaten twice. The eventual winner will join the Newson team at the nationals.

If interested in Pelargonium, there are pretty good odds that you are growing a species found by John Lavranos. One in ten, to be exact, if specializing in the section Hoarea: he collected P. aestivale, P. connivens, P. curviandrum, P. githagineum, P. luteopetalum, P. vinaceum and P. xanthopetalum before their formal description. Sarcocaulon growers know where the epithet of S. lavrani comes from. Yet, unless generally interested in succulents (the Cactus and Succulent Journal dedicated an issue to John in 2006 [1]), few Pelargonium enthusiasts are well acquainted with his lifetime’s-worth of botanical discovery and plantsmanship.
At 91, John is as passionate, generous and sharing as ever: “My enthusiasm for Pelargonium species dates back to my childhood when my mother grew a variety of ‘geraniums’ in our garden in Corfu. When, in 1952, I moved to South Africa, the variety of pelargoniums in the botanical garden of ‘The Wilds’ in Johannesburg, further excited my fancy, as did the large array of other indigenous plants.” Having spent a number of years in the navy, John’s only desire then was to move out of postwar Europe. After the move to Johannesburg with his first wife Helen, they never looked back.
Once in Joburg, John found the time to study towards a degree in botany and geography at the University of South Africa in Pretoria, while already engaging in fieldwork from around 1960 onwards. After the move in 1990, to Portugal with wife Mireille, journeys took him to Namibia, Madagascar, Somalia (Fig. 1) and Yemen, where pelargoniums are less common. His interest in languages served him well on trips: John speaks nine! Collecting continued until 2012, after half a century of continuous discovery. Funding for local trips came out of his own pocket, while trips abroad were paid by personal or institutional contributions and donations. John’s field collections extend to 32,000 specimens, all duly and thoroughly documented, as testified by the comprehensive list of collection data that was recently compiled and published by Roy Mottram [2].
This was the golden era of plant hunting, continuing the tradition of botanical exploration that started in earnest in the late 18th Century, often funded by nurseries and patrons. The comparison with another expat living in Portugal, Friderik Welwitsch (Velbič) of Austrian-Slovenian origin comes to mind: following a botany expedition to Angola funded by the King of Portugal, Welwitsch returned to Europe in October 1863 with 42 boxes of about 10,000 specimens. The first collections of pelargoniums were even earlier than that: the Dutchman Paul Hermann was probably the first to collect pelargoniums in southern Africa in the second half of the 17th Century. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of these explorations to horticulture: the market for pelargonium cultivars has a lot to be thankful for to these intrepid explorers. It’s a big market as well, e.g. in Sweden, one pelargonium plant and a half was sold per inhabitant in 2008 only, 12 million in total [3]!
Back in the 1960s-80s, travelling to exotic places was still prohibitively expensive for most, and local regulations were lenient. John collected plants, bulbs, seeds and herbarium specimens, which he simply laid out in sheets of newspaper and pressed them by sitting on the lot. This seemed to have worked quite well – his many Pelargonium collections are now part of Stellenbosch, Pretoria and other herbaria. “I usually ended up with six or seven heavy cartons of material but I somehow managed not to lose anything by sending them home individually by mail, or together by airfreight,” tells John, who also keenly collected sea and land-shells, fossils and geological specimens. This worked until the demand for wild plants (and especially animals) increased so much that the pressure to collect led to CITES regulations having been accepted in 1973. Since then, local regulations have additionally reduced the pressure on natural populations, especially after air travel became cheaper and many species became significantly depleted in their natural habitats.
John’s interest then turned to countries that were less explored: East Africa, Madagascar and Arabia, where local experts continued to be welcoming. “It was a wonderful surprise when I found P. cristophoranum at its type locality and at another site,” John tells us – his photo clearly depicting this extraordinary species (Fig. 2). John also collected P. multibracteatum on both sides of the Gulf of Aden as well as P. luridum. Between 1968 and 1989 John made at least 10 trips to Somalia (where now, plant populations remain safe due to civil unrest).
Throughout, John remained close to pelargoniums. Piet Vorster, whose work defined our views of the section Otidia, has been a close friend for some 50 years, sharing not only the love for Pelargonium species but also for classical music, particularly Beethoven. Piet and John made a number of field trips together, exchanged visits and met several times in the UK. John holds Piet in high regard: “He is an accomplished scientist but has very much his own mind.” Many of us who have studied Bettie Marais’s PhD Thesis in detail, noticed that John’s herbarium specimens are often cited – John and Bettie probably never met but he certainly made his mark on the section.
The exquisitely produced book on bushman candles was co-authored with Charles Craib, Pelargonium nurseryman, collector and scholar: “The book is the only one in the writing of which I had a part that I am really proud of! It is as close to perfect (at least to my eyes) as any book can be,” affirms John.
To my mind, this book comes as close to ideal as it gets: beautifully illustrated, evidently based on ample experience, with plenty of information on ecology and habitats, and clearly a labour of love. John holds the late Charles Craib in high regard: “Charles was a very gifted man who had a sense of artistry that leaves me feeling like a talentless idiot. At the same time he was often moody and changed his mind about people and subjects, as often as I (with apologies for the expression) change my underpants”. John’s quote illustrates both candour and wit of the kind that come with experience and wisdom. Extensive joint travels across South Africa and Namibia from about 1985 were prematurely discontinued with Charles’s tragic passing at the age of 56.
The Madagascan P. caylae is another part of John’s heritage. Of this species there exists only the type collection at Masiro, at the eastern base of the Andohahelo Range, on a granite outcrop. The original plant was sent to John by Professor Millot in about 1955, when he was the Director of ORSTOM in Madagascar (Office De La Recherche Scientifique Et Technique Outre-Mer). John tells us that cuttings were forwarded to America and what of it is at present in circulation stems from Dr Gary James, of Costa Mesa, in California, who has been very successful with the propagation of this and other rare species.
Fig. 3: P. caylae was also introduced to cultivation by John Lavranos. With its meters tall stalks, this is a curious Madagascan species, now grown by many. Few know that all of the plants in horticulture originate from a single collection.
Of altogether 12 trips to Madagascar, John was frequently accompanied by Jean-André Audissou, himself an experienced nurseryman and explorer from Fouras, France, in 2005. The two came into contact after Jean-André published an article [4] on Caralluma mireillae, which John named to honour his wife. Jean-André vividly describes a typical day in the bush: “After a frugal breakfast, we leave Toliara at 6am, northwards towards Andavadoaka, following a sandy coastal track accessible to all-terrain vehicles only. We looked for Pachypodium mikea described earlier that year, saw Didiera madagascariensis in flower, Oeceoclades and Stapelianthus species, and finally the ultimate goal for the day: several hundred years old specimens of Adansonia rubrostipa. We would stop at midday to eat bananas and a few slices of a sausage brought from Portugal, in the shade of Euphorbia plagiantha. After arrival in Andavadoaka in mid-afternoon, we settled down in a palm-roofed bungalow and before nightfall, we walked the beach in search of exotic seashells on the Mozambique Strait beach. The dinner consisted of crayfish – for the cost of a couple of euros. The dinnertime was an opportunity for John to tell a thousand and one anecdotes about his travels over the last 60 years.”
Asked about growing pelargoniums, John enthusiastically responds: “Most certainly I would like to have a Pelargonium collection, if my advancing years allowed such a luxury! All I keep now is a plant of P. pachypodium, from Loeriesfontein and one of P. cotyledonis, both in pots, and things like P. quercifolium, P. fulgidum, P. abrotanifolium, P. triste and a couple of others in the garden here.” By ‘here’, John means Loulé, a small town near Faro in south Portugal.
Fig. 5: If John Lavranos’s contribution to the knowledge of succulent plants were to be compared to a plant, a baobab would come to mind. Credit: Jean-André Audissou.
John has had 17 taxa named after him, of which 8 are asclepiads and 5 are Aloe species. He published about 180 taxa himself, and brought countless more to cultivation. As habitat loss accelerates due to agricultural and developmental pressures, John’s extraordinary work is becoming more and more valuable and may well become the only testament to the existence of some of the most bizarre, rare and fascinating plant species that evolution has ever had to offer.

When a sudden change in technology made his job obsolete, a highly trained scientist found himself working in a fast-food restaurant. One evening after our Bible study he described the situation as difficult and humbling. He said, “One good thing I can say is that the young people there seem very interested in my faith.” A member of the group responded, “I admire you for being humble. I know your faith must have something to do with it.”
Like my acquaintance, Philip may have wondered why God would pull him off an assignment in Samaria (Acts 8:4-8) and plop him in the middle of the desert (v.26). But then he found that the Ethiopian needed help understanding the Scriptures (vv.27-35), and his place made sense.
When Jesus promised He would never leave us alone (Matt. 28:20; Heb. 13:5), He meant in the hard times as well as in the good times. Our mission in the difficult seasons of life is to work or serve remembering we are doing it for God, and then to watch as God works to accomplish His purposes.

The Aeronca C-2 of 1929 was the first truly light airplane certified by Department of Commerce, Bureau of Aeronautics and produced in substantial numbers in the United States. It holds an important place in the history of aviation in the United States. Before these diminutive aircraft came along flying was restricted to the "professional" pilot or the independently wealthy "sportsman" pilot. Aircraft manufacturers catered to both these groups accordingly. The emergence of the Aeronca C2 and C3 aircraft was however to mark the beginning of general aviation in the United States. For the first time flying became affordable and accessible to everyone. It was safe, economical, and easy to fly.
The Aeronautical Corporation of America, a small company that changed its name to Aeronca, was formed in 1928 at Lunken Airport near Cincinnati, Ohio. Aeronca bought production rights to a small and light airplane designed solely for recreational flying by French-born Jean A. Roché, Senior Aeronautical Engineer for the U.S. Army Air Service. The airplane, engineered for production by Roger E. Schlemmer of the University of Cincinnati's Aeronautical School, was designated the C-2 (Roché's hand-built plane being considered the first of the type). Work began on the production prototype in 1929 and it first flew on October 20, 1929. Painted bright yellow and orange, it was assigned registration NX626N.
Before the Aeronca C-2, purely recreational aircraft were rare. There was almost no private ownership during the decade following World War I. Open-cockpit biplanes had to work to earn their keep. Even the barnstormer's Jenny, despite inexpensive price and romantic images-was strictly a commercial venture that bore little resemblance to the luxury of owning an automobile. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, aircraft manufacturers began to cater to the lucrative but limited market of the wealthy sportsman pilot. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris in the Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis heightened public awareness of the airplane, but, ironically, it was the depression that further promoted the emergence of light airplanes by making larger aircraft too expensive to operate. These factors, and advances in airframe and engine technology, set the stage for one of the most significant trends in aviation between the wars when it became possible for a significant segment of American society to own and fly an airplane.
The first C-2s that Aeronca demonstrated at aviation expositions around the country won enthusiastic acceptance during the latter half of 1930. Squat and bug-eyed, the diminutive Aeronca C-2 was a simple airplane with modest performance and delightful flying characteristics. Its steel-tube fuselage and wooden wings were covered with fabric and braced with wires. The pilot, seated before a stick and rudder bar, had just four instruments: oil temperature, oil pressure, nonsensitive altimeter, and tachometer. The single-seat C-2 was powered by a two-cylinder Aeronca E-107 engine rated at 26-30 hp. In 1929, the Aeronca C-2 sold for $1,495. By mid-1930, the price had dropped to $1,245 as a result of the depression. C-2s were economical at 1 cent a mile for oil and gas, and they could often be rented for just $4.00 an hour. Furthermore, they were simple to fly, easy to maintain, and had no bad characteristics to spring on a novice pilot. By 1931, more than 100 C-2s had been sold and Aeronca introduced the two-seat C-3, with an Aeronca E-1 13 36-40 hp engine. With seating for two side-by-side, the C-3 offered greater utility than the C-2 and quickly became popular as a trainer. "Airknockers" or "Flying Bathtubs, as they were affectionately known, made it possible for the average person to fly. Other light aircraft began to appear but the Aeronca style remained popular and C-3 production ended in 1937 with more than 500 produced built.
NX626N flew for ten years with a variety of owners. In 1940, it was reacquired by the Aeronca Company for display at its new factory in Middletown, Ohio. In 1948, after the establishment of the National Air Museum in 1946, the Aeronca Company answered a call by the Smithsonian Institution to various companies and organizations for historic aircraft and donated the first Aeronca, C-2 NX626N. The C-2 was restored 1976 and was briefly displayed in the General Aviation gallery. It is currently displayed at the Garber Facility of the National Air and Space Museum at Silver Hill, MD.
The Arabic language (اللغة العربية‎ transliterated al-lughah al-‘Arabiyyah), or simply Arabic (عربي‎ العربية transliterated ‘Arabiyyah), is the largest member of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family (classification: South Central Semitic) and is closely related to Hebrew and Aramaic.
Arabic is the native language of over 250 million people in the Middle East, West Asia and North Africa and one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is also the language of an ancient civilisation, which has contributed to human knowledge. Arabic grammar was first codified in the 7th century and is the liturgical language of Islam. Because of its liturgical role, Arabic has lent many words to other Islamic languages, akin to the role Latin had in Western European languages. Since the Middle Ages, Arabic has also been a major vehicle of culture, especially in science, mathematics and philosophy. Its influence is strongly felt on such languages as Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Indonesian and Malay among others. And many European languages still preserve hundreds of words from Arabic origin in various fields of knowledge. Arabic is also the living medium of a contemporary dynamic literature and culture. Its rich and magnificent poetry, classical and modern, is especially captivating.
Arabic courses can be undertaken as single courses or as a major within the Bachelor of Middle Eastern & Central Asian Studies or the Bachelor of Arts degree or combined BA degree options, as well as within the Bachelor of Asian Studies or combined Asian Studies option. Arabic courses can also be included in the Centre's postgraduate coursework, and as an adjunct to research for MPhil and PhD.
First year Arabic assumes no previous knowledge of the language. It covers the Arabic script and sound system, basic grammar rules. The method of teaching is based on an audio-visual and audio-lingual approach, which is designed to develop the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing in an integrated way through the use of dialogues in realistic situations, class interaction and oral and written drills. Grammar is explained in its functional aspect using basic structures of Arabic.
Later courses cover more detailed presentation of functions of the language; oral syntax and morphology, reading of texts and writing compositions.
In the third year, students will have the opportunity to develop a number of conversational and written skills including proficiency in written structures of moderate complexity.
Students who successfully complete their third year of Arabic may then undertake further Arabic studies which include modern literary genres, classical poetry, religious and historical texts.
The Centre determines the language stream in which a student is to enrol, regardless of the degree program. Placement is based on HSC results or its equivalent, an evaluation of students’ prior exposure to Arabic, academic transcripts, or a placement test.

RENO, Nev. - Diandra Asbaty of Chicago and Dan Patterson of West Seneca, N.Y., were crowned U.S. Amateur champions Friday at the United States Bowling Congress Team USA Championships.
Asbaty, the 1999 U.S. Amateur champion, earned a spot on Team USA for the eighth time in her career by posting a total of 10,811, including match play bonus pins, for 48 games. She went 15-8-1 in matches.
Patterson, who was a first-time Team USA member in 2005, won the title with 12,540, including match play bonus pins, for 56 games. He went 22-10-0 in matches.
The top five men and women earned automatic spots on Team USA 2006. Patterson is joined on the men's side by Fero Williams of Gardena, Calif., Scott Pohl of Eagan, Minn., Martin Bedford of Lockport, N.Y., and Ronnie Sparks Jr. of Wayne, Mich.
Asbaty is joined by Shannon Pluhowsky of Phoenix, Olivia Sandham of Wichita, Kan., Lynda Barnes of Flower Mound, Texas, and Samantha Linder of Winter Haven, Fla.
The National Selection Committee also selected three men and women from the players who made match play to join the team. David Haynes of Las Vegas, Bill Hoffman of Columbus, Ohio, Rhino Page of San Diego, Stefanie Nation of Orlando, Fla., Shannon O'Keefe of Rochester, N.Y., and Amanda Burgoyne of Newport, Minn., were all picked.
The committee also awarded two-year Team USA spots to Haynes, Hoffman, Williams, Pluhowsky, Barnes and Nation. Patterson and Asbaty automatically earned two-year spots.
Asbaty charged into the lead for the first time all week after 47 of 48 games. A 279 in game 47 moved her ahead of Pluhowsky and Linder. Despite falling to Pluhowsky 195-190 in the final position round match, Asbaty hung on to win the title.
"I came here just to make Team USA, and that's all that mattered to me," Asbaty said. "I knew it was going to be a marathon week, so I just sort of paced myself. Coming into the last eight games I knew I needed to turn it on to make the team."
Patterson's run to the title was just as stressful. Leading by just eight pins heading into the position round game against Williams, Patterson struck out in the 10th for a 259 game. Williams struck on the first ball in the 10th but failed to strike on the second ball for 254.
"I put a note on my wall two years ago that I wanted to make Team USA, and that goal came true last year," Patterson said. "Then my new goal was to win the U.S. Amateur championship. It's one of those things were the dream came true, and I can't even put it into words. It's amazing."
Team USA 2006 members will participate in events such as the World Tenpin Bowling Association Men's World Championships, Tournament of the Americas and QubicaAMF World Cup.

Winning races is awesome. Winning races in your hometown is even better. Winning a race referred to as “the pro town throw down” because of the local talent in your hometown, priceless.
My unofficial triathlon career started at the age of 15 here in Boulder at the Boulder Peak Triathlon. I had a recently acquired bike that didn’t fit, a borrowed wetsuit, and a whole lot of competitive fire. Without really knowing how to do a transition or REALLY how steep Old Stage was, I conquered the race and won the 15-19 age group. Now I had already been intrigued by the sport having grown up in “pro town” but after that first time actually in a race I decided I was gonna do that for a career someday. Not long after that epiphany I also decided someday I would win the “big boy” race at the Boulder Peak, and this past Sunday that dream became reality.
It has been three years since the last time I did that Peak, and I was really excited to be finally racing it again. This year Lifetime Fitness moved the date of their race to this coming weekend so instead of declining the insane double that a few of my peers do every year I was finally able to race both. As Friday rolled around I started to really think about how to make this race weekend like all the others, but it was a bit tough considering there was no bike packing, no airports, no restaurant meals and no travel stress. Funny how sometimes its the hard stuff that seems normal. But I did my best to treat each day as though I was somewhere else instead of rolling out of my own bed. Now don’t get me wrong, riding from my garage to the race start is amazing, and packing my bike is my least favorite thing in the world next to painting rooms, but it was a perspective shift.
On the whole I think I did a pretty good job, and when Sunday morning rolled around I was feeling good about the race. Now back that up 12 hours when I got a call from a friend out of town asking me if Old Stage had been taking out of the course due to a rock slide and things weren’t so good. I mean, come on, this is Peak, and I like to ride my bike up hills, you can’t take that away from me! Old Stage was in fact closed for a few hours but before I went to bed I was reassured to hear that the road had reopened so it should be game on.
I did my normal routine, although it was 3 hours later than usual because of the 9:35 start, and headed to the Res at a nice leisurely pace on the roads I ride daily. Once I got there I racked the bike, went a for a jog, and said hi to bunch of people. To be honest, the hands down best part of racing at home, especially if home is a place where at least everyone knows what a triathlon is, is that your friends and family can see you race. My in laws saw me in action for the first time, and my parents got to see me race without having to travel. The only iffy part of the morning was when they informed us that the women would actually be getting a 16 min head start, not the 15 discussed the day before. Seriously! Do they know who Laura and Melissa are? Anyway, nothing we could do so it was time to get into the speed suit and head out for the swim warm up.
Really my only mistake all day was not warming up in my wettie. The race was non wetsuit but the air was chilly and it was cloudy and after my warm up, I was cold again. What can you do, so I danced around, did some jumping jacks and thought about hot things. You know, lava, hot tubs, my wife, hot things.
Once the 16 min wait was over we were off and I got into the position I wanted right on Dylan’s feet almost straight away. Only trouble was after about 500m I realized I was struggling to stay there and was having to really crush myself to maintain my spot. Luckily, about the time I really felt bad at 1000m Joey came around me and towed us the rest of the way back in, almost reattaching to the dolphin that is Dylan McNiece. I had a good run out and a quick T1 and was on the bike in the front. Now everyone knows what is supposed to happen after that. I am supposed to ride really really hard and put as much distance between me and the other guys as possible, and sometimes, like Sunday, that actually happens and life is good.
I hammered out of the Res and up the hill to Old Stage. Now I am convinced that the hardest part of this course is not actually Old Stage itself, but in fact the brutal false flat on Jay and 36th to get there. So knowing that I did my best to throttle the boys there and get a gap before we even hit the real kicker. I was feeling strong and did my best to hammer up the hill as smoothly as possible. Its a big climb so no reason to spike the HR higher than necessary. Once at the top I shifted all the way to the other side of the cassette and began my descent. Things were good until a car made me almost stop completely, but after a very “pleasant” and loud exchange I cranked it back up and got on my way. I did the best I could to be aero on the downhills and hammer the rollers back in on 63rd. Once I got to the Diagonal I saw my coached, also a home race bonus, and he told me I had a big gap, but was still 5 min down on Laura so to keep hammering. So I did just that and tried to gain as much back on the ladies as I could before we hit the pavement running.
I rolled into T2 with a good 2:45 over second place man, but I was still 3:45 down on Laura. Now if you know Laura you know that is a tall order. Or if you know how bad my quads were cramping coming off that ride you know that is asking a lot, but I made a go at it over the first of three laps and got back a little time. However, as I started the second lap my quads threw a hissy fit and to prevent a total seizing up I slowed a bit and tried to take solace in the fact that I still had a big lead.
Coming into the last half mile of the run I knew I had the W, and tried to enjoy the fact that not only were all the people standing around cheering for me, but I actually knew a good chunk of them. I blew a kiss to my wife and baby and grabbed the banner in normal finish line protocol. My only regret is since I had a big lead I should have taken Liam from Natalie and carried his cute little butt with me across the line.
After the race it was great to see some old high school friends, my whole family, and people that I know from around town. Thank you so much to everyone that was there cheering, or has since sent me an email or call congratulating me. Someone asked me yesterday whether all wins are the same. It got me thinking a bit, and I decided no they definitely are not. Some are more prestigious, and some have bigger payouts, but some also just mean more for sentimental reasons. Boulder Peak is a big race with a good pay out, but the win is something dreamed up by a 15 year old kid and that definitely makes it more special!
Now its four more days till we line it up in Minneapolis for Lifetime Fitness, and I am doing my best to get the body recovered and ready to go again.
Wow!! You are very inspirational, I’m a cross country runner in high school I’m actually 15 now! I need something to get me even more successful at running and this is like a full total package! You’re very lucky you were born with this ability! I’d love to be able to do all of those things! Take care!
Photo: Tokyo Fashion World November 2016: Some of the 23,122 visitors lured by its eclectic mix of styles.
Exhibitors at autumn event polarised between showing extensive range of largely undifferentiated middle-market footwear and apparel or going for broke with high-end items designed to be virtually unclonable by most mainland imitators.
Although Tokyo Fashion World has expanded considerably over recent years, the event has yet to find a signature style. With its strong industry focus, it has a nuts-and-bolts feel that is reflected in the disparate mini-expos – including the Tokyo Bag Expo, OEM/Sourcing Expo and Textile Tokyo – that make up its constituent parts.
There are many who feel, however, that developing a more unified identity for the show would render the event both more enjoyable and more memorable. Regardless of that, though, there was plenty to be learnt about both the supply and the distribution sides of the sector, with the event having a deserved reputation as one of the industry's more garrulous trade fairs.
Kicking the ball off, Henry Cui, Marketing Operations Vice-president for the People Group, a Taiwan-based shoe manufacturer, was keen to emphasise that increasing pressure on prices had resulted in very narrow profit margins. This, he believes, has made it incumbent on all manufacturers in the sector to seek out ever cheaper manufacturing options.
He said: "On account of the different tariffs levied by different countries, we have had to change where we manufacture. As a result, much of our production has shifted to Vietnam and Cambodia. As Japan is keen to promote business with these countries, this has created opportunities for us.
"We are always looking to get around any obstacle, to find a solution and to make it happen for the customer. Today, business is ever more competitive and we must always do something smarter in order to survive."
At the event, the People Group was presenting a large range of shoes aimed at the budget buyer, with no particular trend dominating. A similar approach was taken by many other exhibitors, with styles generally more diffuse than in previous years.
A number of exhibitors were also adjusting their retail strategies in light of the increasing impact of online shopping. In the case of Hisaki, a luggage manufacturer operating out of the Aichi Prefecture, it was focusing on its Neo Keepr brand. Although looking not dissimilar to Rimowa, the upmarket German luggage brand, the Neo Keepr range has a lower price point and is available almost exclusively online.
Explaining its approach, Ren Cho, the company's Sales Manager, said: "We were looking to sell at the same price both online and in department stores. This, however, has proven to be more difficult than we anticipated."
In Japan, distributing a product through department stores is seen as a good way to enhance its prestige. This practice, though, invariably involves the store expecting a hefty chunk of the retail price. Inevitably, then, the online price is always going to be considerably lower.
Tackling the problem from the opposite end was another upmarket luggage manufacturer – Sweden's Vikland. To date, its range has largely been sold through department stores, while maintaining only a minimal online presence.
Explaining his company's reason for exhibiting at the event, Sales Director Rickard Haggren said: "This is actually only our second time here. Last spring, we took a smaller stand, but we had so much positive feedback we decided to come back bigger and better."
While selling through department stores is widely accepted as a good way to protect a brand, sales through this channel have a tendency to become relatively static. Predictably, Haggren is now looking to online sales as a route to growth, though he is not unaware of the downside of this particular channel.
He said: "We have to be careful about going online. We need to retain the value of the product, while also nurturing its image and its higher class associations. We can't just turn it over to an e-tailer and see our prices cut by 40%.
"We are not, however, entirely against online retailing. What we are looking for is an agent with experience in dealing with high-end goods and, if that person also knew how to sell our range online, that would be more than acceptable. We would be perfectly happy to trust someone like that."
Another area where the internet is having a big impact is the speed with which new designs and trends are now disseminated. Thanks to digital technology, companies around the world are able to modify their own designs almost immediately in response to the latest fashions emerging out of London, Paris, Milan or New York.
This, however, undermines the idea of any single fashion trend being in the ascendant, with a large range of styles available at any one time. It also pushes high-end fashion designers towards creating styles and features that may be harder to "clone" in the short-term.
This first factor was clearly in evidence in the range on show from Taiwan's George Shoe Corporation. The company had on offer a wide selection of predominately ladies shoes (US$65-85) under its Pic & Pay brand.
According to Vicky Chen, the company's Assistant President, the current trend in the shoe sector has seen a move away from distinctive or idiosyncratic styles – something once hugely popular in Japan – and more towards low-key, low-cost practical shoes.
Chen said: "Tastes are less crazy now. People are going for classy, elegant and less adventurous fashions with a practical element. Nowadays, we have to present a lot of styles because as there is no specific trend.
"It's now a very transparent world. We've become accustomed to the internet over the past 15 years and everyone is now used to seeing everything instantly. Fashions are being broadcast from the catwalk straight onto the net. It's easy for anyone to copy them.
"As a result, young people don't follow just one trend any more. They are more inclined to try to highlight their own personalities and want something that comfortably fits their lifestyle. Of course, there is still a small number of people who continue to take fashion very seriously. The majority, though, are more in favour of quality of life and are not interested in the stress of following every new trend."
While sympathetic to many of Chen's views, Cui believes the relationship between upmarket and down-market fashion is a little more symbiotic. He said: "Our focus is on recognising trends and re-purposing high-end designs for the mainstream market. While the fashion houses may not like that aspect of the business, we still help popularise their styles."
As was noted earlier, however, the very ease with which styles can now be copied is having an impact on up-market designs, with a premium now being placed on any element that is harder to duplicate. This is seen as explaining the recent emphasis on embroidered footwear.
Nothing the trend, Chen said: "I think high-end clothing and shoe companies, such as Gucci or Dior, are now attracted to embroidery because it is distinctive and it's harder for other companies to simply copy. Over the long-term, though, a means will be found to imitate even this."
Manish Kawtra, a partner in The Sac and Satchel Company, an Indian high-end bag maker, also sees good quality embroidery as hard to replicate, provocatively billing it as 'China-proof'. His own company was attending Fashion World Tokyo for the first time and was looking to do business with select outlets, while also hoping to secure OEM deals with a number of Japan's more upmarket bag brands.
He said: "We thought Japan would be a good market to try as it can take an expensive product. As embroidery is expensive, we prefer to use only high-end materials, such as French calf. You can't have expensive embroidery on cheap leather."
Perhaps begging to differ with Kawtra's belief, Flapper – a Japanese brand –had on offer a range of Chinese-manufactured bags, all decorated with machine-embroidered designs. Despite retailing from just US$27-60, the embroidery had a distinctively authentic look. Perhaps, after all, nothing is truly China-proof.
Fashion World Tokyo was held from 7-9 November at Tokyo Big Sight. The event attracted 871 exhibitors, and 23,122 visitors.

Naive children's non-fiction about the coming glories of space travel. The blog doesn't miss much, but doesn't look deeper. The joys and perils of extrapolating a future like the present, only more so, are much in evidence: the years since have given us fantastic computer power as an essential, dirt cheap consumer good, and stunning advances in biology, but not jet packs, Mars colonies, rotating circular space stations and flying cars. It mentions the International Geophysical Year naively, as an exercise in pure science, omitting its role in obtaining data crucial to the nascent ballistic missile program. There's no environmental consciousness at all; the rhetoric is of 'conquest' of space, which today even amongst the remaining true believers is a nonsensical idea. And, always, the leitmotif of a potential nuclear holocaust.
The vision back then presented to kids was unremittingly positive. Not so much, anymore. The JFK assassination, I think, was a watershed after which hope was mixed or replaced by fear. Another factor, I think still underrated, was the emergence of HIV/AIDS as Reagan legitimized greed and racism. It would have been far more frightening had it not been cast as an affliction solely of an immoral Other, arising from immoral conduct--addicts, gay folk, unlikely accidents. Today, the future is more imagined along 'Blade Runner' lines, or subject to more shadowy, vague apocalypses--increasing criminality resulting in a Mad Max world, fantasies of survivalism, plague, a Frankensteinian environmental dread. I'd hope that, as before, the future won't be what it used to be...
Unfortunately, it also appears we will not have a new life on the off-world colonies by 2019[/BladeRunner].
Probably not, for better or worse. But my laptop--bought reconditioned for $200, maybe half what a mediocre stereo cost in 1965 in 1965 dollars--beats the hell out of the old 7094 mainframe even before you hook it to the net. My pocket holds a device that lets me listen to maybe 800 records, or watch maybe 10 movies. We don't chop off breasts for cancer, dump PVCs in the Hudson River or wipe a half inch of soot and grime monthly off city windows, much anymore. Politics and economics are bad now, been bad before, will get better. Beats me where we're going, but our perceptions, I think, lean more toward doom and gloom than they should. And that's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Sir Richard Swale is a landowner, a member of the establishment (a former MP) and a traitor. He has been seduced by the Russians with blondes and with antiques, which he collects passionately. He has no children, so plans to leave his collection to the nation. He has engaged an expert to catalogue it. The expert has fallen in love with his wife who, however, will not leave her husband.
Sir Richard's treachery has been discovered, and Warboys and Quint, now retired from Birdcage but called in for the sake of their contacts, decide he must be discreetly killed. They send in a marksman who will wait for a suitable moment and then shoot him at his country home on Exmoor. Meanwhile the Russians have also decided to eliminate him. They engage a mechanic to wire up his Rolls Royce with a bomb which will explode whenever he uses the car cigarette lighter. They do not realise that Sir Richard is trying hard to give up smoking. (Canning himself was a heavy smoker all his life, and had probably also been given strong warnings by his doctor at the time of writing.)
A pair of falcons is nesting on Hurlstone Point close to Sir Richard's property, and he is waiting for the young birds to begin to fly so that he can catch and train them to give to an Arab friend.
The climax comes when the Russians send in another mechanic to dismantle the bomb in the car, having decided against the assassination, and there is a convergence of the British assassin, the Russian-recruited mechanic, and the victim on the cliff where the falcons have built their nest.
Published by Heinemann in 1985 at £8.50 and in the USA by Morrow at $13.95, this was Canning's last completed book, and the first one since The Python Project in 1967 which had any Cold War subject matter. It was the last appearance for the sinister Birdcage organisation.
Most of the action takes place at and around Hurlstone Point on the Somerset coast between Porlock and Minehead. The wildlife lore is powerful. Falcons nesting on Exmoor had featured previously in several of Canning's books, notably in The Painted Tent.
Reaching the place where the cliff path broadened out into a wide bracken-free spread of close-cropped turf, Ruth Winslade sat down thankfully on the long seat which stood close to the National Trust collecting box set up to receive the offerings of tourists and walkers on their way up to and down from nearby Hurlstone Point. (p. 1) From where she sat now she could see the spot. It was a little way below the coastguard lookout building, hugging the cliff slope on the right, falling almost sheer, first through gorse, bramble and bracken and then steep rock face. A small fence guarded the steep fall side now, but on that far-off morning [when her husband had died] there had been no fence. (p. 5) That night [the falcons] roosted on a rock ledge, thirty feet above high-water mark at the foot of Hurlstone Point. (p. 26)

We were eagerly anticipating our second trip to Killarney Provincial Park, but this time exploring its unspoiled eastern and northeastern wilderness sectors, hiking to the top of Silver Peak of the renowned La Cloche Mountain Range, and a visit to the Village of Killarney that would include a trek along the scenic shores of Georgian Bay.
Our adventure began at 5 am when Norm, driving to the west side of Ottawa to pick up Wayne, caught two young doe in the glare of the car’s headlights just as he was approaching Wayne’s residence. Bewildered and not knowing where to run, they stood perfectly still on the lawn as he drove slowly by them. This was taken as an omen for an exciting week ahead.
We decided to stop at the Voyageur Heritage Museum in Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park near Mattawa, Ontario to view the huge Montreal canoe and other vintage canoes on display; a feat our group has failed to accomplish on previous trips as the museum was always closed. The same held true this day – the premise would not be open for another two hours. As we peered into the front door window, we could see someone inside next to the big canoe. First instinct was to rap on the window to get his attention, but there was no response. Disappointed, we headed back to our vehicle, only to have the museum door open and a gracious custodian beckon us to come inside for a tour. We shared a good laugh when we realized the person seen next to the canoe was in fact a prop used in the display.
The Montreal birch bark canoe in the museum was a replica of the giant fur trade canoes that plied the water highway between Montreal and Lake Superior three centuries ago. In May, loaded with trade goods these vessels ascended the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers and down the French River in brigades of nearly 50 strong. In late summer, they returned from Fort William on Lake Superior, loaded mainly with beaver pelts. This Montreal canoe or "canot de maitre" measured 11.8 m (38’10") and weighed 370 kg (814 lbs). With a crew of 10 or more, a Montreal canoe carried 3 tonnes of goods and another tonne of people and provisions, and was portaged on the shoulders of 4-8 voyageurs. Spruce gum mixed with animal fat sealed the seams while long slender roots of black spruce, peeled and split, were used to sew the bark. The French Canadian, Irish and Scottish voyageurs that paddled and portaged these freight canoes were renowned for their skill, endurance and cheerful dispositions.
Anyone with an opportunity to visit the museum should do so – you will be in for an historical treat.
We arrived at the George Lake Campgrounds registration office at 12:40 pm and the western view of the La Cloche Mountain range across from campground site 12 brought back fond memories of our last trip in 2001.
As planned, we drove 8 kms to tour the Village of Killarney, a small fishing port situated along the shore of Georgian Bay that dates back to 1820. First and foremost, we located the renown Herbert’s Fish and Chip wagon – four pieces of freshly filleted fish caught that morning and a pile of steaming french fries, doused with salt and vinegar, all for the price of $10.00. The picnic table under the wharf canopy provided a maritime ambience with a quaint harbour, docks and plenty of seagulls. What more could one ask for!
We hiked along a trail on the outskirts of the village, what we believed would be a short distance to the historic East Lighthouse on Red Rock Point – we soon realized that the trek was much further away than first calculated. We were drowning in sweat as the temperature was in the mid-30s with high humidity. We returned to the wharf to learn that a sow bear and her two cubs had been spotted along the trail we had just hiked, resulting in the closure of the village school. There was an easier way to get to the lighthouse – a drive along Ontario Street to the site parking lot and a short jaunt along the path. Once there, it was like a visit to Peggy’s Cove along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia. In a narrow inlet next to the lighthouse, we dipped into the frigid waters of beautiful Georgian Bay - a refreshing end to a fantastic outing to Killarney Village.
In preparation for the following day’s departure, the contents of our backpacks were emptied on the picnic table and thoroughly screened, eliminating all but the most necessary items. As we relaxed around our campfire, we had a surprise visit from a fellow canoeing friend, Kris Puhvel, Marketing and Membership Manager for the Friends of Killarney Park (http://www.friendsofkillarneypark.ca/). Kris explained the role he and his dedicated volunteer group, working in coordination with the Ministry staff, undertake to make everyone’s venture into the park safe and enjoyable. We are truly indebted to their dedication and efforts. We traded a few canoeing stories and promised to partake in a future venture together, perhaps next year.

Political correctness is the selective denial of free speech, which today means the denial of speech that challenges liberal-left values and the project for the genocide of the European people (and here, and here) and the destruction of the sovereign, democratic, nation state in the interests of the Money Power.
Political correctness was imposed in Russia by V.I. Lenin in the immediate aftermath of the Communist coup d'état of 1917.
The severity of the Soviet Regime of speech control culminated in the Stalin terror when a murmured complaint about the bread ration during the siege of Leningrad could mean being "shot on the spot" (a favorite expression of Lenin's) by the NKVD, then headed by psychopathic sexual predatator, Lavrentiy Beria.
In America, political correctness is enforced chiefly by administrative action to punish transgressors of approved thought. But once free speech has by these means been denied, there is no definite limit to the extent of totalitarian control of expression that may be demanded and enforced.
We may yet see in America, as in Stalin's Russia, peremptory killing of citizens for the crime of politically incorrect ideas, as we already see the unlawful killing of American citizens who are alleged to be terrorists. At present, however, enforcement of political correctness is chiefly by intimidation and other psychological means. It can, therefore, usually be defeated by a brazen refusal to defer to the legally unwarranted dictates of the politically correct.
The case of Professor McAdams who is in the process of challenging the politically correct administration of Marquette University, which seeks to deny faculty and students alike the right to discuss the merits or otherwise of gay marriage, has metaphorically told his tormentors to go fuck themselves. We wish him success in his combat with the bureaucratic agents of tyranny.

Joshua Iosefo is a boy of pacific nation, who is a prefect at Mt Roskill Grammar. He wrote a poem about stereotypes and discrimination against pacific islanders. He then shared that speech the with the whole of Mt Roskill Grammar, his speech was recorded, then put on YouTube.
The poem ‘Brown Brother’, included many stereotypes. Stereotypes is labeling a whole group with certain characteristics. Within the poem it included stereotypes such as, never graduating from college, dropping out, teen pregnancy and many more. You can believe in a stereotype or not but just because everyone else is doesn't mean you have too.
This speech inspired me to do more because I'm a pacific islander,- don’t be scared to dream big, achieve, believe and succeed. I can do whatever in the future, but I have to believe in myself to make those dreams come true.

For this term the topic is Art Alive, and we have been focusing on the artist Charles Fredrick Goldie in extension. The goal was to reproduce a painting of Charles Fredrick Goldie. Above is my version of the painting Ina Te Papatahi painted in 1910. Ina Te Papatahi was painted using a canvas and oil paint, but my reproduced version was done digitally. I would like to find out more about the moko on the chin, I believe the moko tells a story.
I observed very closely at all the detail in the painting like the blanket, moko, wrinkles, shading and the background. All these features in the painting were quite difficult to reproduce. The hardest stage was colouring in the hair and background, as you can see I have used multiple colours. I used the colour wheel on Hyperstudio to get the right colours, I had to be focused to get the right colours, but in the end I did.
Charles Fredrick Goldie painted Ina Te Papatahi and many other Maori people. Why? He wanted to preserve the Maori culture and he did that through painting. Paintings can last over 100 years, infact the painting Ina Te Papatahi is 102 years old.

The far-right's president was easily played by one of the world's worst barbarians, or, as President Spanky calls him "Funny Guy."
All Trump sees in Kim are condos, hotels, etc. He noted the beach area in North Korea as a great area for his future hotel. Trump couldn't care less about human rights violations, all he sees are dollar signs.
I guess time will tell on how this shakes out. So far we did not pay millions for hostage release nor are we giving billions for the further development of Nuc's. We will have to see what the verification process is all about because a previous deal with another country had none.
All of this agonizing about human rights, how Kim is brutal and djt did nothing to stop that. Remember Assad was not very benevolent with his people but that didn't matter. What we got from our esteemed leader was a line in the sand and a russian bailout. Not very positive leadership was it.
Many liberals would rather see the US fail if it meant DJT would be gone, talk about derangement syndrome.
Skud, I hope you're wrong regarding Trump succeeding. I for one hope we do get something positive out of this Korea opening. But I think a lot is going to depend on the Chinese. Will they want an American ally on their doorstep?
I will just say if America succeeds and Trump is president, Great. Because we all win in that. But I think you'll struggle to find a conservative from 2008/2009 who felt that way about Obama. Remember McConnell wishing our president would fail. I'd never heard a member of any opposition party wish for such a thing until then. And I've followed politics pretty closely since before I walked precincts for Richard Nixon before the 1972 elections.
Did I miss reading how NoKo put in writing in "The Deal" just how and when they would denuclearize their country? I seem to have missed the conditions, the verifications, the inspections. Right now, from what I know, NoKo has all of its nuclear weapons, and hasn't got rid of anything.
I remember when President Obama gave the order to special forces to get Osama bin Laden, which resulted in bin Laden's death. No one on the right was willing to praise or give credit for that, and now those same people are howling because we liberals call into question the details of Trump's "deal" with NoKo. There are no details and as far as anyone can determine, NoKo got the better deal: it got a meeting with a US president and NoKo got the US president to call off military games without NoKo giving up anything -- not even their nuclear weapons.
Did the meeting disfuse a dangerous situation? Sure. But who was the loud-mouth bully promising "Fire and Fury!" and the annihilation of the Korean peninsular? Hmmmm? Should Trump get credit for defusing a dangerous confrontation HE started?
Shaw... maybe, just maybe, this will be a great opening for us and give us a front for leverage against China in the war over intellectual rights. Maybe.
Look, Clinton, Bush and Obama all failed using the "normal" methods. It is possible that Trump's approach just might work.
Who knows... maybe we get our ship back after how many years? That would be pretty remarkable wouldn't it?
I could be wrong but I believe NoKo's real position so stated in so many words) is both sides share responsibility to de-nuke.
So far we did not pay millions for hostage release nor are we giving billions for the further development of Nuc's. We will have to see what the verification process is all about because a previous deal with another country had none.
Skud, I assume you mean the Iran deal and none of that is true. The money wasn't ours, it was Iran's frozen assets. The money was returned when they met certain agreements. The deal had the most stringent verification protocols of any any non proliferation deal, ever. Look it up. Iran removed 98% of it's uranium stockpile. They got rid of 75% of their centrifuges and are to keep only the oldest ones. They aren't allowed to enrich past 3.6%, weapons grade must be enriched to 98%.
Trump's own admin. said Iran is complying. It's hard to take you seriously when you can't get one fact straight.
Dave I believe McConnell said he hoped BHO failed to win a second term, big difference and I bet the democrats felt the same for W and DJT.
We will see if this deal with NKO holds up. NKO always tests a new president and in the past we gave them what they wanted, doesn't seem that way now. We are all dealing with a unconventional president who is not a professional politician and doesn't care if the hollywood crowd or the other world politicians think of him. Unlike other presidents he is not running a popularity contest. I don't care for his personal actions but he is accomplishing a lot in 18 months.
Kim is saying the sanctions will be loosened gradually but that's probably just for internal consumption.
skud: "...a unconventional president who is not a professional politician and doesn't care if the hollywood crowd or the other world politicians think of him."
Apparently President Spanky doesn't care about what the majority of Americans think about him either. As of June 10, his average approval rate is 42%. Also it's not just "world politicians" who think he's an ill-informed embarrassing jerk, it's our allies and their populations who do as well. He called our neighbor and close ally Canada's Trudeau "weak" and some other stupid name, but praised a butcher who starves his own people and murders his own family "a talented, funny guy."
You think Trump is good for America and the world because he's not a politician and doesn't care what other people think?
Have you ever studied the history of world despots? Neither did they. Trump has a lot in common with them.
You said Trump has accomplished a lot in 18 months, but give no evidence. Besides reversing everything he can from the Obama years, what has he done to improve life for the average American? Don't tell us the tax cuts, because it is a fact that only the 1% did well on that.
Oh, maybe you believe ripping children as young as 4 years old away from their parents and putting them in cages is something Americans can be proud of?
I am one American sees that as a crime against humanity, and I hope Trump pays dearly for doing that to families.
Skud... you are correct. McConnell said he wanted Obama to be a one term president. Rush Limbaugh said all Republicans want Obama to fail, a claim no one contradicted. Mike Pence at the time said "You bet, we want those policies to fail."
Notice Pence did not say he thinks those policies will fail, or they will not work, he said he hopes they fail. Why? Because if they worked, there would be no reason for the GOP.
Clearly no one was saying within the GOP, as Sen Chuck Schumer did the other say, that while they disagree with Pres Obama, they hope he is successful.
As for Trump, his admin has indeed done a lot. Of damage. To American prestige and influence around the globe. His admin, as evidenced by Scott Pruitt at EPA is also incredible ethically challenged. The economy is humming and that is good for all Americans. I know many of my liberal buddies will just say he inherited the Obama economy, but so what? The pres in office gets the blame and the credit for the econ no matter what.
He has also exacerbated, or perhaps better stated laid bare, the nationalistic almost "White is right" view of many folks of a certain generation. Sadly, he did not have to. I appreciate that he felt he was standing up for the Nazi's in that march because they were American. But when has he ever stood up publicly for blacks, hispanics or any other American group in the face of criticism?
In a sense, I'm with you. I don't think he will be a 100% failure as Pres and I hope he isn't. But as a person, I see no redeeming qualities in him. None. No humility, no empathy and no still small voice in his soul. Only a desire to win and make your opponents look as bad as possible.
Les... NoKo clearly wants to get ALL nukes of the peninsula. And that means ours. That would give them a standing army that literally could just overrun the south.
Dave, I've made that observation as well. If KJU can get the American military out of the Korean peninsular, what's to stop him from going into Seoul, which is just beyond the DMZ? North Korea has one of the world's largest standing army. KJU would love to have the Korean peninsular fall to Communism, and I'm fairly sure China wouldn't mind that either.
KJU is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Trump lavished praise on him that wasn't necessary, but he probably thought it would "soften" the butcher up so that he would cooperate in getting the Nobel Peace Prize for Trump.

While finally catching up on blogs I read, I ran across Brian Buttons recent post titled Enterprise Library and Object Builder. Whether you are using CAB, EntLib or Object Builder directly you should go read his post, as it is full of all kinds of nuggets. For example:
The way OB can tell whether or not to treat an instance of a singleton or not is through ObjectBuilder concepts called Locators and LifetimeContainers. LifetimeContainers, in OB-speak, manage the lifetime of named instances of objects. You can register an object and its name with a LifetimeContainer, and it will keep that object alive until such time as you dispose of the LifetimeContainer. And every LifetimeContainer is associated with a Locator. A Locator acts as a dictionary that maps instance names to objects, but it does it using WeakReferences – this means that storing something in a Locator will not prevent that object from being GCed. Tot keep an object alive, you need to provide the LifetimeContainer as well, which is what keeps the references in use, preventing the object from being scavenging out of existence.

Clinical Laboratory Technician Job Description, Career as a Clinical Laboratory Technician, Salary, Employment - Definition and Nature of the Work, Education and Training Requirements, Getting the Job
Clinical laboratory technicians are also known as medical technicians or medical laboratory technicians. They conduct laboratory tests that aid in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Clinical laboratory technicians are supervised by clinical laboratory technologists and physicians, such as pathologists. (Pathologists specialize in the diagnosis of disease.)
Most clinical laboratory technicians work in hospitals. Some work in research institutes and clinics. Others are employed in commercial medical laboratories that run tests for doctors and hospitals on a fee basis.
Clinical laboratory technicians perform routine tasks in the laboratory. For example, they collect samples of blood and urine, label them, and conduct simple tests on them. They sterilize instruments; prepare, stain, and label slides; and keep records of tests. Clinical laboratory technicians also perform tests involved in blood banking. For example, they may help to determine a donor's blood type. They may work in several areas of the clinical laboratory or specialize in just one.
Histotechnicians prepare slides of body tissue for examination by clinical laboratory technologists and pathologists. They freeze tissue so that it can be cut into paper-thin slices. They also stain the slides so that the tissue can be seen clearly under a microscope.
You must have a high school diploma or its equivalent to be a clinical laboratory technician. High school courses in science and math offer good preparation. You generally need specialized training after high school—either an associate degree from a community or junior college or a certificate from a hospital, a vocational or technical school, or one of the U.S. Armed Forces. A few technicians learn their skills on the job. Certification is not required to work. However, it can be an advantage in finding a job or advancing in the field. Manual dexterity and normal color vision are generally required.
The best way to acquire training as a clinical laboratory technician is to take a two-year accredited training program offered in community and junior colleges, four-year colleges, and universities. The Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation has accredited more than one hundred of these programs, while the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) has accredited more than four hundred and fifty programs. Several organizations also offer certification for technicians.
In some states, technicians must be licensed to work. The requirements vary, but usually include a written examination. Accredited training programs are also available for histotechnicians.

It is very important that clinical laboratory technicians carefully research training programs before choosing one. Selecting the right program can help during job hunting because certain areas of medicine have different training requirements.
Your school placement office can help you find a job. You can also apply directly to hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and research institutions at which you would like to work. Check newspaper want ads, job banks on the Internet, and professional journals as well.
Additional training is usually required to advance. Clinical laboratory technicians may study to become technologists. A master's degree is generally required for teaching and research positions.
The outlook for clinical laboratory technicians is excellent through the year 2014, with employment expected to increase faster than average. As the older population grows, so will the volume of testing and the number of clinical laboratories. The probability of new and more powerful diagnostic tests and research laboratories working to find the cause, treatment, and cure for AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) also should create jobs.
Working conditions for clinical laboratory technicians vary depending on their specialty. However, in all cases the work is very detailed. Laboratory technicians sit for much of the day. They rarely have contact with patients. Their tasks are generally routine, but they perform a wide range of tests.
Histotechnicians perform many different tasks. Generally, they work under the supervision of several people. Histotechnicians may be under pressure to work quickly. At times, tissue samples of a person who is being operated on are sent to the technicians, and they must prepare the slides immediately.
Clinical laboratory technicians usually work forty hours per week. Those who work in hospitals may be required to work some evenings and weekends. Laboratory technicians may be required to wear uniforms and protective clothing.
Clinical laboratory technicians earn a median salary of $30,840. Experienced workers can earn more. Benefits generally include paid holidays and vacations. Some workers have pension plans.

I want work as biochemistry technician. I had 19 years experience in S.S.S.I.H.M.S. at Puttaparthy Ananthapur dist. I would like to work as technologist.
The correct terminology for a lab professional that performs testing is a technologist (not a technician) or a clinical laboratory scientist. Technologists are required to have a bachelors degree and a year of internship. They have an MT (medical technologist) certification or a CLS (clinical lab scientist) license. MLT (medical lab technicians) have a 2 year degree in medical technology and cannot act in the same capacity as an MT.

Today I would like to write some lines about the most recent book on JIRA administration which is called JIRA 6.x Administration Cookbook by Packt Publishing.
Besides my professional experience with JIRA as well as several Atlassian and 3rd party trainings, I was curious on what additional in-depth knowledge this book could offer me to support my day-to-day work as a JIRA Consultant. I can absolutely say, the book certainly delivered!
JIRA, a software that has its roots in the software development and the bug tracking has a growing popularity even outside of those industries. The fact that JIRA is more like a very versatile framework than a static standard software for managing issues becomes clear once more in this book.
The author doesn't limit himself to providing a plain guide that only states the obvious ways of customizations which the user interface offers, but brings in his years of experience to deliver a full-fledged administration guide with extraordinary depth: Apart from general things like the installation, setting up own issue-types, workflows, field configurations et al. he picks up minor usability issues and provides practical solutions in form of Velocity-, Groovy- or JavaScript-Code to adjust the appearance, automatize field input or run content checks in screens among others. Still this book isn't only dedicated to "hardcore" admins either, as even starters will learn a lot on best practices before or even during setting up and getting familiar with their first JIRA instance which might grow to a company-wide software in no time.
This makes it - for me - the best book on JIRA administration and certainly a good read for any JIRA administrator expert or not.

In a world where a blog is created every second does the world really need another blog? Well, it's got one. An irregular set of postings, weaving an intricate pattern around a diverse set of subjects. Comment on culture, technology, politics and the occasional rant about life. Alan ... in Belfast, Northern Ireland
Another post that was written a week or so ago, but then turkey and Christmas pudding got in the way!
It’s silly season, and while most shops are winding up to the sales and most offices are winding down to the annual party, government statistics agencies across the UK have been compiling their lists of top ten baby names. Since the year’s not yet over [at time of releasing their press releases] the analysis covers the period from January to early-December 2007.
There are strong regional differences. Not a single girl’s name Only Sophie makes it into the top ten for all three reported regions (NI, Scotland, England + Wales). [Thanks Ruth!]
And if you mine further into the Northern Ireland figures and look across the five Health and Social Services’ boards, Aoife and Caitlin only make it into the Western Board’s top five and miss out on the overall top ten.
Work-wise, there were a lot of trips to London (resulting from working on a number of project teams that were at least partially collocated in the big smoke), and a lot fewer visits to Ipswich. Not to forget one to Brussels - via Eurostar!
And then there was a sudden cessation in mid October, when I was no longer part of the day-to-day London-based team, with only two days away since!
Belfast waved goodbye to Air Berlin and FlyWhoosh. I haven’t yet enjoyed the delights of new-to-Belfast operators Aer Lingus or RyanAir. There were a few delays, but no need to spend the night at the airport. London City Airport turned out to be a joy. Flapjacks were an issue with bmi!
Getting the train up from London to Newcastle during the June English floods was quite straightforward, but getting a refund out of GNER (replaced by National Express from tomorrow) for the cancelled train home proved more difficult - three months in the end.
Considerable press coverage of Ikea's opening in Belfast from both sides of the border. The Irish Times opened its Ikea-focussed article this morning …
After weeks of doom-laden predictions on the talk shows, miles of police cones on the Holywood-Belfast dual-carriageway to deter hysterics tempted to abandon cars mid-carriageway, scores of CCTV cameras, 20 PSNI officers on Ikea traffic duty and a helicopter overhead to quell rampaging flat-pack fiends, we considered packing flak jackets, tents and three-day rations.
Come 8am, two hours before opening, what we got was an unnaturally orderly and cheerful queue of about 60 being entertained by jugglers and stilt-walkers.
While the Irish Independent and Belfast Telegraph finished their articles - environmentally friendly given that obvious reuse that Anita Guidera got by tailoring the same piece for two newspapers - with a reference to the much-quoted bed/conception statistic:
“From humble beginnings selling pens and nylons in Sweden back in 1943, today it is claimed that one in 10 Europeans are conceived in Ikea beds. After yesterday, Ireland's contribution to that statistic will begin.”
And the BBC suggests another 15,000 visited the next day (Friday). Not a bad footfall for a new store.
And the traffic tail backs - though just on one lane of the Sydenham bypass - eventually arrived on 27-31 December. But no massive gridlock yet!
A few months ago, the Ulster Bank mailed out card readers to users of their Anytime online banking service.
Until then, all you needed to access your account online was the account number, a 4-digit PIN and a password - three things I could carry around in my head.
But then they issued a card reader, that you slot your cheque guarantee/debit card into that can generate a one-time code once you've entered your card's PIN number. That's two physical things I now need to carry around if I want to access online banking when I'm away from home.
Except that having posted out the dinky blue card readers - at least three months ago - the Ulster Bank have yet to turn the service on! So the old account/PIN/password security must be good enough after all. Wonder how much the exercise cost them? And why the delay?
It's started a bit earlier than last year, but the 2008 Irish Blog Awards are now seeking nominations. So if there's a blog or two that you read regularly - or a podcast you regularly listen to - and think stand out beyond others, then nominate them.
(Though the awards.ie server seems to be underpowered tonight - Sat 29 Dec - leaving more time to think of worthy nominations.)
Last time I looked, there's no closing date for nominations, but they're likely to be open for four weeks or so if it follows last year's pattern. Update: Nominations close at 9pm on Friday 18 January.
"New nomination system, new judging system and a restriction on the number of categories you can be nominated in. This means there’s more chance for smaller blogs to get through and combined with no public vote this year, it means it’s not a popularity contest that gets you to the second round. So, to be clear, all nominated blogs will get judged in round 1 and whittled down and some will go forward to round 2 where the judging gets a lot tougher."
My only concern is around the categories that reward specialist bloggers that stick to a single subject, rather than the (majority?) of generalist bloggers who post about a wide range of topics. But you can't have everything!
We purchased a Maxi-Cosi Tobi car seat back in September 2006. I remember that lunchtime well - Northern Ireland were playing in Windsor Park and cars and buses were being abandoned all around Boucher Road as fans made their way to the match.
The seat we'd wanted in Halfords' sale was out of stock, so they cunningly upsold us to a "new improved" model - which gave nothing but trouble.
The straps frequently needed to be untangled, and the stiffness meant that the plastic around the pull-tightening-tether eventually cracked, making it sharp and difficult to secure our wee one in the seat. And it had an enormous base that made it quite a challenge to climb into - since no child waits to be lifted in for any longer than necessary!
Over a year from purchase ... and then I noticed mention in the instructions about a two year guarantee for plastic parts. Aha!
So back we went to Boucher Road Halfords - who agreed to replace the car seat with no fuss or quibble. Given that the seat's occupant had recently celebrated her third birthday and now tops 15 kilos, there was no point swapping for a similar seat - so instead they agreed we could have a Britax Evolva 123 (covers class 1+2+3) that can provide a five-point harness for another few months before we switch to using the normal seat belt threaded across the front.
Only downside is that its enormously fiddly to fit into the car. I'd got quite expert getting the Maxi-Cosi Tobi into the car in the dark, but this new seat will be a bigger challenge! But if it's more reliable in tightly securing our bundle into her seat, that's a price worth paying.
New Year Honours ... and Steve Furber who designed computers that could run a 22nd century intergalactic cargo ship
I've noticed that the New Year Honours list always dominates the BBC News homepage on the last Saturday morning of the year. Not only does it lead the top story, but it's the same for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and most of the categories below (technology, business, etc).
As the day progresses, the sections with most news eventually drop the honours story from the coveted home page slot, and lead on something else. But Technology is usually quiet on a Saturday, so it's no surprise that one particular story is still up top tonight.
Steve Furber - a key designer behind the BBC Micro and other Acorn computers - has been awarded a CBE in the New Year Honours list. According to a report, he got into computing when
... in the late 70s he became involved with the Cambridge University Processor Group, a club for computer hobbyists. "There was a gang of us who used to order integrated circuits and microprocessors from the very small number of shops that sold them," he said. "We got these bits and started building machines." During this time he was approached by Herman Hauser, co-founder of Acorn.
Pity it took 25 years or more to honour him. Those of us who honed our programming skills (that would be 6502/65C102 Assembler as well as BASIC!) on BBC Micros etc owe Steve Furber and his colleagues at Acorn a big thank you too.
“... the System 1 was entirely designed over an Easter vacation ... Sophie produced the monitor program by hand (hand assembly of 6502 code), we blew it into a PROM and it worked straight-off. There may have been a minor bug or two, but basically it ran first time, previously untested.
The System 1 had a starring role in the BBC’s Blakes 7, I seem to recall. It was used as the control panel on the cargo vessel they went around in, and I seem to recall Sophie noting that they even pushed the right key sequence to run a program.
It's tidy-up time of the year, and I took a quick look at draft posts that hadn't ever been published. The series of wise quotes ended prematurely, with the penultimate post never quite being succeeded with the final one ... until now!
To prevent you being wiped out with wisdom overload, this mini-series will now come to an end with a flourish of three clichés to finish:
“I shall be taking you to old London town in the country of UK, ruled over by Good king Wenceslas. Now human beings worshipped the great god Santa: a creature with fearsome claws and his wife Mary. And every Christmas Eve people of UK went to war with the country of turkey. They then eat the turkey people for Christmas dinner ... like savages.”
I wondered why there wasn’t a episode commentary sitting waiting on iTunes? Turns out that the BBC’s podcast rules and regulations were written a bit too restrictively. So they don’t allow for this kind of long episode audio show if it’s not related to a radio programme. So presumably until they negotiate something with the BBC Trust – who approve the services that the BBC write-up – the commentary to accompany Voyage of the Damned is only available via streaming. Boo hoo.
Having attended the Mini Clubman launch back in November, I managed to test drive one the Friday before Christmas. Though picking up a car from Boucher Road at lunchtime on the day that everyone escapes from work early wasn’t the best idea of the year! And leaving it back at 5pm was even worse.
(I didn't take any photos of the car - but then discovered it was one of the launch models and I'd some handy snaps from November.)
The alpine white Clubman I drove was 24cm longer than the standard Mini Cooper that I’ve been driving for the last four years. The extra side door beside the drivers door – often dubbed the suicide door – gives much better access to the back seats. Combined with the extra 8cm of legroom, it’s particularly useful for fitting a car seat and getting a toddler in and out. (Big hit with a three year old!)
The split back doors give good entry into the boot. Despite the extra length, you’ll only fit the smallest of buggies into the diminutive boot. You can accommodate a regular one by putting down one of the split back seats – but it brings a bit more road noise into the car interior.
I’d wondered if the split door wouldn’t badly obscure the view out the back window ... but the door frame is thin enough that stereo vision (two eyes looking at slightly different angles) compensates and you’ll not miss anything – other than a very slim signpost!
There’s a new BMW engine in the Clubman – it’s a lot quieter than the Cooper from four years ago, and allegedly less thirsty for petrol. Not sure why it needed a sixth gear though? The petrol model I test drove features eco-start/stop. So when its out of gear and travelling less than a couple of miles an hour the engine cuts out. And then when you put your foot down on the clutch it starts up again. Causes you to be a bit heavy with your right foot at the start, but I adapted within an hour.
There have been a few other less favourable “improvements”. The indicators no longer move up and down properly, making it hard to cancel or just blink briefly. And radio’s been integrated into the central dial, creating oodles of buttons but much harder to control.
But it drives well, and it is tempting to order one in the New Year to replace the Cooper that has to go back on its fourth birthday in January to be sold on some lucky punter.
As several people and articles had suggested before the Belfast palace of kitsch opened, Ikea's restaurant offers the most divine meatballs.
Make sure you get the (looks like) cranberry sauce and (they don't call it) gravy to go with it. A regular-sized portion gets you exactly 15 meatballs spooned onto your plate.
TIP - If you've applied for a (free) Ikea Family loyalty card, you'll be able to get free tea/coffee at the restaurant as well as the take away stall behind the main tills on the far side of the self-service warehouse.
All the fears of travel chaos on the roads continue to be unfounded - the planners must have got it right! Ikea's footfall is consistently over 10,000 each day, and the car park is moderately full most of the time, but there haven't been many big queues or jams on the approach road.
In fact it's so easy to get into that it's overtaken Secret Sainsbury cafe as somewhere local to pop into on a wet day. And there's a little person who loves to take her shoes off and hop under the bedcovers in the show rooms in the children's section!
Today - Boxing Day - the yellow-jacketed event/security team weren't even needed out with their red-tipped torches to direct traffic into the car park. (Thank goodness - as their Stalinist approach includes directing young families away from the more convenient ground floor spaces, and refusing to let you pick up a trolley to wheel your child from the car park and into the store!)
And they'd obviously cut back on catering staff as well - with paper plates and plastic cutlery being used this afternoon instead of the normal stuff. Not so eco-friendly an image as Ikea normally like to project. And although most aspects of the store feel like they've been engineered within an inch of their life, not leaving a supply of plates beside the dessert slices, running out of bread rolls and being unable to electronically process debit cards wasn't to the usual standard.
(They use old fashioned swipe boards for payments with debit cards. When the slip got creased under the swiper, the till operator casually tossed the slip into the bin at his feet - not even ripping up the paper which had my credit card number and name imprinted on it. So too with the second slip until the third attempt got an acceptable swipe.)
And watch out for the lifts. As well as both car park lifts dying on the opening night, one of the main customer ones inside had been playing up and was cordoned off today. Every new building - residential or commercial - always has its Achilles heel. Ikea seems cursed with dodgy lifts and uneven paving in the smoking corner outside the entrance next to the kids playground.
Christmas Eve saw a trip to Donaghadee. Hawaiian burger and chips in the Captain’s Table chippie on the harbour front. Then a walk out to (and around) the light house with our three year old.
At ten to eight this morning I witnessed at first hand the military operation being run by M&S out at Sprucefield.
Customers in a short queue waiting to collect their turkey and other festive goodies. The collections were all timed to prevent complete madness. Two massive freezer containers in behind the tills, and a refrigerated lorry out the back with yet more "birds".
The big Tesco in Lisburn was having less luck having suffered a bomb scare around 7am, causing trolleys to be abandoned in the aisles and checkouts as customers and staff evacuated.
By half eight staff were shopping in reverse, wheeling around trolleys and putting goods back on the shelves.
According to the cashier on one checkout, the security man on the door went white as a huge number of police cars with flashing lights turned up at the Bentrim Street store.
I was disappointed at the Guardian's article by Guy Clapperton entitled Mapping Britain's Blogosphere that was published on Thursday morning (20th December). I held off ranting about this on AiB for couple of days, but since there's been no reply from the Guardian, here goes!
Firstly, it seemed poor to publish an article about blogging and then not turn on the commenting feature on the website to allow readers to have a conversation about the article. Not very new media in an industry in which the Guardian is trying to lead the way. And it flies in the face of the concept of blogging.
Secondly, while the article's author deserves a small pat on the head for his inclusion of two cities in Scotland (Edinburgh and Glasgow) and Wales (Cardiff and Swansea), there wasn't even a tokenistic nod towards Northern Ireland which has a growing blogging community (some of whose posts are aggregated at northernirishblogs.com).
In an email to the Guardian's Technology editor - though he hasn't yet deemed it worthy of a reply - I suggested that
"next time someone commissions an article about the UK, why not include all the nations and regions - not just the ones that can read the Guardian in full colour ..."
a reference to the old Portadown press that means that NI readers get greyscale pictures instead of full colour and lose the TV reviews from G2.
Update - 30 December - Charles Arthur (editor of Technology Guardian) did reply tonight with a brief email.
Further update - 3 January - And an edited version of the email was published as a letter in the Technology Guardian pullout this morning (thanks to colleague Paul who noticed and tipped me off) - carefully removing any mention of this blogs URL and the final clause mentioning losing the TV reviews from G2.
Update - January 7 - Oh, and Charles Arthur published a blog entry of all the letters he received over Christmas, including even more related to the Blogging Britain article.
For the first time in months (perhaps a year) we sat down together last night and watched a couple of hours of telly live. (Admittedly after a recorded episode of Property Ladder from a month or so ago!)
So there was the joy of Nolan Live - which had some highs balancing out a few lows. But I was glad that they covered Omagh, even though it was the Christmas special. Brought back memories of Gerry Kelly's Friday night show on UTV that ran for years, and managed to switch between local and national, whimsical and deadly serious every week.
The most unexpected moment of the night was during the second item in the Ten o'Clock News. A story about Japanese whaling with at-the-scene reporter Jonah Fisher. It's playground humour, but I can't help smirking at this particular assignment!
The intended comedy arrived with Folks on the Hill - whose animation is incredible considering that its a one-man production on software/kit that would fit under your desk.
Despite his high price tag, I'd never watched more than five minutes of Friday Night with Jonathan Ross before last night. It was surprisingly good: a lot less puerile and needlessly smutty than Graham Norton. And there's a quick fire wit and rapid bantering that Ross achieves with carefully chosen guests that few other talk show hosts (including Nolan) can manage. It's a skill, and he has it. But I'm not sure it'll entice me to sit up that late to watch the new series when it starts in January.
And since this is a TV-related post, watch out for the repeat of Liverpool Nativity over on BBC One on Sunday night - 11pm in Northern Ireland, 10.45pm in other UK regions.
An earthquake struck about 30 miles off the coast of New Zealand on Thursday 8.55pm (0755 GMT) a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale. The city of Gisborne seems to have suffered the brunt, with damage to buildings, cracks in roads, and very stressed residents.
Yesterday morning’s Irish Independent reports on the figures released by Comreg on Wednesday showing that the number of Irish broadband users rose by around 8% last quarter to 705,000, a penetration rate of 16.35% (or 18.4% if mobile broadband users are included).
“However, the country still ranks as having one of the lowest broadband penetration rates in the developed world, behind industrialised nations such as New Zealand, France, Italy, the US and the UK.”
I'd caught the back of these creatures (statues?) from the other side of the window. So I nipped in the door of the Belfast Hilton to get a better view.
It was a mini nativity scene. Very colourful, and no doubt there's a story behind the artist and the inspiration, but there was no obvious sign to explain beside them. Update: there was a sign - just that I missed it the first time. The crib was made by pupils in years 8 to 11 in St. Gerard's ERC - a co-educational school for children and young people aged 4-16 with special educational needs. The crib is based on the work of the Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin in the colours and traditions of Tahiti.
As I took the photo, my gaze was distracted by the sight out the window past Mary's head. A team of Santa's elves offloading stuff from the back of a car!
Five minutes later, walking down past Cornmarket Arthur Square, there was a busker dressed as a bunny playing outside Dunnes, early for Easter! Not sure how much playing he was doing, and how much the keyboard was taking credit. But one of many surreal sights Belfast can throw up at lunchtime.
Later on, at the junction of Callender Street and Castle Lane, a more festive bunch were tunefully filling the street with carols.
Made me think that we should choose a day in January, and document Belfast that lunchtime. Photographing all the buskers and street collectors that we can find. Taking a social snapshot of Belfast that hour. Capturing the building works, the fashion, the weather, the buses, the people. A mad idea - one definitely worthy of Letter to America of old - but it's grown on me during the day.
Although Heroes has ended for most people, I’m still two episodes behind. To be honest, I’m not convinced I’ll be following the second series when it airs next year. I’ve noticed a series of US dramas have been moving my viewing acceptance criteria along a journey.
West Wing was fast and furious, more words that you could pick up, talking about subjects you knew nothing about. But gripping relationships keeping the viewers’ loyalty. (And it was one of my loose 2007 resolutions I managed to complete – getting through all seven seasons before the end of the year.)
24 was high octane drama, action packed, strong cliff hangers at the end of each episode, multiple storylines running in parallel in and across episodes.
Lost added a surreal dimension to US drama. Lots of unexplained, and never-explained details, keeping the audience guessing which parts of the story would turn out to be important, and when the next bolt out the blue would appear from stage left to upset any modicum of sense viewers had managed to make of the spaghetti storyline. Just about made it through all the terrestrial TV episodes, and abandoned at the point it went to Sky.
A strong first episode introducing a cast of disconnected characters with special powers. As the series progressed, the beginnings of interactions between heroes, darker sides to their friends and families, and a sense of purpose – though not quite like the Fellowship of the Ring! Heroes has less surreal unexplained stuff than Lost, less cliff hangers than 24, and not so well crafted relationships as West Wing.
So I’ll bear with it to the end of this series, but unless the next one gets great reviews – not sure the screenwriter’s apology makes that likely – it’ll be deleted from the Tivo as soon as I notice it’s been recorded.
The latest series of Spooks reached its dramatic conclusion last night. Bet there’s a resuscitation – rather than a resurrection – at the start of the next series. I was surprised there was no mention of next year’s Rogue Spooks Spooks: Liberty spinoff at the end.
And news that Peter Jackson will be involved with the cinematic revisioning of what remains of the accessible books in JRR Tolkien’s Middle Earth narrative. Having kissed and made up with the studio which owns the film rights to The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, Jackson has been confirmed as producer (not director – as yet unnamed) for New Line Cinema’s forthcoming Hobbit films. Yes plural. Two films. Got to milk it for all it’s worth – and make it worth the trip down to New Zealand.
I normally avoid online quizs - IMHO they're a waste of time and not very useful. But knowing a couple of people who've been through the proper Myers-Briggs interview and analysis, Ruth E's post caught my curiosity.
Save yourself the pain of paying someone to do a Myers-Briggs (MBTI) personality test ... and free alternative online version.
Problem is that the swing between sides isn't terribly strong, so a couple of questions answered differently could have swapped me from F to T.
Second quick review this week. Christmas is a funny time of the year in the catering and hospitality industry. Larger groups than normal, all ordering at the same time, putting pressure on kitchens and waiters. Good places seem to rise above it and churn out turkey dinners (nearly) better than your mother can produce, while poor places collapse under the pressure.
A work do in two rooms (23 University Road, Belfast, BT7 1NA - where Zio Belfast used to be) on Friday night tended towards the poorer result. While we’d ordered in advance of the pre-provided menu, they’d changed some of the options, so we had to order again when we arrived. And the starter I wanted vanished off the menu.
Bruschetta with goats cheese etc was a fine starter. (Someone else had the pea risotto - which looked like a handful of peas floating in Ambrosia rice pudding!)
The roast turkey main course was tough not tender, and cut so thick you could have soled your wellington boots with it. Service felt slow (an hour between the starter plates being set on the table and the main course arriving) and bit cheeky - there’s a limit to the number of wisecracks you really want to hear.
At least one person ended up in the restaurant next door - Tony Roma’s - which has a similar looking name (in the dark, the words begin with T and R).
Overall, not impressed, and won’t be back. Check out the Harbourview Japanese restaurant over at the Waterfront instead!
Update: Responding to an email from the owner who'd read this post, we did go back ... and found it much improved the second time - good enough to recommend!
Exodus (or Margate Exodus) was a film shown on Channel 4 towards the end of November. But as part of a one man bid to help speed the death of linear television, I picked it up on 4oD (Channel 4’s on-demand catch-up service) and watched it tonight just before it was due to expire.
It’s a modern day retelling of the biblical Exodus story – seems to be all the rage at the moment – written and directed by Penny Woolcock. Set in a mythical country that bears an uncanny resemblance to Margate, its leader Pharoah [sic] condemns all undesirables to live in a secure camp, based in the disused Dreamland amusement park. (It has more than a touch of Children of Men about it.)
As a baby, Moses was abandoned on a beach by his mother, found by Pharoah’s wife, and brought up in his privileged household. Played by Daniel Percival, Moses’ social conscience ran against his father’s beliefs (Bernard Hill). Witnessing an attack on a young woman while on a guided tour of Dreamland, Moses hits a soldier with the butt of a gun and accidentally kills him. So finds himself trapped, hiding inside the camp. Over time he meets his real Mum as well as his sweetheart Zipporah – the house-maid his father sacked.
"The story of Exodus is thousands of years old and cuts across many faiths and cultures. Immigration has never been more meaningful than it is today. Exodus begins with the Egyptians complaining about the immigrant Hebrews – there are too many of them, they’re having too many children. They are ‘the undesirables’ and a problem to get rid of."
Filmed in Margate – itself a major UK entry point for asylum seekers and illegal immigrants – we follow Moses as he adapts to camp life, throws himself into education, and wrestles with the military pressure Pharoah puts on the camp.
When Jethro the school headmaster is shot, the undesirables erect a massive wooden sculpture as a funeral pyre – the burning bush - and Moses sends a stark message to those outside the camp, including his father. But is that the voice of God he hears? (The burning man was actually created by Antony Gormley.)
But his non-violent approach isn’t working. How can Moses lead the people out of the camp? And so a series of plagues are released on the outside world. Algae contaminate the water. A computer virus infiltrates broadcast and IT systems. Food is poisoned. People start dying. Are they innocent or complicit in Dreamland’s suffering? God’s voice is no longer heard. As the military retaliate by storming the camp and shooting randomly, is Moses really following the right course of action?
But when the undesirables are eventually free to leave, can they control their anger and need for revenge? Can Moses live with the consequences of the domino chain he started to topple? Thou shalt not kill doesn’t seem to be commandment of the month now.
It’s a superbly shot film with understated music. Part of the film’s creation was the involvement of the multi-ethnic resident and immigrant community in Margate, culminating in Exodus Day on Saturday 30 September 2006, when the major crowd scenes were film along with the burning of the waste sculpture.
A film that doesn’t duck the big questions of how to counter loss of identity, intolerance and social inequity? A film that doesn’t stop short of asking what sort of God would kill the Egyptian first borns?
Yet the ending – spoilers ahoy! – stops short of the undesirables escaping their oppression through a parting of the English Channel. There is no solution. Instead, Moses fails to bring complete liberation, and the cycle of violence and oppression seems to start again, this time with the roles of oppressed and oppressor reversed.
It’s an ending, and perhaps not as clichéd as it would otherwise have been, but it’s imperfect and perhaps the film deserved better.
A quick review. My first time in the Harbourview Japanese restaurant that opened in the carbuncle built in front of Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. (That’s slightly unfair, as the side facing the Waterfront/river is perfectly pleasant, but the back side facing the courts looks like the good entrance to a hotel.)
Really nice décor and ambiance. (I choose to forgive the Christmas muzak that invades our eardrums at this time of year.)
You get to sit at a table/bar, and the food is cooked in front of you, expertly timed to suit the speed of your group’s eating. The chicken and salmon that came with Set Meal A was beautiful, particularly the salmon.
Recommended. Good value for the quality of food. Would go back. And would encourage others to try it out.
Now all Belfast needs is a sushi bar - though someone will no doubt now tell me we already have one.
There’s something very satisfying about reading a good story. And Audrey Niffenegger’s debut novel The Time Traveler's Wife does not disappoint – other than me wanting to spell traveller with a double l!
I read somewhere that the key to writing good science fiction is to distort just one aspect about the environment in which the characters inhabit.
Clare is six when we first pick up her timeline. A man called Henry keeps popping into her neighbourhood and her life, and over the years their friendship develops … as well as Clare’s patience. Like some men, Henry has trouble sticking around. But his excuse is a bit more elaborate (if hard to explain).
Henry suffers from Chrono-Displacement – a rare genetic disorder that leads him to unexpectedly vanish from his normal life (leaving his clothes to fall to a crumpled heap on the floor where he stood) and reappear back or forward in time (naked as he bring nothing other than his body with him). He could be away minutes or hours or days.
His first task on arrival is to find clothes and a way of getting food if he stays for more than a few hours. Cue lots of tricks such as getting Clare to keep his spare clothes hidden in a consistent location. Cue also lots of meeting up with himself in the past and future to find out what’s going on.
Henry is 24 when he travels back and first meets Clare as a child. But when they eventually meet up in real life, there’s only 8 years between them - long enough for Henry to have a history of relationships and misfortune behind him.
And so the story follows Henry and Clare through their lives. Henry hops about, often leaving Clare not knowing when he’ll return. Like the old text-only computer adventure games would have said: “Time passes”. (Oops! Second reference to that this month!)
It’s a fascinating book. Really well written. The whole time-travelling thing could have got so out of hand, but by mainly sticking to Clare’s timeline, there’s a stable reference point in the narrative, allowing Henry to bounce around, weaving his vapour trail in and out of her life. Towards the end, it also turns into an incredibly sad book, with Henry aware of his own mortality, and tears welling in the reader’s eye.
Perhaps a perfect read for this time of year – Advent – a season of waiting and anticipation. In the book, Clare waiting for Henry to next disappear or reappear, waiting for their life together to stabilise, waiting for a baby. In our household, waiting for a sick child to fight off an infection and rebound to her normal perky self. For Mary and Joseph, to await the birth of Jesus and the complete uncertainty beyond. And for Christians, the waiting for Christmas that itself reflects the long journey towards Easter.
Following on from the success of Manchester Passion on Good Friday 2006, BBC Three broadcast Liverpool Nativity live at 8 o’clock tonight. Mostly indigenous actors performing and musicians singing music from the Liverpool area to narrate a modern day version of the Christmas story.
... expect to find Geoffrey Hughes playing the Angel Gabriel narrating the events, and Cathy Tyson cast as Herodia, a paranoid government minister “desperate to cling to power, orders a crackdown on immigration” directing events as they unfold live in Liverpool city centre.
Of course, any nativity would be lost without Mary and Joseph (Jodie McNee and Kenny Thompson). Joseph is an asylum seeker, instructed to report to the nearest passport office, whilst Mary “discovers she is pregnant and must fight to protect both Joseph and her unborn child”.
At the beginning, narrator Gabriel (Geoffrey Hughes) made constant references back to the “original” nativity to explain the fairly obvious parallels that were being drawn in the modern (though still quite original) Liverpool nativity. Not something that happens when one of Shakespeare’s works gets updated. But probably due to the feeling that understanding of basic biblical stories is waning. (Not to mention the recent Daily Telegraph rants about school nativities etc).
Fun to see the wandering minstrels following the main characters around Liverpool with their guitars, violins and accordions - like the disciple’s band Manchester Passion. Maybe as European Capital of Culture this is what Liverpool will be like for all of 2008! Buskers unite!
[Worried Mary racing away from Joseph to clear her head after hearing that she would be pregnant when her mobile rings.]
The comparisons with Manchester are inevitable, and I can’t stop myself thinking back to the moving power of the 2006 production. Who’d have thought that the Beatles, sons of Liverpool, would end up lyrically weak when compared to Mancunian Oasis! Though Lady Madonna was a fitting accompaniment for the Magi (three Kings) to present their gifts to the baby (sleeping in shopping trolley for a crib).
With betrayal, death and resurrection, the Manchester Passion was always going to be a stronger story. But there was a moment at the end of the Liverpool Nativity, as Mary, Joseph and their baby leave the stage to “do one” (run away), the narrator Gabriel implored the crowd to
“Open up and let them get among you. And when they’re among you, swathe them, bring them into your community, swathe them with your humanity, with your love.”
It’s quite one thing for members of a crowd – any crowd - to turn up and be associated with a cause - in this case the plight of Mary and Joseph - but quite another to take the step from mental/vocal support to actual physical involvement. To put their lives and homes and safety where their hearts are. Very Jesus!
If your BBC Three reception this evening was as bad as mine, you’ll be able to catch it again when it’s repeated later tonight at 11pm on BBC Three and then next Sunday (23 December) on BBC One at 11pm (in Northern Ireland - 10.45pm in rest of UK).
Update: Unofficial overnight viewing figures should that the TV audience peaked at around 710,000 for the 8pm showing on BBC Three, and was also shown live in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Poland and the Czech Republic.
There aren’t may workplaces in which staff choose to gather to sing carols one lunchtime before Christmas. And while I don’t work there, I was in the building and ended up in BBC Reception in Belfast with sixty or so other people for half an hour yesterday lunchtime.
With 11 carols printed out, beautiful accompaniment on piano, double bass, guitar, and the dulcet tones of John Toal leading the singing, those gathered sang heartily for half an hour – and with quite a bit of harmony.
It was during the penultimate carol – Silent Night – that my brain started to fade in the voiceover from Simon & Garfunkel’s 7 O’Clock News / Silent Night track. As we stood singing, it was like a modern day recreation of their song, with the plasma screens offering a window out onto the world as we sang about
Nine lessons and carols is usually a bit closer to Christmas Day. But yesterday lunchtime, it snuck up on me. It might be the only carol service I get to this year, but it was worship, and it’ll be every bit as memorable and special as one held in a church building.
This morning all of Belfast ... no make that all of the local media ... was abuzz with the opening of the island’s first Ikea store. No more getting the bus on the ferry across to Scotland. No more flying across as Iris Robinson admitted on Not the Nolan Show this morning - you wouldn’t bring a big mattress back on the plane!
(It wasn’t the only opening in Belfast with the locally filmed movie Closing the Ring - directed by Richard Attenborough - being premiered in Belfast before a short run in a small number of Irish and UK cinemas. Unfortunately, the film hasn’t found a large distributor, so is unlikely to recoup its costs.)
The three policemen that checked out the Ikea store opening in Malaga were on safe ground as a few hundred people supported by crowds of traditional media (and the odd blogger, ahem Mr Barnes) watched Lord Mayor Jim Rodgers saw his way through a Swedish log whilst Ian and Martin looked on.
I was lying sick tucked up in bed as all this happened. Even then I couldn’t miss it on the radio later.
Popping out for a few messages this evening around 8 o’clock, I decided to chance Secret Sainsburys. No traffic problems on the A2 or the slip road down towards Holywood Exchange. And the lure of the blue and yellow store caught me in its Scandinavian grip, and pulled my car towards the multi-storey car park as if by tractor beam. We got held up briefly as a fire engine unexpectedly drove past the line of traffic and though a gateway into the land behind the main car park with its blue lights flashing.
Despite a low turnout for the opening this morning, lots of people had been encouraged to pop down for Geoff Duke before bedtime. The security/event team looking after the car park said that they’d filled the main car park this evening, but hadn’t needed as much of the overflow. (The top floor of the Ikea car park will be a great spot for plane spotters, with a great view over the Belfast City Airport runway and apron.)
I’ve previously referred to Ikea as bringing kitsch to Belfast, and the photo below is proof! Colourful plastic kitchen gadgets galore.
I bought a packet of paper napkins – we needed some for a birthday party on Saturday. Despite the dress rehearsal last Sunday when Ikea staff could each bring four friends or family to the store to browse and buy, the guy serving me on the till was still getting used to getting plastic cards to work in the PIN reader. (There’s a 70p surcharge for using credit cards, so you might want to use a Switch Maestro card if you’re only buying napkins.) Turns out that this is his second job. During the day he works as a civil servant. But at night he transforms into a blue and yellow super hero till operator. He explained that
“I always fancied the Ikea dream ... but I’m not sure I could stand this very long on top of a full time job!”
Finally escaping the store, I wandered back over to the car park. Both lifts were now out of order – though people were getting into the right hand one on the first floor and wondering why they couldn’t make the doors close since the man in the yellow coat had only blocked off the ground floor door. Oops.
All in all, it’ll be fun to go back in a month or two. The sign outside the Ikea entrance summed up what Northern Ireland’s shoppers felt today ... it's where they chose to be. But I bet it’s bedlam on Saturday and Sunday afternoon!

Pick’n’Mix Festival is showcasing a great variety of staged readings, mini plays and dance performances this weekend in Queen’s University’s Brian Friel Theatre and rehearsal studio. The box office is closed, the performances have started, but there should still be some tickets on sale from the venue.
It’s not too late to catch the farcical Cooking with Elvis (Bruiser); children shows (Cahoots); up to the minute satire (Tinderbox); Songe for Jean McConville - Requiem for the Disappeared (opera by Ransom); kinetic motion sensors supporting a three dimensional dance performance in a virtual world (Eileen McClory); and lots lots more. Tickets £5 with some double dip offers (two shows for the price of one).
More details on The MAC website or on Facebook. And don’t forget that the Belfast Book Festival still has a few more days to run around the corner in the Crescent Arts Centre.
Malachi O'Doherty - a science fiction fan - explored the role of faith and religion in science fiction in a package on this morning's Sunday Sequence. Broadcast a week late for the mid-season finale of Doctor Who .... but never mind!
You can listen again (until next Sunday morning). Described as a science fiction "nut", local blogger Destroy All Onions is featured and amongst the talk of souls, identities, morals and fears of the destruction of planet Earth, he reminds listeners:
There's nothing dates like the future. The visions of the future that we had fifty years ago are horrendously out of date now. They're nothing like what we have now. In fifty years time our visions of the future will be different again and sci fi will be adapting to that.
Food for thought as I write up my vision of a utopian Northern Ireland! More about that in a month or two.
It'll not be long before the smaller ball will be hoisted up and dropped into the middle of the larger, outer ball.
The scale of Wolfgang Buttress' sculpture is finally clear, and within a few weeks the Balls on the Falls RISE will be finished and drivers will no longer be so distracted with the mechanics of its construction, making Broadway Roundabout a safer place to drive around.
Moderators of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland take on the role of the denomination’s ambassador for twelve months. By the end of their term, most moderators appear to have grown in wisdom and understanding of both the church and society, as well as become quite weary with the workload and travel.
I spoke to both the outgoing moderator Dr Norman Hamilton and moderator designate Dr Ivan Patterson on Friday afternoon, asking them about their experiences and anticipations of the role.
Prior to taking a year out to be moderator, Norman Hamilton had been ministering in Ballysillan Presbyterian Church and the surrounding north Belfast for more than twenty years. He described his feelings in the run up to becoming moderator last June as “a mixture of apprehension and excitement and anticipation and certainly a journey into the unknown both in terms of places to go, people to meet and situations to encounter”.
“The moderator does some formal things within the life of the church. He chairs some of the senior boards and committees. But his main role is be the chief spokesman, the chief public face, of the Presbyterian Church for the year, certainly throughout Ireland and to some extent overseas and in the UK.”
Outside of ecclesiastical circles there is a role in wider society too. In Norman’s case, that included seven engagements with the Royal Family and three with President McAleese.
“I think the models of a previous generation have long since passed their sell by date and that we need to find a proper mutually helpful, challenging relationship.”
That includes rethinking role of the ‘four main church leaders’. I wondered whether it was time for a fifth person to stand alongside them to give a non-religious viewpoint.
Some of the latest initiatives by the Taoiseach out of the Lisbon Treaty do involve other faiths and indeed do involve humanists. And I was at the first meeting of that group convened by the Taoiseach only a couple of weeks ago.
That is what I mean by a reconfiguration of the relationship. Those of us who are Christians and want to promote a Christian and biblical worldview need to realise that we are in a society that no longer accepts that as given or takes it for granted.”
“Some bits are flourishing and some bits are struggling. Our structures are struggling to cope with the realities of an increasingly secular changing world. Certainly the much more overtly critical emphasis in wider society is bringing challenge at local levels that we haven’t faced in the past. That’s what I meant earlier about the reconfiguring of the proper relationship between the church and wider society.”
Both in his work in North Belfast and over the last year as moderator, Norman Hamilton has conversed with many politicians. What is his assessment of the maturity of our local political process?
“I was seriously disappointed by the level of internecine warfare over the budget … That seriously troubled me. But I do think that that penny has probably dropped with the new Executive and they do understand the need not so much to hide their differences but to actually ensure that they are seen to be rowing the boat in the same direction, pulling in the same direction. I would be hopeful that they would do it together but slightly fearful that from time to time we will be mentored negatively.”
Cohesion, sharing and integration was a theme throughout Norman Hamilton’s year. He even appeared at the SDLP’s conference as part of their Shared Society panel debate. Has he seen any tangible progress?
“There hasn’t been a lot of tangible progress in policy terms in the north. The widespread disaffection with the previous Executive’s papers showed that.
However the visit of the Queen and the welcome given to her by President McAleese and the Irish people I think has changed the dynamics of that. And perhaps in the North we have some catch up to do with what we saw modelled in the Republic.”
Confident that he’s not leaving his moderatorial successors “a cupboard full of skeletons” Norman also suggested that the definition of the role of moderator deserved thought.
“There is a task for the role of the ministry of the moderator to be defined from the role of the moderator. The moderator does all these things, but what’s he actually there for in Christian ministry terms? I think we need to give a bit more careful thought to that.”
Around many issues, including the gender of moderators – of which he says “I would love to see a woman who was moderator, but I suspect that’s a wee while away” – what makes PCI so conservative and slow to change?
“It does seem to me that temperamentally we are conservative, with a small ‘c’. We are conservative about everything. And therefore we are conservative about our theology, we are conservative about what we do, what is acceptable. There’s just an in-built conservatism in our DNA and I think that has been accentuated by the Troubles. The need to be protective of who we are and what we stand for. That will change, but I still think it’s a long process.”
Norman described a charity concert run by the Carrickfergus Presbytery in the Ulster Hall as an “extraordinarily uplifting” highlight from his year as moderator.
“Some of the praise and worship was led by a group of young adults who have significant learning disabilities. That was stunning and those folks are contributing on Monday night. That is one of my outstanding positive memories because it is all too easy to think that only the good things are done by the great and the good.”
“There were many. How many do you want? I think probably the most difficult one was being in Malawi during the visit of the Pope and the furore that broke around me when actually I was unable to even hear what was being said and to respond to it. That’s not a complaint, just a statement of fact. That was really quite difficult.
I think the other thing I have found difficult is that we still live in a society and even in a church world where relationships are often very strained and very difficult. And it does seem to me that there is a real challenge for Christian people to show in action the gospel of grace that we proclaim in our teaching. We have to behave graciously. And I’m not sure we do that as well as we might.”
When I talked to Dr Ivan Patterson, he was less than 72 hours away from taking over the reins at the front of PCI. I asked what in his life or ministry had prepared him for this moment?
“I think life prepared me. Having been in business for a number of years and come back to study, life for me has always been just a plodding on. There’s never been bright lights, it’s just been listening, seeing what’s available, where I go, and through all of that listening – hopefully to God who would direct me. I suppose life teaches us lots of things. I ministered in a rural area, been in semi-rural in Newcastle. Lots of dealing with people, seeing what makes them tick, and in the context of trying to make God relevant to them through scripture, through teaching and through talking.”
He’s been ministering in the Newcastle congregation for twenty years. The church has recently completed a redevelopment and he welcomes the opportunity for children from the town – who attend different schools in surrounding towns – to be able to mix together twice a week, breaking down church and community barriers.
“It’s really a restaurant town nowadays and there are quite a number of clubs. One of the areas we’ve been trying to do something about is a Night Light team. That’s folk out – usually only on a Friday night because that seems to be the busier night – it’s just being there as a Christian group of people, seeing kids not well enough dressed … it’s really just making sure they get home, they’re not cold, all of that. I think that is one of the major issues.”
“From I went to Newcastle, I was keen that there would be good relationships between everybody. So I’ve gone out of my way to keep good relationships. I think Newcastle was a town that throughout the Troubles was very fortunate. There are no ghetto areas, so the whole town is mixed and relationships have always been – at least superficially – good if not slightly deeper than that.
At the beginning, churches were a little bit suspicious of each other. Even Protestant churches didn’t always do things together. We have been able, not only to reach out, but to do things with the Catholic community – Bible studies and services – but we also do work with the Baptists and sometimes the Elim come to that. Every fifth Sunday there is an open service down in the Newcastle Centre.”
Later in the interview, Ivan refers back to another example of “reaching across the community” and his involvement in the setting up of Youth Link NI, an inter-church youth service established by the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches in 1991.
“That was quite a unique thing in the British Isles because at that stage there was no other youth organisation which included the Catholics. We had about three agonising years to try and get that to work. That was a real learning curve for me. Because you discover that we all have our own hang-ups, but there are certain things very core issues about what it is to be a Christian that are the same. There is a big report on sectarianism. It would be good to be talking about that and seeing how we are part of it because none of us are perfect.”
As Norman Hamilton pointed out, society is increasingly secular. I asked what Ivan thought about the church’s changing role in society?
“Certainly I think we are fairly largely “post-Christian”, in the sense that even some of the Christians are almost post-Christian because for many people it is really something they do rather than something they know about and something that they want to experience of God.
This year the theme that I’ve got is “Word is Life” so it’s really discovering God through his Word, and trying to expose people to what Christ was saying to us and what he expects of us in the world. To me one of the big challenges is to try and get folk to think – especially Christian folk to think – what God might think and not necessarily to be preaching to people but to be just among people.
I try to encourage some of our folk [congregation of Newcastle Presbyterian] – particularly some of the business men – to get involved in the Chamber of Commerce, get involved in those areas where they can go and bring not necessarily a preaching role but to be some kind of salt and light that the New Testament talks about.”
So given Ivan Patterson’s theme for the year, does he think it’s important for churches to spend more time worrying and agonising over ordaining gay ministers and resolving Kirk Session disputes than tackling things like poverty which is what Jesus talks about most in the Gospels and seemed to be pushing his buttons?
“I do think there are times when we get hung up on important issues but sometimes … If I can explain it this way. I remember Orlando Costas being here years ago and he talked about the truth being like a flash lamp. And what so many Christian people do is they shine the flash lamp up into the air and look at the beam, and they forget they ought to turn it down onto the road and say what does this mean for me living out my Christian life.
If we are going to be influential people – and I believe the Christian gospel has something to make an impact on people’s lives and without it I believe they’re not as whole as they might be – then I think we need to sit down and with people, whatever their problem is, whether we like who they are or what they are, just to be able to sit down and share 'This is my understanding, this is how it works for me, but what do you think about this?'”
For the first time, representatives of various sporting organisations have been invited to the opening night of the General Assembly, including the GAA, IFA and Irish Rugby Football Union. Ivan welcomes the greater inclusion of civil society.
“I can’t actually speak for the General Assembly, but as a personal opinion – locally at least – I don’t see that anybody should be told not to come in. And I think it’s good to allow people to see that you’re human, that this is how we do things, this is what we’re about, do you want to engage with us?”
Given that approach, does it sit oddly with him that somebody like Cardinal Brady – who he’ll meet regularly during the year – would not be invited to the opening of the General Assembly?
“My feeling on this would be – and I’ve no idea how the church is going to go on this – but especially at an opening night, the service is our service. And there’s no sense in which anyone’s being compromised – the only person who’s probably being compromised would be the archbishop if he comes. So I don’t really have a problem with it and I would welcome it. Although I did read somewhere in a report that maybe we should actually be thinking about others because we don’t invite the Baptists, we don’t invite the Reformed Presbyterians.”
Described as “conservatively biblical with a strong evangelical outlook”, Ivan Patterson explains what those labels mean to him.
“What it says to me is that I believe the Bible, even the difficult bits. And I believe the Bible impacts people’s lives. I think the good news of Jesus – the Gospel – is something that changed me. Not as dramatically as some people, but it certainly changed me. So I would be fairly conservative in all of that, but I think as I get older – which is maybe not how it should be – I would want to be much more open to how we live that out, how we do church, how we react to people.”
He’s looking forward to the year ahead, with its programme of church visits and services, as well as invitations to civic events. What’s he dreading?
“Probably at this point in time: next week! I’ve two sermons to preach. It’s one thing preaching to other people, but I always feel it’s a different thing preaching to your colleagues.”
Having been away for the last three weeks preparing for his year as moderator, he knows that he’ll miss his home congregation in Newcastle.
The opening night of the General Assembly takes place on Monday night at 7pm in Church House, Fisherwick Place, Belfast. Tickets aren’t required and anyone is welcome to attend. (Belfast Lord Mayor Niall Ó Donnghaile is taking up his invitation and will be joined for the first time by representatives from sporting organisations including the GAA, IFA and Irish Rugby Football Union.
Radio Ulster normally broadcasts the opening night on Medium Wave with a wry commentary from Bert Tosh and William Crawley, and there’s always a chance that PCI may stream it on their website.
Belfast Book Festival has just launched its programme. Running between 13 and 19 June and based in and around the Crescent Arts Centre, the festival is “intent on capturing the literary energy of the city in a week-long celebration of the writer and the reader”.
There are a whole series of events for young bookworms with free storytelling in the Storybook Cafe on Saturday 18 and Sunday 19, a one hour Nearly True Tales Tour around the Cathedral Quarter meeting characters from children’s books (£5/£3) and a reading by Nicola Pierce from her new book Spirit of the Titanic in the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at 2pm on Tuesday 14 (£6/£4) which is also hosting the major Titanica exhibitions at present.
Ciarán Carson and guests (including Glenn Patterson) play music, sing, recite poetry and read prose at 7.30pm on Monday 13. (£8/£6 with nibbles provided)
Hugh Jordan is in conversation with PA journalist Deric Henderson who’s been tracking the story of Colin Howell and Hazel Stewart which will feature in his forthcoming book Let This Be Our Secret. Tuesday 14 at 1pm. (£6/£4)
Later on that day, John Self (the blogger behind The Asylum) is in conversation with Greg Baxter (A Preparation for Death and The Apartment). 5.30pm on Tuesday 14. (£6/£4)
A book of Irish-language short stories with parallel English translations - Bás in Éirinn – May You Die in Ireland – will be launched on Thursday 16 at 6pm in Belfast Exposed. Edited and translated by Aodán MacPóilin and Róise Ní Bhaoill, and published by ULTACH Trust, the book features stories from Liam O’Flaherty, Dáithí Ó Muirí amongst others, all dealing with death. But as MacPóilin explains, “there’s more comedy in the book than tragedy: Irish writers never have any difficulty with death - it’s love they can’t handle!” (free)
It’s rare for any festival in Belfast to ignore films or buses! The QFT will be showing various literary classics during the festival week including Brighton Rock, Ulysses, Rebecca and To Kill a Mocking Bird.

Hi again! I'm back, as promised, with a special post for today. I'm excited to tell you that I was invited to be the guest designer for this month's challenge at The Sketchy Challenges! Of course, I said yes! The Sketchy Challenges have gone monthly from now until September and there is also a theme and a twist: to use the sketch or not.. The theme this time is "Christmas". I always love a chance to add to my Christmas card stash!
My card base and mats are SU Cherry Cobbler and the patterned papers are from a couple of Christmas pads in my stash. Sorry, I don't really know which ones. The gorgeous image is Scarlett Holly by ching chou kuik from Sweet Pea Stamps. I colored her with my Copics then added a bit of Shabby White Fran-Tage to the corners. The sentiment is from Create With TLC. A dimensional poinsettia sticker and a few pearls from my stash finished my card.
Thanks for stopping by again and thanks to everyone at The Sketchy Challenges for having me as a GD! I hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend! See you soon!
Very pretty card, Carla. I love the Frantage. It really makes things look Christmasy. Enjoy your weekend.
What a beautiful Christmas card. I love that image and the Fran-tage gives it such a wintry, snowy look.
Congrats on your well-deserved GDT! And you did a wonderful job with this sketch! Love the pretty papers and image! Fab coloring and Frantage! :^)
Congrats on your GDT :-) I love a nice sketch... this is a beauty, and what you've done with it is FABULOUS; love the image, colours and embellies. Donna xx

One century ago in the 1915 trenches of World War I, a young engineer named Hugh Lofting was moved by the sufferings of innocent horses and mules drafted into the horrifying vortex of human destruction. Needing something to say in letters home to his small children, he invented a certain doctor to minister to the beasts. This remarkable man could, Lofting explained to his children, talk with animals. He would name his doctor “Dolittle” and place him in Victorian England amidst all that period’s rich discoveries of the living world.
The last century has been the worst in history for relations among humans and between humans and non-human animals. Perhaps we might look ourselves in the mirror and ask whether we should still aspire to talk to the animals—who doesn’t share Lofting’s dream?—or whether we should aspire instead to turn down our chatter and do a better job of listening to what animals need us to hear.
Dr. Dolittle was one of my earliest heroes, now at the age of 75, but I didn’t know how he originated and am delighted to learn this. I am also delighted and profoundly thankful that Carl Safina and all like-minded and hearted people have existed and exist now. We need them so badly and so few realise that still. Some little progress is happening, I pray it will be enough and soon enough.
We must “plant seeds” of awareness and understanding of the Animal Kingdom where and when we are able, and it would be excellent if schools worldwide were to incorporate in their curriculum not only the scientific aspects of animals, but also how to relate to them and how they relate to each other. With that there must be far more making young minds aware of how they depend on everything which exists naturally around them and, if insufficient effort is made to conserve and treasure it all, they too will suffer.
Animals and creatures do, of course, “talk to each other” only we have not wanted sufficiently to understand their language. Some progress has been made in that respect with dolphins and whales, but not on those on earth and in the air.

The Brand Bubble is published by Jossey-Bass, a Wiley Imprint and named #3 by Amazon as “Best Business Books of 2008.” More details at www.thebrandbubble.com.
You are the co-writer of the recently published The Brand Bubble. What was the inspiration behind this book?
We found a pattern of decline in the levels of awareness, trust, esteem and loyalty in thousands of brands that the markets assumed were growing. We were curious because this erosion was occurring at the same time as the rise of social media, fragmentation and digital-enabled consumerism. We wondered if this was a coincidence, or a canary in the coalmine? Cue the singing bird…
The brand bubble represents the growing disparity in the value that business and consumers apportion to brands. The markets think brands are worth more than the consumers who buy them.
Brand value is now 30 per cent of the operating value of companies in the S&P 500. This figure has grown by 80 per cent in less than a generation. The 250 most valuable global brands are worth $2.197 trillion dollars, which collectively exceeds the GDP of France. So if you think of brands like a sector, they’re both powerful and in trouble.
We found consumers were captivated by some brands because they weren’t just different – they kept being different. This consumer perception of meaning, motion, and direction is what we call energized differentiation. Energy itself is new and plays a significant new role in enhancing brand differentiation. It has three components:
Vision – The brand’s purpose and aspirations, often originating from its leadership, convictions and reputation of the company behind the brand.
Invention – The most tangible dimension, demonstrating the brand’s vision through product/service innovation, design, content and other tactile brand experiences.
Dynamism – How the brand expresses its vision in a dynamic way in the marketplace to create persona, emotion, advocacy and evangelism through its marketing and other forms of conversations with consumers.
When a brand builds energized differentiation, it improves its loyalty and pricing power. And vision, invention and dynamism, the building blocks of energy are essentially the consumer’s mandate for integrated marketing. They see brands holistically, and we should too.
In the book we walk the reader through a five-stage model to drive the brand through their organization and to collaborate from the standpoint of what the consumer wants and needs. Since marketing is often narrowly applied in many companies (e.g. communications), this process involves the entire enterprise to align the brand strategy with the business strategy. Every department and division through value chain plays a role in igniting the energy of the brand, by contributing creativity and ideas that lead the brand forward. The entire company has to become marketing-led, not just a company with a marketing department.
“Many brands will become commoditized, replaced by new brands or ‘Lazarus’ brands like Adidas, Puma, LaCoste or Marks & Spencer.”
Then there are five “Laws of Energy” that help enterprises re-examine how they approach and implement their creativity, their messaging, their flexibility and ability to evolve their brand, their approach to marketing, and their use of strategies and tactics. They force difficult managerial decisions and keep the consumer and the brand at the forefront of all business decision making, from R&D to finance. The argument we’re making is that the best CEO’s think like CMO’s and the best-managed brands have people who think like brand managers across all functions and lines of business. Together they can amplify marketing’s role and organize deeper more enriching brand experiences that consumers are now demanding.
DH: BrandAsset® Valuator (BAV) is a research tool that Y&R has maintained for more than fifteen years. Can you provide us with a little background to this tool?
BrandAsset Valuatorâ is considered the world’s largest global database on brands, and because of its scale and longevity, it is recognized as a reliable diagnostic tool for understanding how successful brands are built. Each year we interview almost 500,000 customers in 44 countries across 40,000 brands on more than 70 brand metrics. We conduct surveys in more than forty languages. From Arabic to Zulu, we ask consumers how they feel about local, regional, and multinational brands, media, and celebrities.
We’ve invested almost $115 million dollars in our study and our data tracks back to 1993. And we have opened up our database for the first time for anyone to use. Go to thebrandbubble.com/explore and conduct your own brand research. Or try the tool on Facebook by searching for “The Brand Bubble.”
DH: You say that today’s consumers are voracious planners. A craze which is equally characteristic of Baby Boomers, Gen Xers and Millennials. What characteristics do you see for future consumers?
In our research, we noticed behavioural patterns indicating that consumers are acting towards brands like investors in companies. Consumers hold both a short-term and long-term horizon, imagining future utility in a brand, while demanding instant gratification. This is similar to how an investor seeks both growth and dividends in a stock. And like investors, consumers demand brand transparency and a more direct participatory relationship. And they have unprecedented power to make or break a brand. This is especially true of Millennials, who actively blog, vlog, mash up, twitter and epinion a brand to criticism or acclaim.
“With commoditization a reality of every day life, only the brands that are continuously creative will attract and hold our attention, and our affection.”
By thinking of consumers as investors, we can urge others in the company to see their customer through a lens that’s familiar, the shareholder. And brand management can begin to act like a company under Sarbanes Oxley because brands have nowhere to hide.
DH: To quote your book: “the more salient distinction about today’s ConsumerLand is that the nature of change itself has changed.” Can you explain what you mean by this?
ConsumerLand describes a broadband-enabled world of limitless consumer potential and endless control over brands. I believe the nature and pace of change is different because of our Moore’s Law-like consumerist expectations for innovation and progress. Consumers are much quicker to punish uninterested brands and therefore brand equity decays at an accelerated rate. Just consider in the span of three years consumers now trust each other more than they trust brands. Media Edge/CIA found that 76 per cent of people rely on what others say versus 15 per cent on advertising. Today, 92 per cent of consumers now cite word of mouth as the best source for product and brand information. No wonder reviews sites, such as Digg and Reddit, have become the third-most-common use of the Internet after e-mail and search. Everything is moving faster except brand management.
In today’s world, brands are verbs. Yet too often we manage a brand for what it is today, rather than what it could be tomorrow. An open, forward looking expansive vision of a brand’s potential is essential to leading and inspiring consumers and orchestrating the best efforts of the company. This type of thinking is found in high-energy brands. They hate complacency and they never sit still. Many brands will become commoditized, replaced by new brands or “Lazarus” brands like Adidas, Puma, LaCoste or Marks & Spencer.
Therefore the economic value of brands must be front and centre, not using input metrics or things that look backward, but providing metrics that demonstrate a brand’s future potential. This is what energized differentiation is all about. And instead of a “nice to have”, creativity will be a “must have” competitive advantage for business. With commoditization a reality of every day life, only the brands that are continuously creative will attract and hold our attention, and our affection.
I admire Zappos for its relentless focus on customer service. I love Virgin Atlantic for its mastery over the brand experience. I applaud Starbuck’s for having a cultural conversation about its own health. I think Xerox has one of the coolest and most collaborate corporate cultures. And I salute brands like Geico, Axe, Subway and Method for branding desire in commoditized categories. All of them remind us that brands have never been more important, yet there are too few important brands.
I’m very interested in how brands will emerge from this recession and what can be applied to future economic downturns. I’m spending a fair bit of time in India and amazed by business there and the rise of brands like Tata Motors, Titan and Kingfisher. And with the speed of technology, I believe we’ve only seen the beginning of the brand bubble.
John Keane – pedal steel, acoustic and electric guitars, vocals, bass, percussion, organ (all songs but 8, 12)
Caroline Aiken has released 8 albums in her multifarious career, but 2015 marks a first for the seasoned songbird. Broken Wings Heal, the 9th release from Caroline Aiken; has a story like no other, bearing the soul of the songwriter like the metaphor contained in the album’s artwork, a bird being released from a cage.
The inspiration for Broken Wings Heal was sparked 29 years ago, when Caroline welcomed her daughter to the world. But while attending college (4.0 full scholarship), her daughter lost direction, straying into the world of illegal drugs, was arrested. Though no one was hurt, she received a devastating ten-year prison sentence. But this story doesn’t end up a sad one, as the experience and all it has entailed bears a new beauty that shines over the lives of both mother and daughter. It brings them closer. It allows time for reflection, connection and a new direction, and when Caroline’s daughter breaks free from her cage, she will be able to soar to the highest peak, empowered to sing her own song. Broken Wings Heal, is a tribute to her daughter’s strength, love and determination. It’s a heart-on-the-table, hopeful and joyful album, and that’s just the beginning.
Engineered/Produced by Grammy nominated, John Keane (Widespread Panic, REM, Indigo Girls), Broken Wings Heal is a lush and intricate exploration of folk/rock with funk and jazz between the layers. Aiken’s own guitar and piano skills showcase her pure, bluesy vocals, complimented by John’s powerful electric guitar, pedal steel and Randall Bramblett’s horn solos. The title track was written by Boo Ray, and its message echoed Caroline’s own hopes for her daughter, and raises the spirits of all who hear it. “Razor Wire” is a bird’s eye view and positive message of visiting her daughter in prison. “Mysterious Wonder” changes everything up with sultry jazz and vivacious lyrics, originally written in a group of 40 students and staff during Aiken’s time teaching children at a music camp in North Carolina. “Cry Wolf” makes no apologies in amping up the rock ‘n roll edge factor, while “Everything Can Change” (lyrics written by Caroline’s daughter at the age of 12) and finds its place among the rest as a stripped down piano number. Start to finish, Broken Wings Heal is brimming with stories, inspiring messages, and lush, beautiful music that provokes joy, hope and honest to the bone introspection.
Since 1969, I have toured, promoted, booked, managed, recorded, manufactured eight CDs and performed on many other artists’ recordings. I’ve participated in many benefit recordings and performances and raised thousands of dollars for children at risk, breast cancer, safe houses, veterans, many more worthy causes. I currently play national and international festivals, college and community radio, theaters, house concerts and concert series in the USA, UK, Denmark, Sweden, Central and South America and Europe. It’s an honor to be entrusted with people’s homes and to be invited into their circle of friends and family while touring and teaching.
I began mentoring the Indigo Girls in 1980, beginning my love of helping people get to the stage with a positive experience. I give workshops called Zen and the Art of Performance, Songwriting In Your Sleep, and Guerilla Guitarsworks. I am president of the Athens Clark County chapter of non profit 501-c-3 “Guitars Not Guns and Guitars Players Against Gun Violence” (www.guitarsnotguns.org). Raising money in order to buy starter guitars for at risk kids, teaching them lessons and telling them that they get to keep their guitars at graduation is a labor of love that fills my heart with joy watching their eager faces. I also teach grownups how to be kids again on the mic, on stage, and in front of an audience. It is a great pleasure to help someone find their voice and release their message.
I was the Entertainment Director of the Atlanta Dogwood Festival in Atlanta, Ga for 12 years; ’93-’05. As a musician for so many years, I then learned what it was like to be a talent buyer. I vowed to take good care of my artists, stage hands, and volunteers. I booked Dave Mason, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi, Chuck Leavell (Rolling Stones, Allman Bros, Eric Clapton), Randall Bramblett, members of B52s (Cindy Wilson), Mavis Staples, Sugarland, Jennifer Nettles, Shawn Mullins, and so many others. Each year, I managed a $150,000 budget, booked and contracted over 100 acts, built and staffed 8 stages (sound, lights, art, signage, logistics of each stage) hired 50 workers, and found in-kind sponsorships of food, hotel rooms, a million dollar tour bus for the green room. I brought in a world class promotions team, reintroduced the high school art competition, and in 2003, raised $600,000 at the stages so that the ADF could buy their office space outright, never having to pay another rent check.
Being a truly independent artist means I have full responsibility of whether something gets done or not. I knew I had to crowdfund or I wouldn’t be able to record. Asking for money and support was awkward and scary, but I knew I must if I was going to put out this next CD with John Keane.
The title song, “Broken Wings Heal” is by Boo Ray, a Nashville songwriter who I first met in Athens, GA in 2008, and fell in love with the vernacular and spirit of this song, which cuts right to the bone, and says everything I need it to say and more. It is a beautiful centerpiece to this recording, which centers around and explores the fall and rise of a loved one.
I’m learning to appreciate every moment, every nuance of life. These songs are stirred and born from that appreciation and from the yearning to be in the moment and deal with life on life’s terms. I’m healing in front of you and I feel naked and exposed. I am creating a new path with every step.
You have reaffirmed my belief that we could all come together on a cosmic level to make a difference. You helped create a new platform that gives us a common language, a compass with which to gauge life, creating a code book in which to communicate. Your contributions have been a life line and have enabled these songs to reach out into the world. Thank you!
Michael Pierce is a beloved artist based in Athens GA with an international reach. I’ve known Michael and his inspired artwork since 1977 in Macon, Georgia. Michael’s art for BROKEN WINGS HEAL focuses on a beautiful golden gilded cage that I found on the side of the road while on tour in Austin Texas, April 2014. It was calling to me, waiting for me. How did it not get picked up before I got there?! With this cage, Michael has created the perfect image depicting the human desire for freedom. His vision has given this CD the beauty and grace that I see every time I look into my daughter’s gorgeous, hopeful, bright and clear eyes.
This CD is dedicated to my daughter, Sarah Page. As an honor student with the highest GPA in her class, she was on a full HOPE scholarship to Georgia State University when she became addicted to heroin. She has been incarcerated for the past seven and a half years for acting out in desperation during the withdrawals. Fortunately no one was hurt and prison saved her life, and my beautiful, smart and sensitive girl returned to me. She has not only recovered but she is thriving. She has taught over 300 women, helping them to obtain their GEDs. Presently, she works hard for her 4.0 GPA in her accredited college courses. She is singing and playing guitar in the traveling choir and participating in the dog program that rehabs pound pups and teaches inmates to be vet assistants. She has begun the Theology program with the prison’s chaplain and in 2017 she will come home. Rising out of the ashes, she flies towards the sun. Broken Wings Heal.
Born in Atlanta, she began performing live in 1968 in a rock band called Fathertime, based in Long Island. It wasn't long before she was busking around the country, honing her craft as a songwriter and developing a remarkable fingerpicking style on her guitar. Bonnie Raitt graced her 1988 LP “Line of Vision” and she's played on stages worldwide with Doc Watson, Jesse Colin Young, John Hartford, David Bromberg, Muddy Waters, Arlo Guthrie, Richie Havens and many more. After re-locating back home to Atlanta in 1986, she's become the heart of the singer/songwriter scene there, inspiring artists like the Indigo Girls and Shawn Mullins, and thrilling audiences everywhere with her riveting stage presence.
On her 9th LP release “Broken Wings Heal,” she continues her streak of superb albums featuring music that ranges in style from folk to rhythm and blues, from ballads to rockers. The album boasts a cast of guest musicians that would turn any artist green with envy, including John Keane (who also produced), Emily Saliers (Indigo Girls), Randall Bramblett (Steve Winwood, Sea Level, Bonnie Raitt), Ike Stubblefield (Motown B3 master), Michelle Malone, Michael Steele (Bangles), Gerry Hansen (Shawn Mullins, Levon Helm), Charlie Wooten (Royal Southern Brotherhood) and others. The album opens with the lovely and inspirational “Mission of Angels,” followed by the tender “Fragile,” and then Aiken kicks it in with the title track, a bluesy number co-written with Atlanta bluesman Boo Ray and Steve Ferrone, formerly of Average White Band and currently drummer for Tom Petty's Heartbreakers. Her R&B sensibilities shine on “Mysterious Wonder” and “Cry Wolf,” destined to become a funk classic. The album wraps with the beautiful “Butler Field,” a moving acoustic piece featuring the aforementioned Emily Saliers providing lovely harmonies both vocally and on guitar.

Regardless of body style, the 2013 BMW 3 Series is an impressively well-rounded and highly desirable entry-level luxury car.
The 2013 BMW 3 Series wagon is fully redesigned, aligning it with the next-generation sedan that debuted last year. Both benefit from now-standard power front seats and a new M Sport equipment line, while "xDrive" all-wheel drive makes its return to the sedan lineup. Meanwhile, the ActiveHybrid3 makes its debut for 2013, offering 28 mpg combined and an eye-popping price.
Last year's introduction of the new BMW 3 Series was a very big deal. In Germany, we imagine parades being held in its honor with blue-and-white checkered flags flapping from windows as men in lederhosen clang steins of Franziskaner together in a foamy exclamation of celebratory revelry. In America, the new 3 Series represents the reinvention of not only the best-selling luxury car in this country but also the most heralded sport sedan of all time. No Bavarian parade, perhaps, but still very much noteworthy.
However, last year's redesign only applied to the 328i and 335i sedan. For the 2013 BMW 3 Series, the wagon model gets the same changes as its conventionally trunked sibling; the coupe and convertible are still unchanged. The new-generation sedan and wagon are larger, but weigh less. The steering is now electrically assisted in an effort to improve fuel efficiency, and unfortunately it's lost a bit of that trademark BMW steering feel in the process. Like all recently introduced BMW models, the 3 Series sedan and wagon get Driving Dynamics Control, which allows the driver to select among four modes that alter throttle response, steering effort and shift patterns of the automatic transmission.
The most noteworthy difference between the newer four-door body styles and the carryover two-doors is under the hood of the 328i. Whereas the coupe and convertible maintain the traditional, naturally aspirated inline-6 engine, the sedan and wagon get a turbocharged four-cylinder that produces more horsepower and achieves 5 mpg more on the EPA combined driving cycle. That's what you call a win-win. Meanwhile, the 335i's turbocharged inline-6 is the same regardless of body style or generation, and it's one of the most invigorating engines in the luxury segment even while nearly matching the four-cylinder's fuel economy.
Unique changes for the 2013 BMW 3 Series Wagon are restricted to the cargo area. The split two-piece liftgate continues, only now the top piece is power-operated. Plus an optional feature allows you to open it simply by swiping a foot under the bumper, which is handy when your hands are full with luggage, groceries, or children.
Less impressive is the 2013 BMW ActiveHybrid3 sedan that also debuts for 2013. As the name suggests, it features a gasoline-electric powertrain to improve both fuel economy and performance. However, based on current fuel costs, it would take about 62 years to pay back the ActiveHybrid's price premium over a similarly equipped 328i. Plus, the hybrid is only a half-second quicker from zero to 60 mph than its turbo-4 sibling, which is hardly what we'd call bang for your buck.
Yet even if the ActiveHybrid3 represents a questionable purchase, every other 2013 BMW 3 Series is worth serious consideration. Strong competitors like the Audi A4 and A5, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti G and Mercedes-Benz C-Class should make your decision much harder. None, however, has the overwhelming variety of the BMW 3 Series.
Every body style starts off as the 328i. The sedan comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, foglights, automatic wipers, cruise control, auto-dimming mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, eight-way power front seats, driver memory functions, leatherette premium vinyl upholstery, a leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, Bluetooth phone connectivity, the iDrive electronics interface and a premium sound system with a CD player, HD radio, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. The wagon, which is only offered as the 328i, differs only in that it adds a power liftgate that allows you to open it simply by swiping your foot under the bumper (keyless entry/ignition is required).
The coupe differs with a sport-tuned suspension and manually adjustable front seats (power-adjustable is an option), while the convertible gets a power-retractable hardtop and 10-way power front seats with memory functions. Both two-door body styles add adaptive xenon headlights and a 60/40-split-folding rear seat.
The 335i sedan and ActiveHybrid3 get unique powertrains, although both come equipped with 18-inch alloy wheels, adaptive and auto-leveling xenon headlights, automatic high beams and a sunroof. The coupe and convertible are similarly equipped, but feature 17-inch wheels instead and lack standard iDrive, the LED running lights and automatic high beams. The convertible adds heat-reflective leather upholstery.
Most of the extra items on certain body styles and trims are available as options on the others. There are many other options available as well, most of which are available both within packages and as stand-alone options. These include larger wheels, an automatic parking system (sedan and wagon only), headlight washers, parking sensors, keyless ignition/entry, an active steering system, heated front seats, heated rear seats (sedan and wagon only), a heated steering wheel, a power rear sunshade (coupe only), the BMW Assist emergency communications system, a navigation system (adds iDrive on coupe and convertible), a head-up display (sedan and wagon only), satellite radio and a Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system.
Finally, the sedan and wagon can be equipped with four optional equipment lines -- Luxury, Modern, Sport and M Sport -- that include different wheel designs, color schemes, trim types, seats, steering wheels and even suspension tuning.
The 328i sedan and wagon are powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-4 that produces 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque. Rear-wheel drive is standard, while xDrive all-wheel drive is optional. A six-speed manual transmission is standard; an eight-speed automatic is optional on the sedan and standard on the wagon. Both transmissions come with an auto stop-start function that turns off the engine when the car stops in order to save fuel. In Edmunds performance testing, a manual-equipped 328i sedan went from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds -- quicker than all its four-cylinder competitors. EPA-estimated fuel economy with the automatic is 23 mpg city/33 mpg highway and 26 mpg combined, while the manual is similar at 22/34/26 mpg. Both are exceptional for the class.
The 328i coupe and convertible get a 3.0-liter inline-6 that produces 230 hp and 200 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel drive and a six-speed manual are standard; a six-speed automatic and all-wheel drive are optional. BMW estimates a manual-equipped coupe will go from zero to 60 mph in 6.2 seconds -- other body style and drivetrain combinations will take a second longer than that. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 18/28/22 mpg for the rear-drive coupe regardless of transmission. The convertible and/or all-wheel drive achieves 1 or 2 mpg less in each EPA driving cycle.
All 335i models regardless of body style get a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder that produces 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. Each body style gets the same transmission and drivetrain choices as their respective 328i versions. BMW estimates a 0-60 time of 5.4 seconds for the sedan, and in Edmunds performance testing the coupe was a little quicker than that. Fuel economy estimates for the 335i sedan are outstanding at 23/33/26 mpg with the automatic and 20/30/23 mpg with the manual. The coupe gets a still solid 19/28/22 mpg with rear-wheel drive and the manual. The automatic and all-wheel drive drop those estimates by 1 or 2 mpg depending on body style.
The 335is has a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder good for 320 hp and 332 lb-ft of torque. There is also a temporary overboost function that bumps max torque up to 370 lb-ft. A six-speed manual transmission is standard, and a seven-speed automated dual-clutch manual known as DCT is optional. In Edmunds performance testing, a manual-equipped 335is coupe went from zero to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Fuel economy with the manual is 18/26/21 mpg and 17/24/19 mpg with DCT.
And finally, there's the ActiveHybrid3. It pairs the 335i's engine to the eight-speed automatic, an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery. All together, it produces 335 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque. Despite this, BMW says it will hit 60 mph in 5.2 seconds -- barely quicker than its cheaper, less powerful sedan siblings. Fuel economy is disappointing, too, returning 25/33/28 mpg. Better than the others, but not by much.
Every 2013 BMW 3 Series comes standard with antilock brakes, traction and stability control, front side airbags and side curtain airbags. The sedan and wagon get front knee airbags. The convertible lacks the side curtain airbags, but the regular front-seat side airbags extend up to head level and there are also pop-up rollover hoops.
The stability control system integrates several features designed to improve braking performance, such as periodically wiping the brake rotors dry when the windshield wipers are in use and automatically snugging the pads to the rotors when the driver abruptly lifts off the throttle. BMW Assist emergency communications is optional and includes automatic crash notification, stolen vehicle recovery and on-demand roadside assistance.
In Edmunds brake testing, a 328i sedan with 18-inch summer tires came to a stop from 60 mph in 115 feet, an average distance for this type of car with summer tires.
In government crash testing, the sedan received five out of five stars for overall crash protection, plus four stars for frontal protection and five for side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the sedan the highest possible rating of "Good" in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests. It received the second-worst rating of "Marginal" in the Institute's new small overlap front crash test, but few cars have been subjected to this test, and a majority received a similar rating or worse.
The cabins of the redesigned 3 Series sedan and wagon get a more contemporary update compared to the two-door body styles, especially around the dash, doors and center console. The newer four-door models come with four choices of equipment lines -- Luxury, Modern, Sport and M Sport. Among other things, these choices change the color scheme and trim type in the cabin. It's a nice touch that allows a greater amount of customization.
BMW's iDrive remains a somewhat complicated electronics interface (it's standard on every four-door and included on two-doors with navigation). At times it can take too many clicks, twists and turns of the control knob to perform certain tasks, but it does provide a wide range of vehicle customization that'll reward an owner willing to park for a bit and learn the ropes.
The base-model seats are comfortable and supportive, while the purpose-built seats of the sport packages are even more so. Materials and build quality within the cabin are exceptional; even the standard leatherette (vinyl) upholstery looks and feels better than one would expect. The convertible's available heat-reflective leather does a wonderful job of keeping posteriors cool.
The backseat of the 3 Series is one of the more spacious in the entry-level luxury segment regardless of body style, and the added overall length of the new four-door models adds even a little more legroom front and rear. Trunk space is average in the coupe, while the wagon offers a maximum cargo capacity of 53 cubic feet -- more than BMW's X1 and basically equal to the Audi Allroad. The convertible offers a reasonable cargo hold when the hardtop is up, but predictably shrinks considerably when the top is lowered. Still, it's possible to store a standard roller suitcase back there or two smaller bags.
With its new turbocharged four-cylinder engine, electrically driven steering, multiple drive settings and all-new chassis, the 2013 BMW 3 Series sedan and wagon provide a slightly different driving experience than that of the carryover two-door cars. The four-doors have a smoother ride, making them superior long-distance cruisers. And while the sedan and wagon still have sharp reflexes, their new steering doesn't offer quite as much feedback as what's provided by the older coupe and convertible. In terms of being exceptionally fun to drive, the BMW 3 Series is no longer a runaway leader for the sport sedan class.
Still, we have no complaints about the 328i sedan's new turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It provides quick acceleration and a healthy boost to fuel economy. Most shoppers will be pretty happy with this engine. But should you want the traditional inline-6 experience, the 335i adds a huge wallop of turbo torque that's always on tap, while the 335is goes a bit further and sounds especially delectable to boot.
July 18 - the Church Committee would like to thank everyone on the island who played a role in both making improvements to the church and in the success of the concert this past year. To everyone who bought a raffle ticket for the church raffle that raised over $4000, or helped renovate and clean the church during the community work party to all of you who bought a ticket or played in the band, our sincere appreciation. The committee is looking at ways to encourage further use of the Church in 2016 and beyond and we have prepared a new brochure as a sales tool to help us in this capacity. Our goal is to have at least one concert, one art event and one religious service. Suggestions are welcome.
July 4 - Our summer potluck supper was well attended with lots of delicious food on the menu. The potluck raised $330. We traditionally donate proceeds from this potluck to a local charity, and this year it was decided to make a donation to the Pictou West Food Bank. Thanks to all who participated in this annual event.
A structure is currently in the process of being built to house the island hearse, which is culturally significant to our local history. The hearse was previously stored in a shed, and the new structure will do a much better job of displaying and protecting this important piece of our heritage.
In 2014 a new line of Pictou Island merchandise was released and sold at the local community centre. This included t-shirts, hoodies, hats, calendars, posters, cards, and more. Much of the merchandise, such as the cards photographed below, was oriented around the Pictou Island quilt that was recently completed by island women. Sales went incredibly well, earning a profit of $1874 by the end of the summer. All remaining goods are available for purchase at the Pictou Island market next to the wharf, and cards are being sold at the community centre.
The Pictou Island South Lighthouse will soon be coming under the ownership of PICA as part of the Dispersal of Surplus Lighthouses from under the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act. This process is now almost complete after three years of forms and procedures - the lighthouse should finish changing hands by mid October. It will be maintained as is with a grant from the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act.
Vixen DeVille (Cat LaCohie) of Vixen DeVille Revealed at the Lounge Theatre, June 17, 2018. (Photos by Monique A. LeBleu)
Although Vixen DeVille aka Cat LaCohie is sexy, warm, welcoming, energetic and embarrassingly gifted in a wide variety of talents, she is also self-deprecating, tough-as-nails, and incredibly funny.
Winner of the 2018 Best International, Soaring Solo Artist and Encore Awards, as well as Nominated for Best of Cabaret & Variety, at the Hollywood Fringe Festival, LaCohie’s show “Vixen DeVille Revealed” is first and foremost definitely an adult show. But it’s also immensely entertaining, comical, and even educational, with occasional moments of heartbreaking truth.
Assisted with a “kitten” and audience participants, Vixen DeVille, combines glass walking, fire-eating, magic, aerial, video, comedy, body confidence, truth and burlesque into a mind-blowingly sexy-fun show. Continue reading →
Movies Till Dawn: The Saturday Morning Strange – “Godmonster of Indian Flats” (1973) Posted on July 7, 2018 by Paul Gaita
The irresistible force paradox – which asks us to consider what happens if an unstoppable object collides with an irresistible force – is put to the test in this bizarre hybrid of science fiction, experimental film and underground comedy. Virginia City, Nevada is the proving ground, and the forces in question are the town’s despotic mayor (exploitation veteran Stuart Lancaster), who fends off an Eastern investor by framing his representative for murder (of the sheriff’s dog), and a mutated sheep embryo, which grows, thanks to a local scientist (E. Kerrigan Prescott) and his dizzy assistant (Karen Ingenthron), into a colossal, awkward-looking and occasionally flatulent barnyard monstrosity. These elements eventually come together after much discussion about the town’s history, mystic seers, and endless scientific babble, with the expected explosive results, though that is probably the only thing about “Godmonster of Indian Flats” that viewers will see coming.
Fritzie Zimmer’s ‘What’s Left of Me’ Leaves Nothing to be Desired (or to the Imagination) all the While Leaving the Audience Wanting More! Posted on July 6, 2018 by Jennifer K. Hugus
OMG !– and all hail the “Fritzie Zimmer What’s Left of Me Show” starring Sam Pancake and Steven Wishnoff as Fritzie and Giacomo respectively; centering around the life and times of none other than Fritzie Zimmer the “World’s oldest openly gay stand up comedian” at “87 years fun”!!! Performing in a theatre described by Zimmer as “decorated like Bruce Villanche’s Womb”, Fritzie and his hearty ivory tickling (and quite possibly tickling something else under the ivories) sidekick Giacomo Schwartz, take us sidelong, headlong, and directly up the inseam of Fritzie’s sordid yet silly lifelong career!
Reminiscing hits, flops and near misses of appearances, voiceovers and cameos revolving around the likes of Peanuts Specials entitled Pigpen Takes a Bath, a short-lived sitcom surrounding the life of teenage girl gymnasts: Lickity Splitz, to speak nothing of Ding Dong Avenue the networks’ answer to Sesame Street, That’s not a Pickle, That’s my Finger, and of course all varying and sundry game shows on which Fritzie appeared: Puzzle Junkies, Pobody’s Nerfect (of the adult spelling bee variety), Bait and Snitch and the one and only exclusive to Florida, Gator in a Box, the showy-to-silent duo of Zimmer and Schwartz will keep you in rhinestone-studded stitches!!!

Get ‘Buzz’d’ and Splooshed in Hollywood at the Studio/Stage Posted on July 6, 2018 by Monique A. LeBleu
“Buzz’d Out! Live” at the Studio/Stage for the Hollywood Fringe Festival, June 10, 2018. Photo by Monique A. LeBleu
For fans of trivia games, games shows, colorful game show hosts, and perhaps even “splooshing” enthusiasts, “Buzz’d Out! Live!” at the Studio/Stage in Hollywood is definitely for you!
Although a family show, this immersive show is geared towards adult participants who willingly—if not enthusiastically—set themselves up for getting splashed on, dumped out, puddinged and generally “creamed” with an assortment of food and non-food related items in a competition that pits fours contestants against each other in a battle of wits, gooey projectiles, and/or other physical challenges.
With just a team of six, headed by co-creators Ben Benjamins and Roe Moore, Buzz’d Out! Live! is loaded with high production value set, props, and video animation, high tech lighting and sound, some well-hidden low tech, along with low brow splashing, sploshing, dumping, and spraying that makes for some pretty awesome high comedy.

The Troubadour Presents: Randy Bachman – Every Song Tells A Story Posted on July 6, 2018 by Ivor Levene
Coming up in just a few weeks, Canadian legend Randy Bachman will be appearing at one of Los Angeles’ most venerable and intimate clubs, The Troubadour on Saturday, July 21, 2018.
Bachman, who founded The Guess Who in 1965 and Bachman Turner Overdrive in 1972 will be performing hits from The Guess Who, Bachman Turner Overdrive, and other solo material. I can’t think of a more perfect setting for Randy, as The Troubadour has seen its share of star power for decades.
Hailed as one of Los Angeles’ most prized clubs, The Troubadour was the place that Elton John, Joni Mitchell, The Byrds, Neil Young, and James Taylor all made their U.S. debuts, and that was just in the 1960’s. This is the place where Cheech and Chong were discovered by Lou Adler, and Janis Joplin played her last gig. Even Led Zeppelin have performed here. Can you even imagine that? I can!
Bachman, in addition to his success with The Guess Who, also founded his second super-group, Bachman Turner Overdrive (BTO) shortly after leaving The Guess Who in the early 1970’s. His current repertoire is filled with classics from both bands, music from his latest tribute album to George Harrison, “By George By Randy”, and some of the best guitar playing this side of the U.S./Canadian border.
I’ve heard that Randy also regales his audiences with stories and memories from his early days, so this isn’t just another show, it’s an intimate look back at his past. When you combine that with his unique style of guitar playing, you’re going to be in for a great show. If you’re here in Los Angeles, you don’t want to miss this one. I surely won’t!
Tickets for the show can be obtained here at ticketfly. More information on Randy can be found at randybachman.com
Reviewed: The Rolling Stones – From The Vault: No Security – San Jose 1999 Posted on July 5, 2018 by Ivor Levene
Reviewing a Stones concert film can either be a very hard thing to do, or it can be very easy. In my case, it’s definitely the latter. Not because I find no fault in their performance, but because I do, and I like it. After having been to countless Rolling Stones shows, the most recent four weeks ago, I can honestly watch these Stones films and differentiate between them, kind of like a connoisseur of fine wines. And we all know that wine and The Stones get better with age, but it’s always nice to have a look back. Perhaps it is hard after all, reviewing what’s essentially the same set list, but finding the things that make this film stand out. There’s plenty to go on there. I want desperately to be critical as so many others are but let’s face it, The Stones defy criticism in the face of age and adversity.
It’s funny to watch this film now and think “how young the Stones looked back then”, when back then, all most people did was make jokes about their age and wondered when they were going to call it quits. You can certainly see the difference in this film. Keith is animated and completely fluid, Charlie plays hard and fast, and the slide guitars meander from both Keith and Ronnie’s hands, back, forth, and back again. The film was shot in 1999 in San Jose and it was the first time the band had played there since 1965, so the local fans were hungry.
The music Prince made with the Revolution from roughly 1982 to 1987 is some of the most innovative, beloved and popular music ever produced. The band is now back in action, paying tribute to its creator and giving new life to its old material on stage. And there’s still a lot of life in that music, at witnessed by the band’s ability to transform a huge crowd into a single, boogieing mass.
Following a powerful and emotional performance on the Arroyo Seco’s Sycamore stage, keyboardist “Dr.” Matt Fink of the Revolution took a few minutes to talk with the LA Beat about what he’s been doing lately, who he’s been doing it with, and the pleasures of playing Prince music to young festival crowds.
That was a really exciting show today. I know you play a variety of different situations, do you approach a festival gig like this any different from the way you approach a headlining show where the whole crowd is there to see you?
We don’t really approach it differently, but normally the sets are a bit shorter. You know, we usually play for 90 minutes, maybe an hour-forty, and today was a fifty minute set. So you have to create a new set list for it.
What are some of the things you get into that we didn’t get to hear today, in case we have a chance to see you down the road?
We’re doing a song called “All Day All Night”, which was released on the Purple Rain special edition, that came out last year but (prior to that) unreleased, never really been out before. And we’re doing a couple more album tracks off of Around The World In A Day, you know, a few other things. Songs that weren’t hits but are deep cuts off of records. Continue reading →
Reggae On the Mountain – A Perfect Way to Celebrate Music & Summer Posted on July 4, 2018 by Joan Alperin
Even before I moved to Topanga Canyon some five years ago, I would always make it a point to attend the annual Reggae On The Mountain Festival. Besides being a nature paradise, Topanga is bursting with musical history. This festival, in my opinion, is one of the best. This is the ninth year that the festival is being put on by Label 27, happening Saturday, July 14, 2018 and Sunday, July 15, 2018 from 11 AM until- 8 PM, giving us two days of incredible music from international stars and heavy-hitting local bands.

‘Sweet Charity’ Brings Back the Reprise Company–and it’s Only the Beginning of the Fun Posted on July 3, 2018 by Joan Alperin
Reprise is back and now christened Reprise 2.0. The company, which presents musicals that are either lesser known or rarely revived locally, is producing a three-show season at its former home, UCLA’S Freud Playhouse in West Los Angeles
The inaugural show, “Sweet Charity,” starring the incredible Laura Bell Bundy (Broadway’s ‘Legally Blonde), directed and choreographed by three-time Tony winner Kathleen Marshall was absolutely incredible.
If this is any indicator of the type of shows they put on, Reprise will certainly do very well. Next on their agenda is “Victor/Victoria” directed by Richard Israel and choreographed by John Todd. The cast hasn’t been set yet, but it runs September 5-16, 2018. Continue reading →

Some people have been saying that they don’t feel patriotic this year. But I don’t see this holiday being about politics. it’s a day for barbecuing with your family, going to parades and blowing shit up. My only real problem with Independence Day is that horrible patriotic music. Especially Sousa. John Philip Sousa’s marches makes me crazy. As a result, I try to seek out places that aren’t advertising something like “A Salute to America” or “A Patriotic Jubilee.” For those of you who get off on that stuff, there is still plenty to be found in this holiday roundup.
The Dodger Stadium’s fireworks are one of the great Los Angeles traditions. If you don’t have a friend who lives in the hills overlooking Chavez Ravine, you can see them inside the stadium and catch an all-American baseball game too for as little as 25 bucks, including a special T-shirt. The cheap seats are going fast, though. The Dodgers will play the Pittsburgh Pirates at 6:10 p.m. This is the one game where you should not leave during the 7th inning. Stay late for the fantastic fireworks show. It is sponsored by the presented by 99 Cents Only Stores so let’s hope they aren’t weird off-brand fireworks. Tip: Leave an ice chest full of drinks and snacks in the car to enjoy while sitting in the inevitable traffic getting out of there.

Last night, I had a dream that I was back in school, tutoring the actress who played Loonette on YTV's The Big Comfy Couch after the end of class. "Algebra means running math backwards. You see a letter on one side of the equal sign, and you do the opposite of what's being done to the letter. For example, if x + 5 = 7, do the opposite of plus 5 on both sides, and you end up with x = 2." The trouble is that I couldn't get her name right (and no, it wasn't "Alyson Court" in the dream or even "Clarissa Quimby"; it was something like Tyra with a double-barreled last name), so I ended up just calling her Loonette.
But now there's another clown on TV, and his name is Billo. Let's hope he can do the math better than freshmen at City University of New York.
As of GNOME Games 2.29, the GNOME Games project has renamed Gnometris to "Quadrapassel" to distance it from the Tetris trademark. At the same time, Same GNOME became Swell Foop because "GNOME" in app titles has become deprecated anyway. I guess nobody told them about Quadra.
In other news, Ubuntu 9.10, a popular GNU/Linux operating system distribution based on Debian, is out now.
People accuse me of building most of my portfolio from clones of commercial falling block puzzle games. But each clone has a specific purpose derived from a particular disappointment with one of these games. I made one game because MS-DOS was dying, and I was disappointed with Windows' inability to run Tetripz correctly. I ported it to GBA after feeling how laggy the GBA port of Tetris Worlds was. (Little did I know at the time that the lag I felt was due in part to other growing problems in the Tetris franchise, such as the broken infinite spin mechanic.) I made Luminesweeper because I was disappointed with Q Entertainment's choice of Sony's PSP, a new and expensive handheld system, as the exclusive platform for a falling block game. I made another falling block game for two reasons: to demonstrate how The Tetris Company was destroying what some felt to be the challenge of the game and to fix Tetris DS's lack of specialized training modes.
But now I'm disappointed in Nintendo's attempt to block individual developers from pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps. I ranted on this earlier, but since then, Nintendo released Wii Menu 4.2, the first update to specifically attack homebrew rather than illegally copied commercial games. The cat-and-mouse game on the Wii isn't quite as intense as Sony's was in the first years of the PSP, but Nintendo's intent is clear: only corporations established in the mainstream video game industry are allowed to develop for its hardware.
Even apart from the persecution of homebrew, the rise of HDTV has made PC platforms (Windows and Mac OS X) start to look more attractive. Virtually all new LCD TVs sold in major United States retail chains have inputs for VGA and HDMI signals from computers. I understand that a lot of people don't know about this, which is why I've written Cable finder, a guide explaining how to connect your PC and your TV.
I'm tired of game consoles. They have three advantages over a typical PC: small size (as opposed to a typical ATX mid-tower), compatibility with standard-definition TVs (as opposed to PCs with only a VGA port, which need an HDTV), and a guarantee of sufficient graphics performance (as opposed to Intel GMA). These allow for multiplayer with one console and one large monitor, which is cheaper than four PCs and four smaller monitors. But their big disadvantage is overhead on the developer's side. Console makers such as Nintendo expect developers to have a "secure office" and "industry experience", but a team of part-time developers with day jobs outside the video game industry is unlikely to have the cash to lease an office or to take internships with a major video game developer in another state. So instead, I bought a Mac mini: it's roughly the size of a Wii, Apple sells an SDTV adapter, and it has NVIDIA graphics.
I'm also tired of having to put up with legal threats. I've put my falling block game in a code freeze until I feel like converting it into a more general engine that can cover other falling block game types like Dr. Mario, Columns, and Puyo Pop. That might not come very soon because I'm working on other projects.
Here's a new video that should have no chance of tripping anybody's copyradar: Little Red Riding Hood. It's an outdoor game that I invented based on a story collected in 1697 by Charles Perrault.
Caffeine, who ran TetrisConcept.com, got tired of running a forum. So he moved the wiki to Wikia and shut down the forum. Members of the community have started a temporary successor forum.
On Thursday, June 11, a YouTube representative finally got around to switching the protest video back on, a total of 21 business days after the counter-notification was filed. The trouble is that U.S. law specifies that a video is supposed to go back up 10 to 14 business days after that, not 21.
Google celebrated the 25th birthday of Tetris today with a custom logo on the Google Search page. In June 1984, Alexey Pajitnov completed his first prototype of the video game Tetris on an Elektronika 60, a Russian clone of Digital's PDP-11 minicomputer. Fans of computing history may recognize the PDP-11 as the platform on which Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie first developed the Unix operating system. Since then, both Unix and Tetris have been cloned numerous times, just as the PDP-11 was. Tetris Zone can run on Mac OS X, which is based on Darwin, a clone of Unix. The Linux operating system, used by Tetris Friends and by Tetris Zone's web site, is also a clone of Unix. In fact, the IEEE publishes an international standard called POSIX that tells exactly what a Unix clone should look like.
Where did the name "Tetris" come from? Vadim Gerasimov, who ported Pajitnov's prototype to the PC, described it as a portmanteau of "tetromino" and "tennis". Tetromino itself is a portmanteau of Greek tetra-, meaning four, and "domino". "Tennis" comes from French tenez meaning "take", short for "take heed that I am serving the ball". Tenez itself comes from Latin teneō, meaning "I hold", whose infinitive form is tenēre. And like most Latin words, teneō is derived from a Proto-Indo-European root, the same root word that produced English "thin" (like an I piece) and the Greek word tetanos, or "tetanus", or "lockjaw", which calls to mind L and J shaped pieces just as "Tetris" calls to mind the T.
You may have seen the NES, GBA, and DS sections on this web site and wondered why I haven't tried developing for Wii. Wonder no more: I'm starting to like the PC better than homebrew.
Pygame is a set of code modules designed for programming video games for the PC in the Python programming language. It wraps the SDL library so that games made with Pygame can work on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Popular video games made with Pygame include Pydance, Frets on Fire, and Galcon.
Numerous people have used Pygame to develop puzzle games. But unfortunately, the developers of some falling block games appear to lack imagination in the naming department.
A falling block game called Gnometris is part of the GNOME desktop environment. Canonical Ltd. distributes Gnometris, along with the rest of GNOME, as part of the Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. Likewise, Novell distributes Gnometris as part of the openSUSE project.
LTris is another falling block game. It comes as part of the operating system loaded onto ASUS Eee PC subnotebook computers, which is based on Xandros Desktop.
GNOME and LTris are is distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GNU GPL is one of many free software licenses that grant the user the freedom to change the software and to share it with their neighbors, including selling copies, without breaking copyright law. Other widely used free software licenses include the Apache License, the Mozilla Public License, the MIT License, and the new BSD License.
A lot of programs distributed as free software are "clones", or replacements for proprietary software that perform the same function. You may have already used OpenOffice.org (compare to Microsoft Office), GIMP (compare to Paint Shop Pro or Photoshop Elements), Mozilla Firefox (compare to Internet Explorer), Pidgin (compare to AOL Instant Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, and mIRC), VLC media player (compare to Windows Media Player), or any of several others. Because copyright does not cover functionality or menu structure, these free applications present a reasonably familiar user experience, allowing users to learn them quickly. In fact, users of Microsoft Office 2003 have found OpenOffice.org easier to learn than Microsoft Office 2007.
Arika, publisher of Tetris the Grand Master, is spraying DMCA takedown notices for videos of falling block games across YouTube again. But this time, Arika got YouTube to take down a video of a falling block game that isn't a direct imitation of any Arika product, and even a video criticizing Arika's practices, which should be textbook fair use. So to be safe, I've put development of falling block games on hiatus until the situation becomes clearer.
My dream last night became a nightmare when I ended up trying to express the idea of "free software" in Toki Pona. I could get the "free" part (roughly "any person can give or change this"), but Toki Pona, a very Eloi-ish language, doesn't fit well for describing the Morlock concept of "software".
I'm not Catholic, but I did make a bet with the Lord that I could lose eight pounds (3.6 kg) between Ash Wednesday (February 25, 2009, the first day of Lent) and Good Friday (April 10, 2009) by limiting myself to 1500 calories (6300 kJ) of food per day. The first two weeks went fine, but then I lost the willpower to diet. I resumed my old eating habits and gained some of the weight back. But two weeks later, I came down with a spell of dry coughing fits and off-and-on fevers up to 103.1 degrees F (39.5 degrees C). It all ended around Good Friday. In fact, I think the Lord might have let me get sick for a reason: I lost all the weight that I had set out to lose.

So you’ve decided to start your own business. If you are like many other first-time entrepreneurs, you want to build the next Google. Or the next Apple. You want to walk into a coffee shop and see everyone is using your product. You might even want to “make a dent in the universe”. There is nothing wrong about this. This is usually the most long-lasting motivation for entrepreneurs when things go bad and one has to continue fighting. However, if you start out wanting to do nothing less than taking on the whole world, chances are you will be disappointed. There is no direct path to “change the world”.
In this article, you will find a 3-step approach to build a startup. It might be quite different from the “go big or go home” stories you’ve heard or read. It might seem too humble and not exciting enough, but it’s much easier for start a company this way.
Ramen profitable means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders’ living expenses. This is a different form of profitability than startups have traditionally aimed for. Traditional profitability means a big bet is finally paying off, whereas the main importance of ramen profitability is that it buys you time.”
It basically means your company is producing something people want and you are paid enough to make a living off that. It’s not the final destination yet but this is a crucial step. Once you reach this milestone, you suddenly become indestructible. It doesn’t mean you have a perfect product yet. But at least you have an infinite run way to fine tune your offering or try a different plan.
If you get to Ramen profitable, you should celebrate this by adding an extra egg to your Ramen! This might be a tiny step if you compare yourself to a company like IBM or Microsoft. You may be surprised that you’re already better than 90% of all startups, which close shops in the first year of operation. You have chosen a market, manage to get enough funding to build the idea into a real product and have people found it useful enough to pay for it. (If the people who is paying doesn’t even know you, go get another egg for your Ramen please. )
Achieving Ramen profitable does not mean you should stick with the same idea. Many companies pivoted into a new direction which eventually make their name there. Take Microsoft as an example. It was founded in 1975 to sell a special version of Basic interpreter called Altair Basic. But Bill Gates didn’t stop there. 5 years later, Microsoft moved into the operation system market and released DOS and then Windows, two core products that helped to grow itself into a billion dollar company. The essence here is as you reached this stage, you will have a better understanding of the market. You will be in a much better position to take on new opportunities when it emerges.
Step 2: own a niche. Become the number one in a market. It’s more important to be the number one in a small market than a number two in a bigger one. We are living in a “big is better” world so this might sound crazy. Who haven’t read about Facebook’s IPO and secretly wish he could be one of those 1,000 fresh minted millionaires. However, it may surprise you that usually a smaller market is actually a lot easier to conquer. Dave McClure has an excellent short article talks about “niche to win” strategy:
Most startups think they have to be AWESOME to succeed. Actually, this is quite far from the truth – in fact, you can be incredibly mediocre and still be quite successful. The secret is to find your Niche – that is, the initial customer segmentation / product differentiation combo that enables you to beat your more established, mature competition with a much crappier product.
Besides the segmentation and differentiation, you need to own a niche market to get the time and resources to build a team, to hone your marketing messages, to establish your distribution channels and turn your technology into a product. Your technology might work for a small group of early adopters who are willing to play with latest tech, but the main stream market requires much refined off-the-shelf product.
There is a gap between the early adopters and the rest of the market. A premature expansion usually sinks the company by burning too fast too early. When it really should carefully fine tune its offering and use its resources frugally. This idea is best explained by “Crossing the Chasm”, one of the best book on marketing and selling high tech product to mainstream market.
Step 3: bowling into adjacent markets. Geoffrey A. Moore, the author who wrote the Chasm book, explains the next step in his other book called “Inside Tornado”. The basic idea is once you dominate one niche, the next thing is to expand into adjacent markets. Just like playing bowling, you don’t try to knock down all the pins at once. Instead, you hit the first one at the right angel, then let the ball as well as the first pin to take down the 2nd and the 3rd; then all these pins will help to spread the force and take the rests.

Two exciting groups combine in this evening of music from the German Baroque, particularly the great Heinrich Schütz and his Musikalische Exequien (1636.)
Vicars Choral have performed the past two years, delighting audiences with looks at rare sacred music from the Renaissance.
The Early Music Festival has enjoyed past performances by students at CCM’s Early Music Lab, especially the harpsichord, lute, and viol students. This year the voice students take a turn. The newly-formed Collegium Vocale includes both undergraduates and upper degree students exploring the truth that regular Festival attendees already know: small-scale chamber choirs are where it’s at.
The Catacoustic Consort presents a variety of vocal and instrumental music from Renaissance chamber music to Baroque opera, with the intent of recreating the sound of the music when it was originally composed.
The music is performed on period instruments such as the viola da gamba, theorbo, organ, harpsichord, Baroque guitar, and lute. In addition to a historically informed approach to performing music, Catacoustic is dedicated to approaching music with an understanding of the life and times when it was originally played, including informed humanities presentations to accompany its programs. Some favorite composers of early music include J.S. Bach, John Dowland, Marain Marais, and Claudio Monteverdi.
The Catacoustic Consort is also dedicated to the early music community in the greater Cincinnati area. To this end, it provides a rental program of early instruments; offers an annual grant for instruments, training, or early music education; and sponsors the annual Cincinnati Early Music Festival, which celebrates local musicians engaged in the performance of early music. Catacoustic is also committed to outreach to senior citizens.
Based in historic East Walnut Hills (Cincinnati), Ohio, Catacoustic serves the tri-state area. The Catacoustic Consort is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

This is the card I made for the little Dutch baby boy. I used the same Pink Gem Image – Igloo Bears – and coloured it with Promarkers and Copics. The papers, the wooden star and the gems are from my stash. The die cut is Stars Semicircle by Marianne Designs, the small stars are punched and I have glittered them all with Stickles Frosted Lace and Glamour Dust. Again I’ve dotted liquid pearls around the image and the sentiment is computer generated.

One of my aims for 2015 is to begin catching up on all the reading I’ve neglected for, well, the majority of my life. So, I started by googling several combinations of ‘books to read before you die,’ ‘100 most important books,’ and so on. I discovered that quite a few reputable (and a few not so reputable) sources have published such a list. Nice, but it still leaves me at a loss for what to do next. Which list do I go with?
After carefully reading through what was on offer I decided to take the collective wisdom from the various sources by painstakingly comparing (Well, I hired ‘Vi’ from Vietnam via Elance to painstakingly compare) all of the lists to determine how much overlap existed between them. I used this information to create a new list of the top books based on the number of times the book appeared as one of the list’s recommendations. The more the book was referred to by the lists, the more the experts agreed, and the more securely that book’s place became in my new and improved books-to-read-before-you-die list.
And now for the books. Surprisingly enough, there were 520 books from the 8 lists, which meant there was less overlap than I expected. 65 of the books were pretty straightforward as they were mentioned at least 3 times (with The Great Gatsby and Catch-22 being the only 2 making it on all 8 lists). To make up the remaining 45 books, since my list had to be 100 books long, I simply needed to choose those books that made it onto at least 2 lists. Unfortunately, 91 books were on at least two lists. So, I decided to further cull those 91 by focusing on the books that were mentioned at least twice by The Guardian, Amazon, Harvard, Time and The Telegraph. That left me with the right number of books and, voila, the greatest list ever created now lives. Lucky for me most are available on Audible ❤. Enjoy!
That’s it. I’m pretty busy so plan on getting through most of these usingAudible — I highly recommend giving it a try (they’re currently giving 2 audio books away FREE).
Feel free to drop me a line if you think I’ve missed anything or if you’d like the spreadsheet with all 500+ books listed on it.
The current procedure for causes of beatification and canonization can be found in the Apostolic Constitution Divinus Perfectionis Magister promulgated by Pope John Paul II in 1983. The various stages leading to canonization are as follows:
The process begins at the diocesan level after at least five years have passed since the death of the candidate. Usually, the bishop of the diocese in which the candidate died is responsible for beginning the investigation after he receives a request from the faithful through the postulator, generally a priest who presents a plea for a beatification or canonization. In response, the bishop forms a diocesan tribunal for this purpose once the nihil obstat (a decree that no impediment exists that would prevent the investigation) of the Holy See is obtained.
The tribunal calls witnesses to recount concrete facts concerning the candidate’s exercise of Christian virtues considered heroic, i.e. the theological virtues (faith, hope and charity), the cardinal virtues (prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude), and other virtues specific to the candidate’s state in life. Additionally, all documents regarding the candidate must be gathered for review. At this point the candidate is entitled to the title of Servant of God.
When enough information has been gathered, the congregation will recommend to the pope that he make a proclamation of the Servant of God’s heroic virtue. From this point the one is referred to by the title of Venerable. A Venerable is not given a feast day, no churches may be built in his or her honor, and the church has made no statement on the person’s probable or certain presence in heaven. With that said, prayer cards and other materials may be printed to encourage the faithful to pray for a miracle wrought by his or her intercession as a sign of God’s will that the person be canonized.
The investigation is then passed on to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. A summary report, or the Positio, is prepared that proves the heroic exercise of virtue. The report undergoes an examination by nine theologians who give their vote. If the majority of the theologians are in favor, the cause is passed on for examination by cardinals and bishops who are members of the Congregation. If their judgment is favorable, the Prefect of the Congregation presents the results of the entire investigation to the Holy Father, who gives his approval and authorizes the Congregation to draft the relative decree of beatification. The public reading and promulgation of the decree of beatification grants the candidate the title of Blessed.
Beatification is the permission to venerate the candidate within a limited sphere. Typically, it means that the person can be venerated by a particular region or group of people for whom the person holds special importance. In other words, it is not universally binding to the entire Church.
If the candidate was not a martyr but rather a confessor who died peacefully after a life of heroic virtue, a miracle attributed to the Servant of God verified after his or her death is necessary. The miracle must be proven through another canonical investigation in a procedure that is comparable with that required for heroic virtues. If the investigation comes to a satisfactory conclusion, a second decree is promulgated that with the decree on heroic virtue grants the candidate the title of Blessed.
In order for the Blessed to be canonized and acquire the title of Saint, another miracle is required. This miracle must be attributable to the intercession of the Blessed and must have occurred after his or her beatification. The miracle is verified according to the same methods used during the beatification stage.
Once conferred, the title of Saint indicates that the person lived a holy life, is in heaven enjoying the Beatific Vision, and is to be honored by the universal Church. Saints may be publicly invoked and mentioned officially in the liturgy of the Church, especially in the Litany of the Saints. The Saint is assigned a feast day which may be celebrated anywhere within the Catholic Church, although it may or may not appear on the general calendar or local calendars as an obligatory feast. Churches may also be built in his or her honor.
Beautifully rendered and brilliantly edited, The Grown Ups is an impressively informative and utterly compassionate glimpse into the lives of Down syndrome adults who are, at age 40-something, stuck in a school environment that 'normal' society deems safe, but they know to be quite limiting. Filmmaker Maite Alberdi's rapport with her subjects allows them to voice their innermost longings and admirable aspirations. Their engaging story is a mixture of heartache and humor, and hope for greater understanding of people with Down syndrome – or, for that matter, anyone whose perceptions and abilities are different from 'the norm' For these reasons, we select The Grown-Ups to receive the 2016 IDFA AWFJ EDA Award for Best Female-Directed Documentary. Alberdi won her first AWFJ EDA Award at IDFA in 2014, and we look forward to seeing many more extraordinary films from this wonderful young woman director.
For almost their whole life a group of friends 40 year olds have been classmates. They have passed all their grades and now don’t want to continue complying with school obligations. They outlive their parents and they are aware that they have been in school longer than most teachers and they are sick and tired of being students.
They are grownups and they want to be treated as grownups. They always believe that when their parents died, they would be able to do everything they weren´t allowed before, like living on their own, driving, hanging out, having sex, being parents, getting married, and having a real job. But things are not changing for them, they have Down Syndrome and they have to deal with the frustration of living as if they were still ten years old, but they are almost fifty.
''Maite Alberdi's sensitive, good-humored study of Down's Syndrome adults expresses anger against the system with a light touch.''
''... a fascinating parade of strong characters – feisty Anita, entrepreneurial Ricardo, suave Andres, and Rita, “smarter than your average bear” ­ each confronting a series of touching challenges as Alberdi looks at lives lived under never­ending restraint.''
Maite Alberdi's sensitive, good-humored study of Down's Syndrome adults expresses anger against the system with a light touch.
Film title translations may vary considerably from region to region, but rarely do they contradict each other entirely. Branded “The Grown-Ups” for the international festival circuit, Chilean documentarian Maite Alberdi’s third feature goes by “Los niños” (“The Children”) on its home turf. Either way, the title is laced with irony, since this gently stirring, empathetic study of middle-aged students at a school for Down’s Syndrome children shows them to be stuck in a tragic state of limbo: Mature enough to want the pressures and privileges of independent adulthood, yet emotionally and financially ill-equipped to pursue them alone, they’re ultimately failed by a system that treats them as homogeneously disabled. Though Alberdi’s short, audience-friendly film offers plenty of sweetness and light observational humor, the sad anger of its message still burns through; international distribution, particularly on VOD platforms, is quite feasible.
“Who are we? Conscious adults,” the film’s four principal subjects recite as a constant mantra at the group therapy sessions arranged for them by the school — a statement of defiance that, however kindly encouraged by their supervisors, only they appear to fully believe. Aided by the clean, no-nonsense clarity of Menno Boerema and Juan Eduardo Murillo’s editing, “The Grown-Ups” works swiftly to differentiate between the strong individuals in this quartet, who spend most of their time training and working in the school’s catering department — yet not toward any identified qualification or reward.
The most immediately charismatic of the four is Anita, a bright, self-confident woman yearning to begin a new life free of her parents’ constant, unyielding guardianship and the numbing routine of the kitchen — strictures which, however well-intended, are beginning to have an effect more oppressive than protective. Her exasperation is emboldened into vocal self-assertion by an increasingly tender romance with the gentlemanly Andres, a fellow Down’s Syndrome classmate who appears to understand her emotional needs better than her elders; together, they dream of marrying and raising a family. (Through adoption, Anita is quick to clarify, explaining that she is past menopause; that she recognizes such practicalities amid otherwise far-fetched idealism is illustrative of her unusual, intermediate stage of personal development.) Together, the two plan their wedding with poignant excitement, even going so far as to shop for rings, with a critical legal cloud hanging over them: In Chile, adults are forbidden from marrying if they are judged to have the mental maturity of a minor.
Who gets to make that call, and by what criteria, is the question Alberdi invites audiences to consider, or reconsider: The longer we spend in the company of these people, the clearer it seems that they should be treated on a case-by-case basis. Anita and Andres, for example, are more high-functioning and less outwardly child-like than Rita, an endearingly exuberant but fragile 45-year-old with a limited mastery of physical boundaries and a penchant for Barbie dolls. At more or less the opposite end of the spectrum is the sensible, studious Ricardo, voted the group’s class president, who holds a part-time job as a carer at an old-age home and is eager to save money for a self-sufficient future. The disparity between his needs in the latter department and his pocket-money income, once revealed, is heartbreaking; among other matters, the film tacitly calls for employment reform for those with learning difficulties.
As the dominant arc of Andres and Anita’s relationship hits complications beyond their control, “The Grown-Ups” veers into outright tear-jerker territory, though not at the expense of its emotional authenticity. Several intimate or wholly joyous set-pieces — the chaste lovers’ first bedroom encounter, for example, or a surprise birthday-cake dance routine — both brighten the tone and, more crucially, give the subjects added nuance and definition. They are finally treated as equal, many-shaded personalities, not just passive, victimized case studies. Pablo Valdes’s airy, unobstrusive lensing often counters their darker mood swings with the pastel party-balloon shades that dominate their environment, visually emphasizing a world that tries to mollify their anger. Perhaps Miguel Miranda and Jose Miguel Tabar’s perkily whimsical score was similarly intended, yet it’s the film’s chief misstep, with tip-toeing piano strains that risk infantilizing these grown-ups along with everyone else around them.
Life of Pi, All is Lost, Dead Calm, Cast Away; all are stunning films, each with the sea as their subject. Nonetheless, they all deal with 'the will to survive', as emphasized in their trailers.HOW TO MEET A MERMAID, by contrast, deals with 'the will to die', which exists alongside the former and triumphs over it on occasion. Just as with survival, this will to perish requires its own share of courage and strength of will. My protagonists have made their choice; for Lex and Rebecca, grim determination takes them past death's doorstep, whereas Miguel rushes headlong into a desperate adventure, as thousands upon thousands of illegal immigrants are doing at this very moment.
"To me, all human behavior is unpredictable, and considering man's frailty in the ramshackle universe he functions in, it's all irrational. It couldn't be very rational because this universe is not a very rational one, it seems to me" - William Faulkner, Nobel-prize winning American writer. HOW TO MEET A MERMAID, we hear the echo of Faulkner's words, leaning over a lectern back in 1958. Having decided to put aside his beloved bourbon for a minute, he treats his audience to dissemination on our human struggle through a crackling microphone. I am a great fan of Faulkner, and the fifty-year old recordings I've uncovered provide the motivations of Lex, Rebecca, and Miguel with a sense of perspective. The Faulkner quote stated above has served as the foundation for this film. In HOW TO MEET A MERMAID, we are hurled down onto earth by the universe, as portrayed in the stunning opening shots of the film: at times, in a paradise we no longer recognise as such; sometimes, in hell, and then there are times when there is nothing to it but to figure it out for yourself. Lex, Rebecca, and Miguel all reside in their respective paradises that have become a hell to them. Loneliness amidst thousands of fellow human beings (Rebecca on her Disney cruise), alone among friends (Lex at the diving resort) or Miguel (teaching surfing classes to tourists who are blissfully unaware of the fact that he uses his surfboard for purposes other than fun: an escape from destitute poverty and a gateway to that other paradise, America, his way barred by a fence.)
It appears as if I have produced a trilogy on the human struggle, without ever realising that the subject harbors my deepest fascination: how do we keep going? In retrospect, this trilogy started out with First Kill (2001): am I personally capable of killing a human being? Bloody Mondays & Strawberry Pies (2008) addresses the question of how to live without getting killed either by your job or by boredom. And now, HOW TO MEET A MERMAID, on the battle to remain alive.
With HOW TO MEET A MERMAID I stand up for the glorious beauty of our existence. This is a film about courage, doubt, difficult decisions, the lure of the sea, and the splendor of life in its occasional ineptitude at dissuading us from acts of recklessness. In the closing shot of the film, a footprint set in the concrete of a sun-drenched sidewalk, I join Faulkner by sharing in his vision: "I have great faith in man.”

Slots Plus offers over 80 slot games (as the name suggests) plus a handful of table games, video poker, and scratchcards. Altogether, there are around 120 games for you to enjoy. One of the leading names in casino software is Realtime Gaming (RTG) and that is the developer of choice for this site. Founded in 1998, RTG is one of the most popular choices because it offers state of the art graphics and cinematic audio quality for its games.
When you sign up to play at this site, you can access this dynamic game collection via the downloadable desktop client or instantly on your mobile device or internet browser.
The table games offered at this site were our favorite. They might not be the traditional top-pick as many only players prefer slots, but the versions of Blackjack, Roulette, and Craps provided the best graphics and ease of play.
Honestly, these games are so smooth that they don’t even seem like a video version. The true to life sounds only enhance the experience of these traditional casino games.
What is your favorite game theme? Whether you are looking for pirates treasure, prefer the nature theme of Builder Beaver, or want to step back in time and win big with Cleopatra – you will find it here. Each slot game offers a unique theme and flash animation that is hard to ignore.
In addition to a handful of jackpot slot games with pots over $1,000,000 – each game gives you bonuses and special features to enhance the experience. These different features include bonus rounds, bet multipliers, secret games, and free spins.
What can we say about the video poker selection? It is pretty standard, right down to the graphics. You will find the classic options like Deuce’s Wild, Joker Poker, and Double Double Bonus Poker among the mix. With each of these games, you can play 1 to 52 hands. The variants of the games give you over 50 different options. Our favorite is Pyramid Poker and its special pay table.
As for other available games, video bingo, keno, and scratchcards help Slots Plus offer a little of everything and give players the chance to win some easy cash fast.
Slots Plus carries the Central Dispute Systems (CDS) logo on its homepage. This company is one of two that test the site for payout fairness and random number generation within the games. The second company is Gaming Laboratories International.
GLI is the premier testing facility in this market and has maintained an outstanding record for customer service and the best reputation for a company of its kind. Each month GLI tests those gaming platforms – like Realtime Gaming – which are registered with them and gives their seal of approval.
For the last 10 years, Slots Plus has been steadily growing in the online casino market. The site lacks some of the more modern features like live dealer games, but it still promises players a quality experience from the start. Our research into the background of this site yielded no negative comments or complaints – just a strong, positive reputation.
This site is owned and operated by Panama-based Main Street Vegas Group which launched in 1999. The company has less than half of a dozen online casinos – all of which have positive feedback from users.
During peak hours, the live chat wait was less than five minutes and the help staff was able to quickly identify our problem and resolve it.
While there is no record of customer allegations for this company, that is not to say that they cannot happen. If you need to file a complaint about this company, visit www.CentralDisputeSystem.com and enter the information to launch a formal investigation into the matter.
US-players may not have the best online gambling options, but they certainly have a variety of sites which can give them the complete experience from their home. Slots Plus is one that we recommend to anyone who favors RTG games and deposit bonuses with minimal rules.
It is free to sign up for membership and you can play some of the games without making a deposit. However, if you want to get the full effect, make your first deposit of $25 or more and start wagering on your favorite casino games.
Slots Plus is truly very basic in terms of online casinos. It doesn’t have the same “wow” factor of bigger brand names but it is known for consistently paying customers and offering easy resolution to problems. Albeit, the payout approval time frame can be long but, if you know that going on, then it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle for you.
Overall, we enjoyed our time spent at this site and encourage US-players to get started today with the 400% deposit match bonus eligible on all slots games.

Hockey Notícias - Scoresway - Liverpool´s defensive improvement has hurt attack – Klopp - Results, fixtures, tables and statistics
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp accepts a greater focus on defending has impacted his team's attack this season.
Klopp's men are unbeaten in eight Premier League games, but their attack is yet to reach the same heights as 2017-18.
With 15, Liverpool are equal fifth for goals scored, however, they have conceded just three – a league-best alongside Manchester City.
Klopp said a change in approach had contributed to those numbers, but believes his team are still creating enough.
"We want to be stronger defensively but we didn't say that means we don't have that much interest in offensive things," the German told UK newspapers.
"You put the focus a bit more on something and immediately you lose a bit of the fluency in something else.
"But we have created enough chances, it's just that we didn't score. It's not that we've had no chances, it's just that we didn't use them like we used them in the best period of last season.
"I am completely fine with that. We have already had good results and scored goals but it's obvious that we can improve. We need to keep the stability - no doubt about that."
Liverpool have also made adjustments to their pressing this season, with it occurring less often higher up the pitch.
But Klopp, whose team visit Huddersfield Town on Saturday, said that was purely down to the approach of opponents.
"It's more the case that teams don't usually play against us. They overplay our pressing with long balls, which makes sense," he said.
"In a lot of games our counter-press has been really good, which is much more important in terms of losing the ball and winning it back.
"In terms of the high press, it depends on the style of play of the other team. You can't do it if they don't play. It's not that we don't want to do it any more. If they play then we should be there."
Cooper Kupp went down midway through the fourth quarter on a non-contact play against the Seahawks and a torn ACL has been confirmed.

South Africa’s gas industry is on the cusp of great growth and expansion in light of a potential global oversupply of shale gas. Locally, the Department of Energy has confirmed the potential development of regional gas-fields, which will lead to natural gas becoming a more important fuel in South Africa.
With the availability of natural gas in neighbouring countries, such as Mozambique and Namibia, and the discovery of offshore gas reserves in South Africa, the gas industry in South Africa is set to undergo rapid expansion.
“In view of these developments, local plastic pipe manufacturers have to ensure that the pipes used in gas pipelines, have been manufactured according to stringent specifications and adhere to global standards,” says Jan Venter, Chief Executive Officer of the Southern African Plastic Pipe Manufacturers Association (SAPPMA.) This non-profit association represents more than 80% of the plastic pipe produced in South Africa and focuses its efforts on ensuring pipe systems that are correctly designed, leak-free and durable for long- term use, including the rehabilitation of old pipelines.
Natural gas is a clean-burning, more affordable and more secure source of fuel and is increasingly being looked at as an alternative source of energy for both domestic and industrial use. It burns cleaner than any other fossil fuel, emitting up to 70% less carbon dioxide (CO2) than coal in electricity generation. A modern gas-fired power plant is also 40% more efficient than a coal-fired. Developing South Africa’s gas pipelines is expected to unlock significant socioeconomic and environmental benefits for the country.
According to Venter, pipes made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) are widely used for the distribution of natural gas as they have a well-documented inertness to both the external soil environment and to natural gas.
“Extensive testing has taken place over the last 45 years, confirming time and again that the long-term strength of plastic pipes are unaffected by natural gas and its common constituents – making them the ideal material to use in gas pipelines,” Venter said.
Venter has first-hand knowledge of the potential challenges of a pipeline and why it is crucial to ensure that the materials used are up to the task, as he was involved in installing the first gas pipeline in Mozambique using HDPE pipe. An 865km cross-border, natural gas pipeline was later installed from the Temane gas fields in Mozambique to Sasol's synfuels plant at Secunda in the early 2000, also using HDPE pipe.
“Like water pipelines, gas pipelines are a long-term investment in infrastructure and the pipes and fittings used are therefore required to last in excess of 100 years. HDPE pipes offer numerous benefits for gas pipe installations, such as being lightweight and easy to handle, easy to join, available in a range of sizes and pressure ratings and have low frictional resistance, with hydraulic properties that remain virtually unchanged over its useful life, resulting in lower energy use and pumping costs,” he explains. Pipes ranging between 20mm to 630mm (as per SANS 4437) are generally used in gas pipelines.
One of the biggest dangers of gas pipe lines, however, is the risk of Rapid Crack Propagation (RCP) - a rare but significant catastrophic pipe failure that results in a rapidly progressing crack (typically >300 ft/sec) when a pressurized pipeline is subjected to a sudden or intense impact. RCP can also be the result of a pre-existing flaw or crack in the pipe and can occur in most piping materials including steel and PVC pipes.
“RCP is a concern in piping systems that are used to convey compressed gasses due to the fact that the rapid energy dissipation from a compressed gas provides the energy required to sustain crack growth,” Venter explains. For this reason, pipes bearing the SAPPMA mark are regularly tested to ensure that they meet and exceed industry standards.
SAPPMA has also recently formed a specific task team, headed up George Diliyannis (‎Technical Support Engineer at Safripol,) who has been tasked with the specific focus of investigating the requirements of the current specification, compiling a guiding document and as an industry body, ultimately ensuring high standards of pipe manufacture and installation when it comes to gas installations.
Concludes Diliyannis, “The gas industry is fast growing and SAPPMA recognises that it has a responsibility in this regard. South Africa has adopted the latest proven ISO standards for gas pipelines made from HDPE. These standards cover materials, manufacturing, installation and testing. Specifiers and users should ensure that South Africa’s gas pipelines are manufactured and installed according to SANS 4437:2014 in order to ensure long term operational safety and pipeline integrity. Gas pipelines will increasingly become an important part of the country’s infrastructure. Extended working lifetimes and uninterrupted supply of gas are therefore essential and will only happen if the pipes and the pipelines are prime quality.”

for the Kolmogorov widths $d_s(A_K^D)$ of the compact set in C(K) consisting of all analytic functions in D with moduli not exceeding 1 in D, τ(K,D) being the condenser pluricapacity of K with respect to D.
For any given positive integer k, and any set A of nonnegative integers, let $r_{1,k}(A,n)$ denote the number of solutions of the equation n = a₁ + ka₂ with a₁,a₂ ∈ A. We prove that if k,l are multiplicatively independent integers, i.e., log k/log l is irrational, then there does not exist any set A ⊆ ℕ such that both $r_{1,k}(A,n) = r_{1,k}(ℕ ∖ A,n)$ and $r_{1,l}(A,n) = r_{1,l}(ℕ ∖ A,n)$ hold for all n ≥ n₀. We also pose a conjecture and two problems for further research.
We prove that a biseparating map between spaces of vector-valued continuous functions is usually automatically continuous. However, we also discuss special cases when this is not true.

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky House members working on the next state budget have been unable to find money to restore cuts to higher education that the governor proposed, House Speaker Greg Stumbo said.
In January, as part of his two-year state spending plan, the Gov. Steve Beshear included a proposed a 2.5 percent cut in operating funds for universities and community and technical colleges in the first year of the budget cycle.
As House members have worked on their version of the budget, they have “desperately tried to find a way to restore that money,” Stumbo, D-Prestonsburg, told reporters. “Unfortunately, there are not funds available, as best we can tell.”
The proposed spending cuts would be the latest endured by Kentucky’s public higher education system. If they go through, colleges and universities will have lost 17 percent of their funding since 2008.
The House Appropriations and Revenue Committee has been reviewing Beshear’s spending proposals for weeks.
The budget that passes the Democratic-led House is expected to resemble the Democratic governor’s recommendations.
Senate President Robert Stivers said he has some questions about how the universities handle their finances. He said tuition increases at universities have outpaced the rise in their fixed costs.
“There’s not a lot of correlation there, and I have a real question why they do that,” the Manchester Republican said.
As the starting point in the budget work, Beshear presented a $20.3 billion state spending plan for the two years starting July 1.
The governor proposed an extra $189 million over current funding for the state’s main funding formula for K-12 classrooms.
He also proposed pay raises for teachers and other school employees, and recommended spending $36 million over two years to expand preschool services to serve an estimated 5,125 more 4-year-olds.
He targeted more funding for textbooks, staff development, extended school services and school safety.
As promised, Beshear found extra money for Kentucky’s elementary and secondary education system by recommending $98.6 million in spending cuts.
Meanwhile, Stumbo predicted the House will move ahead with Beshear’s recommendations on capital projects, which would be welcomed by the universities and colleges. Beshear proposed about $520 million in state General Fund bonds to finance a range of university projects. His proposal also included giving universities the authority to issue more than $700 million in agency bonds, which the universities would pay back themselves.
Stumbo expressed support for another proposal to finance a flurry of construction on community college campuses.
Beshear proposed issuing $145.5 million in agency bonds to pay for up to 75 percent of the construction projects. The remaining costs would be covered by local communities where projects occur, as well as other public or private sources, he said.
Stumbo called community colleges the “best bang for the buck” in higher education and said those schools “need some sort of definitive building program to meet their needs.”

It’s already near-impossible to find a new computer that doesn’t have Vista already installed on it. As I’ve noted here, hardware driver compatibility can be a bumpy road. That’s the bad news. The good news is, application compatibility for Windows Vista is often not as big an issue. Music notation software, for instance, largely works, with a couple of additional notes regarding installation and registration.
Both Finale and Sibelius (and various other tools from SmartMusic and Sibelius for education) are listed as “compatible” with Vista. There’s even a promised update specific to Vista from Finale for the summer. The only hitch is User Account Control (UAC) for software like Sibelius under Vista. Fortunately, disabling UAC isn’t so bad.
As a quick recap, some applications may actually perform more smoothly under Vista. Cakewalk SONAR, for instance, has robust support for the new WaveRT audio system (if you have a PCI audio card that supports it) and MMCSS scheduling. Be aware, though, that those marginal improvements can be quickly erased by driver issues elsewhere in the system, which have a tendency to domino when it comes to both stability and performance.
We could debate this all day, so I’ll just say this: there are still a number of cases where you would “downgrade” (upgrade?) a new Vista computer to XP, even if it means ponying up for a boxed copy of XP, and as with any major OS update on any platform, I wouldn’t even think of installing without a backup and rollback plan to the previous OS. If you can, test on a dual-boot system; it’ll make uninstalling easier.

Description Published photograph of Dr. Armand John deRosset III. Dr. deRosset III (1807-1897) was one in a long line of doctors in the deRosset family. He graduated from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in 1824 with his A.B. degree and received his M.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1828. He was a Director of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad Company. In 1852 Dr. deRosset, along with other civic minded individuals, helped incorporate Oakdale Cemetery, and he became the first president of the cemetery company. Oakdale was chartered as the city cemetery of Wilmington from 1852 until 1901. It was the 5th largest landscaped cemetery in America during this time period. Sadly, the first burial in Oakdale was his daughter, 6-year-old Annie. The deRosset home, built in 1841, still stands at 23 South Second Street.

In the final bite size post around the latest UKCSI from the July results, we’re going to look at the use of and satisfaction with both digital and traditional channel preferences from a customer perspective and some of the key takeaways for organisational learning.
Just over a third (36%) of all customer experience take place through a digital channel (web, email, chat, text, app or social media) with the remaining 64% through traditional channels (face to face, phone or writing). Satisfaction between digital and traditional is broadly similar, 77.8 for digital and 78.5 for traditional.
However, there are more notable differences when looking across sectors. Out of 13 sectors, only Utilities and Tourism show over 50% digital channel preference by customers (52.9% and 66.3% respectively). The least digitally adopted customer experience sectors are Retail (Food) at 16.6%, Public services local at 17%, national at 21.8% and Leisure at 18.5%.
Digital continues to be both an opportunity and a challenge for public services with the ongoing cost pressures they face whilst trying to maintain and improve the customer experience. Demographics within a local authority, access to the internet and the complexity of individual circumstances continue to be barriers in service transformation that we at Custerian see directly with public sector clients. Optimised, blended solutions supported by efficient and effective processes, delivered through engaged employees seem to be the way forward.
One key takeaway around channel is that preference doesn’t necessarily lead to higher satisfaction and that customers use channel for different purposes.
Digital takes preference for enquiries with 21.6% of customers versus 12.9% traditional channels but with lower levels of satisfaction for digital (74.1 vs. 77.7).
For purchase, traditional trumps digital at 46.8% versus 39.4%, however here digital has marginally higher customer satisfaction levels (80.3 vs. 80.1).
Whilst the general perception is that digital is dominated by youth, the real usage of the channel is more broadly spread.
Interestingly, when you look into digital channel usage by gender, women use email as a higher usage channel than men (9.9% vs. 6.7%) and use it 53.6% of the time when making an enquiry vs. only 30.6% by men.
However again, channel preference doesn’t guarantee satisfaction. Despite the higher adoption of email use by women, they’re less satisfied when compared to men which bucks the overall trend as women are generally more satisfied than men.
The final key takeaway is that there definitely seems to be different strategies within organisations to a digital vs. traditional channel approach from the results. However what is clear is the need for consistency across channels in terms of customer experiences, allowing customers their preference of choice.
This closes out our series of 3 mini blogs on the July ’17 UKCSI results. We’ll continue to keep a keen eye on the numbers as we progress through what could economically and politically be a very disruptive remaining 6 months of 2017, not to mention the continued expansion of digital and technology advances and adoption, which if delivered well by organisations should create better, more integrated and friction less customer experience. Here’s to progress!

73% of Karachi’s NA-243 polling stations are handicap inaccessible – Coalition for Election and Democracy
Around 73% of the polling stations in NA-243, which falls in District East, are inaccessible to persons with disabilities, revealed a survey conducted by the Pakistan Alliance for Inclusive Elections (PAIE), a network of disabled persons’ organisations working in the country.
These numbers are alarming, considering the Election Comission of Pakistan’s (ECP) five-year strategic plan, which was to be implemented before the July 2018 general elections, included polling station accessibility. Pakistan’s largest city will now face the same issue in the upcoming by-elections on October 14.
Civil society organisations have demanded the ECP take immediate steps to make all polling stations accessible to persons with disabilities.
There are a total 216 polling stations in this constituency with 402,731 registered voters, of whom 211,510 are male and 191,221 female. The number of persons with disabilities registered as voters in this constituency is unclear.
The survey results depict that maximum polling stations fail to meet one or more mandatory criteria lacking, water, sanitation, proper ventilation and ramps. “With minor alterations, the issues can be resolved,” the survey found.
Sharing the findings of the survey, Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) Senior Advocacy Officer Fatimah Shah said, “The purpose of this audit was to present reliable data before stakeholders regarding accessibility in elections and to generate debate on the concerns of persons with disabilities.”
This issue becomes more important in the current scenario as the ECP failed to resolve the accessibility problem before the general elections this year and now, the by-elections are approaching with 73% polling stations still inaccessible for persons with disabilities in an urban constituency of Karachi – the economic hub of Pakistan.
CPDI Senior Programme Manager Raja Shoaib Akbar, who has supervised the survey, stated that 30% polling stations did not have a firm and obstacle-free passage leading to the building while 67% buildings did not provide a level access to the entrance of the polling station. He said persons with disabilities cannot go inside these buildings using wheelchairs as they only have stairs and no ramps. Even the ground floor of the buildings is inaccessible.
Moreover, 80% of the polling stations do not have a ramp to facilitate voters on wheelchairs. In 27% of the cases, protruding objects outside the polling stations pose a challenge on the way, Akbar shared.
According to international standards, polling station gates must be wide enough to facilitates voters with disabilities. However, the survey revealed that smaller pedestrian gates pose several problems. Firstly, the gates are not enough wide enough, secondly, the iron bar below the gate is always thicker than the maximum threshold standard of 6mm. Lastly, the threshold of the gates is generally two to three inches above the ground causing another hindrance. The ECP should direct its staff to facilitate persons with disabilities by opening the larger gates as this would ease some of the discomfort.
The survey further revealed that no low slope ramps or other facilities were observed at these buildings for facilitation of persons with disabilities.
Poor lighting posed another impediment for persons with reduced visibility. Also, only 57% of polling stations possessed exterior lighting arrangements, leaving the entrance of 43% sampled polling stations in the dark at the time of closing of the stations and display of results by the presiding officer.
The report suggested that slight changes can make these inaccessible buildings more persons-with-disabilities-friendly, such as construction of small ramps at the entrance and inside the building, leveling of pathways in front of the polling stations and removal of protruding objects from the pathways and interior of the building.
Despite many attempts, contact with the provincial election commissioner could not be established. However, the provincial spokesperson for the election commission said, “It is the job of the returning officer to look into the matter.” The returning officer of NA 243 neither attended his phone nor responded to text messages.

This was in the Bishops Boardroom at the ACK Garden House headquarters Nairobi,in which fourteen out of twenty eight dioceses then were represented.
It was realized that as early as 1985, a number of Dioceses had a form of Diocesan Men’s Associations, which existed under names such as Fathers Union or Men’s Association.
Such associations did not have any coordination at the Provincial level like the Mothers’ Union (MU).
A number of meetings were held in 2000 and 2001 at the Provincial level to establish the Provincial KAMA and formulate the constitution to manage it.
The Provincial KAMA received the recognition and blessing of the Provincial Synod in July 2001. By that time, nearly every Diocese had established KAMA.
The Diocese of All Saints Cathedral was created after the sub division of the Diocese of Nairobi on 1st September, 2002.
After the creation of All Saints Cathedral Diocese, a meeting was held on 16th October, 2002. This was to establish and put in place the mechanism to run the association and elect the Interim Diocesan executive committee.
Mr. Fredrick Kimathi was appointed the Interim diocesan KAMA coordinator. Work started by recruiting new members to join KAMA and on 27th September 2003. The first commissioning and inauguration was done at St. Francis Karen by the Archbishop of Kenya and Bishop of All Saints Cathedral Diocese then the Most Rev. Benjamin Nzimbi.
Our present Archbishop and Bishop of All Saints Cathedral Diocese the Most Rev. Dr. Eliud Wabukala is doing what it takes to encourage and motivate our Diocesan KAMA.
The week that the St. Peter’s day falls into becomes the KAMA week culminating with a climax on the Sunday of the same week.
KAMA members are involved in the physical and spiritual development of their families, parishes, congregations and diocese together with other Christians.
2. To help its members to grow in spirit, mind and body, and be natured in faith for every good work.
5. To encourage members to undertake acts of Christian service for the distressed, disadvantaged and the disabled.
8. To encourage Anglican lay men and women to play positive roles as Christians in political, social and economic life of the nation.
10. To promote Christian fellowship, love and unity in the Church and society, and to promote spiritual enthusiasm among members.

Population ageing and globalisation represent two of the most radical and far reaching social transformations that have occurred since the middle of the last century. This book provides, for the first time, an accessible overview of how they interact. Ageing has been conventionally framed within the boundaries of nation states, yet demographic changes, transmigration, financial globalization and the global media have rendered this perspective problematic. This book critically applies theories of globalisation, notably Appadurai’s model of the landscapes of global modernity, to gerontology. In so doing the books aims to assess the impact of globalization on the experiences and expectations of ageing and later life. Drawing on data from a wide range of studies, the book explores the state of the health, financial circumstances, identity and sense of belonging of the world’s older population. The key argument presented in the book is that, although we are witnessing the decline of the nation-state as the dominant spatial unit through which to understand ageing and later life we are yet to witness the emergence of a global spatial order. The book concludes by arguing that the economic, political and cultural co-ordinates of later life have become increasingly located in a series of overlapping spatial logics encompassing the local, the national, the regional and the global.

Gorman-Rupp is rightly known throughout Iowa and Nebraska (and all over the world) for self-priming pumps -- as rightly they should be, having not only invented the breed in the 20th Century, but also having developed it into a true powerhouse modern design in the 21st. But for as much as we'd like all pumping applications to be appropriate for a suction-lift pump (making it possible to handle all pump maintenance and operation safely above-ground in the fresh air), there are plenty of applications where a self-priming pump unfortunately can't be made to fit.
Recognizing that need -- and seeing a gap in the market for a submersible wastewater pump to safely handle a 3" spherical solid -- Gorman-Rupp is today introducing the Infinity SF series of submersible solids-handling pumps. This is the production the company has been promoting under the "Blue Octo" campaign -- and for good reason: The motor portion of the pump assembly is in fact shaped like an octagon. This unique design not only looks different, it performs differently as well. One advantage is that the Infinity series can be operated as a dry-pit submersible pump without a cooling jacket. The cooling jackets used on many other dry-pit submersibles circulate the liquid being pumped around the motor in order to provide a cooling effect. That cooling effect, however, both reduces the pump's efficiency and introduces lots of dirty liquid to the region surrounding the motor. The Infinity series submersible pump, by entirely doing away with the cooling jacket, similarly does away entirely with those problems.
And as they say in the television commercials: Wait! There's more! Like Gorman-Rupp's self-priming pumps, the Infinity series submersible pumps are designed and manufactured in Mansfield, Ohio. These are "Made in the USA" pumps, qualified for projects requiring American-made products -- and proof positive that high-technology manufacturing is still alive and well in the United States of America.
These new pumps are on display at Gorman-Rupp's booth at WEFTEC 2010 in New Orleans, today through Wednesday, and they will be available for application design immediately. Please feel free to contact us with your questions.

The Iowa Assembly has set the stage for an epic battle-to-the-metaphoric-death between the state’s elderly population and the up-and-coming elected power mongers. Fearing the Elders may usurp their power, Iowa Lawmakers approved a bill changing the state’s Department of Elderly Affairs (DEA), not to be confused with the fed’s Drug Enforcement Agency, to the Department of Aging – or more aptly Dead on Arrival (DOA).
Recently appointed Head of D.O.A., Will T. Corpse, moves into new office in State Coroner's basement
Despite the age-old prophecy espoused by the Blind Prophet, Iowametheus, that one day a group of power-hungry legislators, armed with a deadly acronym, will rise up and destroy the Elders, the latter refuses to relinquish their walkers and allow their power to be usurped.
Masking their true intentions, Des Moines Democrat Rep. Janet Petersen, 38, claimed that the move was needed, because some people don’t like the word “elderly.”

So I am thinking that the price of the game is appropriate for the unprecedented people at the current price

Base money supply of $2 trillion ("printed money") pales in comparison to the $38 trillion in private debt and the $11 trillion lost in the credit/housing bust.
Frequent contributor Harun I. recently made a comment which highlighted the futility of "printing money" to compensate for deleveraging and credit/asset destruction.
Harun referenced this chart from one of Mish's most compelling entries: Bernanke Wants to End Bank Reserve Requirements Completely: Does it Matter?
With only 3.8% real money backing all the debt out there ($T in cash and $52T in debt), it would not take much to drain the system of physical money, and then what? To think of this another way, if 3.8% of the debt out there was paid in full and no lending took place, all existing real money would vanish and a whole lot of people would be holding the bag.
This is the dark side of leverage. And, this is why deflation is so feared. And this is why, in a deflation, cash is king (because it becomes scarce). As highly levered as the system is, the Fed could run the presses night and day and not make a dent.
Let's take just the private (non-governmental) debt of $38 trillion. So base money supply is $2 trillion, and the Federal Reserve "printed" another $2 trillion to buy $1.4 trillion U.S. mortgages (since no private investor was insane enough to do so) because otherwise there would be no market for U.S. mortgages. The Fed also pushed a couple hundred billion into goosing the stock markets via "providing liquidity" to "too big to fail" banks. (Private lending remains moribund.)
Now take a look at this chart I prepared from Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data of the 2000-2008 period: the 2000 stock market bust and the housing bubble's inflation and deflation.
1. As the housing bubble ramped up in the Greenspan "super-low interest rates" era, the dot-com stock market implosion of 2000-2002 erased a mere $1.6 trillion from household net worth (from $42.5T in 2000 to $40.9T in 2002).
2. From 2002 to 2007, household net worth rose by a dizzying $23 trillion. No wonder everyone felt flush; the "wealth effect" from real estate doubling or even tripling was unprecedented, and rising stock and bond markets added a few trillion as well.
3. As households added almost $2 trillion in net liabilities annually in 2005 and 2006, household savings went to near-zero or even negative. This was the result of the bubble-era mantra that "my house is my ATM cash machine, my savings account and my retirement." Indeed, trees can grow to the sky, and then up into the stratosphere....
4. A staggering $11 trillion in household net worth was lost from 2007 to 2008, and as housing has continued to fall, albeit at more modest rates, even as the stock market has "recovered" much of its 2008 losses, we can guesstimate that the losses are roughly unchanged in 2010.
5. As mortgage debt went negative in 2008, the savings rate skyrocketed. Few people seem to ponder the consequences of the U.S. household deleveraging on this scale, or the scale of this wealth destruction. Where U.S. households were borrowing and spending 10-15% of the U.S. GDP every year ($12-$13T GDP, $1.1T to $1.9T in net new liabilities each year), now they are borrowing essentially zero and actually paying down their mortgages (the natural result of making principal payments if one doesn't take on more debt).
To make matters "worse" for a "consumer" economy based on leveraging every last dollar into new debt/credit, households pulled $470 billion out of the leveraging/credit game in 2008 and socked it away as savings. While that's good for banks attempting to recapitalize, it's bad for banks and businesses which depend on households taking that $470 billion and leveraging that into trillions in new debt/spending.
Let's say the Fed "printed" $10 trillion and threw it into the economy. That doesn't quite replace the $11T in wealth which was destroyed in the "global financial crisis"/credit-housing bust of 2008. It is less than half the increase in net worth households experienced from 2002-2007, and it is less than half the expansion of debt in the entire U.S. economy, which doubled from $25T in 2000 to $52T in 2008.
I predict there is another $11 trillion in losses already in the pipeline. Here's a quick rundown of household wealth:
$33T in financial assets, of which $11T is equities (stock market) and the balance in bonds and other liquid business assets
The housing market has another 30% decline baked in as values retrace to pre-bubble levels, so that's another $4-$5 trillion in wealth destruction ahead.
The stock market is at least 30% overvalued as it is "high" on global Central State deficit spending and an illusory "global recovery" created by that State spending, so reckon another $3-$4T in coming losses there.
As interest rates rise then existing long-term bonds will face stupendous losses in their market value, so let's estimate another $4-$5 trillion.
A glut of overcapacity globally will force the liquidation of many business assets which will be rendered effectively worthless (surplus factories, etc.), so let's reckon another $4T in losses in fixed and liquid business assets.
Oops, that's $15 trillion in losses. Even if I've overestimated a bit, that's still around $10-$12 trillion more in losses ahead, or a return to 2002 levels of $40T in net household worth.
If debt hadn't doubled since 2002, then that slide back down might not be so painful. But all that "free money" was leveraged into more debt.
So even if the Fed "prints" another $2 trillion, or $4 trillion or $6 trillion, that number is overwhelmed by the credit/debt/wealth that is being destroyed by deleveraging.
You want to create inflation? Then print $10 trillion and distribute it to the bottom 90% of U.S. households who collectively own a mere 7% of the nation's financial wealth. That might do it, but I'm not so sure even that would do much.
Households' "belief in the system has faded," to use a Survival+ phrase, meaning their belief in the current "prosperity" based on exponential credit expansion, governance by Financial power Elites partnered with a parasitic Savior State, and the status quo idea that "housing and stock markets are coming back, buy and hold for the long term," etc.
As I have noted before in When Belief in the System Fades, Stock Market Version (March 26, 2010), the American public is staying away from this "global stock market rally" in droves.
U.S. households are staying out of stocks, paying down debt and saving cash. That reflects their actionable belief system. They are rejecting the status quo's desperate pleas to borrow more, spend more and leverage themselves to the hilt once again.
Most pundits seriously underestimate the global overcapacity in manufactured goods. If Americans want another 10 million cars, 10 million sofas, 10 million TVs, or whatever other good you can name, China, the EU, Asia and the U.S. have so much overcapacity that any spurt of demand, no matter how gargantuan, could be met quite easily by production facilities that are already in place and currently idle.
So even if you print $10 trillion and give it away, people will use it to pay down debt and bolster savings; if you doubt this, please re-examine the chart above. Whatever goods they do buy will not rise in price because global overcapacity exceeds any possible spurt in demand.
Lastly, let's ask a question which is rarely ever asked: is buying more surplus consumer crap really the kind of "growth" we want or the kind that is sustainable?The second the consumer item moves off the lot or out of the store it immediately loses much of its value; due to massive overcapacity, "new" will be abundant and cheap until Peak Oil disrupts the entire global trade flow. Mercantilist economies like Japan, Chuna, and Germany (despite lip-service to "domestic demand") are like sharks: they either grow their exports or they die, just as sharks must swim forward or they expire.
Spending $10 trillion on more superfluous, rapidly depreciating consumer crap is actually a massive malinvestment, a stupendous diversion of capital from truly needed infrastructure and debt deleveraging.
But we all know the Fed isn't going to print $10 trillion and give it to U.S. households; it will print trillions and give it away to banks, in a futile attempt to recapitalize insolvent, fraudulent firms which should be forced into bankruptcy. The trillions of "free money" (courtesy of ZIRP, zero interest rate policy) will sit in the banks where it will fund speculations in stocks, bonds, commodities and foreign exchange. A trivial sum will be lent to insolvent consumers with much ballyhoo, and the consequences of deleveraging shoved forward one more election cycle (extend and pretend).
Those who expect this policy to create inflation will be disappointed; there is simply no way that this policy can create inflation, nor can it reinstill households' belief in the exponential credit expansion system.

Stephanie Maxwell will replace Peter Daut on WSOC's (Channel 9) morning newscasts beginning in January, news director Julie Szulczewski announced Tuesday.
Maxwell, a graduate of UNC Chapel Hill, has spent the last five years at the ABC affiliate in Jackson, Miss. Earlier in her career, she was an anchor and reporter in Greenville, S.C., and New Bern. Maxwell is a native of Cincinnati and grew up in Atlanta.
Hermes Press has begun the task of reprinting, in chronological order, the comic book tales of The Phantom. With two volumes of Gold Key issues, and a volume of King issues already released, we come to the first of several Charlton volumes.
This volume , The Charlton Years: Volume One, contains art mostly by Jim Aparo, but also includes a story each by Frank McLaughlin, Pat Boyette, and Bill Lignante. The scripts are largely written by Dick Wood, with an exception of a tale by Bill Harris.There is also an introduction by Christopher Irving, while providing some nice background information, it doesn't really expound on much more than any Charlton/Phantom fan would already know.
A few discrepancies occur within the book,most notably the attribution of Steve Skeates as the writer for the story "The Phantom's Death" in issue #33. I personally asked Steve about this story not long ago and he had this to say: "My name has somehow been connected with The Phantom for some time now! The thing is, I never did write a Phantom story!....much as I would have liked to!". Perhaps this is an oversight that Hermes Press can correct with later pressings.
The book itself is a sturdy hardcover, with a dust sleeve. The full color cover of the actual book is the same image as the jacket (the cover of issue #38)--a nice touch that's a bit different than many other collections that tend to leave the binding a single color with just the title printed on it.The pages are printed on a nice slick/glossy paper stock.
Weighing in at a hefty 224 pages, the volume covers Charlton's first foray into the adventures of The Phantom, reprinting their first issue (#30) and continues up to issue #38, for a total of nine issues (sans any text stories and non-Phantom back up stories.)
The cover reproductions have been modified to omit the Charlton logo,price boxes, comics code, and any other extraneous items, leaving just the art and Phantom logo.
As with many reprint volumes of this type, digital color corrections have been made, and depending on your view of such things it either deters or adds to the reprint. In this case, the corrections can be jarring (although not entirely unwelcome) at times due to the original printings on Charlton's sub-par presses. An example:
There is very little in the way of "extras" in this book, but there are 10 pages of original art reproduced, and that's always a plus.
With a cover price of $49.99, the book seems a bit expensive, but with a little digging around you can find a new copy for much less. I was able to find a new/mint copy for around $25 on Amazon--a price much better suited to my wallet.
These are on my radar, but money limitations make me wince when I see them. Alas, eventually perhaps.
sadly, due to the digital corrections some of the nuances that made Charlton, well..Charlton, are gone. I would have much preferred a reproduction approach similar to Craig Yoes's Ditko reprints, but still it's worth seeking out. The next two volumes are on pre-order for under 20 dollars, and that is definitely something I can get behind.
Have them all and they are awesome. Also, there is no reason to pay the listed price. They can be found for as little as 50% quite easily.

Governor Kay Ivey on Wednesday recognized eight Alabama companies for success in selling their goods and services to countries around the globe.
Recipients of the 2018 Governor’s Trade Excellence Awards represent a diverse swath of Alabama’s business landscape, including high-tech manufacturers, innovative software developers and a craft beer brewer. Ivey honored the eight companies at a ceremony Wednesday at the State Capitol in Montgomery, Ala.
“Today, we celebrate the ingenuity and dedication of eight Alabama companies who recognize that commerce does not end at our state’s borders,” Ivey said. “These companies’ vision to be international leaders in their respective fields is most impressive, and we look forward to their continued efforts in overseas markets.”
The governor also acknowledged that each of this year’s Governor’s Trade Excellence Award recipients are small businesses, a pillar of Alabama’s economy.
“Small business is big business in the state of Alabama,” Ivey added. “Small businesses employ more than 772,000 people, nearly half of Alabama’s workforce, in more than 380,000 establishments. Their importance cannot be understated.”
Back Forty Beer Company (Gadsden, Ala.): Was founded in 2009 to bring top-quality craft beer to Northeast Alabama and now brews almost 20 different brands with distribution in five states. In addition, the brewery exported beer to China, Canada, Malaysia and The Netherlands in 2016-2017.
Conversant Bio (Huntsville, Ala.): Is a human tissue procurement company that provides Institutional Review Board approved samples to researchers working on cures for the world’s most prominent diseases. Conversant exports to 21 countries and has worked on more than 3,000 research projects.
Diamond Fortress Technologies Inc. (Birmingham, Ala.): Became the first company to successfully develop a mobile touchless fingerprint biometrics software solution. It exports to countries including Mexico, Pakistan, Colombia, India, Australia, Sweden and South Africa. A DFT subsidiary also promotes banking and other financial services in lower and lower-middle income countries as defined by the World Bank.
Douglas Manufacturing (Pell City, Ala.): Is a leading manufacturer of conveyor components and engineered conveying solutions. The company’s primary export markets are North America, Central America, South America and the Caribbean, serving industries that include pulp and paper, steel, chemical, cement, coal, fertilizer, biofuel, oil and natural gas, and agriculture.
Irrigation Components International Inc. (Daphne, Ala.): Is the world’s leader in center pivot spare parts sales. ICII has been providing irrigation parts to dealers, distributors and OEMs for more than 30 years. It serves more than 35 countries worldwide.
Keet Consulting Services LLC (Pelham, Ala.): Has been serving the Geographic Information Systems industry since 1999, with export markets that include Australia, Canada, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. The company provides a wide range of services, including application development, GIS implementation and RouteMan, which is sold internationally and helps companies manage route delivery and route sales.
North Alabama International Trade Association (Huntsville, Ala.) Is a business-driven nonprofit membership organization committed to increasing activity in international trade in North Alabama for the past 35 years. The organization is managed by and partners with the Madison County Commission International Trade Development Center.
Regitar USA Inc. (Montgomery, Ala.): Is a major manufacturer and distributor of automotive electronics, power tools and mobile safety products. It exports around the world, with primary emphasis on North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Australia and New Zealand.
During the Governor’s Trade Excellence Award Ceremony, Ivey also recognized the Alabama Small Business Development Center, which helped more than 3,000 small businesses last year. In the past five years, the Alabama SBDC program has helped small businesses create more than 4,800 jobs and access more than $368 million in new capital.
Hosted at the University of Alabama, the Alabama SBDC partners with eight other universities in Alabama, in a network that leverages university expertise from the respective colleges of business to provide management and technical assistance to small businesses.
The governor issued a proclamation, designating March 21, 2018 as “Alabama SBDC Day.” The organization has 30 professional business advisers who cover all 67 Alabama counties from 10 field offices.
“The SBDC is a strong resource partner for the Alabama Department of Commerce’s Office of International Trade and its Office of Small Business Advocacy,” noted Ivey. “This organization also works closely with ADECA’s Small Business Credit Initiative. In addition, the University of Alabama’s International Trade Center helps companies that are new to exporting learn how to become successful exporters like our award winners. They also help in encouraging these companies take advantage of the Alabama Department of Commerce’s trade expansion programs.”
Alabama’s exports climbed to a record level of $21.7 billion in 2017, with automobiles, aircraft components, chemicals, paper and minerals fueling the increase.
“Exporting is a driving force of Alabama’s economy, which benefits in the form of new jobs and investments for those exporters here at home,” Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce Greg Canfield added. “We congratulate today’s winners and are preparing to help them and other companies increase their global sales plans this coming year.”
Hilda Lockhart, Director of Commerce’s Office of International Trade, said this year’s award winners are models for peers which may be looking to follow a similar path in exporting their goods and services overseas.
“Each of these companies are driven by a desire to compete on the global stage, and their creativity, hard work and strategic planning have helped them achieve those goals,” she said.

In October 2018, join educators from around the world for a Project Zero Perspectives conference in Pamplona, Spain. With the theme Understanding for a Complex World, we will explore the following questions:
In today’s changing and increasingly complex world, what skills and knowledge must students understand?
How can these goals and approaches fit within national and international needs for standardized testing and curricula?
This two-day conference is offered in collaboration with the Center for the Advancement and Study of International Education (CASIE) and will offer plenaries and interactive courses that explore these questions and offer pedagogical tools, strategies, and frameworks developed by researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Project Zero. The conference will specifically highlight research and practices that address one or more of the following strands:
Teaching for Understanding: What is understanding and how does it develop? What is important to learn today that will prepare us for an unknown future? How do we focus instruction and assessment on deep understanding of the topics we most want our students to learn?
Understanding for Global Competence: How can we develop the skills for learners to thrive as global participants in today’s world? How can they learn to engage in cultural differences and develop perspective taking? How do we as educators deepen our own global competence in working with students from diverse backgrounds?
Thinking with Complexity:How do we develop student’s dispositions to think about and with complexity? What teaching and assessment practices support students’ capacity to understand complex relationships and engage in complex reasoning?
Learning Environments:What are the qualities of spaces and settings that support deep understanding, playful learning, and thinking? How can teachers and school leaders effectively design formal and informal environments to support their goals?

The South African Reserve Bank governor, Lesetja Kganyago, announced a quarter of a percentage point increase in the benchmark interest rate at SARB’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting on Thursday, 19 November 2015. This is the second rate hike for the year – the first hike was in July when governor Kganyago also declared a 25 basis points repo rate hike.
The repo rate now stands at 6.25%. It was pointless to postpone the latest rate hike as further delay “could lead to second-round effects and require an even stronger response in the future, with more severe consequences for short-term growth,” the governor said.
Mr Isaac Matshego, a Nedbank economist, reckons SARB had positioned itself in a more comfortable place in order to avoid having to hike aggressively should inflation rose beyond 6% and the outlook remained low.
SARB is worried that the severe drought conditions plaguing the country will affect food prices negatively, causing inflation to spike. This, together with a possible increase in electricity tariffs as well as the depreciation of the rand, outweighs the benefits of low global oil prices. Governor Kganyago admitted that South Africa’s economy continue to be listless.
SARB anticipates the economy to grow only 1.4% this year and 1.5% in 2016, strengthening to a feeble 2.1% in 2017. The inflation outlook prediction for 2015 was revised to average 4.6% from 4.7%, while that of 2016 was lowered to 6% from 6.2%. It is anticipated that inflation will breach 6% in the first and last quarters of 2016. The rate hike cycle aims to temper the consequences.
The MPC’s statement mentions that “although global financial markets have stabilised since the previous meeting, the outlook for emerging markets in particular remains challenging. The US Fed is likely to raise its policy rate in December, and further volatility in financial markets can be expected in the lead-up to this.”
Governor Kganyago stated that SARB would monitor a Fed hike when it finally happened and will duly assess its possible effects on the rand and inflation outlook. He said: “If we are of the view that that is what it does (weaken the rand), we would then have to adjust policy.”

1. I am in awe of the fact that God has provided me with a no-brainer job opportunity. I say 'no-brainer' because I have tried working part-time with kids and it was not really 'part time'. Also, it is pretty much impossible to find a part time teaching job, especially when Daniel's school is so far away...I would either have to find a job that only required 2 hours of working or pay for extended day for Daniel, which would defeat the purpose of working. However, with Daniel's school, medical and therapy costs, I felt like I had to at least try to get some extra income somehow.
So one day, I was sitting in the office at Daniel's school and the idea popped in my head to see if they had any part time jobs for the fall...teacher turnover there is very low so I was just hoping they needed a receptionist or secratary (not to mention that I doubted I would even be qualified to teach there). I casually asked the director about it as she walked by. She asked me about my background and I was soon stunned when she offered me a teaching job. It is a job that I would jump at whether or not Daniel attended school there, and it fits perfectly in my schedule...God gave an answer to prayer that was greater than anything I could have imagined.
