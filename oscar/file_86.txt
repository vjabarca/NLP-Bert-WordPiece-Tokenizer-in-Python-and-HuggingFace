Once a hardcore band, Codeseven have changed their sound dramatically, intriguing many earthling types with their aural musical visions. Their latest release is entitled The Rescue, and it's filled with hypnotic anthems that will send a listener into the rock and roll stratosphere. Prior to my seeing this band live for the fourth time, I was able to secure an interview with two of the members. Taking place in their old but reliable van just prior to their set, Eric and Matt of Codeseven took on inquiries from the Highwire Daze troops. Read on...
Eric: Well I guess pretty much for us, just being influenced by wide varieties of music. We also get bored, at least from my aspect, playing the same stuff over and over. We like to experiment. It keeps it interesting so you don't really get burnt out on what you're playing. There's always a new element added.
Matt: There was a two-year gap between the albums. You could imagine how you would turn (musically). It could be anywhere.
Eric: No, not at all. I think the next album might be the same thing as The Rescue. A little more elements hopefully. We'll bring new instruments in and probably experiment a little bit more.
As a drummer, it must be a challenge. Your not simply playing blast beats all of the time. You're slowing it down a bit.
Eric: I saw one time this kid got on there and said that "you guys were my favorite metal band and you let me down. I'll never buy another one of your records." And I'm like, oh that's nice. And close to home, about 45 minutes away in this place called Wilksborough. I went in there to look to see if they had the CD in Sam Goody and to see if it was out. I went in and asked if they had gotten more in, and they said "Actually we have one here. Somebody bought it but they brought it back because they didn't want it. They said it's not the same band." They just returned it and said they wanted to their money back. It is a drastic change, so I can understand. But it's doing well, but it should be doing a lot better in my opinion.
Eric: Honestly, I think I've only read one bad review, and that's good. I mean, everybody has got their opinion on everything and I don't down anybody because of that. There's plenty of stuff that I don't like. I'm a really picky person, so I can understand where people are coming from.
Eric: A lot of it has to do with the whole UFO thing and strange phenomenons, especially with Jeff our singer.
Matt: A friend of ours got one on camera while in Oakland. We played at the Gilman Street. I don't know if it was a blimp or what.
Eric: We've seen some stuff late at night though, and I have seen a couple of things myself which makes me a complete believer. But as far as Jeff and James, the other guitar player, are concerned, they've both been abducted and all that weird stuff.
Eric: You know what, print it. By all means print it! He is a weirdo and if you meet him, you'll definitely agree.
Eric: I wish Coalition had never been released - the first one. It was released two years after it was done. A lot of that was even written in 1996, it should have been out in 97, but didn't get released until late 98.
Eric: I'm happy with Division Of Labor. It could have been a little bit better recording. Kurt did a really good job, but some of the parts could have been changed.
On your first album you did a cover of Boys Of Summer by Don Henley. What made you choose that song and do you still play it?
Eric: We were high. Well actually, as far as the weed goes, neither of us smokes marijuana. Nobody does except for Jeff. But riding in my car, my Ford Escort back in the day - that song came on and I said "Hey guys, we should cover this." We thought it was a good idea and we threw it together one day before we went into the studio to record Coalition. It just turned out good. It was fun. And back home, I remember playing one show and it just being a pile up. It was 8-900 people and you could hear them screaming the words over the PA system and it was really insane. I mean, everybody loves that song. We play it occasionally, but tonight it's not going to happen because we haven't played it in a year.
Eric: We love Dave. Dave's a great guy. It just didn't work out between us. A lot of bad business decisions on our end and we felt that he was handling stuff wrong. He was a great friend and we hated to part ways with him. We were all just really upset, but that's just the way it had to go. He could have been on the album maybe playing keyboards or doing whatever - that would have been fine. But it actually didn't end up working out that way.
Eric: I see him at the bar occasionally back home. He promotes shows in Winston. He did a Zao show and made all this money off of it and he took everybody out drinking. We all got completely smashed.
What has been the best and worst part of touring? You've toured with Fairweather and now you're out with Dredg,
Eric: Okay, it's a 1988 Ford Econoline 150. V8 5.0 - very small, very dirty - with a trailer that's about to fall apart. It may fall off while we're driving down the highway. It runs good so far - knock on wood - and hopefully it will get us home. If it doesn't, I'm going to cry. But no, it's a good van. Got a TV and a CB - we like to fuck with truck drivers but we can't do that on this trip because we need a new microphone. We have mood lighting for all the ladies who like to come in the van and spend time with Codeseven. That never happens…
Eric: I use to be the big road whore I guess, but not anymore. I found a good girl, so we'll keep it that way for right now.
Do you guys have any messages for people who are following your career or for people who might want to check your music out?
Eric: I'd like to thank everybody that's stuck with us over the years. There's been a lot of changes and that definitely can ruin a fan base because people aren't use to it. We really appreciate it, and we're going to try to please everybody and kind of stay close to the same thing now.
Eric: …yeah, and we're glad to have them as fans. To people who haven't heard us before - I hope you hear it and I hope you like it. That's about all I can say. It's hard to describe our music, so hopefully they'll just listen to it.
Eric: I hate to name bands because it sucks. If you like bands like Radiohead, Faith No More, or Sunny Day Real Estate - that's the stuff we're really influenced by. Really spacey music - I wouldn't really call our music spacey at all. Full of a lot of different effects and experimentations and that's pretty much all I can say. If you like Limp Bizkit or Stained or Creed, you probably won't like our music. I hope that we can help change the face of music. That's the biggest goal of mine personally - and probably for the rest of the band. Highering the standards of music. You just hear crap after crap on the radio and you think how in the hell are these guys big? I just hope that bands like us or anybody else who experiments or does something a little bit different - I hope that becomes the standard in music. And I hope the industry catches on and makes it happen.
Many thanks to Matt and Eric of Codeseven for the interview and their manager Bambino for making it happen. Be sure to check out The Rescue on The Music Cartel and don't forget to Watch The Skies...

Ophir was about halfway between Brewster and Malott on the old stage road, the first stop out of Brewster where the first horse change was made. This site was on a bench about one half mile from the Okanogan River. It was the homestead of James B. Watson.
Ophir had a post office that was established on June 13, 1890. The town of Ophir was described by one old-timer as "never more then a ranch house of George T. Jenkins," in which was a store and post office, which served the surrounding ranch settlers.

A caper film about the unlikely gang of retirees that pulled off the daring Hatton Garden jewellery heist of 2015.
Legendary venture capitalist John Doerr reveals how the goal-setting system of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) has helped tech giants from Intel to Google achieve explosive growth—and how it can help any organization thrive.
In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-up whom he'd just given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on track. They'd have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast. And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.
Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the legendary Andy Grove ("the greatest manager of his or any era") drove the best-run company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove's brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced, it worked.
More and more these days kids seem to be wanting video game systems for Christmas and if it’s not the video game systems then it is one of the many accessories or games that go with them. By the time we are done buying the system, the games, and everything else there is little room for more traditional gifts, those gifts that expand a child’s mind, that teach them important social skills, and that will help them learn about the importance of fair competition. We don’t want our children’s childhood to be all about sitting in front of a video game though so we need to give them gifts that will inspire them to do more than pick up a controller and live in a world that is all fantasy. Not only is it not healthy to be so inactive but it is not healthy to have such limited experience. Limited experience leads to limited point of view and ultimately limited opportunity, two things that we do not want to bestow on our children. We as parents have the responsibility of showing our children that there are other things out there for them to enjoy if they just take the time to discover what those things are. We can start by giving them creative Christmas gifts that will have them doing something besides pushing buttons and sitting in front of a television or computer monitor all day. Listed are four classic Christmas gifts that have nothing to do with video games and everything to do with important lessons and learning experiences.
Board Games – Board games are a great way to teach children about the value of a good, fair competition but many parents these days just assume that kids will not play board games because they have video games so they don’t buy them for them. The fact is if we do buy them and then actually play them with our children they will probably find that they enjoy the friendly competition and the time spent with the family.
Science Projects – Simple, safe science projects that can be found at most toy stores are a great way to expand your child’s mind. Such projects as volcanoes, home made tornadoes, and chemistry sets are a great way to instill a sense of wonder in your kids and they will have a great time completing the projects and so will you.
Models – Model cars, boats, airplanes, and motorcycles are another great way to expand your child’s mind. And the best part about these as that they will have a great new decoration for their room as well and they can show off their modeling skills at the same time.
Art Sets – Art sets will give your child what they need to explore their creative side before they get to the age where they just assume that they have no artistic talent. Whether it is painting supplies, drawing supplies, or anything else it will be a great way to get your child thinking about more than their video game system.
This year give your child the gift of creativity and important life lessons by giving them something besides video games and you will surely be glad that you did.
How to identify balsam wool building insulation, Silvawool, Kimsul, Blackweld & and other wood insulation or cellulose insulation products
InspectAPedia tolerates no conflicts of interest. We have no relationship with advertisers, products, or services discussed at this website.
This article illustrates and describes balsam wool and wood product insulation materials. We discuss the properties of balsam wool, what it is made from, its fire resistance, insect resistance, insulation properties (R-value).
We address the frequent question: does balsam wool insulation contain asbestos and we give the history of use and manufacture of balsam wool. We added these examples because of frequent questions about these materials.
This document assists building buyers, owners or inspectors who need to identify various insulation materials in buildings by simple visual inspection. We provide photographs and descriptive text of balsam wool insulation and other wood insulating products to permit identification of these materials in buildings.
We also provide a MASTER INDEX to this topic, or you can try the page top or bottom SEARCH BOX as a quick way to find information you need.
"Balsam Wool" is a wood fiber product or "cellulose" insulation that was widely used in homes and in a variety of other applications in the U.S. from at least the 1930's. Synonyms for balsam wool insulation include wood fiber insulation, wood insulation, wood-wool insulation, and blackweld or blackwell insulation.
Our Balsam-Wool insulation photo (above left) includes a Weyerhaeuser Forest Products logo in the bottom of the red diamond.
We learn from the Minnesota Historical Society [5] as well as from reviewing patents describing the history of production of balsam wool fiber insulation [4] that the Wood Conversion Company of Cloquet, Minnesota, incorporated in 1922 in Delaware.
The Wood Conversion Company of Cloquet was a Weyerhaeuser By-Products Division, and was a key participant in the development & production of Balsam Wool Insulation. Wood Conversion was the assignee of a variety of patents describing the production of balsam wool and other wood fiber (and even animal hair) insulation products.
In the right hand (and page top) photo of this insulation (basically chopped wood fibers, probably treated with a fire retardant), you can see the brown/tan fibers of insulating material.
Balsam wool insulating blankets, also referred to as "wood cotton" in some patent literature, are shown in our photographs here. These insulating batts of "balsam wool" were produced using wood fibers from tree bark, wood pulp, or other lumber byproducts.
A review of some of the key patents, (described below in the references section of this article) a variety of tree species were described including tree bark and wood byproducts from redwood, [balsam] fir, and others. [4]
Various sprays were used to give desired properties including for adhesion, fiber control, sizing, and possibly insect and rodent resistance.
When inspecting balsam wool insulation we advise against cutting the kraft paper covering these insulation batts as if the paper is cut a large amount of the insulating material is likely to simply fall out.
If you must make a cut to test or confirm the material or its condition, the cut should be just an inch or so, and you should tape the cut closed after your inspection.
Would ignite and smolder but not really burn. Same house has some Kimsul insulation but this is quite different. Friends upstate say its been a bad winter, its been poor here in Raleigh but nowhere near what you guys suffer through. - S.S., Raleigh N.C. 3/10/2014
What you have in hand looks like wet Balsam Wool - a wood fiber insulating product I describe in the article above, though your insulation sample is more coarse and has larger chunks than I've seen.
I'll post the photo here to invite other reader comment. Most likely this is SILVAWOOL INSULATION or a similar product. - DF
The insulation in the video you cite (and these three photographs) is not balsam wool and it is not vermiculite. The insulation in the video shown by the link you provided (and excerpted here in stills) is most likely fiberglass batts or perhaps a mix of fiberglass batts and chopped (or damaged) fiberglass, or possibly fiberglass batts along with some older mineral wool or rock wool.
It's not apparent why the vacuum removal of this attic insulation was undertaken. Just why was not given. But it would perhaps be reasonable to remove old fiberglass or mineral wool insulation if it were badly damaged, ineffective, or if the insulation were contaminated by rodents, insects, or if the insulation had become wet and was a mold hazard.
Balsam wool insulating blanket used wood fibers from tree bark, wood pulp, or other lumber byproducts. As such it is a wood or cellulose product and not an asbestos-containing material.
Watch out: however, from 1958 through 1974 asbestos was used in the production of other products at the Conwed Corporation (Wood Conversion Company) plant in Cloquet, Minnesota, including the production of ceiling tiles and other products.
Our photo at left illustrates a stereo-microscopic view of balsam wool fibers. You can see that the manufacturing process separated individual long wood fibers and that there was little extraneous material in this insulation product.
I have Balsam Wool Batt insulation in my house. It is labeled with the same Weyerhaeuser label that you have pictured. I want to replace the insulation but need to know if the black paper backing contains asbestos. thanks, Ron.
Ron, while there are some curious manufacturing site overlaps between producers of asbestos-containing products and manufacturers of wood-fiber based products that *might* have produced some asbestos cross-contamination among products (Robins 1988), we have not yet been able to find credible research asserting that problem is a real one.
Other than that, wood fiber insulation products are not asbestos-products nor was their paper covering. If you want an absolutely reliable answer however, you'd want to spend about $50. to send a sample of your material to a certified asbestos testing lab. Keep us posted if you take that step. I'd be surprised if asbestos were detected in any balsam wool product. Here are some interesting research citations Take note of Baird (1946) in re your question as he cites "boards containing wool and asbestos" suggesting that mineral wool or balsam wool might have appeared with asbestos in some products.
Allcut, E. A. "Heat Insulation as Applied to Buildings and Structures." Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers 128, no. 1 (1934): 195-251.
Cummings, J. M. "Possibilities for the Manufacture of Mineral Wool in British Columbia" [PDF], British Columbia Department of Mines, (1937)- includes tables comparing properties of various insulation and other materials to mineral wool and balsam wool, retrieved 12/6/2014, original source: http://142.32.76.167/Mining/Geoscience/
Reader Question: can I get my insulation tested to see if this (apparently Balsam Wool) insulation contains asbestos?
Hello. I think I may have found something like Balsam wool in my attic. Would love to get it tested (to make sure it's not asbestos.) Any recommendations? I'm in Nashville, TN.
Matt most forensic labs can identify different types of insulation; but there is little or no physical resemblance between balsam wool and asbestos, nor was asbestos used as a brown fiber enclosed in batts, nor does asbestos resemble long woody fibers. Take a look at the insulation; Balsm wool is usually pretty easy to identify by eye.
We perform limited forensic lab testing on a pro-bono basis for people of limited means. Please do NOT send us any samples or materials for testing without prior arrangement.
In 2012 we performed a simple combustion test of a sample of Balsam-Wool insulation from an older home. Our photos below illustrate the result. Using an alcohol lamp as a flame source in our lab, and holding a sample of balsam-wool insulation in the flame until its edges glowed, we found on removal from the flame that the insulation would not support combustion.
Balsam wool, depending on the wood species used to produce it, may be naturally insect resistant (Balsam) as are cedar, cypress, and some other wood products. It might have been treated with a fire retardant, I don't yet know (am researching the question). Some fire retardants (borate salts used in cellulose insulation) also seem to be mold resistant and may also be insect resistant.
Is the balsam fiber treated to prevent attracting wood destroying insects. Have a crawlspace that has allot of balsam batt insulation that's deteriorated and falling on ground.
Good question. I haven't come across moldy balsam wool insulation. Although there are plenty of molds that like to grow on cellulose - wood fibers - the number that grow happily on dry or even damp balsam fir may be much smaller.
If you have some that is suspect, mail me a few cubic inches in a labeled new clean Ziploc bag and I'll test it pro bono next January when our lab returns to the US.
We estimate that balsam wool has an R value of about 2 to 3.5 in loose fill and about 2 to 3.25 in batts.
We have seen some estimates of an R value of 3.4 per inch for versions of insulation that contain a mixture of wood fibers and chopped paper.
Thought you'd appreciate these instructions for Balsam Wool. We've been removing it because we have limited space for fiberglass, and the packaging is displacing too much space. The balsam inside has disintegrated and packed, thus not too useful. - D.G. 3/10/2014
Professional home inspector Stephen P. Shockley sent along this excellent photo of 1940's vintage insulation found in a home below a more recent layer of fiberglass insulation.
We think this is "Blackweld Insulation", another wood-fiber insulation product similar to the Balsam Wool product described above, and we are looking for a positive ID, product label photos, or a sample to examine in our forensic lab. CONTACT us with feedback.
Had Mr. Shockley been able to send a small sample (a cubic inch or less would be sufficient) to our forensic lab we would have examined the material to identify its constituents.
Some readers refer to this insulating material as "Blackwell Insulation" but that's probably an error. Google Scholar searches for BlackWeld Insulation and for blackwell insulation made in 2009 and again in 2017 have not found patents nor specific uses of the terms blackweld insulation nor blackwell insulation.

I ran across you site while doing some research on insulation inside a vintage refrigerator. I'm refurbing (Admiral Refrigerator 1949 - 1950) when I removed the interior I came across what looked similar to Silva Wool or some type of shredded wood insulation but much more fine that what was pictured on your site.
It's reddish brown, mixed sized pieces some look like wood, while others almost hair. It burns for a short second than goes out much like your tests. It wasn't held together with any paper backing but looks like it may have been glued in sheets but now is very loose and falls apart very easily.
Have you come across anything like this in your research? From what I found and reaching out to some antique appliance folks also, it sounds like refrigerators in that era typically used compressed sawdust which hopefully means something similar or Silva Wool (I've read horse hair too).
I have attached an image (with penny for scale) if you'd be willing to take a look - and possibly help identify, if anything for peace of mind - I would greatly appreciate it! - J.R. 2015/12/28 by private email
Thanks for the excellent photos. Your insulating material may be Silvawool or Kimsul or a similar chemically treated wood fiber insulating material: at least to me this looks very much like a treated wood fiber insulating product. Indeed the fibers in your photos are longer than in some balsam wool insulation products, but if we consider that a wide variety of cellulose fibers were used for insulating materials that is not a surprise.
Silvawool® was indeed a shredded wood fiber insulation product, one of many popular in North America beginning in the 1950's. There is no doubt that wood fiber insulation was used not just in buildings but within refrigerators, freezers and in other special applications.
SilvaWool was a Weyerhaeuser product - the trademarked brand name was first used in 1949 and was filed in a trademark application by Weyerhaeuser (Tacoma Washington) on 5 August 1950 as # 0562777. The Silvawool trademark was fully registered in 1952. The company's literature (found by trademark search) described Silvawool as "... Silvawool is a product related to chemically impregnated wood fiber for use as insulation material. " Silvawool insulation is no longer in production.
The material is likely to have been treated with a fire retardant, perhaps the same borate salt as was later used in cellulose (chopped newsprint) insulation.
As with other wood and cellulose insulations, this is not an asbestos-suspect material though we have read reports of possible cross-contamination when some companies processed non-asbestos insulation products at the same plant where asbestos products were handled. Generally testing for asbestos is not performed unless we find some particular reason to do so such as facing a high-cost dusty demolition project.
Kimsul™, produced by Kimberly Clark, in Neenah Wisconsin in the U.S., is an older insulating material used from about 1930 into at least the 1950's and that has been described by some building history sources as a creped paper insulating material that was impregnated by asphalt.
Although Kimsul was described by its manufacturer as a wood-fiber product, It won't look like the wood fiber insulation described at BALSAM WOOL INSULATION PROPERTIES though I've seen Silvawool and "Kimsul" described together in some sources. Kimsul, according to Bill Kibbel at historicbuildings.com, was used in refrigerators, car dashboards, in trains, and as an insulation in Quonset huts during WWII. - retrieved 2015/12/29, original source http://historicbldgs.com/asbestos.htm
Kimsul, a Kimberly-Clark insulation brand copyrighted in 1949, was sold in round rolls or in stitched batts, was still in distribution in 1956 when Kimberly-Clark advertised Kimsul for use as building insulation in the April 1956 issue of Popular Science - ad excerpt shown here.
Kimsul was produced in reflective-faced batts which, if spread apart, showed what look like soft, brown, accordion-pleated crepe paper. The company described Kimsul insulation with its reflective "vaporseal" as resisting radiant heat loss as well as providing insulation value in ceilings and walls.
The Kimsul manufacturer provided charts of percent of loss in a Kimsul-insulated wall as ranging from 0 to 90% but did not provide the R-values used today. Typical heat loss savings estimated by the company for homes using Kimsul in walls and roofs ranged from about 25% to 38%. A K-factor of 0.27 Btu/sq.ft. was quoted in the company's Kimsul catalog.
Kimsul's ASTM tested fire resistance was quoted in the same catalog as resisting flame temperatures as high as 1700 degF. You may see Kimsul Insulation printed on the Kimsul insulating batts in an attic or wall of a home built in the 1940's and 1950's. Each roll of Kimsul contained 200 sq. ft. of insulating material.
Spafford's patent for an insulation pad described using Balsam Wool (US Patent 2,028,253, 15 September 1930. He improved the production to permit thicker blankets of insulation.
Balsam wool is described in the US Weiss Patents Nos. 1,336,402, US Pat. 1,336,403, and 1,336,404. Related patents derive from the 1930's-40's.
In the 2nd Weiss patent, US Pat. 1,336,403,Weiss described preferring wood fibers, using tree bark, from spruce, balsam, fir and redwood and any bark having long fibers (also he considered Japanese swamp moss) including ground wood pulp that was then shredded into fibrous form. The problem of how to keep the fibers in place between two sheets of paper without having to sew and quilt the entire assembly was solved by spraying fibers with an adhesive, or in later versions, using an adhesive bonded to the paper inner faces, such as asphalt, pitch, or tar. Fibers were also treated with a water resistant sizing.
In the third Weiss Balsam Wool Insulation Production Patent 1,336,404 the inventor referred to the insulating material as "wood cotton" - a "cellulosic product derived from wood pulp" Various sprays were used to give the material desired properties and for fiber control, including casein, lime, sodium silicate.
"Origins of the Lumber Industry at Cloquet," by Hugo Schlenk. 3 leaves. Information is given on the Charles N. Nelson's Lumber Company's Cloquet mill which was built in 1880; on the operations of the Knife Falls Lumber Company (1883); the absorption of this firm by the George Shaw company of Davenport and by Frederick Weyerhaeuser (1883). This firm was then called Renwick, Shaw and Crossett Company, and later the Cloquet Lumber Company. Other companies organized were: Cloquet Water Power Company (1882); Johnson-Wentworth Company (1894); Northwest Paper Company (1898);
Wood Conversion Company (1922); and the Northern Lumber Company (1911), the latter three being Weyerhaeuser interests. The paper ends with a description of the organization and early leaders of the Knife Falls Boom Corporation, which was incorporated in 1871.

I have never understood how a Catholic politician could be a good Catholic and still support abortion. I mean, the Catholic Church says that's a really bad thing.

Apparently, now that Ted Kennedy is pinin' for the fjords, the Providence bishop has barred Representative Patrick Kennedy from receiving communion because of his stand on abortion.

It’s always fun when a boxing career takes an unexpected turn. For a long time Liverpool’s Tony Bellew looked to be one of those typical British fighters who would never quite deliver. High-functioning at domestic and European level, true world class appeared a step too far.
At light-heavy he put in a strange smorgasbord of performances, occasionally explosive – as when dispatching Ovill Mckenzie in eight rounds after tasting canvas twice himself – and occasionally dull and flat. His two fights with South African Isaac Chilemba will not live long in the memory, for example. Despite this inconsistency his mouth frequently ran away from him. His bombastic interview style, “these fists feed my kids, I’m going in there to destroy” became more than a little grating. When you listen repeatedly to a fighter talk big, then fail to deliver, it tarnishes your view of their abilities. Bellew, it seemed, was a loudmouth with a higher opinion of himself than performances justified.
Two world title defeats confirmed that appraisal. Nathan Cleverly outworked and outpointed him in 2011, before Adonis Stevenson made him look silly two years later. Once again Bomber Bellew had talked the talk, claiming that the champion was too small and needed to return to super-middleweight, but in that Quebec city ring, he singularly failed to make a fight of it. Tony put in a cautious, back foot, safety-first performance that imploded when he was TKO’d in round 6. Steve Bunce called him out on it and Bellew responded by throwing his toys out of the pram in a Talksport radio interview.
Following that mauling at the hands of Stevenson, Bellew elected to move up to Cruiser. This had the trappings of a cynical move. (Nathan Cleverly did the same thing after Krusher Kovalev destroyed him). It seemed that Bellew accepted that the light-heavy world champions were too good for him and a public reinvention as a cruiserweight could give his career a shot in the arm and earn him some final paydays before retirement.
Once again, those suspicions seemed confirmed when Bellew took part in the most tawdry of all the Matchroom / Sky PPV nights to date. His tepid, non-title rematch with Cleverly, in which neither man really turned up, seemed the very epitome of fan exploitation. A pointless, WWE style rivalry, between two mediocre performers, all ruthlessly hyped to rip-off casuals. It left a nasty taste in the mouth and meant that at that stage, only two years ago, Tony Bellew was a pretty hard fighter to like.
But then, somehow, it all changed. The cruiserweight wins kept coming, against increasingly impressive opposition, leading to the big one against fearsome Ilungu Makubu at Goodison Park in May. Bellew appeared different in the build-up, wiser, more reflective and less self-absorbed. It was as if he knew this was his last chance for credibility. Perhaps because of that, he absolutely smashed it.
Down in the first before pulverising Makabu in the third, he finally lived up to all the big talk from years before. Bellew didn’t just win, he entertained, against a very dangerous and avoided fighter. At last he had it – WBC world champ.
For a first defence BJ Flores was a reasonable choice. We’ve seen far worse. Although 36 years old, the American has operated around the upper levels of the Cruiserweight division for years and proved capable of giving top guys like Danny Green and Beibut Shumenov a decent argument. Most tellingly of all, prior to meeting Bellew, he had never been stopped.
It may be true that Flores started to unravel after being hit low, a point seemingly missed by the ref, but Bellew the cruiserweight destroyer is not one to let chances pass untaken. With the American in temporary disarray, Bomber went into overdrive, forcing 4 knockdowns altogether and taking a few big shots himself. It was, quite simply, another scintillating performance.
Bellew the Cruiserweight is an exciting fighter. He now finds himself in the position of being arguably the UK’s most watchable world champion. After his expensive, fan-fleecing bore-fest with Cleverly three years ago, that’s quite a turnaround.
Having got himself into this position, what the he now needs to do is build on it. Yet for some reason (I’m thinking pound notes) he has fixated on a match-up with David Haye. He needs to back away from that nonsense, sharpish.
Not only will Haye obliterate him, it won’t even be a contest. Bellew takes too many shots and Haye is a powerful heavy, but more than that, the whole thing stinks to high heaven in the same way the Cleverly get-up did.
Bellew is very good at playing the psychopathic, swivel-eyed loon and someone has obviously told him it’s the way to hype a contest to a general audience. The post-fight scene on Saturday was undignified and again, reminiscent of a lesser, more theatrical sport. All we needed was for someone to smack Bellew on the back with a folding chair, while female bodybuilders with huge, fake tits stood pouting at the camera.
As the embarrassing scene played itself out, Eddie Hearn, of course, hovered in the background with a faint smile. Already the interent is abuzz. The clamour has begun, but the Haye fight, if it happened, would take Bellew back to what made him something of a joke figure years ago.
It would doubtless end up on PPV. Tony would give it all the scouse mouth for months of tortured build-up. Then he’d get flattened.
As a man who holds the most valued belt in the cruiserweight division, he doesn’t need any of that. Bellew should focus instead on defending against viable challengers before looking for unifications. If he could topple Alexander Usyk, or Denis Lebedev, then real global superstar status awaits. Imagine that!
Right now Bomber has the chance to lead a British charge and like all of us he faces a choice. His is to be very well paid to do things the right way, or go all out to make millions in a one-off, farcical, PPV circus.

Let me welcome you to the top secret language school for international agents. We train the best and brightest here. We’re glad you made it.
You are here because we need you to learn Hindi. We need you to be able to read, listen, and translate it. When you are in the field, Hindi needs to be second nature to you. Don’t let us down.
This school is tough, and not everyone makes it through, but we’ll help you as much as we can. We’ve trained agents with far less talent than you in learning Hindi.
You will be presented with 12 categories focusing on different areas of the language-- ranging from numbers to phrases. Each category has 10 levels that you should master.
You learn Hindi on the shooting range. Each Hindi word rises in your sites, and you must shoot each word before it gets away. Let too many get away and you fail the level. Shoot them all, and you unlock the next level.
You’ll start off simple by learning numbers in Hindi. The first level is easy-- you have a 50/50 chance of getting each word right. But, later levels are harder. Some levels have no sound-- so you have to learn to read the words. Other levels have no text-- so you have to learn to listen. Be prepared to repeat the levels. But don’t worry, young agent, as you get better on the shooting range, you will get better with Hindi.
Later, when you are in the field meeting with fellow agents, we want you to remember all the Hindi words you’ve learned here. Keep working at them until you become proficient. Hindi should be like a native language for you.
Also check out our other games to learn Hindi, Arabic, Cantonese, Russian, Swahili, Korean, Spanish,
If you purchased Hindi Bubble Bath, the same vocabulary is used in Secret Agent: Hindi, so you will find it very similar (but with a spy theme).
You guys voted for this star-crossed lovers business, and honour compels me to deliver on my promises in the fullest way possible. Which means—you guessed it—the Langurds are about to enter that shadowy, foreboding territory we call PLOT.
Don’t worry—Siesta’s generation will be played and written as much by the seat of my pants as the others have been. It’s just that after playing detective so many times in Gen. 6, I felt it would be helpful to put all of my “COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT” moments in one place.
So please humour me as I don my Halloween-store trench coat and cap, and attempt to mash together disjointed happenings into a wad that can conceivably be called “evidence.”

Computer Building: Putting Your Computer Together: The daunting task of building a computer simplified and made easy
Launching and building a vacation rental business might require some sweat equity along with the right turnkey software solution to help you keep things organized as bookings ramp up, but if you have an acute attention to detail, then this is by far one of the best businesses you can start online. Of course, this does operate in the real world, but your web presence and marketing skills are really what define this business and helps it to succeed.
One thing is clear – clothes and accessories will always be one of the super-profitable online business ideas for an ecommerce site. However, with so many boutiques and brands already online, rising above the noise is extremely difficult. Yet, one promising idea that savvy entrepreneurs have probably already noticed is the booming trend of “ethical fashion”. Brands, such as Pachacuti, People Tree, Sea Salt and Matt&Nat have successfully crafted their brands around the concept of organic, ethical production of fashion items and are riding the trend to the top of the strongest brands list.
Create a stylish and functional website. Elegant or funky, classical or hipster, your online store should reflect what you’re selling. No matter what your style is, it's important to give off a professional air. Since you won't be able to earn people's trust in person, your website will have to do the selling for you. Your site should be engaging, and most importantly, easy for customers to use when they're ready to make a purchase.[4]
What are dividend stocks? They are just like regular shares of stock, but with one exception: For every share of a dividend stock that you own, you are paid a small portion of the company’s earnings. Basically, you get paid just for owning the stock! If you are looking to get started with dividend investing, check out Ally Invest (which is included on our list of best investment apps).
I know what you're thinking. How do you start a webinar business? Well, webinars are quite possibly one of the best ways that you can sell anything online. The best part? You don't even need your own product. Webinar guru, Jason Fladlien, co-founder of Rapid Crush, has grossed well north of $100 million in sales via webinars, which goes to show you the sheer power of this medium for selling.
Startup costs: Freelance writing is another of those service-based businesses with very low start-up costs. There are tons of places online where you can find clients for free. At worst you can sign up for an Upwork account for $10 per month, just don't plan on staying there forever. The most lucrative writing projects are rarely found on platforms like Upwork.
In this role you need to be a product expert and will probably represent a company, explaining the benefits of their products to potential clients. Also, you will need to find new customers or market segments that a company can sell to and convert those leads into sales. Usually, salaries and rewards for sales consultants depend largely on how many sales they can close.
Acorns rounds up your everyday credit and debit transactions and automatically invests the spare change for you. It's only $1 a month and free for college students with an .edu address for up to four years from the date of registration. You'll barely notice the micro-investments of spare change, plus the Found Money feature invests money in your account when you shop with Acorns partners such as Macy's, Nordstrom, and Walmart.
Find focus groups in your area.[20] Focus groups are comprised of people that can provide a company, organization, or individual with feedback on a product, design, idea, etc. Monitor local postings or search a site like FindFocusGroups.com to find some in your area that you are eligible to participate in. Some of these sites promote online-only tasks, such as serving as an “e-juror” for lawyers working on a case. The pay for these tasks can be relatively good, and can be disbursed quickly.
Overall, the Internet itself is overflowing with one money making opportunity after another. While making money online for most people isn’t their primary source of income, it can net a very solid supplement stream of incoming dollars each month. There are some online entrepreneurs, however, that are managing to mine gold due to all the effort, persistence, and time they’ve invested in order to make that dream come true. Can one of these online money making options work for you?
Affiliate marketing. You know this one already. You include links to products you are promoting as an affiliate, and every time somebody buys the product, you get a commission. With a blog you can integrate advertising with content to make it even more likely you’ll get the sale. For example, you could do a product review — which is useful content — and then include a link to buy the product under an affiliate link.
As the internet grows and expands, not only is SEO going to get more competitive, but it's also going to grow more lucrative. You could quite easily capitalize on this industry if you know what you're doing. This doesn't just go for doing work for clients, but also for yourself. You could launch any number of online businesses, niche websites, and blogs with the right amount of SEO skills.
And while you’ve probably heard of selling sperm or eggs, don’t get your hopes up: Yes, the young and the healthy can sometimes earn good money as sperm or egg donors, but such opportunities require extensive screenings and long-term commitments. Donating blood (sans plasma), meanwhile, is a great and altruistic thing to do, but you generally won’t get money for it.

Manhattan: A Staycation, of Sorts Where New York City editor made a 24-hour holiday out of coming to Manhattan. As a Where editor who lives in Princeton, New Jersey, I have the distinct advantage of residing at the midway point of my favorite U.S. cities: Philadelphia and New York. And, though I take the train daily to my Midtown Manhattan office, it is not quite the same thing as staying over in a NYC hotel and playing tourist. Recently, I did just that, and it reminded me that this town will never, ever leave you jaded. I arrived at the Time Hotel in Times Square a bit wiped out�it was one of those hot and humid, early summer days that leave you limp. I was immediately revived with a cup of superb coffee at Goldfinch, the counter in the front of the hotel that serves Stumptown Coffee, the brand known for its rich, bold java. I checked in on the second floor, but found it hard to leave that desk, even after I was handed my room key: I was mesmerized by what first appears as a piece of abstract art, with black slashes turning slowly and deliberately, until you step back and realize that numbers start emerging to show the time: it was a clock! In my mind, it was cooler than even Big Ben. The clock at the front desk of the Time Hotel. But as fun as that was to watch, I couldn�t wait to get up to my room, after the desk clerk explained, �the big mirror facing your bed is also a TV�just switch it on with the remote to make it turn into a screen.� Holy futuristic worlds, I thought. There's a TV in the mirror! The room�a deluxe king�came with a separate sitting area, complete with a sofa bed, chair, bar and large flat-screen TV. Dramatic, modernist touches included an all-black floor lamp and a bulbous glass bureau lamp that, upon close inspection, revealed miniature people, upside-down, at the top of the glass. Curiouser and curiouser. People trapped in a lamp trapped in a room at the Time Hotel. And, while, all these cool, cutting-edge elements adds to the whimsy and fun of the hotel, the most important details were not ignored: a large, comfortable bed, a sound-proof room, a powerful waterfall showerhead. That was, of course, what added to the plush comfort of the whole experience. Next on the agenda was dinner at the popular Serafina Italian restaurant, with several around the city, and one located in the hotel. A drink at the bar set the tone for a fine meal�a perfectly chilled and balanced Grey Goose martini. After that, my guest and I made our way into the lively dining room and feasted on prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella, avocado and baby shrimp salad and saut�ed branzino with tomatoes. The dining room at Serafina After the leisurely dinner, we headed back to our room just in time to catch the Christian Bale version of the film �Batman� on our wondrous mirror-turned-television. The morning brought another bracing cup of Goldfinch coffee, croissants and a trip Downtown. My friend had never been on the High Line. We were fortunate in that it was a Monday, as the fascinating, former elevated freight train tracks-turned park is usually packed on the weekends. On this day, though, there was plenty of room to meander up and down, admiring the views of the Hudson, the Meatpacking District and surrounding skyline, as well as the wild and cultivated plants and trees, and marvelously designed sculptures and benches, the latter which seemed (as a result of their creative design) to melt into the cement. The High Line It is impossible for me not to stop in at the Whitney Museum of American Art when I am this close to that museum (literally next to the High Line, on the southern end), and I was glad I did, as I had not yet seen �An Incomplete History of Protest,� currently on exhibit. From photographs to videos to artifacts (like this wall of protest posters), it brought visitors up close and personal to the concept of civil revolution, and how many obstacles get in the way of making a democratic culture truly free for everyone. The wall of protest posters from �An Incomplete HIstory of Protest.� The day was finished with a truly original lunch experience at the gorgeously appointed Santina restaurant a block away. Between the bewitching and wholly unusual dishes (Italian chickpea pancakes filled with crunchy avocado paste, branzino crudo and a grapefruit dessert you have to eat to believe) and the exquisite Murano chandeliers, I was completely enchanted.
Hotel Okura Tokyo to be Reborn as The Okura Tokyo in September 2019 TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun 25, 2018--Hotel Okura Co., Ltd. announced today the much-anticipated opening of The Okura Tokyo in early September of 2019, replacing the highly reputed but aging Hotel Okura Tokyo. The Okura Tokyo will reprise the former Hotel Okura Tokyo�s famed traditional Japanese beauty as well as its cherished simplicity and elegance to offer a new combination of �traditional luxury� and �contemporary luxury.� A total of 508 luxury rooms will be available in two buildings on the spacious central-Tokyo Okura property, about half of which will be covered with lush gardens and greenery. Advanced reservations for individuals will be accepted from April 2019; reservations for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions will be possible from September 2018. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180625005791/en/ The Okura Prestige Tower's lobby will be a reprise of the original Hotel Okura Tokyo lobby, proudly carrying on the Okura's tradition of beautiful Japanese aesthetics. Decorations will include signature legacy pieces such as the Okura Lantern ceiling lights, lacquered tables and chairs arranged like plum flowers, the world map and clock, and paper lamps. Also, the Shibenka Four Petal Flowers silk brocade designed by Japanese "human national treasure" Kenkichi Tomimoto and shoji paper windows with the Asanoha-mon leaf-pattern lattice work are being painstakingly recreated to assume their positions in the new lobby. (Photo: Business Wire) The smaller of the two buildings, The Okura Heritage Wing, which will have its own reception, will be a 75-meter, 17-story structure with refreshing views of gardens and greenery on three sides. The Wing will be a top-end luxury hotel with a tasteful, classically Japanese atmosphere. The beloved Yamazato Japanese restaurant will make its awaited return, as will the renowned Chosho-an tea ceremony room, making the Wing the perfect choice for special gatherings in elegant Japanese settings. The larger Okura Prestige Tower will be a 188-meter, 41-story structure combining premium quality accented with refined Japanese aesthetics. Guest rooms will begin on the 28 th floor, affording wonderful vistas of Tokyo from every room. The Tower will offer fine dining options and banquet facilities, including one of the largest ballrooms of any hotel in Tokyo to establish The Okura Tokyo immediately as a premier venue for prestigious international conferences. �As Leonardo da Vinci said, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This is what we are trying to realize with The Okura Tokyo, a hotel designed on the philosophy of simplicity and elegance,� said Toshihiro Ogita, President of Hotel Okura. �It was sad to put our much-adored Hotel Okura Tokyo to rest, but I am fully confident that The Okura Tokyo will be equally loved by our worldwide guests and visitors. The Okura Tokyo will proudly offer the incomparable Japanese-style hospitality and other attributes that distinguished our original hotel, which we will combine with the highest standards of contemporary luxury to ensure that guests enjoy memorable, supremely comfortable stays.� The Okura Museum of Art will also make its second coming on the property. Originally established in 1917 as Japan�s first privately operated art museum, it will once again attract art lovers from the world over with a celebrated collection that includes some 2,500 works of art, among which are three National Treasures, 13 Important Cultural Properties and 44 Important Art Objects designated by the Japanese government. The traditionally themed museum building will be one of the design elements comprising the property�s impressive new entrance, The Okura Square, which will also feature a large waterscape that reflects the changing seasons and times of day. The original Hotel Okura Tokyo opened its doors in 1962 as a first-class hotel that was quickly prized worldwide for its traditional Japanese beauty combined with the very best accommodations, cuisine and service. Legacy decorations from the original hotel will grace the new lobby of The Okura Prestige Tower, including distinctive hexagonal Okura Lantern ceiling lights, lacquered tables and chairs arranged like plum flowers, the world map and clock displaying global time zones, and quietly elegant standing paper lamps. A number of other decorations will be faithfully reproduced for the new lobby. These will include the Four Petal Flowers wall tapestry, a Nishijin -weave silk brocade originally designed by Japanese �human national treasure� Kenkichi Tomimoto, and shoji paper windows with the Asanoha-mon leaf-pattern lattice work. In addition, the lobbies of The Okura Heritage Wing and The Okura Prestige Tower, The Okura Square, The Okura Salon, and selected restaurants and bars have been designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, celebrated architect of the redesigned Museum of Modern Art in New York and son of Yoshiro Taniguchi, designer of the Hotel Okura Tokyo�s famous lobby, a further nod to the Okura legacy. �The original lobby designed by my father was extremely popular,� said Yoshio Taniguchi, �so I felt a special responsibility to create distinctive Japanese designs that would similarly inspire guests for years to come.� The company also unveiled today The Okura Heritage Brand, a new brand that emphasizes traditional Japanese dignity and elegance, to complement its existing The Okura Prestige Brand. The Okura Tokyo will be the Okura family�s first �Two Brand, One Operation� hotel, a concept that the company will expand going forward. Further details are provided together with a rendering of The Okura Tokyo in a concept movie unveiled today.

MSP group considering developer selection The Missouri State Penitentiary Community Partners will consider using a pre-qualifying process when selecting a potential developer for the 32-acre redevelopment site. Before drafting the request for proposal for the Missouri State Penitentiary redevelopment site, the partners want to hear various developers' ideas for the area. Jefferson City Area Chamber of Commerce President Randy Allen proposed a pre-qualification process that would allow the partners to receive ideas from developers. If approved by the group, it would create a short qualifications list and provide historical background on the property to any interested consultants or developers. Members would interview those interested, hear their proposals and narrow it down to a few developers. The group then would create a more detailed RFP and select a developer. This would allow the group to see "the best of both worlds" when deciding between an at-risk developer, broker developer who acts more as a consultant, or a developer that is a mixture of the two. "The committee is conflicted which kind of developer we want, so what I was thinking was this gives us the opportunity to get their advice, get preliminary advice from all these folks who we might gather in this net," Allen said. This was the same process used when a group selected a developer to restore stone work as part of the Missouri State Capitol construction renovations, said Cathy Brown, Missouri Office of Administration director of facilities. While the process does take more time, she added, "it's worth it in the end." Avenue HQ co-owner Holly Stitt warned the MSPCP to be cautious about not excluding potential ideas or developers if the group decides to use the pre-qualification process. "Just keep an open mind for what the possibilities might be," she said. The city must select a developer within two years of closing on the land conveyance and begin construction within four years, according to a finalized land conveyance agreement between the city and state. The Jefferson City Council approved the agreement last month. After hearing from developers, the group hopes to include in the RFP any public improvements and uses that are not already laid out in the finalized land conveyance agreement, such as transportation from the old prison site to the downtown area and state Capitol building. Members said after selecting a developer, they want to hold public sessions to hear residents' ideas for potential features on the nearly 32 acres. Primary uses for the redevelopment site would include hotels, entertainment venues, office buildings, museums and convention centers, according to the agreement. The city could construct secondary uses like full-service and fast-casual restaurants, bars, coffee shops and retail establishments, as long as these features do not exceed 10,000 square feet each. Other uses could include parking spaces, one parking structure, green spaces and pedestrian plazas. Not allowed on the redevelopment site are traditional fast-food restaurants, restaurants or retail establishments with drive-thru facilities, an enclosed shopping mall, or other residential uses besides condominium units and loft-style apartments. All buildings and improvements would be of similar style to the existing Missouri State Penitentiary historic structures. As part of the redevelopment, the city must construct the MSP Parkway, which would extend Chestnut Street northward and provide vehicular access between the Lafayette Street cul-de-sac and Chestnut Street. The group agreed to not set limitations on the type of public incentives a developer could use when developing the property, including tax increment financing and community improvement districts. Ward 5 Councilman Jon Hensley cautioned the group of "dangling a bunch of money in front of" developers, though. The city currently has an RFP out requesting special economic development counsel, City Counselor Ryan Moehlman said, so whoever is awarded a contract could provide the MSPCP some guidance on the project. The MSPCP will do a walk-through tour of the redevelopment area at 9 a.m. June 29. The 32-acre redevelopment does not include the historical buildings used for prison tours, as the historic buildings will remain in the state's possession, including the gas chamber. Former Gov. Eric Greitens signed over the nearly 32 acres to Jefferson City last July after legislative approval.

A shell's throw from Summerleaze Beach, a romantic walk along the shoreline is mere moments away. Alternatively, why not enjoy one of their super relaxing spa treatments inside: luxe manicures and pedicures, or a full body massage? Head Chef Joe Simmonds has been classically trained under Sam Moody at the Michelin-starred restaurant, The Priory, so some truly delicious dishes await in the restaurant, including food that really focuses on the region: Cornish mussels, tempura squid, baked fillet of plaice and pan-seared scallops. It's charming, chilled out and comes Mr & Mrs Smith-recommended. Book away. thebeachatbude.co.uk WEST CORNWALL St. Ives Carbis Bay Hotel & Estate (Carbis Bay Hotel) Offers award-winning spa experiences. Need we say more? We'd opt for the 'Lava Glow' - a 30-minute lava shell back massage with a half-hour tailored facial. PLUS a comp glass of bubbles. All for �75. (You're welcome...) Whilst they offer family apartment suites, beachside houses and valley cottages, we'd be more than happy in a Deluxe room, thank you very much. Overlooking St. Ives Bay with a marble bathroom, rainhead shower and a kingsize bed, really, what more does one need? The Beach Club is where to head on sunny days - their breakfast menu offers a delicious Cornish Crab Omelette - and for sunset at night, book a table at the two-rosetted Sands Restaurant. Blackcurrant poached salmon, hake en papillote, lamb wellington and, for pudding, a 'Ferris Wheel of Fun to Share'? Oh, stoppit... carbisbayhotel.co.uk Gannet Inn (Gannet Inn) Lots of lovely rooms to choose from at the Gannet Inn (sister hotel to the Carbis Bay Hotel, Spa & Estate) but it was the 'Quirky' rooms that rather piqued our interest. What makes a 'Quirky Room' such? They're in-keeping with the original building (exposed brick walls) yet still maintain an elegant feel. Interesting... 'Hungry Gannets' can enjoy hearty British fare in the restaurant - beef burgers, beef wellingtons, beer-battered fish and breaded scampi - whilst 'Thirsty Gannets' can wet their whistle from noon to 11pm (if they so choose) on Cosmos, Tom Collins', Negronis and Martinis galore. Best of all, guests get access to the C Bay Spa next door. All the perks of a grand hotel, from the comfort of a luxury little inn. Bliss! gannetstives.co.uk Headland House Hotel (Headland House Hotel) For an intimate getaway, why not consider a luxury B&B? Headland House is one such hotel, offering breathtaking views of the turquoise sea at Carbis Bay from the comfort of cosy rooms within. Heligan Garden Guestroom - named after the famous gardens of Heligan - houses a spacious king bed with an en-suite including a double end slipper bath attached. In keeping with its namesake it also has a garden; a secluded spot with table and chairs in which you and your amore can while away the hours. With a breakfast room, conservatory and - when the weather is fine - an outdoor terrace, it's a picturesque scene that awaits you during your morning meal in this hotel - one which consists of outstanding local produce, too. Yum. headlandhousehotel.co.uk Penzance Chapel House (Chapel House Hotel) For a staycation with history, look to Chapel House in Penzance. Merging Georgian style with '� la mode' comfort, their six sizable double rooms all boast sea views and oak-made double beds with ultra modern decors (like fluorescent blue bedheads and neon pink sofa cushions). Most of the ingredients served up at Chapel House dining room are sourced from the surrounding region. Fish features (naturally), with their West Cornish speciality breakfast - sizzled cod roe, smoked bacon, samphire and a poached egg - providing a delightful seafood alternative to the traditional English. Kitchen Supper is served from 6:30-8:30pm every Friday and Saturday, whilst 'Grazing' is available (or 'access to tea, coffee and cake') around the clock. chapelhousepz.co.uk Falmouth Merchants Manor (Merchants Manor) Any hotel that boasts its very own woodfire called Bertha has to be worth checking out. 'From cooking sourdough to smoking the fish for breakfast, she can do just about anything'. Oh,Bertha, you had us at 'sourdough'. This luxury spa hotel includes a 2 AA Rosette restaurant which takes the best from the coast and countryside and brings it to the plate. Take, for instance, TR11 - 'Local Forage, Hedgerow Greens, Herb Custard'. Who could say no? 'Bertha Fried Philip Warren Steak'...? (Go, Bertha!) Merchants Manor isn't just about the food though. It's also about the spa: a place for Chavutti Thirumals (a southern Indian massage), yoga treatments, plus it also has a technogym and a pool. It has pretty luxe accommodation as well. From Cosy Single rooms for the lone traveller, to the doubled bedroom-ed Luxury Residences (with their very own private terrace), truly, you are spoiled for choice. merchantsmanor.com SOUTH Fowey The Old Quay House (The Old Quay House) In the midst of Fowey, lies the Old Quay House Hotel, a boutique refuge which plays host to 11 elegant bedrooms and a scenic waterfront restaurant. Choose between the Loft, Deluxe, Superior or Classic Rooms, each with baths and showers included, some with Estuary views, all replete with White Company goodies. On the menu at the restaurant downstairs, Head Chef Richard Massey delivers cured sea trout, roast monkfish and Cornish cod loin, whilst on the cocktail menu you'll find popular highballs like the Paloma, Bellinis and Dark and Stormies a-plenty. And with one night's stay starting at �180 for a double room, undeniably, it's excellent value. theoldquayhouse.com Portscatho Driftwood (Driftwood) A stay at Driftwood comes with a Michelin-starred restaurant so you'll certainly not go hungry. Yes, it has marine-inspired rooms, with homely touches like gingham headboards and cosy, cream-coloured walls. But it's the extras which set it apart: acres of private garden to meander around, a sheltered sun terrace to suntan, and a private beach and cove to explore. Then, of course, there's the Michelin-starred restaurant. Head Chef Chris Eden once worked under Phil Howard at The Square and Paul Gayler at The Lanesborough, so we know he's learned from the best. A typical dinner includes 'Blonde Ray Wing, Jerusalem Artichoke with Samphire' or 'New Season Loin of Lamb with Honey Glazed Aubergine' and, if you have room for pudding, 'Curgurrell Corner Lemon Verbena Sorbet with White Chocolate and Macadamia Nuts'. Yup, pick up a fork and get stuck in. driftwoodhotel.co.uk Saltash Pentillie Castle & Estate (Pentillie Castle) If you fancy feeling like a prince or princess on hols, check into a Cornish castle: specifically, Pentillie Castle. Built by Sir James Tillie in 1698, Pentillie Castle is situated just 20 minutes from Plymouth city centre and comes with no less than 55 acres of woodland gardens to explore. There's even Sir James Tillie�s Mausoleum to investigate so you won't be short of things to do. Overlooking the River Tamar, settle into one of the award-winning rooms, all en-suite, all elegantly furnished, all remarkably reasonably priced (the Dewhurst Suite, a four-poster-bed suite, for instance, is just �210 per night from Sun-Thurs). Food-wise? Only �35 per head for three courses, canapes and coffee with petit fours - but if that's a bit much, DIY suppers are available as well: pre-made lasagnes, pies and curries can be heated up in the hotel AGA by your fair hand, to enjoy no more than 20 minutes later. Couldn't be easier. pentillie.co.uk Truro The Nare (The Nare) One of the larger hotels on the list, The Nare houses no less than 37 bedrooms all with a country house feel. Think dressing tables with mirrors and comfy armchairs and sofas, writing desks and double sinks. For old-fashioned Britain, book in here. With panoramic views over Carne beach, you can take a dip in the sea just minutes after leaving your room. Or if your preference is more outdoor swimming pool and/or a sea view hottub, know they have those as well. This hotel is for the active holidaymaker. Fancy a quick game of tennis? A sporting round of croquet? A kayaking tour, fishing trip, horse ride or guided walk? All are available here. Afterwards, feast on slow-cooked pork belly, flamb�d malt whisky venison or a sumptuous seafood platter. Then collapse into bed, have a restful sleep and do it all over again the next day. narehotel.co.uk Hotel Tresanton (Tresanton Hotel) Owned by Olga Polizzi - sister of hotelier Sir Rocoo Forte, mother to broadcaster Alex Polizzi - you can expect nothing but the best from this Cornish delight. With 30 rooms, some with their own terrace, Hotel Tresanton offers Cornish decor (in its art and antiques) with buckets of rustic charm. Dinner is served in a candlelit restaurant and delivers the best of the region's produce: cauliflower soup with Welsh rarebit, Crab mayonnaise, Cornish pork chop and halibut with mash. For breakfast, it's West country yoghurt, poached eggs or (AND!) oily delicious kippers. When not eating or exploring nearby St Ives - specifically, the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden - try out one of the hotel treatments: a Swedish/Holistic massage, an Inlight Body Embrace, or an Inlight Organic Facial. Or simply relax on one of the sun loungers of the hotel's Mediterranean-style Beach Club, looking out over the pure blue waters beyond. Because Cornwall, if nothing else, is all about the sea - isn't it? tresanton.com

Although dwarves are not known for their love of trees and animals of the surface world, they are well known for their often obsessive fascination with stone and earth. The stone sage channels this affinity to establish a kinship with the stone and with creatures from the elemental plane of earth that is unmatched by most other races.
Spells: A stone druid learns, prepares, and cast spells as a druid. In addition, a stone druid removes summon nature’s ally from his spell list and replaces it with summon monster. When using summon monster, the stone druid can only summon earth elementals or creatures with the earth subtype.
Bonus Language: This is exactly like the druids ability of the same name, except that a stone sage’s bonus language options include Terran, the language of earth-based creatures, instead of Sylvan.
Improved Stonecunning (Ex): A stone sage’s sense for stonework becomes uncanny. His bonus on Perception checks to notice unusual stonework increases to +4. This ability replaces nature sense.
Nature Bond (Ex): This is exactly like the druid ability of the same name, except that if the stone sage selects the nature bond, he must select either the Earth domain or one of its subdomains. Alternatively, if a stone sage selects the companion bond, he gains a Small earth elemental as his companion, and uses the Animal Companion table for advancement, as normal. At 4th level, the elemental companion increases one size category to Medium, and an additional size category to Large at 10th level. Apply bonuses and penalties as normal due to size change (see Bestiary).
Spontaneous Casting: This is exactly like the druid ability of the same name, except that a stone sage can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any summon monster spell of the same level or lower. A stone sage always summons an earth elemental or earth-based creature of the appropriate size and Hit Dice.
Stone Walk (Su): At 3rd level, a stone sage can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 1/2 his stone sage level + his Wisdom modifier. If protected against fire damage, he can even glide through lava. This mode of travel leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where the stone sage is located flings him back 30 feet, stunning him for 1 round unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save. This ability otherwise functions as the earth glide ability. This ability replaces woodland stride and trackless step.
Earthen Resilience (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a stone sage gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells and the spell-like abilities with the earth descriptor. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that deal acid damage, such as acid arrow, acid fog, acid splash, and corrosive touch. This ability replaces resist nature’s lure.
Wild Shape (Su): This is exactly like the druid ability of the same name, except that a stone sage can only transform himself into an earth elemental.
At 4th level, a stone sage gains the ability to turn himself into a Small earth elemental. When taking the form of an elemental, the stone sage’s wild shape functions as elemental body I.
At 8th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Medium earth elemental as if using elemental body II.
At 10th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Large earth elemental as if using elemental body III.
At 16th level, a druid can use wild shape to change into a Gargantuan earth elemental. This functions as elemental body IV except that the stone sage gains a +10 size bonus to your Strength, a -2 penalty on your Dexterity, a +6 size bonus to your Constitution, and a +8 natural armor bonus.
Stone Tell (Sp): At 9th level, a stone sage gains the ability to speak with stones, whether natural or worked stone, at will. This ability functions as the stone tell spell. This ability replaces venom immunity.
Stoneskin (Sp): At 13th level, a stone sage can harden his skin, turning aside even the most brutal of physical attacks. He can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to his stone sage level + his Wisdom modifier. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 1-minute increments. This ability otherwise functions as the stoneskin spell. This ability replaces a thousand faces.
Iron Body (Sp): At 17th level, a stone sage can, as a standard action, transform his body into living iron as the iron body spell for a number of rounds per day equal to his stone sage level. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. This ability replaces timeless body.
The German government has for quite some time maintained that the chief purpose of Scientology is not religious, but economical in nature. According to the Government, Scientology disguises itself as a religion if this might be advantageous. For example, in the remainder of Yugoslawia Scientology has claimed to be a non-religious organization. In Greece, Scientology (KEFE) claimed to be a philosophical, not a religious organization. And when Scientology as founded in South America in 1955, one of its goals was "... to lend and borrow money" (this slip has since then been corrected).
The German government maintains that Scientology is dangerous for its members and possibly dangerous for society. Members are spending huge efforts and large amounts of money; high debts (> 50,000 US$) are not uncommon. Wages are low, often below welfare levels.
Some of Scientology's activities are aimed at subversively invading the nation's economy. This is especially true in the areas of management training and real estate business.
The Scientology Public Relations Campaign Against Germany. Distributed by the German embassy in the U.S.
The German government has also written a fairly detailed response to allegations which were brought by Scientology before the ECOSOC in 1993. It turned out that many of the allegations were fabrications and could not be verified.
The Senate (state parliament) in the German state of Hamburg in 1992 founded a workgroup on Scientology, the head of which is Ursula Caberta. This group has published at least two documents (in German, of course):
The Bavarian Government is implementing a catalog of measures against Scientology to "protect its citizens". The measures are intended to force Scientology organizations to pay their taxes, to intensify public awareness of Scientology and to protect the state from Scientology infiltration.
In 1994, the department of the interior of the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen commissioned an advisory opinion about the "effects of applying the ideas of Scientology to a pluralistic society in a democratic state". The opinion, authored by PD Dr. Jaschke, Frankfurt, states that -- although different from current extremistic parties -- Scientology has the hallmarks of a totalitarian organization, is mainly political and economical in nature and aims at the abolishing of democracy.

Add a centerpiece to your bathroom with a fabulous freestanding tub. They are a bathroom upgrade that adds value to your home and a sense luxury to the room. Claw foot tubs are no longer the only option. The new freestanding tub designs are sculptural, modern and fluid looking – the perfect centerpiece for any bathroom design.
For the ultimate memorable shower, consider the use of alternative materials. Teak wood flooring tiles, corrugated aluminum walls or colored (instead of clear) glass doors make for some unique shower ideas. Many homeowners are looking for contemporary shower ideas to create their dream bathroom. Regardless of what inspiration you take, remember to choose the best-quality materials you can afford, and keep your bathroom simple, uncluttered and low-maintenance.

Normally when one hears of sexual harassment allegations being filed, one assumes that it is by a female against a male. The reality is quite different, and it is imperative to understand that anyone, regardless of gender, has the right to speak up against mistreatment. Still, it can be easy to misunderstand what options you…
In today’s climate, where sexual harassment claims in the workplace are being given more credence than ever before. Indeed, the workplace has been highlighted as a space where many of these episodes occur. While sexual harassment is never okay, it can be especially egregious in the workplace because very often, the victim has little recourse…
Sexual harassment at work is still a problem in this day and age. In reality, what once used to be overt has gone further underground, and become more subtle. As such, more misconceptions about what constitutes harassment have propagated. It is imperative to be able to distinguish between truth and misinformation. Myth: Only women have…
Despite belief to the contrary, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination in the workplace, most often carried out against those whose gender or sexuality differs from what is considered to be the norm. This does not change if your workplace is the venue. Both men and women are able to file sexual harassment claims,…
Many of us have used the term harassment before, almost always in a colloquial sense. However, there is a legal category of behavior known as harassment, and it is almost always grounds on which a complaint may be made to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). If you believe that you have been the victim…
Sometimes, when a job ends, it does so on bad terms. It is sadly not uncommon for employers to take the opportunity, after an employee has moved on, to speak ill of them for a variety of reasons. However, within certain circumstances, to do so is against South Carolina law. If an employer oversteps their…
Though it may not seem like it, even federal institutions do change. Because it happens so infrequently, however, people can be blindsided by it, to the detriment of any business they may have with the agency. Such is the case with the March 2016 changes in procedure at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Staying…
Our jobs are not as secure as they perhaps once were. In this day and age, more and more companies are choosing to focus on the bottom line, and sometimes, this can result in mistakes and outright ill treatment from employers that have obligations to treat us better. If you ever wind up in the…
Individuals have the right to a work in an environment that is free from discrimination based on their immutable characteristics. If you experience mistreatment based on your membership in a protected class, you have the right to bring suit against your employer. However, sometimes this results in retaliation, either in the form of more mistreatment,…

Seminyak is a mixed tourist residential area on the west coast of Bali in Indonesia, just north of Kuta and Legian.
Originally a separate township, this is now another suburb of Kuta. This area is very popular with resident expatriates and land and accommodation prices are amongst the highest in Bali. Plenty of luxury spas and hotels abound. Owing to its high density of high-end shopping, combined with the clustering of many fine eating establishments, it has rapidly become one of the most well-known tourist areas on the island.
In addition to a few commercial strips with popular and lively restaurants, bars, villas, and good crafts/furniture shops, there are a few notable establishments: Ku Dé Ta, which is a bar/restaurant with a cult following based on its beach side/semi-resort atmosphere that has earned it the title of number one party spot in various magazines, and Oberoi, which is an expensive hotel with a worldwide reputation. Jalan Raya Seminyak (more often referred to as Jalan Legian), runs parallel with the beach, bisecting the district and acts as its main road artery.

In a report compiled by professional services organization KPMG, the cloud was recently described as being a “disruptive” influence on the banking sector. However, for once, the term wasn’t being used in a negative light.
So, how can a technology like cloud computing disrupt an industry in a good way? What KPMG analysts were hinting it at was the fact that this innovation is slowly but surely turning the way we think about doing business on its head.
As far as financial companies are concerned, the report stated that the “old ways of doing business need to change” and the cloud is certainly doing that. Within a few years, a significant proportion of the population has moved to conduct their banking via their smartphone or tablet, using downloadable applications to access their accounts, move money around and set up payments – all actions that used to require a physical presence in the bank itself.
It’s a breakthrough saving consumers time and money. However, it’s not just the customer base that is profiting. The banks themselves are benefiting for increased levels of customer engagement, more efficient processes and cost savings. It’s a win-win situation for those that have invested in the technology, giving them a clear competitive advantage over those that have yet to develop their own similar platforms.
This revolution among businesses is not just limited to one specific sector though. The cloud has also been able to facilitate the emergence of big data and analytics as a key trend for the future, with many firms shifting their focus to the collection of information on anything and everything to try to gain market insight that will help them develop effective long-term strategies.
Of course, at the heart of this drive are cloud developers, with third-party suppliers like Canopy offering a range of applications that can be added to their clients’ networks via its Enterprise Applications Store.
With more choice comes more decision-making and the abundance of functions the cloud now serves has emphasised to those taking the technology seriously the importance of devising and implementing an effective cloud strategy. While it’s entirely feasible for a company to adopt a carpet bomb approach that results in an all-singing, all-dancing system, this goes against the ethos that one of the cloud’s main benefits is to provide a more efficient, cost-effective and simpler way of doing things.
It has always been the case that technological advancement pushes business onto the next level and the cloud is doing just that. Many firms have already realised the potential it offers and have invested in some level, while those that haven’t will probably end up doing so at some point – but the longer they leave it, the bigger chance there is of them falling behind.
Perhaps the most beneficial element of the cloud is its ability to create a network between businesses and their clients like never before. Sharing information and communication has never been easier, and in a world where globalisation seems to be the key to moving forward, this technology offers the potential to create an international village that has never been better connected.

Intellectual capitalism drives Bluedog. We believe an intellectual capitalist pursues freedom of choice -- and what counts is freedom in the marketplace, in the home, in one's thoughts.
Gizmodo tackles the question, “Is the iPad still relevant?” The response is a resounding yes, using examples such as:
Few devices make better digital doodling pads than the iPad paired with an Apple Pencil, and you’ve got a host of apps to help the creative juices flow, from Procreate to Paper to SketchBook. We know that “full” Photoshop is heading to the iPad from 2019, which is huge—will Illustrator follow?
To help offset carbon, Microsoft plans to plant hundreds of acres of native trees in Ireland over the next few years -- the largest corporate investment in Irish forestry in a decade. The plan by Microsoft will focus on native trees, such as Pedunculate Oak, Downy Birch, Common Alder, and Scots Pine. This will help to offset Irish greenhouse gas emissions.
There is a push by many -- including the inventor of the World Wide Web -- to make a decentralized internet more possible. There are a number of apps available that leverage this model, and this article discusses a word processing app...
The distributed web is being promoted by people I admire, including web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the Internet Archive’s Brewster Kahle and Mozilla’s Mitchell Baker. It also has a valid reason to exist: people really should own and control their own data, not just labour as unpaid serfs for surveillance capitalism. However, most people follow the line of least resistance, so the web is not going to change overnight.
Services like Graphite are worth considering if you need both encryption and the ability to share secure files online, though there are other ways to do this, such as Boxcryptor and Whisply. DWeb apps will need to become easier to use and mobile before they can reach a mass market.
Website mag InfoWorld revealed their annual list of "the leading open source projects for software development, cloud computing, big data, and machine learning." Read more at their site.
PwC, one of the so-called Big Four accountancy giants, said that it decided to embrace the gig economy after a study it carried out showed that almost 46% of 2,000 respondents prioritised flexible working hours and a good work-life balance the most when choosing a job.
A forum thread on QRZ.com indicates that the shortwave time broadcasts by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) from stations WWV (Colorado) and WWVH (Hawaii) may be slashed in budget year 2019. [One of the proposed reductions includes "$6.3 million supporting fundamental measurement dissemination, including the shutdown of NIST radio stations in Colorado and Hawaii."]
While the WWV broadcasts may seem like an anachronism to some Slashdotters, they remain a crucial component in many unexpected services, from over-the-air broadcasters and traffic signals, to medical devices, wall clocks, and wrist watches. The signals serve as standard beacons for radio propagation, and as a frequency reference for alignment of a broad range of communications equipment. It's easy to imagine that not even the NIST knows every service and device that could be impacted by this decision.
Security researchers are warning Linux system users of a bug in the Linux kernel version 4.9 and up that could be used to hit systems with a denial-of-service attack on networking kit. The warning comes from Carnegie Mellon University's CERT/CC, which notes that newer versions of the Linux kernel can be "forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service (DoS)".
It lists a number of network-equipment vendors, PC and server manufacturers, mobile vendors, and operating-system makers that may be affected but notes that it hasn't confirmed whether any of them actually are. But, given the widespread use of Linux, the bug could affect every vendor from Amazon and Apple through to Ubuntu and ZyXEL. A remote attacker could cause a DoS by sending specially modified packets within ongoing TCP sessions. But sustaining the DoS condition would mean an attacker needs to have continuous two-way TCP sessions to a reachable and open port.
An investigation carried out by Federal Communication Commission's own inspector general officially refutes controversial claims that a cyberattack was responsible for disrupting the FCC's comment system in May 2017, at the height of the agency's efforts to kill off net neutrality. The investigation also uncovered that FCC officials had provided congressional lawmakers with misleading information regarding conversations between an FCC employee and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cybercrime task force. A report from the inspector general's office (OIG) released Tuesday afternoon states that the comment system's downtime was likely caused by a combination of "system design issues" and a massive surge in traffic caused when Last Week Tonight host John Oliver directed millions of TV viewers to flood the FCC's website with pro-net neutrality comments.
Investigators were unable to "substantiate the allegations of multiple DDoS attacks" alleged by then-FCC Chief Information Officer David Bray, the report says. "At best, the published reports were the result of a rush to judgment and the failure to conduct analyses needed to identify the true cause of the disruption to system availability." [Here's an excerpt from the report:] "While we identified a small amount of anomalous activity and could not entirely rule out the possibility of individual DoS attempts during the period from May 7 through May 9, 2017, we do not believe this activity resulted in any measurable degradation of system availability given the minuscule scale of the anomalous activity relative to the contemporaneous voluminous viral traffic."
From Slashdot: Oracle has filed a protest regarding plans to award the Pentagon's huge cloud contract to a single vendor. Rebecca Hill writes:
The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract, which has a massive scope, covering different levels of secrecy and classification across all branches of the military, will run for a maximum of 10 years and is worth a potential $10 billion. In spite of this pressure from vendors and the tech lobby -- as well as concerns from Congress -- the US Department of Defense (DoD) refused to budge, and launched a request for proposals (RFP) at the end of last month. Oracle is less than impressed with the Pentagon's failure to back down, and this week filed a bid protest to congressional watchdog the Government Accountability Office asking for the RFP to be amended.
In the protest, the database goliath sets out its arguments against a single vendor award -- broadly that it could damage innovation, competition, and security. Reading between the lines, it doesn't want either of Amazon or Microsoft or Google to get the whole pie to itself, and thus endanger Oracle's cosiness with Uncle Sam. Summing up its position in a statement to The Register, Oracle said that JEDI "virtually assures DoD will be locked into legacy cloud for a decade or more" at a time when cloud technology is changing at an unprecedented pace.
Is programming becoming more difficult? Allen Downey (Professor of Computer Science at Olin College, author of Think Python, Think Stats, Think Bayes, Think Complexity and more) writes,
"The fundamental problem is that the barrier between using a computer and programming a computer is getting higher. When I got a Commodore 64 (in 1982, I think) this barrier was non-existent. When you turned on the computer, it loaded and ran a software development environment (SDE). In order to do anything, you had to type at least one line of code, even if all it did was another program (like Archon). Since then, three changes have made it incrementally harder for users to become programmers... Cloud computing has taken information hiding to a whole new level. People using web applications often have only a vague idea of where their data is stored and what applications they can use to access it. Many users, especially on mobile devices, don't distinguish between operating systems, applications, web browsers, and web applications. When they upload and download data, they are often confused about where is it coming from and where it is going. When they install something, they are often confused about what is being installed where. For someone who grew up with a Commodore 64, learning to program was hard enough. For someone growing up with a cloud-connected mobile device, it is much harder...."
Slowly but surely, more U.S. communities are realizing that the future of mobility is bigger than cars. Biking is seen as an attractive, cost effective, healthy and convenient way to get around. Bike commuting tripled in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington DC, Minneapolis, Portland and Denver from 1990 to 2012, and doubled in many other cities.
"An uplifting and emotional celebration of people and place, which captures the delicacy of the natural world; the heart and soul of a farmer-poet, Patrick McCormack; and the ancient rural spirit of Ireland which stands behind him. The Story is centered around Patrick and the land, The Burren, Western Ireland. A wild place where Mesolithic tombs, famine villages and present day small rocky fields are like jewels telling of our long human story on these hills. Patrick longs to farm in the quite pace his ascendants did. But his life gains a different momentum when he’s called to Battle in the Supreme courts to decide on the fate of this iconic wilderness."
The American manufacturers aren't going to come in and sell them at the lower price. All that's being done is lower the demand after raising the prices. This is going to put a lot more people who were installing the panels out of work than the number of people who ever going to be employed making them. There are 10,000s people in the US working to install panels and that work can't be outsourced to any other country. Who cares where the panels come from? The cheaper they are, the more projects (residential and industrial) will become viable and started meaning more people employed.
Perhaps you feel the urge to do more, with less? Or you appreciate a well-crafted tool, to make life better? Or you want freedom of expression, of thought?

Hollinghurst and Roth polled 16 votes apiece, two more than Colm Tóibín's The Master (14). Novels, generally, outpolled non-fiction, where the only two books to reach double figures were A Tale of Love and Darkness by Amos Oz (13) and Chronicles Volume One by Bob Dylan (11).
Last year I made a rough, unscientific list of the best of the best books of the year. I had another look at the lists this year and my unscientific methodology produced this list of non-fiction books of 2004 that made it to several best-of lists. In descending order of popularity they are:
Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001, Steve Coll
American Dynasty: Aristocracy, Fortune, and the Politics of Deceit in the House of Bush, Kevin Phillips
Galleycat has already compiled a list of the best of the best fiction, which is topped by these books:
"To put it bluntly, I didn't see any honest case for giving Bush a second term, and was angered by the dishonest case--he's done a brilliant job of fighting terrorists, he's a tower of wisdom and resolve, he's going to control big government, he's going to protect traditional values, he's got a second-term agenda to create an "ownership society"--advanced by his campaign.
"Moreover, I came to believe strongly that the real agenda of the people closest to Bush--including his political advisors and much of the Republican congressional leadership--was not only dishonest, but deeply cynical and irresponsible: a drive to simultaneously wreck the federal government and to perpetuate their control over the wreckage as long as possible through the exercise of the rawest sort of institutional power and corruption. And moreover, this belief made me angry at even those Republicans who did not share that agenda, because they were helping to promote it against their own best instincts."

The Network interface is a "higher-level" interface to networking facilities, and it is recommended unless you need the lower-level interface in Network.Socket.
On Windows operating systems, the networking subsystem has to be initialised using withSocketsDo before any networking operations can be used. eg.
Although this is only strictly necessary on Windows platforms, it is harmless on other platforms, so for portability it is good practice to use it all the time.
maxListenQueue (typically 128) is specified to the listen queue. This is good enough for normal network servers but is too small for high performance servers.
If available, the IPv6Only socket option is set to 0 so that both IPv4 and IPv6 can be accepted with this socket.
Triple of: read/write Handle for communicating with the client, the HostName of the peer socket, and the PortNumber of the remote connection.
Accept a connection on a socket created by listenOn. Normal I/O operations (see System.IO) can be used on the Handle returned to communicate with the client. Notice that although you can pass any Socket to Network.accept, only sockets of either AF_UNIX, AF_INET, or AF_INET6 will work (this shouldn't be a problem, though). When using AF_UNIX, HostName will be set to the path of the socket and PortNumber to -1.
Calling connectTo creates a client side socket which is connected to the given host and port. The Protocol and socket type is derived from the given port identifier. If a port number is given then the result is always an internet family Stream socket.
Send and receive data from/to the given host and port number. These should normally only be used where the socket will not be required for further calls. Also, note that due to the use of hGetContents in recvFrom the socket will remain open (i.e. not available) even if the function already returned. Their use is strongly discouraged except for small test-applications or invocations from the command line.
The Handle returned by connectTo and accept is block-buffered by default. For an interactive application you may want to set the buffering mode on the Handle to LineBuffering or NoBuffering, like so:
For really fast I/O, it might be worth looking at the hGetBuf and hPutBuf family of functions in System.IO.
On Unix, when writing to a socket and the reading end is closed by the remote client, the program is normally sent a SIGPIPE signal by the operating system. The default behaviour when a SIGPIPE is received is to terminate the program silently, which can be somewhat confusing if you haven't encountered this before. The solution is to specify that SIGPIPE is to be ignored, using the POSIX library:

Wombat's Gaming Den of Iniquity: [RPGaDay 2017] Day 4: Which RPG have you played the most since August 2016?
I've mostly played Classic Traveller. I actually ran The Bospor Incident at PAX East back in March. I've got some feedback, and I need to print some more Data Point cards to give some more information to the players, but it went well. I may need to rework the stats for Mongoose Traveller and see how that works - probably pretty well.
That was an easy determination to make, because I can count on two fingers the times I've played RPGs in the past year. Lordy, that needs to change.
I typically find myself with 30-90 minutes of free time well after dark. That's not conducive to playing, in my mind. Definitely not face-to-face, anyway. I'll work on it, but the house renovation is totally capitalizing my time.

Synopsis: The Libertine--filmed in a grainy, color-muted chiaroscuro--captures the lush costumes, extravagant decor, and remarkable filth of Restoration England. John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester (Johnny Depp), warns the audience at the very beginning of the film that they will not like him. From there, he treats his wife cruelly, drinks to relentless excess, abuses his friendships, and generally wallows in dissipation, much to the dismay of King Charles II (John Malkovich), who hopes that Rochester will write a play glorifying his reign.
But Rochester finds his true inspiration when he sees a young actress named Lizzie Barry (Samantha Morton). Rochester sets out to make her the greatest actress of their time--and she, with some reluctance, submits to his teaching. The weakness of The Libertine is not that Rochester is unlikable; it's that he doesn't want to do anything. Barry galvanizes the movie because she burns with ambition, but Rochester's only apparent aim in life is an agonizingly slow self-destruction. Still, The Libertine has lurid Saturnalian visions, Morton is superb, Malkovich gives a typically insidious turn, and Depp, as always, finds moments of sad poetry in the bitterest of speeches.

ELECTED is into the galley phase, which means that the publisher has put it in the format required by major distributors. It now looks like a real book with a table of contents, cool font for the start of each chapter, etc. I am combing it over, looking for any last, small changes (like commas, words that got smushed together incorrectly in the switch from MS Word to the new galley software, etc.)
I’m almost finished editing the galley, and thank goodness I’ve looked at it. There were definitely things to catch. People are very critical of errors in books. When you’re reading and you see an error, even a small one, doesn’t it take you out of the story and remind you it’s just a book instead of a real story? Errors cause that response in me, as I’m sure they do in others, which is why it’s important to make sure all of the typos found in this final version. This is the last time I get to edit/see the book before it goes out as an ARC (advanced reader copy) to bloggers and reviewers…and then goes on presale…and then is available for the masses!
I got the galley one day before my birthday, which was such a good present. Seeing the book in its final format took my breath away. It’s the culmination of hard work from so many people, not just myself. My favorite part was seeing the dedication and acknowledgements inside the novel. And my publisher was supportive of adding a preview of book 2 in the ELECTED series, which was neat to see included as well.
World Thinking Day is celebrated by Girl Guides around the world and has taken place annually since 1926. It's a day when everyone in guiding across the world explores and celebrates how we’re all part of a bigger movement, the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts.

I moved from Michigan to California about ten years ago and since then have learned a few things about caring for my skin during the winter. Now that I’m in my thirties and have three little children, remembering to take care of my skin, and finding the time to do it, is often difficult. So I’ve rounded up a few of my best tips for taking care of your skin during those cold winter months….and the best part is they are all super easy and super fast! I’ve partnered with one of my favorite brands, Dove, for this post.
1. Drink plenty of water. File this tip under things that are just plain good for you. I have a giant water bottle I carry around with me at all times and make it a point to fill it up multiple times a day. Staying hydrated will help your skin stain moisturized even in the dry winter air.
2. Use sunscreen! It seems like a given during the warmer months, but don’t forget to use sunscreen in the winter too. Dove dermatologist Dr. Alicia Barba reminds us that the sun is still out, even if you don’t see it, and the sun’s reflection on any snow can be particularly damaging. So wear your sunscreen. I use a moisturizer every morning with SPF 30 and I have SPF in my makeup too.
3. Care for your underarms. The skin under my arms is super sensitive, especially in the winter. Dr. Alicia Barba says wearing lots of layers of clothes can of irritate underarm skin. Underneath all of those layers you’ll need an antiperspirant that is formulated with moisturizers to help alleviate irritation. I started using Dove Advanced Care Antiperspirant about a year ago and love that it leaves me with softer and smother underarms.
4. Exfoliate gently. Don’t go overboard, but gently exfoliate your skin in the shower regularly. You’ll want to use a gentle soap (and not scrub too hard). I like to use Dove’s body wash with a loofa. Exfoliating your skin regularly will help get rid of that dead skin and keep you feeling fresh. But if you do it too often or too hard you can dehydrate your skin, so be careful!
5. Detoxify once a week. During the winter I like to use a mask every now and then to tone and purify my skin. I typically do this at night for a few minutes after the kids have all gone to bed.
6. Take care of your lips! Keeping your lips moisturized is essential in the winter. I LOVE to use Lanolin on my lips. Most breastfeeding moms already have this in their home. It’s nice and thick and stays on for a long time. Perfect for the winter!
7. Use a humidifier. A humidifier in your bedroom at night can be life changing during the dry winter months! Adding some humidity to the air can help your skin feel better…and help you if you have a stuffy nose too!
8. Take a multivitamin. You should do this year round…but it’s really important in the winter too. I like to take an extra dose of vitamin D in the winter too.
9. Wear gloves. This one may seem silly. But usually when I’m trying to wrangle three kids in their winter gear I often forget about bundling up myself. Gloves help protect the sensitive skin on your hands from the cold. My hands are especially prone to being extra dry in the winter, and one trip outside without gloves will make everything way worse. So protect your hands!
10. Get a pedicure! I know it sounds crazy to get a pedicure in the winter, but it’s the perfect time! My feet are neglected when it’s cold and in desperate need of a little extra attention. I had a pedicure the other day and it really helped my poor, dry, winter feet! I had to wait a little longer for my nails to dry (since I had to put on socks and boots!) but it was totally worth it.
I choose to use Dove Advanced Care because it also cares for your skin and provides 48-hour odor and wetness protection. I used to suffer from razor burn under my arms and regular deodorant seemed to irritate my skin and make it worse. Once I switched to Dove Advanced Care my skin felt so much better.

For over 40 years, at FINE, we have produced natural healthy products and pure extracts of the highest quality from nature, specializing in product enhancement with master extraction processes and blending facilities.
Where possible our products are certified Organic, where not we apply the highest standards in producing or obtaining quality pure ingredients. Certification standards are only the beginning of the standards we require of ourselves.
We are constantly testing for molds, pesticides and toxic impurities, as we prepare and formulate products that are considered by our discriminating clientele, among the finest foods and supplements available in the world.
A company that extracts specific essences from natural plants and animals in the safest possible way and blending them in food and supplement products is a Nutraceutical Company. Unlike Pharmaceutical Companies Nutraceutical Companies do not synthesize chemical additives, vitamins or other unnatural products, preferring the synergistic power of naturally occurring substances for health. In the Nutraceutical industry FINE takes the responsibility to meet and exceed the highest standards of preparation and processing. Leadership is a key component of our life ethic. Carefully extracting special plant and animal essences and blending them back with whole food sources, in vital healthful products, is one of our recognized specialties.
Underprotection is a perfect example of a sustainable brand that makes us really happy. Just have a look at their sexy bras, their fashionable bodies and their colourful kimonos and tell us you’re not in love! The best news is that all of their products are made in a fair way and with sustainable materials. Underprotection uses delicate fabrics in such a way that their products will stay in good shape, also after washing them several times. In this way you can enjoy your lovely sustainable purchase for a long time.
For some of their products Underprotection uses recycled polyester, which takes less energy to produce than what is needed for ‘new’ polyester. Their recycled polyester is OEKO-TEX certified.
Next to creating beautiful products in a fair matter, Underprotection uses a ray of sustainable materials. And we are not just talking about organic cotton (GOTS certified) or Lyocell. Fibers are extracted from sour milk and banana leafs, which are turned into fabric. With this, Underprotection turns waste of banana farmers and the dairy industry into something useful.
Underprotection works with Charita, a young woman who owns a small factory in New Delhi where the collections of Underprotection are being produced. Charita shares the same values concerning the production of clothes and the working environment and is working with Underprotection since the beginning in 2010. Underprotection’s production is certified by the Fair Wear Foundation.

Firstly, did Sagan say he sincerely apologizes for what he did on the podium, or for what he did on the bottom? I guess it really doesn’t matter since either one fits. Secondly, is there really nobody close to Sagan who was able to coach him on how to apologize to a woman for molesting her? Apparently not–though that’s not surprising, since we are talking about Europeans here. Anyway, next time (and there will be a next time, since Sagan has „serial sex offender“ written all over him) he should follow these rules:
1) Put a shirt on. A real shirt, with a collar. Not a white t-shirt with a stretched neckhole that you put on five seconds before filming.
2) For chrissakes, put on some pants! (I see no evidence that he’s wearing pants, so until I do I’m going to assume otherwise.)
3) Find a nice setting, like a rose garden or one of those pretty European town squares or something. Don’t sit in a corner of your motel room like you’re watching adult videos and taking way too much time to apply your chamois cream.
4) Form your mouth around the words you’re saying. Don’t mumble like your mommy is making you do this. Otherwise you come off as shifty and untrustworthy. I mean seriously, if he can’t pull this one off, how is he going to get through the inevitable positive doping test?
OK, und hier noch eine persönliche Anmerkung. Ein Bericht über Peter Sagans Entschuldigung auf Cycling News sieht auf meinem PC so aus:
The control app monitors the record/play levels and peak levels for all 64 channels, marking track numbers if they overload. The Master Clock status and timecode location are also displayed. Remaining media capacity can also be confirmed.
There are two time counter displays, allowing for flexible time information monitoring such as simultaneous monitoring of the Elapsed Time and Timecode Input.
When the DA-6400 is installed in an inconvenient location such as a machine room, it can be controlled remotely from the performance space via Wi-Fi. In addition to basic transport operations like Record, Play, Take Skip, and Backward/Forward, the operator can also set and locate marker points.
The app is equipped with a 64-channel level meter, making it possible to monitor levels. When a level overload occurs, the bar meter changes to red, and a pop-up display of the Channel number appears above the meter.
In addition to basic Record, Play, Take Skip, and Backward/Forward operations, marker Set and Skip buttons are provided.
The app communicates with the DA-6400 via a Wi-Fi network, so monitoring and control can be performed from an optimal location even when the DA-6400 is installed in a rack case.
* A Wi-Fi router is needed for Wi-Fi connection. Connect the DA-6400 to your router and use its IP address to find it from the app.
By locking out the control, accidental trasport operations can be prevented during recording or playback. Swipe with two fingers to the left (while the panel is unlocked) to lock Transport Button operation. Swipe with two fingers to the right (while the panel is locked) to unlock the Transport Button operation.

The president of the State of Schleswig-Holstein commissioned a study to investigate whether the idea that Scientology has of humans and of society is compatible with the German constitution. The study was done by Prof. Dr. Abel, Schleswig, who has done research on the topic of religious freedom since the early Eighties and has long-term experience as lawyer in cases involving Scientology and other groups. The first part is a thorough discussion of the ideas behind Art. 1 GG which states that the dignity of man is inviolable. The second part discusses the ideology of Scientology in light of these ideas. The study concludes that Scientology does not care a lot about the dignity of man, plurality of ideas in a society, or democracy. Furthermore, it states that Scientology is anti-social in character and does not guarantee equality before the law.
May I simply say what a comfort to discover somebody that actually understands what they are talking about on the web.

Sometimes, there are flashes. Thoughts, ideas, positions, discussions that are rolling around in the head. This blog is dedicated to writing them down. Discussion and input are more than welcome.
“Why? Because I'm another woman, and everyone knows women are sweet and helpful with each other? Because we're all sisters under the Goddess?” (Fanche in Lady Knight by Tamora Pierce)
And yes, I will start with the white woman in the video so we can get that out of the way. Her portrayal follows the dominant discourse on white women. She's very white, blonde, pretty, thin, rich. She's vain and shallow. She's also the Innocent Victim embodied by her skin colour and social status. It's easy to feel with her, because we have a lifetime worth of experience telling us that she's the kind of women we should have empathy with. She also displays the common white women racism of simply ignoring the existence of women of colour. And she gets stuffed in the refrigerator.
As John Fiske notes in Understanding Popular Culture, items of popular culture only become popular if the “contain resources out of which the people can make their own meanings of their social relations and identities”. As a white woman, the video offers me nothing. The discourse on white women is not deconstructed. She still only exists as an extension of the white man, is used to hurt him, and when he apparently doesn't want her back, she can be discarded. In other words, it's Monday.
But it's also OK, because not everything has to be about me. And even though I want a bigger share of the popular culture cake for white women, I don't want it at the expense of women of colour. I want a piece of the dudes' share. Rihanna and other women of colour don't have to use their platform to do white women's work. That's our job. When did we ever lend a hand to women of colour? To the contrary, our feminist history is full of very, very racist individuals and could you please look the other way while we celebrate their other achievements?
But what about the discourse of black women, on women of colour? Reading my Twitter feed, Rihanna struck a nerve with them. Apparently, whatever there isn't in the video for me, it's in there for them. I'm not going to do a thorough analysis of the discourse on black women. Not because I don't care, but because I'm not qualified. Please read this excellent essay on Media Diversified on the subject. Obviously, Rihanna's persona isn't taking shit from white people in the video. They wrong her, she gets them. She doesn't need a guy to avenge her, she doesn't ask or beg. I can imagine how this can feel. It's the feeling you get when your heroine kicks ass.
Quite obviously, there's more than one discourse going on here. There always is. No cultural text will ever be perfect. Some oppressive discourses are challenged, others are reinforced. And, really, what did you expect from a product of consumerist mass culture? It's not a medium know for it's revolutionary tendencies. As I said, in terms of the discourse on white women, it's Monday. It's everywhere. Which gets me to the small herd of elephants in the room: the thinly veiled racism of white feminist critics.
Yes, I'm talking about you, Helen Lewis and friends. Helen Lewis who literally had to drop whatever she was doing to yell at Rihanna for a while. She tells Rhinna that torturing rich white women isn't very feminist. Because what is and isn't feminist is decided by White Feminists. Because suddenly there's this mythical unified entity called "women" again. What you're doing to one of them, you're doing to all of them. Provided the one of them is white. As if Judith Butler's analysis that "gender is not always constituted coherently or consistently in different historical contexts and ... intersects with racial, class, ethnic, sexual and regional modalities of discursively constructed identities" never happened. We're all in this together, right? Except when we aren't.
The problem isn't criticising Rihanna's video. The problem is that black women are the only ones who are ever being criticised. For things that are a dime a dozen in popular culture. They are held to a different standard than rich white women. Helen Lewis cries about Rihanna not protecting white womanhood. About Rihanna not being perfect. But here's what Helen Lewis had to say about Lena Dunham not being perfect:
The point is not that this criticism is unfounded but that, as ever, women are held to a standard that men are not. From some of the commentary, you would think that because Dunham wrote and directed the show, she should have been able to dismantle the entire racist, sexist structure of the US media single-handedly.
Such a sense of proportion. So many excuses. So much understanding! Funny, when Lena Dunham writes and directs an entire show that erases women of colour, a form of violence many people don't even realise exists, it's something that can be excused on accounts of nobody's perfect. But Rihanna, now Rihanna should be able to do so, right? By the way, that article is about Dunham's autobiography. Not a word on Dunham's transgressions towards her younger sister and the further violation of her by publishing those accounts.
Is there any famous white woman Helen Lewis will not excuse? I don't know. I've found this exchange on Twitter about the MTV video awards. Here's her lauding Patricia Arquette without even mentioning her huge fuck up, handwaving objections from women of colour. I cannot find her calling out Taylor Swift, or Miley Cyrus, or Lily Allan, or Katy Perry. Never did their racism, their appropriation of black women's music, life, and bodies bother Lewis' enough to even spill a single Tweet about it, let alone a lengthy article in the New Statesman. And Helen Lewis isn't alone, she's just one of a score of professional White Feminists who really, really, really needed to tell the black woman that she's wrong. And that's why the critique of Rihanna's video is racist. Not because you don't like the lady in the refrigerator. Because White Feminism never ever calls out other white women. They are excused, protected, defended. The black woman is thrown down the bear pit at the slightest sign of being less than perfect.
Dear White Feminists, if you would like black women to consider your tender feelings when they're producing cultural texts, I have some suggestions for you:
1. Speak up. Do your fucking job and throw some intersectional feminist critique at the next pretty white woman who erases women of colour, who appropriates their work, who uses their bodies as props. Maybe if black feminists saw you doing that once in a while, they would be willing to discuss the intersectional construction of womanhood with you.
2. Shut up. Quite obviously you don't know about the discourses on black women. Because if you did you'd probably understand that you're simply not very qualified to analyse them beyond the most rudimentary levels. It's OK to leave that critique to people who are qualified. Here's a hint: they're not white. Use your clout to give them a platform.
3. Learn something. I know, those matters are complicated, discourses intersect, they change. But you're being paid to be cultural critics. It's your job, ok?
One day in one of these conversations my eldest said: "It's OK mum. I understand. You're the exception. You can go on liking dragons and swords and blue."
Suddenly I'd been turned from the feminist rolemodel into a freaky exception. Gender essentialism was saved.
The exceptional woman is a well-know phenomenon that has a tendency to occur especially in more conservative circles. It's what gave us Margret Thatcher and Angela Merkel. I guess the point could be made for the exceptional different minority member as well, but I don't want to talk out of my ass here.
The exceptional woman is well liked for a number of reasons. First of all she never threatens the Status Quo. The majority has long accepted that women can be prime ministers and such, only that they are very rare like those utter geniuses. Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Margret Thatcher. Only that the guy-geniuses are outstanding among all humanity while the outstanding women are only outstanding among women while doing things many men do and have done and will do. There's no talk about equal representation when it's clear that only the top 0.000000000001% of women are suitable for something 5% of guys can do, right?
Secondly, the exceptional woman doesn't rock the boat. She doesn't question power dynamics and structures, she simply finds her place in them and many men are happy to make room for her because "she's one of the boys".
Thirdly, she serves as a convenient fig-leaf. How can you claim the Republicans have a problem with racism and misogyny if they have Condoleezza Rice and Sarah Palin? The fact that all the women who gained power within conservative structures did so by decidedly NOT caring about the issues faced by women serves as further evidence that those problems don't exist instead of evidence that you cannot get ahead in politics if you do.
This might also explain the relative lack of exceptional women in more progressive circles. Those groups are ripe with misogynists (and racists, homophobes, transphobes), so when women who are progressive because they care about women's rights are trying to get ahead with a feminist agenda the room the conservative woman gets suddenly disappears. After all, making room for this clearly not so exceptional woman would be tokenism, right?
Perhaps it is no wonder that the women were first at the Cradle and last at the Cross. They had never known a man like this Man--there never has been such another. A prophet and teacher who never nagged at them, never flattered or coaxed or patronised; who never made arch jokes about them, never treated them either as "The women, God help us!" or "The ladies, God bless them!"; who rebuked without querulousness and praised without condescension; who took their questions and arguments seriously; who never mapped out their sphere for them, never urged them to be feminine or jeered at them for being female; who had no axe to grind and no uneasy male dignity to defend; who took them as he found them and was completely unselfconscious. There is no act, no sermon, no parable in the whole Gospel that borrows its pungency from female perversity; nobody could possibly guess from the words and deed of Jesus that there was anything "funny" about woman's nature.
22 Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her 26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, 27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. 28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 30 for we are members of his body. “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”32 This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. Ephesians 5:21-32
The dreaded “S word”--submit. Many preachers are afraid to tackle this subject—afraid of being “the bad guy” and many others tackle with this subject—not caring if they’re “the bad guy”. The Bible does indeed say that wives are to submit to their husbands, but there are a couple things to note. In the Greek, the word submit, doesn’t even appear in Ephesians 5:22 but comes from verse 21 “submit to one another, out of reverence for Christ”—all Christians are to submit to one another. It’s about mutual submission because we love Jesus and we love each other. The Greek word translated as “submit” is hupotasso, which is a military term; when it’s used in a non-military sense as this is, it means to voluntarily come under with the idea of cooperating together to accomplish something*. Paul and Peter always spoke directly to the wives and never told the husbands to make them submit. I’ve come across several women who want nothing to do with God because their fathers yelled at their mothers, “Woman, submit!”
From the beginning, it was not so… Incidentally, the Bible never tells all women to submit to all men just because they’re men. And it NEVER commands women whether Old Covenant or New, to obey their husbands. But Sarah obeyed Abraham… Yes, but she chose that and was commended not commanded. ( However, God commanded Abraham to listen to his wife and do what she said concerning Hagar. (Genesis 21:12)
If you look at the whole section in Ephesians 5 you’ll see that once again, the Bible interprets itself. Paul emphasizes one role of Jesus toward the church as a comparison to marriage, that of a savior who laid down his life. Paul used a metaphor; metaphors don’t compare on every point, only those that the author emphasizes, just as when we refer to Jesus as “the Lion of Judah”, we refer to his strength, power, and leadership, even ferocity. We’re not saying that he has four paws and a tail and sleeps all day draped over tree branches! In the same way, Paul does not mean to compare husbands to Jesus in every way. A husband can never save wives from their sin, he didn’t create them and he’s certainly not God! What Paul does say is that a husband is to give himself up for his wife, loving her as much as he loves himself, to feed and care for her—just as Jesus did and does for the Church (this was a culture that treated women with contempt and as property), even leaving his family behind. Notice that the majority of the instruction is to the husband! It’s about love not rulership!
Think about it, when you go to a salon to get your hair cut, you have to voluntarily come under the stylist, you have to sit still and let him or her serve you. Peter didn’t want to allow Jesus to serve him by washing his feet—he didn’t want to hupotasso to Jesus’ loving service. Jesus washed his disciples feet to be an example for us to serve one another.

In nearly every culture so many myths and prejudices have prevailed against women throughout the ages that it’s hard for even well-meaning people to know what the truth is. It seems that no matter how “equal” a society allows women to be there’s still an underlying current of distrust and even fear of women. Sometimes it comes from men and often women hold these prejudices against each other and even themselves. “But from the beginning, it was not so”, God the Father, has had a better plan for women from the start—a plan reawakened by Jesus.

I’ve created this website to help women and men sort out truth from error or “what we’ve always been taught” and to see the ramifications of false beliefs about women. God intends for women and men to work together to build his kingdom while the devil intends to divide us in order to build his own kingdom. Yes, in the New Testament Paul & Peter gave guidelines to particular women and to husbands and wives about how to interact but many teachers have for their own ends—or from lack of understanding, lifted these from their literary, cultural and historical contexts. I’ve agonized over these issues as I’ve studied the Bible in depth along with international resources, and books by both “Complementarians” or traditionalists (those who say that women are “equal but unequal”) and “Egalitarians” or Biblical Feminists (those who dismiss most of Paul & Peter’s instructions as cultural). Both believe in the inerrancy of the Bible and are probably very sincere (I don’t know them personally, so I can only suppose). I don’t however, “side” with either group; I am simply and unashamedly a follower of Jesus. How could I not? Jesus is my champion. Not that these others aren’t followers of Jesus (see John 8:31, 32) it’s just that they possibly didn’t look deeply enough but only sought to prove their points
This is a growing body of work to which I will continue to add what I’ve learned, so please check back from time to time. I want to glorify Jesus through my studies and writings and to offer them as a resource for you—whether you are a Christian, or are “turned off” by some of the things you’ve heard from Christians—or other faiths, about women. Feel free to comment with your stories and/or questions, even if you don’t agree--I’m willing to work through it with you, always pointing back to the Bible in its original languages (No I’m not an expert but I know how to use the resources; I encourage everyone to not take my word for it but to look it up for themselves). However, I won’t keep any comment that’s disrespectful.

Domain name shows the identity and existence of your business through the World Wide Web. It helps to expand online reach, and there by reach more customers.
I remember back in 1994 when a friend asked if I'd like to buy a domain name. I had no idea what that meant, so I turned down his offer. And that turned out to be a big mistake.
For most businesses, your website is the first chance you have to make an impression. For those in the marketing business, a polished and professional website is arguably your most important promotional tool.
A typical top priority for any institution of higher education is protecting its institutional identity and reputation.

When I learned that Rightside was adding the .BAND domain to a portfolio that also includes .ROCKS, I started thinking about all the ways my fellow artists can put a music-specific domain name to work.
Up-and-coming artists know how hard it can be to get discovered by listeners online. To gain a large following, you need that something extra that will draw the right kind of attention.
In the past, most bands or artists relied on the label that signed them to record, mix, publish their album, as well as find a distributor for their music.
Rightside, a provider of domain name services has added .BAND domains to the global music industry as the fourth new Top Level Domain (TLD). .BAND is geared to both emerging and mainstream artists, industry influencers and online music services.
Devs, live streamers, and avid gamers alike can now register .games domain endings for their websites. The .games extension launched on Sept. 21, and already has the potential to become one of the most popular new domains on the market.
Every new domain extension represents an innovative way for people, companies, and brands to put themselves online, but not many embody pure, unbridled fun the way the new .GAMES extension does. Fortunately, .GAMES goes into General Availability on Wednesday, September 21, 2016 (and if you act today, you can still grab a domain in the last day of the Early Access Phase), so the time to get this incredibly fun domain is here.
Short, unique, and branded .GAMES domains quickly help website owners identify themselves as passionate fans, brands, and enthusiasts of the gaming industry

With so many TLDs to choose from, web marketers and online businesses are finding near infinite branding opportunities. At the same time, these new domains are creating a bit of confusion due to lack of information about their intended use, or the ways they can be put to use.
Picture this awful scenario: A person has been arrested. Now they need to remember the name of a lawyer, quickly, while they’re on that one phone call with Aunt Suzie. They’re crying something awful, but they know that one attorney in town everyone knows to call.
TLDs, or top-level domains, are an important decision for your attorney brand. The type of TLD influences how consumers perceive you and your firm. In the past few years, just fewer than 1,000 new gTLDs (or branded TLDs) have been released for use among consumers and businesses.
When people need a lawyer, they naturally turn to someone they trust. Perhaps a neighbor or friend happens to be a lawyer, or maybe they know someone who just had the same kind of legal problem.

“We came to realize there was a greater story to be told,” said William Kleinert, executive producer of PROJECT: ICE. “We have over 23 different people we interview in the film, climate change kept coming up over and over again. It became a much bigger part of the story than we initially conceived it would be, and it really has become a central point to the film.”
Winter ice cover has dropped in the last 40 years, a trend that affects all those who live near the Great Lakes, play on them, or rely on them to make a living. With so many people calling the Great Lakes region home, that ice loss is hard to ignore.
While many other documentaries have shown impacts of climate change, PROJECT: ICE aims to do it in a new way. Rather than focusing on ice melting in the arctic, It follows stories about Great Lakes commercial ice anglers, kite skiers, dog sled racers, scientists, historians and more, in order to show how many people are affected by the climate-caused changes to the Great Lakes.
“The difference between looking at the arctic or Greenland or Antarctica is those are areas that are virtually uninhabited,” Kleinert said. “The Great Lakes is home to 40 million people. So it’s quite a different impact that ice and the diminishment of ice over all is having for people in this highly inhabited community versus ice that’s disappearing at the poles.”
Kleinert and his co-producer Kevin Kusina want to raise awareness of climate change’s impacts on the Great Lakes by showing the film to audiences around the country, which could lead to more environmentally conscious action.
“They might not be familiar with what’s going on,” he said. “They might not be seeing the decreased ice and dramatically decreased water levels and they might not understand the importance and impact that’s having on shipping, on fishing, fisheries and on other aspects of recreation and commerce throughout the region. We are shining a light on that and we hope people will pay attention to it and we hope policy makers will pay attention.”
Project: Ice has been shown to private audiences in Washington, D.C., northern Michigan and Los Angeles, and will be shown in film festivals in 2014. Kleinert hopes the film will be widely available late next year.
Under the title “Why History of Anthropology and Who Should Write It?” the History of Anthropology Working Group of the German Anthropological Association (DGV) organized a two-day conference on “Cultural and Social Anthropology and its Relation to its own History and to the Historical Sciences” at the University of Vienna (Austria) on December 9–10, 2016. Peter Schweitzer, Marie-France Chevron, and Peter Rohrbacher, staff members of the Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology at the University of Vienna, convened the conference. The central questions they formulated were: (1) “To what end should a history of anthropology be written,” (2) Is there “a ‘best practice’ for this form of historiography,” and (3) “For whom should a history of anthropology be written”?
Presenters offered eleven papers, five of which concerned anthropology in Austria. Vienna is the only location in Austria where socio-cultural anthropology is practiced, not only at the university, but also at the ethnological museum (now Weltmuseum) and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Most of those presenting papers are connected to Vienna, the others work in Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt, and Halle. I will first summarize the papers on Austria.
Peter Rohrbacher (Vienna) set the stage by discussing “Dominik Josef Wölfel (1888-1963) and his research on the Canary Islands 1938-45.” Having carried out research on the Canary Islands during the 1930s, Wölfel wished to settle there with his family and, to this end, published a Franco-friendly book on the Spanish civil war in 1937. The National Socialists ruled Germany from 1933 on and Austria from 1938 until the war’s end in 1945. After Austria’s Anschluss to Hitler’s Germany in March 1938, the Nazis forced Wölfel to resign from his post as curator of the Africa department at the Vienna Museum of Ethnology in April 1939, because his wife was half-Jewish. The accusation that he was “politically unreliable” was dropped after two of his colleagues, including Viktor Christian (see below), intervened on his behalf in order to safeguard the publication of an Italian manuscript concerning the pre-Spanish population of the Canary Islands. Dating from 1590, this manuscript had been discovered by Wölfel, who published it in Leipzig in 1940. Wölfel was prevented from accepting a professorship at Tenerife in January 1941, as he was not granted permission to leave Vienna on account of his 1937 book, which was considered unfriendly to Germany. Despite the fact that he had lost his job and was living on a small pension, Wölfel continued his linguistic research by means of four scholarships provided by the Imperial Research Council between 1942 and 1945. Wölfel’s research was supported by Eugen Fischer and Diedrich Westermann, both professors in Berlin, who held leading positions in this council. Most of these subsidies were given to Wölfel’s brother-in-law, Leopold Grünwald, who had been forced to retire as a “half-Jew” by the Nazi authorities and who assisted Wölfel’s linguistic research. Rohrbacher used this material to exonerate Wölfel from a verdict passed in 2013 by the Viennese Historical Commission claiming that his publications display “racist standpoints” and that he had supported National Socialism with his “public work.” Rohrbacher concluded that the commission’s interpretations cannot be endorsed.
Gabriele Habinger (Vienna) discussed “gender in the history of anthropology” by way of an analysis concerning Annemarie Hefel (1916-1991), a research assistant at the Vienna Institute of Ethnology during the Nazi era. Having studied art history in Vienna from 1935 on, Hefel shifted to ethnology (Völkerkunde) as her main subject in 1938. She earned her PhD in May 1941 under Hermann Baumann (1902-1972), appointed professor of ethnology in 1940 as the successor of Wilhelm Koppers, who had been expelled by the Nazis in 1938. In July 1941 Baumann offered Hefel the position of temporary research assistant at the Institute, beginning in October that year. After working on the African collections, Hefel resigned in April 1944 under pressure from Baumann. After World War II, she worked as a curator of the Africa department in the Vienna Museum of Ethnology, at the recommendation of Dominik Wölfel. Habinger analyzed these events by considering both gender relations and political factors, noting that Hefel was appointed despite her connection to critics of National Socialism (her father had been sent on leave in 1938). Important reasons for Baumann to employ her were that the Institute was suffering from a shortage of male personnel, many of whom had by 1942 been drafted into the army, and that an African collection from Berlin had arrived in May 1941. In addition, Hefel had qualified with her widely praised dissertation on gold exports in African history and she was not expected to oppose Baumann. A reason for her forced resignation was presumably Erika Sulzmann’s availability at the end of 1943, a student from Frankfurt who was loyal to the regime. Subsequently, Baumann obstructed Hefel’s appointment at the museum, in spite of the support she received from museum employees resisting the regime. Baumann employed several female anthropologists at a time when male anthropologists dominated the field. Another female anthropologist, Marianne Schmidl, had been supported by Wilhelm Schmidt but was murdered in a concentration camp (Geisenhainer 2005). Habinger ascribes Baumann’s support of women to the shortage of male anthropologists, a thesis supported by the fact that the female “assistants” were offered temporary contracts explicitly meant for the duration of the absence of their male colleagues.
Andre Gingrich (Vienna) presented a paper on Viktor Christian (1885-1963), a philologist-cum-historian who, as a Faculty Dean and holder of several other powerful positions, was extremely influential during the Nazi period. Christian had studied Semitic languages and ancient oriental studies, with ethnology as a subsidiary subject. At the time the latter field included “anthropology and ethnography” at the Museum of Natural History (NHM) and the University of Vienna (Gingrich 2016). After acquiring a PhD, Christian worked at the NHM for eight years, accepting a chair in Oriental Studies at the University in 1924. Following Austria’s Anschluss, he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and served as Prorector of the University from 1943 on. He was also a member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences from 1938 until the 1960s, even after his dismissal as a professor in 1945. Between 1938 and 1940 Christian served as the acting director of the Institute of Ethnology, where he forced Koppers out, saw to it that Baumann was appointed, and excluded c.15% of the students from the Institute. Gingrich analyzed Christian’s involvement in “research” carried out in two prisoner-of-war camps near Vienna, as well as his role as President of the Anthropological Society of Vienna in the preparation of hundreds of “racial reports” (Rassegutachten) written by four Austrian physical anthropologists between 1940 and 1944. Gingrich concluded that for Christian ethnology was “only a subsidiary subject,” but it was “very close” to physical anthropology, and that the “criminal entanglement” of those involved was “ethically extremely problematic.”
Gabriele Anderl (Vienna) dealt with the “results of and problems related to provenance research in the case of the World Museum in Vienna.” Formerly known as the Museum of Ethnology, it was founded as the Anthropological-Ethnographic Department of the Museum of Natural History in 1876. Following the 1998 Art Repatriation Act, provenance research was also carried out in this museum with the aim of locating objects that had been appropriated between 1933 and 1945 and returning them to their rightful owners. Taking the “Popper collection” as a case, Anderl outlined the pain-staking research required to establish the provenance of the artifacts, which have rarely been attributed to an artist.
Katja Geisenhainer (Vienna) analyzed “connections between ethnologists from Vienna and Frankfurt during the interwar period and the years immediately following Word War II.” As part of a wider project on relations between Vienna scholars and their German colleagues, Geisenhainer presented numerous cases of their entanglements starting in the early 1920s and continuing into the late 1940s. She concluded that these connections had been determined more by personal relations linked to a common theoretical orientation than by political preference. This implies that the cultural historical approach, even while it encompassed varied perspectives, was the main thread between ethnologists from Vienna and Frankfurt. The doctrine of cultural provinces (Kulturkreislehre) was developed by Fritz Graebner and Bernhard Ankermann in Berlin, Bonn, and Cologne; by the Roman Catholic fathers Wilhelm Schmidt and Wilhelm Koppers in Vienna; and by Leo Frobenius in Frankfurt. However, while the Nazis imprisoned Schmidt and expelled Koppers, the latter’s successor, Hermann Baumann, continued the cultural historical approach, albeit by postulating a link between a culture and a “racial substratum.” Baumann, who had joined the Nazi party in 1932, served as the Director of the Vienna Institute and as a government adviser between 1940 and 1945, returning to Berlin just before the war’s end in March 1945. By contrast, Frobenius, whose “Research Institute for Cultural Morphology” had been founded in Munich in 1920 and moved to Frankfurt in 1925, never joined the Nazi party and collaborated only to a limited extent. Moreover, even if Frobenius was graced with the mercy of an early death in 1938, his theory of cultural morphology was not compliant with Nazi racial theories. His student, Adolf Ellegard Jensen, was not appointed as Frobenius’s successor because of his marriage to a woman partially of Jewish descent. Yet Jensen was able to continue his work with support of the Colonial Office; for instance, he worked on a handbook for applied ethnology of Africa edited by Hugo Bernatzik and published in 1947. Considered unblemished (unbelastet) after the war, Jensen was appointed director of the Frankfurt research institute, soon to be renamed the Frobenius Institute. While Koppers carried forward the cultural historical tradition in Vienna, Jensen continued the cultural morphological tradition in Frankfurt.
Gingrich and Rohrbacher are currently editing a volume of papers on the history of ethnology in Vienna during National Socialism, which will include Habinger’s and Geisenhainer’s papers as well as many others. Why the interest in this dark age? In Gingrich’s view, current socio-cultural anthropologists have political, public, and ethical responsibilities to research these issues. Several scholars mentioned were appointed professors at universities after the war, including Baumann who played a key role in re-establishing cultural history (Gingrich 2005). A discipline remaining silent on its involvement in past war crimes would lose its legitimacy in the present (see also Dostal 1994). In order to arrive at a balanced view, Gingrich finds that one needs a great deal of inside knowledge, a “thick description,” and a combination of both emic and etic perspectives of the perpetrators and their henchmen, followers, and victims. In Rohrbacher’s opinion, the aim of the history of anthropology is to analyze continuities and ruptures by looking into the causes generating the various aspects of the tradition. In close cooperation with historians, and with the help of an in-depth study of the sources, events must be historically contextualized, especially if ambiguous. Like Rohrbacher, Habinger adheres to a differentiated, nuanced approach, taking into account all factors and studying as much source material as possible. Also favoring interdisciplinary cooperation with historians, Habinger feels that aspects of anthropology’s history will continue to be developed by socio-cultural anthropologists. Geisenhainer agrees with the latter position and adds that the history of anthropology helps practitioners to reflect on their work and to critically assess new theories and methods.
The remaining lectures dealt with subjects not directly related to Austria. Felix Wiedemann (Berlin) discussed the role of migrations in cultural historical narratives concerning Bedouins around 1900. Distinguishing between an internalist or presentist approach, “usually” applied by disciplinary historians, and the externalist or contextual approach applied by historians, Wiedemann opted for the latter. He analyzed Friedrich Ratzel’s work on the nomadic way of life as the original state of nature that from the 1880s on became a point of reference for debates about waves of migrations from the Arabian Desert.
Khaled Hakami (Vienna) discussed the “uses and abuses of evolutionism: why most people are progressivists and why Herbert Spencer would have objected.” Opposing the view that evolutionists arrange societies on a unilinear scale from lower to higher forms, and that all cultures pass through the same stages of moral development, as Robert H. Lowie wrote, Hakami argued that this is not a valid representation of the original nineteenth-century sources. Instead, it is an image or a “straw man” created by cultural relativists in order to discredit the work of their predecessors. Spencer’s aim was to study complexity, understood as differentiation and integration. Hakami pointed out that many evolutionary theories from the nineteenth century have been falsified, but that most of the main principles have survived in modern macro-sociology. Modern anthropology has largely ignored this fact, risking reductionism since these principles can be of great value to anthropology. Accordingly, as a complement to a historical, emic approach, which places Spencer’s ideas in the context of his era, historians of anthropology, following Popper, need to distinguish between correct and incorrect theories, between principles and theories—on a logical and empirical level, by using an etic approach, just as natural scientists do.
Marie-France Chevron (Vienna) posed the question “Why Bastian?” in order to deal with the sense and purpose of studying the work of Adolf Bastian (1826-1905). The history of anthropology has surplus value not only in revealing “paths of knowledge” and shifts in theoretical orientation, but also in illustrating how social and scholarly contexts have shaped the way in which research topics have been constructed (Chevron 2007). Viewing the relation between anthropology and history as vital on many levels, Chevron feels that the history of anthropology must act responsibly towards the subject, society at large, and the people involved. Considering that a plurality of approaches is “best practice” in this field, the subdiscipline has an important contribution to make to the “longue durée” of anthropology.
Zsófia Hacsek (Vienna) explored the “roots of ethnology in Hungary” by focusing on the founding of the Ethnographic Department of the Hungarian National Museum (1871-72) and the Hungarian Ethnographic Society (1889). She also discussed research expeditions, both in the Kingdom of Hungary, which from 1867 on had been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and abroad. Hacsek concluded that the study of néprajz included both Volkskunde (the study of peoples in one’s own territory) and Völkerkunde (the study of peoples worldwide), but observed that studies of the latter type were not welcomed in Hungary if they were not directly associated with the Hungarian homeland or other people speaking a Finno-Ugrian language. For the same reason, the study of kulturális antropológia, instituted after the fall of communism, runs the risk of being abolished in the current era of Hungarian populism.
Gertrud Boden (Frankfurt) discussed the fieldwork practices of the German Africanist Oswin Köhler (1911-1996) among the Khwe in Namibia and raised the question of “Why the reappraisal of disciplinary history and research practice is relevant for the societies studied by anthropologists.” Boden is currently editing the final two volumes of Köhler’s encyclopaedia, Die Welt der Kxoé-Buschleute, of which three volumes appeared in 1989, 1991, and 1997. Köhler undertook 22 research trips to Namibia, all but one together with his wife Ruth, and set up two field stations in order to document Khwe culture. Köhler assumed his research to be based on a “general cultural consensus,” which Boden questions since he only interviewed elderly Khwe men and avoided political issues related to warfare in southern Africa. Thus, the perspectives of women, young people, and Khwe from the eastern part of the Khwe settlement area were excluded. The issue of representation is important as nowadays, in times of socio-cultural change and language-loss, Khwe want to be given access to Köhler’s field data in order to revitalize their language and culture. Thus, according to Boden the history of anthropology has great relevance for the members of societies studied by anthropologists.
Finally, in my own paper I argued that the history of (early) anthropology during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries can be relevant to the current juncture. Taking my recent book on the genesis of ethnography and ethnology in the German Enlightenment as a point of departure, I stated that I conduct the history of anthropology to analyze theories and methods for the benefit of the past and the present. One has to apply a historicist method in order to avoid anachronism, but also because it is the most effective for contextualizing ideas and practices—especially when combined with an emic approach and a paradigmatic perspective. Following Lakatos, paradigms can be defined as research programs. This “historicist-emic-paradigmatic method” enabled me to produce results for anthropologists, historians, and historians of science interested in the history of anthropology, ethnography, and ethnology, as well as related fields such as linguistics (Vermeulen 2015: 35). In my view, confirmed by this conference, the subdiscipline must be conducted with great care while combining scholarly and moral responsibility, especially when dealing with sensitive issues from the past.
Up to 30 people attended this fascinating conference and brought forth lively discussions. Striking to an outside observer was that the history of anthropology has such a strong, enduring resonance in Austria and that the involvement of Viennese ethnologists in Nazism (or their exile) is dealt with in such a detailed and responsible manner. Discussions on the questions of “Why, How, and For Whom a history of anthropology should be written” will continue during a workshop on the history of anthropology taking place at the biannual conference of the DGV in Berlin, October 4-7, 2017 (for the Call for Papers, see here).
Current anthropology in Vienna focuses on many different topics, as a recent one-day conference on “Anthropology in Austria” at the Royal Anthropological Institute demonstrates. Yet one has to admire the intellectual and moral courage of Viennese anthropologists to face the darker sides of anthropology’s history in such a persistent and nuanced manner.

***UPDATE JULY 2017***As of July 2017, I have decided to step back from hosting most of my gatherings (this one included) until further notice. It's not that I'm "burnt out" which I am a little bit but its mostly because of several reasons which include:
1) Training others to host these gatherings for me (as well as get others interested in hosting other gatherings)
2) Participating in other events/departments for Fanime (I am part of CWF - Cosplay Wrestling Federation and due to our rapid growth, I will be focusing a lot more of my time and efforts there)
3) Wanting to get these "gathering hours" counted as part of volunteer hours (if we are doing just as much work to contribute content to the con, I feel like these hours should be included. Its just so much easier to have these hours counted when we need a total of 20 hours for the entire weekend for badge reimbursement and gatherings usually go for 1 - 2 hours long).
FOR NOW, THIS GATHERING DOES NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL HOST UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE! If you'd like to be a host of this gathering or have questions about gatherings in general, please reach out to me! Thanks!
Disclaimer: Fanime will be taking group pictures during the Gathering/Event this year. If you do not want to be included in those pictures please step aside for those photos. By remaining with the group when the pictures are being taken you give your consent to be photographed.
MP (Meeting Place): I always check in to the gatherings table. Otherwise, if you already know where to go, go ahead to the place.
For questions/concerns - "...does this series/costume count? etc." - just post it here and I'll let you know. As long as it's not lewd or of the adult nature, then it should be fine!
Yay! I will be there to take pics and if you need help co-hosting it as well, let me know. I just posted it on my LL Gathering event page about this as well. This is awesome :3 and as as suggestion as well, you should make a facebook event page as well
OH MY GOD this is a great idea *____* so many [male] idol series i'd love to see the cosplays of in one place aaaa! this really makes me wish I had more time to do the Utapri Haruka cos I've been planning in any case, will definitely pass this around to friends who I know are cosplaying idols at Fanime!
Thank you friends for all your help and support. I honestly got the idea of this thing from you all and my Fanimaid girls :3 BTW, to keep in the spirit of all things idol, let's make sure to invite our Wotegei friends to this gathering.
I will also try to answer questions in an interview kind of sort of way lol (I already got a few questions lined up lol).
Answer: The easiest answer I would give is that we can pair up by color and take pictures with each other!
I'd love to go to a gathering like this!! ^_^ I am so bummed that my idol cosplay won't be finished in time thou.
Yes! All this counts! Any anime that even has a point in the series where the characters wear idol outfits count (example: that one episode in Beyond the Boundary)
I'm doing the Idolm@ster gathering so if this is close to that (Sunday at 2?) I could join without having to change! Can probably bring some other IM@S people over too~
idk yet whether or not I'd be able to make it, but I wanted to say that I really like the idea of this gathering! As the host of the Vocaloid gathering, it's nice to see something Vocaloid cosplayers can go to on the weekend as before we've had people unable to attend our Friday gathering due school/work/etc on weekdays.
Also I love the idea you mentioned in your other post about pairing everyone up by color! idk if you mean to do shots in order of colors (all the reds, then all the blues, the yellows, pinks, etc, etc) or just order everyone at once in rainbow order (or both if time permits!), but color coordinated shots are fun!
(If the gathering happens to be anytime after 2pm on Sunday, I might be able to drop by in something, hmm... )
I'm also going to be at the Idolmaster gathering on Sunday, but I'd like this gathering to be at a later time. I have another idol character in mind I'd like to push up for this event, so 4pm would be enough time to change (it looks like there's nothing else at the time so far). I guess it depends when your panel is. But I'll do my best to go anyway!
Yeah, i'm going to be at the Vocaloid gathering as well, but hoping to be able to use my Yuzuki cosplay more cause i'll have actual speakers installed (whee!)
Thank you everyone for voting! Keep those votes coming in! (FB and here all collectively count) I'll probably close them this Saturday night.
It looks like the 5 pm - 6 pm slot is favorable but I wonder if it's dark enough by then to get some light.
I'm cosplaying THE iDOLM@STER and attending the iM@S gathering that's also on this selected day so this kind of works. 5-6 is what I consider dinner time, but maybe I can work around that. Also, I'm leaving Sunday night (mind you what constitutes night is still a little fuzzy) so any later probably won't work.
If I'm not able to go, I'm not able to go. It's not the end of the world, so don't feel bad if you have to side with everyone else over me, but I would love to at least see this so I hope it works out.
Hey everyone! So as an update, this gathering has been submitted - I'm just waiting to get a sure confirmation... Cosplay Gatherings did close submissions on the 15th but as of now, no final list has been fully set and released on it's FB page. I know that list is coming out soon because it actually did go out like last night in a post on FB but the link is being changed again (and is unavailable at the moment).
This is Angelica, the host of this gathering. First and foremost, thank you everyone - cosplayers, guests, photographers for taking the time to attend such a new and unique gathering.
I plan on working with the gatherings department more next year so as to implement new strategies, not only in this gathering, but in the other gatherings happening around Fanime.
Many people also liked the idea of hosting this gathering like an Idol concert/show. We basically had a crowd that was willing to listen to us and they loved seeing us dance and sing so maybe next year, I'll make sure to bring speakers and what not.
This gathering will follow the style of typical gatherings with photoshoots etc. If there is interest, we can have a music/concert kind of thing. There will be a PA system available.

When choosing a roof for your residential or commercial structures there are plenty of options to choose from. Making the right choice for your commercial or residential roofing installation should not be hard. Most people today prefer metal roofing to other types of roofing due to its many advantages. For those people who need protection against harsh weather, should consider the metal roofing material. Metal roofing is does best during the hurricanes and tornadoes as compared to the rest of the roofing materials. It does not support any combustion and will not burn during a fire.
It is durable as compared to other materials which require replacement after sometime. For proper installation of the metal roofing, consider hiring a professional contractor. There are many roofing contractors available. You ought to look for the best roofing contractor when you put into consideration the amount of damage that can be caused by an improperly installed roof. When you compare residential roofing to commercial roofing, the process of commercial roofing is complicated.
There are several elements that help to determine the best roofing company. One of the considerable factors is the experience of the contractors of a roofing company. You ought to find out the period in which the contractor has been in commercial roofing service. Note that experience comes with different exposures in roofing. The more the roofing contractor is in service, the more he or she becomes reliable.
It is crucial to determine the kind of roofing services the company has been offering during the past years. It is easy to know if a company or a contractor is reliable if they specialize in high profile structures. Therefore, you should research your potential company and find out their previous work to determine their abilities in roofing service. You can quickly tell if they can meet your requirements by going through their companies website or ask for photos of their previous projects. Make sure you hire an insured roofing contractor. Roofing installation process comes with a lot of risks which can lead to injuries or damages.
Let the roofing contractor issue you with their valid permit that shows they are allowed to operate in your state. You should not get in contact with a roofing company that is not willing to present their work permit. Consider a roofing company that is based in your locality. It is easy to learn about their reputation. Your friends and family can tell you about the reputation of the company. You can also use their former clients and ask them about their experience with the company. Consider their payment terms and determine if their charges best suit your budget.

I admit, i grew up during a time when clothes were made for children. So, upon having them myself I still don't understand the girl-boy rules. Not really.
As you probably know, I do machine embroidery and happily make shirts not only for my kids, but also for my friend's three boys.
And I admit I happily made one with purple kitties for the gender non-conforming middle child. That kid rocks. He doesn't give a shit about what other people say. He is a sparkling princess for carnival and loves Hello Kitty:
Now, the oldest one is more "traditionally boyish", if by "traditional" you mean fashion that didn't exist 20 years ago. And I chose a combination of designs and colours that simply rocks:
I fell in love with it. Sometimes what you plan in your head doesn't quite turn out the way you thought it would. And sometimes it's better than you ever imagined. This one is the latter case. I was like "I want this soooo much. I would so much love to make it for my children, but probably they wouldn't wear it anyway and then those hours would be wasted".
They need to be fairly long: 30cm for 1 cm width, 50-60 cm for 2 cm width. Look for quilling of paper ball supplies. They turn out nicest when both sides are coloured, but for the tutorial I used paper with different sides.
7. Pull tight and flip around so the side that was previously on the bottom is on top now. The strip pointing upward should be on the right.
10. For the last one you need to insert it in the little "pocket" formed by the first strip and pull tight.
11. Now start with the left hand strip on the top. Fold 90°. Make sure you fold in the right direction.
15. It should look like this now. Turn 90° counterclockwise, rinse and repeat. By turning ityou can always work in the same pattern.
18. Take the lower strip thats pointing to the right and fold it to the left. This is just to get it out of the way.
19. Take the right strip pointing upward and fold down. Now fold 90° BUT don't make a sharp edge, just pinch it at the centre.
20. Now make a loop and insert the strip under the strip you folded out of the way. You can see which side needs to face upward by the pattern
23. Once you're done with one side, flip around. You can also leave it like this and stick on a parcel or card. If you go on you need to work in your hand.
24. Done! Almost. Cut away the remaining paper. Traditionally you cut close to the point, but I think it's nicer when working with 2 colours to leave a small margin.
25. You can also make a shooting star. If you've made it flat you can use it as a name tag or place card and write the name on the longer strips.
As detailled as possible. Including the colour of the windowframe the woman was standing in front of.

The trail against the one surviving member, Beate Zschäpe and some of their accomplices started last week after it had been postponed. Postponing was necessary because there is, of course, a big interest in the media about the trial and not enough space for all the journalists to sit. After all, this is said to be the most important trial in Germany in recent history.

So I bit the bullet and upgraded my iPod Touch last month on a good sale opportunity. 6th gen 128GB iPod Touch. Set up was easy. Got a lightning and 3.5 audio out dongle so it works fine with my Aux in in the car.
Hit a few snags with the music app, because it kinda sucks now, and they lean heavy into Apple Music and streaming media etc. Get a few third party apps that work fine like my older iPod used to.
I come to find Siri is basically useless because it requires an internet connection to do ANYTHING even really basic items like playing an artist or playlist by title. I research you can turn Siri off and revert to the older Voice Control which is how I used to do the basics on my older model.
The only thing I ever seem to get it to do is to go to the next or previous track. Anyone have any experience with this? Without voice control it's really difficult to pull anything up on the fly.
Voice control and Bluetooth in iOS 11 are also broken where it says that devices such as the iPhone X do not have voice control capability (a lie) and I have a bug open with Apple on it.
You were saying that voice control in an older system was working to change artists? Never having tried that before I was unaware of that capability. Which iOS was that? v10?
In this case I recommend a playlist of tracks that you would like to hear. Then use the Next track to skip ones that don't interest you at the time. You should also log a bug with Apple at bugreport.apple.com
I was wondering how you were going to charge the device while driving? Have you considered a case with 2 lightning ports, so you can use one to listen and one to charge?
My iPod touch was a gen 2 or 3 last, it was a 64GB one. I barely updated the iOS version but it worked flawlessly except once in awhile in large playlists (2000+ songs) it would crash and go to the home screen.
So I bought the official Apple dongle that is lightning to lightning passthrough, and it also has a 3.5mm audio out so I could charge AND have it going to Aux In in the car. Next car will hopefully have bluetooth streaming I missed that by like a year or two in model it only does Bluetooth calls unfortunately.
Have you backed up your iTunes Library this week? If not, you are risking losing your music and playlists....
I have a simple query on snmp agent. How an agent on a device determines the device as Printer, switch or router?
I know that MIB can query on the device using snmpget command to hrDeviceType and the agent on the device will reply back the device type. But i want to know as agent is same on all devices and its not different for printer or switch or router how does agent determines it as a Printer?
Does it read some specific parameter from the firmware or kernel of device and then declares it as Printer or switch and then responds to the hrDeviceType query?
Please let me know in terms of Printer identification. What code needs to be implemented on the device firmware or on agent and how?
Also, if you like what we're doing, spread the word. Share us on the TwitterFace or other methods. Thanks!
I'm new here but I'm not a newbie on using Litestep. I really like your idea to keep alive this wonderful project.
I've compiled a litestep x64 for Windows 8 x64 with VS C++ 2012 version according to the github source code made by alur and acidfire. Thank you guys ! It works wonderfully but if I would like to compile modules, like popup-2.2src, to avoid installation of old VC++ requirements, it won't work because of too many errors...
So, please could you do the same with modules, like that we could have a great experience under Windows 8 !
Can you make the build accessible? I'd like to try it under win7 x64, as one of my installs crashes on recycle. I'd also be interested in any modules compiled for x64...
If I try to start it, it says "Can't start because msvcr110.dll is missing from your computer" I assume some new dependencies on MS runtime libraries?
Either way, when I installed the dll, I received the error message that LiteStep "didn't start correctly".
Ah, that makes a big difference of course! Please do let us know when you have a build for win7 x64!
I have some modules compiled for 64bit here: http://alurcard2.net/LiteStep%20Modules/64bit, but I compiled those 3 years ago. I doubt they work particularly well under windows 8, and the tray module most certainly needs to be updated to handle some new messages from the core.
I''m still working on a new set of modules for windows 8 and 7 (and on fixing the remaining bugs in the core), but I don't have much spare time these days.
The problem is that I only load modules I really use, so I can only switch once all the modules I use run under 64 bit, as there is no mix and match, if I understand it correctly. Hence, I'll have to wait a while until I can make the 64bit move, it seems...
So whats the current status of a pure 64bit build? or something built on a known runtime platform so we don't need to constantly install 20 different runtimes for both 32 and 64bit.
I have been releasing official 64bit builds of the core for the past few versions, over on LSdev. The latest versions of most of the xModules, as well as the LiteStep core are built with vs 2012. My nModules use vs 2013. Those should really be the only 2 runtimes you need.
I am 17 years old and have been doing to the UD2 variant for mass gains for about 6 weeks. I want to take a week off and eat a 30/40/30 caloric ratio. Is only one week off okay? In your...
.....A Canadian woman has been found guilty of distracted driving for looking at her Apple Watch, despite claims that she was just checking the time while waiting for a red light to change (via The National Post).
A judge in the Ontario Court of Justice ordered University of Guelph student Victoria Ambrose to pay a $400 fine, after determining that she had spent too much time staring at her smartwatch while being in control of a vehicle.
According to court documents, the woman was ticketed after a police officer noticed the glow from an electronic gadget coming from the woman's car, which was stationary beside his cruiser at a red light.
The officer reported that he saw the woman look up and down at the device four times in 20 seconds, and then fail to move forward when the light turned green. The officer then shone a light into her car and she began to drive. When he pulled her over, he realized that she had been looking at an Apple Watch.
In Ontario, it is illegal for drivers to talk, text, type, dial or email using hand-held cell phones and other hand-held communications and entertainment devices, such as smartphones, portable media players, GPS systems and laptops.
Previously, the province had not designated the Apple Watch or other smartwatches as being illegal to use while operating a motor vehicle. However, in judging Ambrose's case, Justice of the Peace Lloyd Phillipps rejected her argument that the Apple Watch being on her wrist satisfies an exemption for devices securely mounted inside the vehicle.
"Checking one's timepiece is normally done in a moment, even if it had to be touched to be activated," said Phillipps.
"Despite the Apple Watch being smaller than a cellular phone, on the evidence, it is a communication device capable of receiving and transmitting electronic data. While attached to the defendant's wrist, it is no less a source of distraction than a cellphone taped to someone's wrist.
“The key to determining this matter is distraction. It is abundantly clear from the evidence that Ms. Ambrose was distracted when the officer made his observations."
Safety tests carried out in the U.K. in 2015 concluded that using a smartwatch while driving is more dangerous than using a smartphone.
According to the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), a driver reading a message on an Apple Watch would take 2.52 seconds to react to an emergency maneuver, whereas a driver talking to another passenger reacts in 0.9 seconds.
Oh good grief. Do we really need to start issuing distracted driving citations when at a red light? Sure it can be annoying when the light changes and people don't move. That happens without electronic devices.
I suspect from the account given that she was doing more than checking the time. Whether the watch meets the letter of the law in Ontario may be debatable.
In my state it is illegal to text and drive but you can do it while stationary in your vehicle--such at stop lights. Been behind several at stop lights that I had to encourage to put down the phone and get going after the light changes.
Oh good grief. Do we really need to start issuing distracted driving citations when at a red light? ...
why not? Drivers need to look at the road. They need to move when light turns green, they need to be aware if there is a car out of control and be ready to avoid an accident. Say you see a car about to run into you, even if you don't have enough time to react and get out of the way, if you see the car coming, you may change your position in the car to minimize the impact. for example, if you have an iPhone in front of you and your airbag goes off, that iPhone will blow in your face.
Maybe when one is distracted enough that they don't realize that they're stopped right next to a police car.
The officer reported that he saw the woman look up and down at the device four times in 20 seconds, and then fail to move forward when the light turned green.
One of my pet peeves (falling under my main pet peeve of people driving like they're the only one on the road) is that people who are texting or reading email or whatever they're doing with their phone at a red light, very often sit through the green light several seconds, oblivious to the change. I've seen a huge gap in traffic because they 'failed to obey posted sign or signal', which is a separate CVC violation from operating a handheld electronic device.
We don’t do focus groups. They just ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products. —Sir Jonathan Ive
That's the second report I've seen of the Canadian constabulary citing someone for using a smartwatch while driving, and at a light. The first one was a guy, and it was over a year, maybe two, ago.
I'm usually focused as well. But there are times when I will look at my phone, or my watch, or adjust the AC, or look in the mirror to see what's stuck in my teeth. There is a point of going too far with writing tickets at red lights.
How quickly? One second? Two? A driver can be staring out the windshield, not using a device, just letting the mind wander. Where's the line and what's the penalty versus the "crime"? Should a parent get a ticket for turning around to say something to their kid in the backseat while at a red light? Should cops give tickets when someone is 1mph over the speed limit? Or two? Distracted driving is a problem, when the car is moving. That deserves a ticket. At a light or stop sign, it's a possible annoyance. A toot of the horn resolves that.
It's still distracted driving. Yes, annoying when you are the tenth car waiting and the light turns red on you because some dolt at the light waited too long because they were texting. And it is a hazard because when they do go after you toot, they easily may not be as aware of their surroundings. Pull over on the shoulder and text away.
But it's not a ticket offense if you hold up the line for any other reason? Only for using an electronic device? There's a lot of hypothesizing going on here. I've watched plenty of people be unaware of their surroundings without using an electronic device.
The Washington State law involving distracted driving isn't limited to toys or tech. It is anything. Could be eating, drinking, applying make-up, shaving, plucking brows, curling your hair, brushing your teeth, jabbering with others in your vehicle, ANYTHING. Also headphones aren't allowed. So all these morans driving around with earbuds in and using an in-line mic are breaking the law too.
Have a friend who use to be a cop. Told me on occasions he has pulled various people over for shaving, putting on makeup, and even one guy tuning his guitar all while driving. My most interesting experience is me passing a guy on the interstate to go to grad school many years ago (before all the tech devices came into being) noticing his was not paying attention to the road--turns out he was reading a book while driving.
Men like to complain that women putting on makeup at a stop light or while driving should be cited. In some cases I agree. But in all my years, I've seen more instances in a person holding up traffic or driving erratically because of their phone in a week, than I've ever seen of a woman and her makeup.
A person Zen-ing out for a moment or reading a billboard is seldom distracted as long as someone using an electronic device, and usually gets with the program before needed prompting.
Sure, people can and do get cited for other causes of distracted driving, but electronic devices are far more likely to cause a bigger distraction.
Today I was the second car behind somebody at a light looking down at her phone when it turned green. I waited a bit and then did the honking for the car behind her that didn't honk. Off she went in a blaze of speed!

Thankfully for you, there are many insurers out there that specialize in homeowners insurance. In this article, we are going to walk you through the different types of coverage and tips for finding the best insurance product.
Any home insurance policy covers the following: the property itself including the fence (dwelling), the contents of the house (personal property), medical expenses for people who get injured while being in your property (medical payments), legal expenses if you are sued and found guilty of someone else’s injury or damage to property (general liability), and hotel expenses if you are unable to stay in your home because of repairs (loss of use).
The coverage mentioned above is a basic form of coverage that you absolutely need to have. There are optional coverage items that you can add, such as guaranteed replacement cost, which provides the most complete coverage.

And they are supporters of the Second Amendment. And Mika had the nerve to say 2A Constitution supporters are “COWARDS”. Oh boy….did she open a can of worms! This is what Mika said from partial transcription:
“For those who say after every shooting — which is practically every day — and mass shooting practically every month if not twice a month, ‘Oh, it’s too soon. Oh, it’s too soon.’ Really? We’re not safe at school. We’re not safe in church. We’re not safe at concerts. Like exactly when can we have this conversation? YOU’RE COWARDS.”
With the small town of Sutherland Springs, Texas still reeling from the traumatic mass shooting in their church…Mika wasted no time in politicizing the event. And then insulting over a third of Americans. Drop your thoughts on the subject below and let us know what you think about the Second Amendment.

The Massachusetts men’s and women’s swimming and diving teams headed to Dartmouth College to compete in the Tate Ramsden Invitational last weekend. Even after solid performances, both teams could not edge out Dartmouth, as both the men’s and women’s teams placed second.
The highlight of the weekend was the diving trio of Emma Roush, Maja Boric and Katie Polk. They caught the eyes of the judges, dominating both the 1-meter and 3-meter dives. Roush scored 32 points with two first place dives, followed by Boric and Polk respectively in each event.
“I thought they dove exceptionally well over the weekend,” UMass coach Bob Newcomb said. “They were solid as always, and I think they’re setting themselves up [for the Atlantic 10 Championships] in a really big way.”
The team trained day-in and day-out over winter break, which led to successful performances by not only the divers but the entire team. UMass put in work on two training trips, the first stop being Dallas, Texas. They swam at Southern Methodist before heading to Tampa, Florida to train at a local aquatic club.
Other notable standouts at the Tate Ramsden Invitational included freshman Stephanie Judge, who out-touched Dartmouth’s Hi’ilani Hopkins by a mere .57 of a second in the 200-yard butterfly. She kept her composure and never gave up, as she was a half-body length behind at the 150-yard mark, but came back to grab 16 points for UMass.
“I think the response and what we’re getting now is a result of the quality of training that they’ve had and the consistency of it,” Newcomb said.
Dartmouth finished the meet in first with 768 points, followed by UMass with 750 and SUNY New Paltz with 237. Although the Minutewomen didn’t end either day in first place, they stayed focused, winning seven events the second day to make the meet as close as it was.
Fordham, an Atlantic 10 opponent who has beat UMass the last three years, is the Minutewomen’s last dual-meet opponent. The meet is scheduled for Saturday.
The men’s team won four events on the first day of the meet and finished with 835.5 points, but it was not enough to defeat Dartmouth who finished with 878.5.
The performance was anything but lacking for the Minutemen. Dartmouth had the advantage in first place victories, but UMass’ swimmers were able to excel in the relay and backstroke events.
The Minutemen took three of the top five spots in the 200-yard medley relay. In the fast-paced 200-yard freestyle relay, just over one second separated UMass’ victorious team of Owen Wright, Kellen Gray, Kyle Stephanides and Ryan Pedrick from the Dartmouth team that was right at their heels.
“We’re developing a team,” UMass coach Russ Yarworth said. “As you develop a program through recruiting and training, you hope to have depth at every event. Relays are usually star events because you’ve got to have your best swimmer in each event, especially in the medley relay. It’s great to have one, two, three kids in each stroke. It’s extremely beneficial.”
In the individual backstroke events, Oliver Wyeth and Chris DiGiacomo raced spectacularly, leading UMass to 67 points in the 100-yard backstroke and another 44 points in the 200-yard backstroke, which was the most of of any two individual events. Wyeth finished first in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 50.46 seconds, followed by DiGiacomo who finished in 50.64. DiGiacomo also finished second in the 200-yard backstroke.
The Minutemen received great performances from the sophomore class in the pool with Al Madden, Harry Ortof and Pedrick all contributed points with strong finishes.
UMass will also face Fordham at home this Saturday with the hope to finish the season with a win and go into the A-10 Championships even stronger. For Yarworth, though, this last meet is about more than winning.
“The first goal is to honor the seniors for making it through four years with me coaching them, and for us to just have a great experience with a good crowd.”

“Hungarians even named it” says the CIA officer to Amy Adams and her colleagues in one of the scenes of Arrival, but he doesn’t say which word he was referring to. Origo.hu traced the solution.
The Arrival sci-fi is screened in Hungarian cinemas since last Thursday and it seems like it is one of the unmissable movie experiences of the year: aliens land on our planet and an intelligent, sentimental and exciting drama evolves instead of the usual demolition.
What’s most surprising for the Hungarian audience is that the CIA officer played by Michael Stuhlbarg refers to a Hungarian word, when he’s talking about how the aliens’ intentions might be hostile and that it is not expellable that they are planning to play countries off against each other.
“It might be that the visitors want to stir up a war between us so that only one side would remain” says the distrustful Agent Halpern. Then a military officer played by Forest Whitaker interposes a remark that there’s no evidence to this, but the CIA officer goes on by saying: “There is. Our history. The British in India, the German in Ruanda. Hungarians even named it. Indeed, we live in a world without a supreme commander.”
Which Hungarian word was Halpern referring to? It’s actually not obvious and you can’t turn to the Story of Your Life and Others novel, which is the base of the movie, because this dialogue is the creation of screenwriter Eric Heisserer. So Origo called up the Hungarian marketer and a colleague of InterCom told them the solution: salami tactics (salami-slice strategy).
This expression was first used by Mátyás Rákosi and it was the colloquial naming of the behaviour, political methods of the Hungarian Communist Party in order of their quick rise to power. In a wider sense, this tactic was used by other communist parties as well in the Soviet occupation zone to develop monarchism. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated “slice by slice” until one realizes that it is gone in its entirety.
After WWII communists weren’t picky with methods to eliminate their political opponents, a lot of times they even treated their fellow party members with hell-bent methods. For the sake of the quick development of dictatorship they brought show trials, arrested, blackmailed, forced to retirement or kidnapped people who they found dangerous.
Director Denis Villeneuve has been shooting Blade Runner 2049 in Hungary since summer, but it is sure that the expression is not part of Arrival due to this, because it has been shot way earlier.

I am looking into having my hair dreaded with human hair extensions as my hair is in a bob where the front is longer and reaches my shoulders but the back is about 3" long. I am in the process of growing it to help with the dreads.
I love the idea of adding bright vibrant colours in Blues, Greens, Purples & Pinks to my hair but I don't really know what is the best to achieve this, and what would last as I am hoping for something permanent.
When I had my hair in synthetic single ended dreads it took 4 hours as I have a lot of hair but it is quite thin.
I have had big woollen dreads in vibrant blues. I loved the woollen ones as the colour was great but they where too thick for me. With the synthetic ones I had in they are nice and thin, but feel scratchy and the colour was dull, plus the elastic bands became stringy and broke off unravelling my hair in the process I loved them just they where not permanent.
I am willing and able to travel but hoping to find somewhere close to Hampshire that can fit my hair.
If you can help with any advice or are able to help then please can you email me a price list or details.
Sorry, but you cannot advertise on this part of the forum until you have been here 30 days and made 50 posts.
Quick question - what is the purpose of letting the dry first? Just wondering if there is a technical reason they need to be dry before refelting again. Thanks
Er....wool can rot if it's wet too long. It may have something to do with getting the fibres to felt together.
I don't think there is anything wrong with it, I've washed then rewashed dreads before with no* major incidents.

Ahhhhh, okay I understand now. I know that sometimes something has to be done in specific steps or it won't work properly so i figured I would ask. Thanks so much for the reply!
I know this is an old thread, but I've been looking a alot of wool dreads lately, as apart from ones I played around with when I was younger (generally wrapped around my real hair) I have never had a set. So I have been searching through loads of posts and tuts. But just had to say how much I totally love this set. Such fine work DSM and they make me drool, I am in utter ore!

Jennifer Garner attended the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past premiere in L.A. last night and looked absolutely stunning. In an interview with TheInsider, Jennifer Garner commented on Matthew McConaughey’s authenticity. “What you see is what you get. He’s exactly the same here as he is on set, as he is any time I saw him off-set. He’s comfortable in his own skin and in a very, generous, kind way.” In the movie, Matt plays Conner, a bachelor that has left numerous broken hearts in his past. Jennifer plays Jenny, Conner’s childhood friend. Michael Douglas was also at the premiere. Ghosts of Girlfriends Past will be in theaters everywhere May 1.
Check out this interview conducted by Matt Zaller with Jennifer Garner and Matthew McConaughey. Jennifer Garner isn’t wearing pants and tells Matt Zaller to drop his. They also discuss scarves, Iceland and their new movie.
We hope you’re as excited about the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past movie as we are! Jennifer Garner’s first movie since Juno will be released to theaters on May 1, 2009. Fans have high hopes for this romantic comedy with Matthew McConaughey. In the movie Conner (McConaughey) and the ghosts of his previous girlfriends try to discover what turned him into such a jerk and whether there is still a chance to find true love. Sure, it might sound corny, but with these two it must be good! The movie is rated PG-13 and will be distributed by New Line Cinema.
The release date for Jennifer Garner’s next movie is moving nearer. Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, with Matthew McConaughey, Lacey Chabert (Gretchen Wieners in Mean Girls), Emma Stone (Jules in Superbad), Michael Douglas and Christina Milian is set to be released on May 1st 2009. During production Jennifer was busy on the set but was still able to make time for her family. Those working on the movie noted that she was serious about her work and intent on getting the job done. A fun fact: Ben Affleck was originally set to play the lead role. That production was scrapped and Jennifer Garner was added to the new cast. It would have been interesting if the two had been in the movie together.
We haven’t updated in a while, but hopefully you’re as excited as we are about Jennifer’s upcoming movie. Ghosts of Girlfriends past is directed by Mark Waters (Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) and is set to be released in 2009. Filming wrapped up at the beginning of summer and the film is now in the post-production stage. Of course, as you probably know, Matthew McConaughey and Emma Stone also star in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. It is great to see Jennifer Garner making time to make more movies even as she is so busy cashing Violet Affleck around.In the movie, McConaughey plays a womanizer who attends the wedding of his younger brother, where he is haunted by sevel of his ex-girlfriends including Jennife Garner. The film is similar to Dicken’s “A Christmas Carol.”
Here’s the video from Ellen’s interview with Jennifer Garner on September 22, 2009 in case you missed it. Obviously she’s been out there making the rounds of shows to build excitement for The Invention of Lying which will released on Friday. She informed everyone that having babies isn’t that hard. Apparently Seraphina is more like Jen, “just dumb and happy.” Watch the interview for yourself below.
Jennifer Garner appeared on Good Morning America this morning to promote Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, which arrives in theaters tomorrow. Watch the video, she looks absolutely adorable.
Jennifer Garner was on the David Letterman show last night, April 29, 2009. You can watch the videos here. During her time on the show she discusses how her and Ben selected the name Seraphina Affleck. Violet had decided a while ago that the name would be “Sarah” and after a week Jen and Ben still hadn’t selected a name so they decided on Seraphina, which means “angel”. Seraphina Affleck is now three months old. She also said she has promoted Ben to be in charge of Violet. At the end of the clip, you can even watch her stick Neosporin into her cleavage.
Want to ask Jennifer Garner or Matthew McConaughey a question? Maybe you want to know Jennifer Garner’s favorite song? Or will Alias ever return? You can ask these questions and more in the MovieFone interview. They are taking user-submitted questions, which they give to Jen and Matt. The stars will then ask each other the interview questions for the other. For example, Matthew McConaughey would ask Jennifer Garner: “What is your favorite romantic comedy?” to which she would reply. Stay tuned for more of these promotion-like events as the opening Ghosts of Girlfriends Past draws near.
Specification forming part of Letters Patent No. 201,978, dated April 2, 1875; application filed March 4,1878.
Be it known that I, MAX ADLER, of New Haven, in the county of New Haven and State of Connecticut, have invented anew Improvement in Corsets; and I do hereby declare the following, when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and the letters of reference marked thereon, to be a full, clear, and exact description of the same, and which said drawings constitute part of this specification, and represent, in--
This invention relates to an improvement in the method of cutting corsets with a view to saving material and produing a perfect form; and it consists in the several parts of the shape shown and described; which together form one-half the corset. Each half is cut in several pieces, each marked, respectively, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in Fig. 2. The part 1, forming the front, is cut expanding slightly from the top to the point cc, and thence downward to the bottom, the point a being the lower point of the first gore, 2, the corresponding edge of which is stitched to the first part from the top down to the point a. The third part is curved or slightly expanding on both edges from the top down to the points d which is the lower point of the gores. The opposite edge of the first gore, 2, is stitched to the corresponding portion of the part 3, and from that point downward the two parts 1 and 3 are stitched together. The second gore, 4, is stitched to the part 3 on the opposite edge from the gore 2, and the part 5, of shape as shown, is 'stitched to the opposite edge of the gore, and thence downward to the part 3.

HELP!!!! *pulling out hair* i swear i can't do it! can someone tell me from start to finish on applique work. i will praise you forever. Thanx
What I have learned that you have to space the rows far enough apart so it will lay flat. If they are too close the work will curl and be uneven.
The best way that helped me was to put the beads of the string and lay them beside the row I was working on and sew them to the fabric and make sure I don't sew it too tight. It took a lot of practice/patience for me.
One of the keys to good applique work is to have a good foundation of material/backing to do your work on and make sure that it is held taut. The folks that do great rosettes, for example, use a combination of a canvas-type fabric and thin (cigarette carton) cardboard. For larger pieces of applique work (blanket strips, etc.) I've used embroidery hoops or a custom-made frame. I also prefer the 2-needle style - 1 thread holds the beads, the 2nd thread with the needle does the sewing.
The best advice I can give is the same as with anything -- practice, practice, practice, practice...well, you gett the idea. :p
Too bad we cannot all get together for a crafts session somewhere to share ideas, see others beading and gossip.
Maybe this will help --it's a technique I learned from a Creek/Seminole artist who does exceptional (museum quality) work on panel belts, bandolier bags, etc.
I do my applique work on wool -- since all my applique work is of Creek origin anyway. I use a single needle. String seven beads at once and attach them to the fabric with a simple stitch that goes completely through the wool. With the needle on the underside of the fabric push the needle through the cloth next to the first bead, completing a circle of sorts. Pass the needle through the second bead, then stitch down the thread holding the beads. Come up through the third bead, pass the needle through the fourth and stitch down again. Continue until you get to the last (seventh) bead, at which time you will add seven more and continue on. It's a great system that produces very finely stitched, but flat work that is incredibly tight. I might have a diagram I could fax to you. Let me know if this helps or completely confuses you.
Crazy Crow also sells a great video on how do the running stitch and the two needle method. It is slow enough to learn by but fast enough to no bore you to death LOL. I learned how to do the running stich by accident after my mom taught me to embroider...since it is similar but you are putting beads on. I only use a max of 4 beads at a time though or sometimes the beads will be a bit loose...4 beads on..go in and come back up between the beads with the needle and then run it through the last two beads..string 4 more beads...that is my method anyhow.
Thanks soooo much you guys, i think without this board i would have never been able to work out the kinks in beadwork!
One of the keys to good applique work is to have a good foundation of material/backing to do your work on and make sure that it is held taut.
Applique as practiced by the Prairie & Missouri River people was a two needle process. Beads were strung on one thread and sewn down to the fabric, every two beads, with the other. The material the beads were applied to was frequently backed with old newspaper. If you look at the backside of the fine old work you'll see a beautiful pattern of fine stitches from the anchoring thread, almost to the point of it looking machine made. Beadworkers prepared little spindles of strung beads, a seperate spindle for each color they planned to use. As they beaded they simply unwound what was needed and stitched that to the fabric using a second needle. Again, they only stitched down two beads at a time producing absolutely flat work. Sometimes on close examination you'll see gaps between the bead rows or at the end of a row. These gaps were never filled in for when viewed as a whole, the eye (your preception) filled in the gap.
hm... i am going to make hair thingy's and they are gonna be fully beaded. you know the kind that is placed at the ends of french braids. i was wondering if applique was used for that, and if not then wha is it used for? hmmm... i am not quite getting the 2 needle thing, what is the purpose of 2?
I do the "one needle two beads at a time" type and while it's slow as all get out (I like the look with sz 13s) I like the look and tightness of the pieces. How do you get the same results with bigger beads?
Hi. We have a two-person play that we plan take on the road to small towns and cities and stage in small performing spaces, 80-200 seats, many of which do not have installed lighting. So we're looking for an inexpensive portable lighting kit to take along with us.
It is a single set play, an apartment, and 80 percent of the time, it's just unchanging lighting on the apartment and actors. At several points, the lights on the apartment dim and lights come up on the front of the stage for a flashback scene. At one other point a light goes on downstage right, when someone is at a pay phone.
Put in my real name in the profile but it hasn't seemed to go through yet. I'll check back in tomorrow.
The way I see your situation, there are three things you need to invest in - fixtures, trussing/tripods, and a controller. Speaking of investing, what’s your budget and how big is your stage?
Fixtures run a wide range of options with varying brightness, coverage, and quality just to name a few. What’s a reasonable solution will depend on your budget. Many people are going all LED with their rigs, and while there’s nothing inherently wrong with that, good LED fixtures cost money. Coming from a theatrical background myself, I can agree that despite being simple in nature you still want good, natural-looking light - not the cheap LED lighting that gives a cold harsh look. If LEDs are out of reach you can always go with the cheaper halogen Par 38s that can be had for a mere $20. You’ll need a dimmer pack to go with those, but those aren’t terribly expensive either. It’ll all depend on budget.
In terms of a controller, I normally recommend a true theatrical console for theatrical work, however, in your case I’d take a hard look at QLab or Show Cue System. Both can handle simple lighting (depending on the license you buy) and are made specifically for scripted playback in a theatrical environment. While there is better lighting software out there for more complex applications, my vote is for one of those two programs. On the plus side, you can also fire audio and video cues from the same program. You can even automate the entire production if you so desire.
Lastly, I agree that a pair of tripods and T-bars are your best bet. Generally, you want to get your lights around 45 degrees up and out, cross-aiming the fixtures so that each area on stage is hit from at least two opposing fixtures. Now, as you probably know in most theaters we have dozens (and usually hundreds) of fixtures shooting from all different locations to give the lighting designer as much creative freedom as possible. Since I imagine that’s beyond what you need right now, a pair of tripods is a good start. I’d look at the offerings from Ultimate Support and Duratruss.
Wow! Jeff, incredibly helpful answer! Our budget is as small as we can possibly make it and still do the job. But the advice to go with older halogens which are much cheaper is the key for me. Being ignorant of lighting generally, I was only seeing LEDs. So that suggestion right there will probably make this possible for us.
I have run sound boards for local production and have used QLab for that, a free download. I'll look into it for lighting.
Thanks, I was looking at Par can par 38's on Amazon and they have a well-rated one for $18 (Amazon prime). Bulb included. So I may go with that. According to the info with it, you can use LEDs with it
Glad I was able to help! So since you think that halogen Pars are a good fit for your budget, here are some specifics:
These are what I use: Link. They're not fancy and made cheaply, but the 3 dozen I have in inventory have survived the past decade and still see regular use. They get the job done for a basic Par can, and I know a few other members here use them as well. You'll also need a lamp to go with them. I lamp mine to the full 250w capacity with these, though it appears this specific lamp is hard to find these days...mine are definitely living up to the 4500hr life span! Any E27 socket flood lamp will fit in there, so it doesn't need to be anything specific though generally the wider beam angle the better. I know others have done just fine with lesser wattages - most of my work is on stages at outdoor amphitheaters so I need all the lumens I can get! I'm sure the Par Can itself you linked to on Amazon is just fine from a mechanical standpoint, but the lamp might be questionable. It's hard to tell and I've never used that particular kit. Not all lamps are created equally, and for this particular application you'll want a good one!
As a full disclaimer, there's no one reason over another to buy these (or any) specific Par can - I just use them because they're very cheap and are a great utility fixture to fill in the gaps between my larger fixtures. You could also consider Par 64s or something higher end like a Source Four Par - all of which can be had very cheaply via ebay these days. The only caveat is that once you start getting into higher wattage fixtures you start needing heavier-duty dimmers, which get expensive quickly...
Speaking of dimmers, here's what I generally recommend for light-duty use - link. With a pack like this you'll be able to connect up to 8 Par 38s, controlled in groups of two (it's a 4-channel pack). Even with 8 250w units running full-on I've never had an issue with them keep up so long as you use moderation. Anything with lesser wattage should be able run full-on indefinitely. You can find dimmer packs for less, but the reason I like this one is that it will hold its last command should your DMX signal fail. Not all cheap dimmers do this - some immediately blackout and that's not what you want happening in the middle of a performance!
Seeing as you mention LEDs in the Amazon link, yes, mechanically you can use the LED Par 38 lamps in anything with a fitting socket, however the dimmer usually doesn't work well with them. Mileage varies significantly on this, so I've always been of the mindset to use either halogen as it's intended or to buy a proper LED Par fixture built for entertainment uses.
You'll want some gels and maybe a little diffusion to shape/color your beams to a fitting choice (you almost never use a naked lamp in theater), but I'd think you'll want softer colors just to add life into your lighting design. If you buy a packaged lighting tripod they usually come with holes drilled in the T-bar for mounting fixtures, otherwise you'll also need a clamp for each fixture you buy.
I'm glad to hear you have QLab experience! I don't think a license that includes lighting is free, but definitely look into it. To go with that you'll need a USB-DMX interface such as this. I have one, and while not the cheapest out there it's compatible with just about every piece of lighting software that accepts 3rd party interfaces (QLab and Show Cue System included). Get yourself some real DMX cable (not mic cable), a terminator for your last dimmer in the daisy chain, and good quality 12/3 power cords (ideally SO or SOOW to be NEC compliant) and you should be all set. Lastly, if you want road cases to move all this in, I've had good luck with the offerings from Audiopile, though companies like Road Cases USA offer dedicated lighting cases with the ability to customize to fit. Just make sure you get at least 3/8" thickness if you go that route. Happy researching and best of luck with the production!
Again Jeff, incredibly helpful. We've got a good play and good actors, but we have little experience with proper stage lighting. I'll let you know how we do. Thanks, Stan
Jeff, one more question. I went looking for the Sylvania 250W halogen and you're right - they are hard to find. But I found a Sylvania LED 250W which they tout as a subsitute. What do you think? It says dimmable.

For the next forty days I will be providing a daily bible based prayer focus for those of "us" that are hungry for God. It is God's desire to see His will fulfilled in, and through our lives, but in order to see His will fulfilled in and through our lives, it has to be our desire to seek Him and His will (plan, purpose, mission) for our lives. In order for God to really be able to use, and bless us, we have to be in tune with His heart. And in order to be in tune with the heart of God (God's mind), we are going to have to renew OUR minds! (see Rom. 12:2, II Cor. 4:16, Eph. 4:23, Col. 3:10, Titus 3:5).
God wants us to "Put on the mind of Christ" (I Cor. 2:16, Phil. 4:8) so that we can understand just what His ways and thoughts are, so that we, The Body of Christ can put the ways and thoughts of God into action. It would be easy for me to post the scripture references that I'll be pointing you to, but I think that it is important for you to open up your own bible everyday....so I won't be posting the entire scripture. I also suggest that you go on a "Fast" for the next forty days. This could be abstaining from a type of food, T.V. show, website, or anything that you feel could be cluttering your spirit. My goal is for us to be even more sensitive to the Holy Spirit at the end of these forty days, so that we can be even closer to God, and clearly His voice so that we can follow through on His directives. So get out of that comfort zone!
This prayer focus will be available daily on my blog, and through :: myspace :: bulletins so if you are getting this message through an email blast, this will be a one time notice....I don't want to blow up your inbox! So if you are a :: myspace :: member, make sure you :: subscribe to my blog ::, and if you are not a :: myspace :: member, you can visit my blog daily at :: WWW.WRAPWORLDWIDE.COM ::
Ask God to show you specific areas in your thinking that need some adjusting. Ask him to give you a Kingdom mindset. some of us have developed strong opinions about somethings in life, but those opinions are sitting contrary to the Word of God. So if we begin to build, or have built anything based on those opinions...whatever that has been built, or that is being built is not going to last very long, even though it may seem to be fruitful for a while. some of you may have to rebuild some things (plans, visions, and missions comes to mind here) during this season.
*Say this out loud as a confession of Faith (Rom. 10: 8-10): I refuse to lean unto my own understanding....I have the mind of Christ....I think Kingdom thoughts!

I can also recall that during that time, the Black community was decimated by the crack epidemic. Many were effected by either the burden of a family member that was addicted or a family member that was a dealer. The relentless War on Drugs that was introduced by Ronald Reagan, tore a hole in the Black community’s infrastructure. This gave the police free range to harass and arrest dealers and addicts alike. This, in turn, broke up the Black family. Even now, the victims of this so-called war are still reeling from the affects. Years later we’ve found out that the War on Drugs was actually a War on Black People, according to John Ehrlichman, Richard Nixon’s top aide.
Now we’re witnessing another sect of the United States being effected by drugs. Now that White America is now being effected by opioids, there’s now a sudden shift in America’s thinking, Now America wants to treat the addicts. They wouldn’t dare think of repeating the same drill that was perpetrated on the Black community, which is something I find innately racist. As for the “drug dealers” of the opiates, Big Pharma, they will never see a day in jail. Meanwhile, here in Georgia, a simple gram of marijuana(weed) will get one arrested and possible the lost of one’s job. I find it rather odd that in these mostly majority White populated states that marijuana is not only legal in the state, it’s a way of creating wealth. In other words, Billy in Colorado can become a millionaire on a marijuana crop, meanwhile, Tay Tay in Georgia is arrested and given 120 days and/or fined for 7 grams of marijuana.
Marijuana is illegal only because it’s growth can’t be sanctioned, even with proof that it helps war veterans to pain sufferers, it’s benefits are ignored in order to satisfy the deep pockets of Big Pharma. Anyone with a seed can grow marijuana, but you can’t grow an opiate. Big Pharma has lobbyists all through Washington D.C. making sure that their wares are being pushed, in every way, for profit. This makes Big Pharma is the supplier, Washington D.C. lawmakers are the distributors, and the doctors are the pushers.
I remember when I would smoke marijuana. My mind would open up in ways that were indescribable. I would think in broader terms and would pose unanswerable questions about our current state of affairs here in the United States. Maybe it’s the remnants of marijuana of my past, but I think that maybe the conspiracy against weed is really a conspiracy to maintain a constant flow of customers for Big Pharma. I mean, why else would a person that smokes marijuana be denied a job and in turn a person on opiates can retain one?
Racist Or Nah? Italian Gymnast Hates On USA Team #Winning “Next Time We’ll Have Our Skin Black Also So We Can Win, Too”
Residents of the apartment complex stated that as McGaughey walked up to McGhee, he began to stab her. He stabbed multiple times in the torso and neck and left her lying on the sidewalk. She died at the scene as a result of her injuries.
About 30 minutes after the stabbing was reported, McGhee updated the profile picture on his Facebook page of a cut arm with a bloody wound. Friends and family left messages for him to contact them and to do the right thing.
Investigators stated that McGhee and McGaughey had previously dated, but had stopped seeing each other a year ago. McGhee, however, had continued contact McGaughey.
McGhee began to wrestle professionally around 2006. He was known in the ring as DT Porter and DT Ruddick. McGhee was a developmental wrestler with World Wrestling Entertainment from 2010 to 2012, and also managed a pawn shop and a clothing store, both in St. Louis, according to his Facebook page.
A description of McGhee on his archived wrestling website states, ‘Once the oppressed, DT is the one now doing the enforcing. Determined to take out all of his childhood pain and torment out on the bodies of his opposition, DT lacks mercy, and will deliver great anger and furious vengeance on any who stand in his way.’
McGhee’s vehicle was spotted in Tampa and a pursuit involving Hillsborough deputies, the Florida Highway Patrol and Tampa Police Department ended near Interstate 75 and County Road 41 in Pasco County where the suspect’s vehicle crashed.
McGhee was transported to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Tampa for treatment of injuries from the crash and apprehended after a short chase by a police dog.
McGhee has been booked into the Land O’Lakes Detention Center. He will be transported back to the Hillsborough County Jail at a later date. He will be charged with first-degree murder, said Pascal deputies.
It is not clear which body part is in the picture, but multiple reports are saying it is an arm. It is also not clear if it is McGhee or McGaughey is shown in the picture.
The picture’s posting caused confusion and concern among those that know McGhee, with some people urging him to contact them and others wanting to know what was happening.
Both McGhee and McGaughey are originally from St. Louis, MO, based on their Facebook pages, it is unclear if the two knew met in Florida or knew each other from back home.
This story should be seen as a lesson to anyone that has ever asked themselves the question, ‘Can I remain friends with my ex after the breakup?’
Give it some time, because if they were infatuated with you, it’ll take them some time to get you out of the system.
Never let your ex know about your personal life after them. Friends are not concerned about your personal life, only you.
And if you are in a relationship and you think that your current love is a tad bit off, get out of the relationship…
Posted in: News From All Over, Strange And Weird News, Strange But True.	Tagged: 2013, abuse, americans, aunt jemima, dora charles, Georgia, gossip, lawsuit, news, odd news, paula dean, paula deen, racist, savannah, united states, weird, weird news.	2 Comments
Dora Charles, Deen’s longtime chef, claimed that African American staff were also asked to ring a bell while hollering ‘come and get it’ in a throwback to the past.
Charles also alleged that she was paid a measly $10 an hour and had to endure the TV chef using racist language around her.
Family, friends, and fans of Deen have been very vocal in their support of the Southern Cuisine Queen. But many (me included) are wondering how this new claim will effect her image.
Deen has been dropped by The Food Network along with corporate sponsors like Walmart, Home Depot, pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk and her book publisher.
Charles’ told the New York Times that she wanted to speak up now because she felt that the truth should come out about the woman who she once considered her ‘Soul Sister’.
For 22 years, Mrs. Charles was the queen of the Deen kitchens. She helped open the Lady & Sons, the restaurant here that made Ms. Deen’s career. She developed recipes, trained other cooks and made sure everything down to the collard greens tasted right.
“If it’s a Southern dish,” Ms. Deen once said, “you better not put it out unless it passes this woman’s tongue.”
Charles’ states, ‘It’s just time that everybody knows that Paula Deen don’t treat me the way they think she treat me’.
Charles met Deen while Deen was running a restaurant in a Best Western hotel when Charles, newly divorced and tired of fast-food kitchens, walked in and auditioned by cooking her version of Southern food. Deen hired her immediately.
Mrs. Charles attended Ms. Deen’s wedding. Sometimes Mrs. Charles appeared on the television shows as part of her day job. She also performed on Ms. Deen’s signature cruises, taking vacation time to do so, though her expenses were paid. She sometimes received clothes and other free goods that came along as Ms. Deen’s star rose.
Mrs. Charles’s family and friends even got jobs with Ms. Deen, including Ineata Jones, whom everyone called Jellyroll. She ended up as close to Ms. Deen as Mrs. Charles was.
Tension between the two ladies began when Deen asked Charles’ to prepare ‘hoecakes’ (my grandma made these…they are pancakes made from cornbread batter and served during dinner) and to ring a dinner bell in front of the restaurant, hollering for people to come and get it.
Dora Charles, a longtime worker for Paula Deen, said Ms. Deen did not treat her fairly, a claim Ms. Deen denies.
“I said, ‘I’m not ringing no bell,’ ” Mrs. Charles said. “That’s a symbol to me of what we used to do back in the day.”
Charles’ cousin Ineata ‘Jellyroll’ Jones took up the offer and her image as Aunt Jemima was sold on postcards in many of the Deen Souvenir Shops.

But that’s not ALL he did, according to the police reports, Huggins then proceeded to quarter Bandit off into more manageable parts.
After seasoning Bandit’s ribs and putting them on the stove to boil, he then proceeded to throw Bandit’s head in the trash. He placed the rest of the pet in freezer bags and stored her in the freezer ‘for future meals’.
“I’ve been to the food pantry, and the mother, I’ve seen her at the food pantry,” Davis said. “So I know they didn’t have to do that for food.”
Authorities charged Huggins with felony cruelty to animals. His bond is set at $2,000 according to arrest records.

It is, once again, the 11th day of September. It is, once again, a clear crisp sunny September day in the New York area. And, once again, just after 8:40 this morning, in a small park a short distance from Ground Zero, they will begin the reading of the names. All of them. Thousands of them, one after the other.
They will pause at 8:46 a.m. for a moment of silence, to reflect on that moment, that clear crisp sunny September day, that September 11th, when a plane piloted by murderous fanatics slammed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
The names will be read again from 8:47 a.m. until 9:03 a.m., when there will be another moment of silence, for the moment when the second plane hit the South Tower. They will be read again until 9:59 a.m., when another moment of silence will mark that moment, nine years ago, when the South Tower fell. They will be read again until 10:29 a.m., when another moment of silence will mark that moment, nine years ago, when the North Tower fell.
And the reading of the names will pick up and continue until all the names, nearly 3,000 of them, have been read.
It is a powerful ceremony, this annual gathering of the families of those lost. It is somber, it is poignant, it is heartwrenchingly painful even now, nine years later.
Nine years. Nine long painful years. Nine years without those responsible being brought to justice. Nine years.
And this year, it will be harder for all of us in the New York region and for all of us in this nation than it has been in the past. For this year, there are other fanatics determined to use this day for their own ends. No fewer than six groups have demonstration permits to air their own grievances. A demented preacher from Florida is still wavering on whether to plunge our troops and our citizens abroad into danger by burning the holy book of a religion he disagrees with. All of the good will and national unity that we hoped might be the true enduring effect of 9/11 is gone. We have somehow let it slip away.
How did we go so wrong? How have we come to ignore all of the things that make this nation so wonderful, so unique -- the freedoms, the tolerance -- and embrace such hatred and such fear? How could we do this to the memory of those we lost that day in September nine years ago?
They did not die at the World Trade Center for us to divide Americans into "us" and "them." They did not die at the Pentagon for us to forget that there are patriotic Americans serving this nation with honor and courage who happen to be Muslims. They did not die in that field in Pennsylvania for us to give in to the fearmongers and the fanatics.
9/11 can't be turned into a time for demagoguery. It can't be converted into a time of xenophobia. It can't be subverted into a reason for Americans to divide. It can't be given over as a platform for our lunatic fringe. Americans of good will, of all races and colors, all genders, all religions, all political stripes, have got to hold firm and keep this day as a day of solemn remembrance.
All those men, women and children who died that day nine years ago deserve better of us than to be turned into a political football. Their loss is not an occasion to preach hatred and sow discord. We do not honor them when we lash out indiscriminately and tar with one brush huge numbers of people whose horror at the events of 9/11 was nearly as great as our own. To the contrary, we truly honor our lost ones when we focus on what is best about this country and when we demand that all the lunatics -- even our homegrown ones -- be called to account for the damage they have done to us.
And we honor them best by using this day, as we have each year in the past, as a time for remembrance. It is time again to do what I swore I would do in the moments before the sun set that Tuesday nine years ago. It is time again to open the film cannister into which I brushed some of the dust of Ground Zero, time again to touch it with my own hands, and time again to stand witness. To make sure that I do not forget. That we do not forget. That no-one forgets. That nearly 3,000 lives will never be forgotten.
To say, one more time, this year and every year, as long as I have life and breath, in words and images, NEVER FORGET.

Until 1999 fewer than 1,000 North Koreans had made the journey to the South, but an influx began after famine hit in the mid-1990s.
The border between the two neighbours is heavily fortified, so most new arrivals make a long and difficult journey via the northern border with China.
China has a repatriation agreement with Pyongyang, so North Koreans must make their way to a third country in order to move on to South Korea.
Once there, they are given resettlement training and help with finding housing by the South Korean government.
The Hail to the King medal is a Halo 3, Halo: Reach and Halo 4 Multiplayer Medal awarded during a King of the Hill match for killing 5 opponents in a row from inside the hill before it moves to another location in the map.
The name is probably a reference to Ash from "Army of Darkness" (Evil Dead 3), as the phrase is one of his most famous catchphrases.
The name may also be a reference to another video game character who fights aliens, Duke Nukem, who uses it as his catchphrase.
This medal is much more easily gained in Mosh Pit than in Crazy King, because the Hill won't move, everyone in the Hill is stronger, and the person in the Hill can kill people outside the Hill and still get the medal. Another way of getting this award is if you have a Energy Sword, Shotgun, Noob Combo or Mauler and an Overshield and just get some kills.

Victoria Falls being the home of so many ghost stories, it stands to reason that its graveyard is an immensely popular tourist attraction. Strangely enough, its most famous occupant isn’t buried here, but is actually a tree! The so-called “Suicide Tree” stands almost in the exact center of the graveyard, a nearby headstone placed almost perfectly to allow someone to climb on it to tie a rope around the tree to hang themselves with. Local legend states that this is exactly what a young widow did on hearing the news that her husband had been killed in World War I.
It’s said that when you stand under the tree’s branches at night, you can hear the poor widow’s sobbing. However, after five teenagers were found dead, hung from the tree the morning after a full moon, the Victoria Falls Police decided to place an officer near the tree at night to dissuade any other potential suicides or vandalism, and do not allow anyone to approach it. They of course deny that you can hear sobbing under the tree. If you ask almost any of the officers though, most will admit that they’ve been too scared to try it for themselves!

My name is Ryan and I live in Sydney. My history is extremely boring and full of horror stories from racist countries so I’ll skip to 5 years ago in a hotel room in Perth, shortly after I moved to Australia. I liked to call myself an IT Professional but in all honesty I was a Windows Systems Administrator for 13 years who discovered that you can actually make a living breaking into peoples shit….ethically of course!
I met a guy in a downstairs bar of a hotel I was staying in and after shooting the shit and finding out we both worked in IT he told me why he was there. He was performing a Penetration Test of that hotel and he explained his life of planes, hotels and laptops and after showing me my first ever exploit, I realised I wanted…no…NEEDED to be him! I wanted his life and I wanted his sorcery! I can’t remember his name but if you are reading this, get in touch!

The objective of the present project is to uses a new techniques for steganography in a HSI color cover images, which hides secret message in the edges of the carrier images using 2-bit LSB substitution for embedding. To get true edges, canny edge detection technique has been used. Amount of data to be embedded plays an important role on the selection of edges. The main advantage of using HIS color mode is that it produces a image with a significantly larg file size hence we hide large amount of secrete message Experimental results have shown that the proposed technique performs better and higher embedding capacity.

As workplaces and organizations become less centralized and more global, online education has become a flexible, convenient and, often, necessary means for training and teaching. But with online education, you are not in the same room with your learners, and keeping them engaged and supported becomes a challenge. Online learners often feel disconnected or unmotivated or are tempted to rush to complete the material. As a teacher or trainer knowledgeable in Dialogue Education™ (DE), this workshop will guide you in using the principles and practices of DE to design online learning environments and programs that have real and lasting impact for your learners.
In Dialogue Education Online, you’ll work online, on your own and with others who also have deep experience and knowledge of DE, guided by facilitator, Karen Ridout. The course consists of a structured series of diverse and creative learning tasks based on Dr. Jane Vella’s book On Teaching and Learning. You’ll be supported and accountable as you participate, practice, reflect, and directly apply the content you’re learning to your own teaching strategies and methods. Throughout the course, you’ll learn to integrate the principles and practices of Dialogue Education in your online education design.
Broaden your own and your organization’s opportunities to reach diverse groups of learners through online education
Design online learning events that assure dialogue and lead to proven engagement with and retention of material, for real and lasting impact
Deepen your knowledge of DE and expand your methods of applying it to your organization’s training objectives
Enhance your value in the workplace and expand your career opportunities through your expertise in this timely and innovative pedagogy
Over the course of eight weeks, you’ll complete one module per week on your own, based on stated completion dates for that module.
In addition, you’ll participate in two collaborative meetings – via Skype, Adobe Connect or telephone – scheduled at specific times as agreed to by you and your fellow participants. The first meeting will be held after Module 2; the second after Module 8.
The reading for this course is On Teaching and Learning: Putting the Principles and Practices of Dialogue Education into Action (Jossey-Bass, 2007) by Dr. Jane Vella. YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE THIS BOOK PRIOR TO THE COURSE.

The added bonus is that you will not only be able to ensure that the scheme is being run correctly and is financially sound, but you will avoid any nasty surprises.
A special levy is an additional amount of money that may be charged on top of a basic levy, to cover a project, upgrade, or extensive repairs that is outside the normal monthly expenditure of a complex. Cameron Jansen, broker/manager of RE/MAX Central, explains that projects requiring a special levy could range from a security upgrade, to adding a feature such as a swimming pool or club house.
Jansen says that, once trustees have identified a specific project, a general meeting will be organised to make the proposal to the homeowners. “Ideally, the proposal should provide the owners with a detailed breakdown of the expenditure involved, as well as an explanation as to why the special levy is necessary,” he says. “A vote will be held with a quorum of 80% required for the interim special levy to be implemented.”
Once the special levy has been agreed upon, there is the matter of payment. According to Jansen payment of a special levy can be made as a once-off payment, over a three- or six-month period, a year or even longer. This will depend on the general consensus of the homeowners.
When a special levy is being raised or paid at the time of sale, trustees will only issue a levy clearance certificate after the seller has settled any outstanding amount on the special levy. In most cases this is not the ideal situation for a seller, but the seller and buyer can then come to an agreement whereby each party is responsible for a pro-rata share of the special levy.
It is therefore important that the seller discloses any special levies being paid to the buyer, and that the buyer requests information on the possibility of future special levies being raised. This ensures the buyer can make an informed decision, taking all possible costs into consideration before purchasing the sectional title unit.

A model SOA application in .NET Part 5: the service layer continued | Exercises in .NET with Andras Nemes
In the previous post we started implementing the IProductService interface. We got as far as declaring a couple of private fields and a constructor. Here we’ll implement the ReserveProduct and PurchaseProduct methods.
Open the project we’ve been working on in this series and locate ProductService.cs. The implemented ReserveProduct method looks as follows:
First we let the product repository locate the requested product for us. If it doesn’t exist then we throw an exception with an appropriate message. We check using the CanReserveProduct method whether there are enough products left. If not then we let the client know in an exception message. Otherwise we reserve the product, save the current reservation status and populate the reservation response using the product reservation returned by the Save method. We wrap the entire code in a try-catch block to make sure that we catch any exception thrown during the process.
If you recall from the first part of this series we talked about the Idempotent pattern. The IsUniqueRequest is an application of the pattern. We check in the message repository if a message with that correlation ID has been processed before. If yes, then we return the response stored in the repository to avoid making the same purchase again. This is not the only possible solution of the pattern, but only one of the viable ones. Probably the domain layer could have a similar logic as well, but I think this is more robust.
If this is a new request then we locate the product just like in the ReserveProduct method and throw an exception if the product is not found. If the product exists then we need to check if the reservation can be made using the reservation ID of the incoming message. If not, then the reservation either doesn’t exist or has expired and a corresponding exception is thrown. Otherwise we confirm the purchase, save the product and dress up the product purchase response using the product purchase object returned by the ConfirmPurchaseWith method. Just like above, we wrap the code within a try-catch block.
This completes the service layer of the SOA project. We’ll look at the web client in the next post. The web client will be a web service client based on the Web API technology so that we don’t need to waste time and energy on presentation stuff such as HTML and CSS.
Really cool stuff. I’m hoping to get into an SOA approach in the near future and was really confused as to how to get started. This definitely helps with the creation of the services.
Something that I have yet to understand is – say you were to create an authentication service which all other services called in order to either authenticate a user login, or ensure that the user is logged in – how does this service get integrated into other services without being a part of those projects and/or the authentication service being tightly coupled with all other services?
I guess I get the idea that the services that call the authentication service have to know how to structure their calls to the authentication service, but this seems pretty tightly coupled at least in the way I’m thinking about it.
Authentication is always a different beast. There are certainly many ways to integrate authentication and authorisation into a service and they all have their pros and cons. You can separate out this entirely by taking a single sign-on approach where the auth server and logic resides in an assembly separated from your main application.
If you are then designing a SOA service like the ticketing service in this series then all users coming wishing to use it must authenticate with the auth server first and come to the ticketing service with a security token. The ticketing service must then evaluate the token early on in the application’s lifetime and reject the request with some appropriate error message if the token is invalid.
The auth token can be generated in a couple of different ways. I have devoted a number of posts to Claims based security that can get you started.
In mobile applications nowadays a different approach is taken: OAuth2, where login is delegated to providers such as Twitter, Google etc. You’ve probably seen consent screens such as “this application will be able to read your tweets”. That’s a telling sign of OAuth2 in the background.
Hey Andras, Thanks a lot for posting this. I am digging into SOA architecture and it really helps. I just got your project from GITHUB and it looks like the SOATester project is missing. Can you hook a brother up?

"All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America rise, not from defects in the Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit, and circulation."
In the setting I am working on now the dwarf-role is being taken by the coblynau (a Welsh faerie that is one of the sources of the US tommyknocker), with the twist that the knocking sound is the low frequency end of their sonar echoes.
There was also the idea presented on the SoogaGames blog whereby dwarves, gnomes and halflings were all one species.
*I quite like the idea of going a bit Elder Scrolls with this - the dwarves, such as they were, backed themselves up onto a series of crystal matrices (perhaps to avoid a plague or something), some of which are installed in mechanical chasses so that they can perform routine maintenance of the mothballed dwarf holds. For whatever reason, the dwarves were unable to revert to "meat mode" and their species essentially no longer exists, leaving a series of "abandoned" dwarfholds for use as "dungeons" ... with some having mechanical guardians for PCs to fight. The crystal matrices, known as "dwarf power stones" are popular amongst the magic community who don't realise that they're consuming dwarven souls when they use them.
I'd couple this with a SoogaGames take whereby you have another "little people" species made up of those dwarves who got locked out of the holds when the grand backup occurred ... following the plague and civilizational collapse they know no more about the original dwarves than humans do and are more like hobbitses than dwarves.
I'm getting a pretty good handle on how I want elves to be. EVERYONE talks about elves, so it's easy to "data mine" (plagiarize) from dozens of sources.
I'm thinking of a mix between Wen Spencer's Elfhome, and pre-Lloth elven kingdoms (Forgotten Realms).
Elfhome: It's a backstory kind of like Riftwar's Dragon Lords and the elves. There was a race of proto-elves who discovered how to use magic to tinker with genetics, the Skin Clan. They used their power to conquer the world, slaughtering some clans, enslaving most. They used their magic to tinker with the proto-elves, giving them all the classic elven traits. And they tinkered with themselves, turning themselves nearly godlike. Eventually, the now-elves rose up in rebellion, and kicked them out. And the Skin Clan keeps trying to get back in control.
Pre-Lloth elven kingdoms, there's the various types of elves (haughty Sun elves, gregarious Moon elves, etc., even the not-yet-Drow Dusk elves). I liked the histories, because in the Crown Wars, it wasn't the proto-Drow who started the atrocities, but a Gold elf kingdom, attacking a Green/Dusk kingdom. So I'd want different kingdoms to have different mixes of sub-races.
I'm still trying to figure out how to get the Blue/Orange morality and the Summer/Winter split into this mix...
But what about dwarves? What makes dwarves unique in your universe? How did they come to be? What defines them? How are they different from "short humans, lives underground, likes gold, gruff, Scottish accent"?
Loves artisanship. Has an aesthetic interest mostly in rock and metalurgy and crafting with such. Make great infantrymen, never forgets a favor or insult. Lives in city-states and tribes but never empires or territorial kingdoms. Very conservative. Always hungers after the past. Stubborn. Resistant to ring-addiction. Made by Aule who goofed up and had to be rescued by Eru because even the Valar can't make a whole intelligent species of their own. And where the heck did the Scottish accent come from?
"The navy could probably win a war without coffee but would prefer not to try"-Samuel Eliot Morrison
Go back to the source: the dvergr of Svartalfheim in Norse mythology. They live underground, and they're good with tools. That's all these dwarfs have in common with D&D dwarves.
Dvergr are intensely magical - they created Thor's hammer Mjölnir, Odin's spear Gungnir, Freyr's ship Skíðblaðnir, and many other artifacts of immense magical power.
Four dvergr have lent their names to the cardinal directions of the compass: Austri, Vestri, Norðri, and Suðri (“East,” “West,” “North,” and “South”) hold the sky off the ground. This is an example of both their strength and their height - dvergr are not short.
Their skin is pitch black. They might or might not have beards. And their accent is Norse, not Scottish.
More at https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/dwarves/ , from which I cribbed most of the above.
My dragon heresy game features dwarves that are mostly derived from this. They have skin that looks like granite (it's still skin, though), they're hairless, and they're actually the source of the dominant human culture in Torengar, which is sort of the "Town" of a DFRPG style campaign if "Town" were a whole realm.
"Despite (GURPS) reputation for realism and popularity with simulationists, the numbers are and always have been assessed in the service of drama." - Kromm
I once did a setting where dwarves and dark elves were the same race, short, pale-skinned, dark-haired (beard optional) and had a worm-like larval form. They could also be killed by sunlight, but the popular idea that they turned to stone was caused by confusion with trolls.
Dwarves don't ever form complete communities. They always find some other species to be craftsmen and miners for, so they don't have to worry about food. They'll still have their own section of the community, but will always have farmers of other races nearby.
There is only one dwarven mine, but its in a weird pocket dimension with entrances spread over the world.
I tend to do this too. Dwarves have a very structured and orderly society, with acknowledged superiors/inferiors in every relationship. They're also very big into conformity and tend to suppress individualism.
Whereas the whole ancestor obsession thing ... Asian fusion seems to be the way to go for dwarves - a Confucian/Shinto/Taoist/Buddhist mix ... much like a lot of actual Chinese people (if you substitute out the Shinto for traditional Chinese animism).
I also like the idea of dwarves whose funeral rites are very similar to their child dedication rites (each essentially marks you moving to or from the spirit branch of the family).
Although thinking about it this could also be about the management of obligations - a dwarvern society in which every individual keeps a strict tally of their debts to one another could well look reciprocity obsessed to outsiders. Recall Pratchett's dwarves whose marriage rites include closing out your accounts with your parents ... in cash terms.
Actually, speaking of Pratchett, how do we portray female dwarves? Rare or just all but indistinguishable from the males? (And recall there was variation even in his dwarves ... the Copperheaders had acknowledged gender within their community whereas that was a massive taboo for dwarves from Uberwald
She's terrible. Like completely awful. I bought a skin for her and it was one of the worst things I've ever done in my life because I feel compelled to play her.
I mean I get her passive is strong. Probably too strong--especially on a decent team. Sure. But she is just unrelenting garbage to play. Her rend is bad. Her leap is bad. Her ultimate is decent but not for its cooldown. And plan of action? That's like...lets take up a skill slot so all of your abilities either suck MORE (like rend) or do what they should in the first place(like her jump).
P.S. Every time I use Sentinel of Zeus and die before it goes off while still spending the cooldown I want to sue Hi-Rez.
Like, her thing is that she has one less skill than everyone else because Plan of Action merely boosts one of her other skills.
Which makes you think that her skills would be on par with everyone else's and then get boosted to being significantly stronger than a typical skill.
But in reality her skills are HOT GARBAGE without Plan of Action and instead get boosted UP to the strength of everyone else's skills... Meaning that Nike gets 1 skill that's up to par and then is stuck with 2 shitty skills while PoA is on CD...
Which makes literally no sense and results in her being mostly just a passive bot, there to buff actually useful gods and then throw out an ult in a teamfight so she can stay alive for a long time in order to keep giving that passive to everyone.
But yeah, the design seems so strange and she is literally carried by her passive being really effective (Especially at her release before it was nerfed a ton)
if uses your logic i give you a lsit of gods with 1 less ability (i mean ability wich works only with other abilities or give boost) :
Nike have the highest winrate in diamond+ becuz she is amazing mostly becuz of her passive she pretty much always ends up in top 5 highest winrate gods in diamond+
Agni fumes actually deals damage though (Max rank it can deal 500 + 50% damage over its full duration) so can be used to clear waves.
Ah Puch's corpse explosion is still a damaging skill in its own right (Though this is kind of lame without corpses to detonate...)
Ameterasu's Divine Presence is literally her best skill as its AoE speed/power and self healing for her.
Ares's Bolster Defences is actually one of his strongest skills what with the massive AoE prots and CCR.
Plan of Action literally does nothing by itself other than a measly bit of HP5 (Which could essentially just be an actual passive...).
Literally the only thing that comes close in terms of not being a skill is Bacchus' Chug which mostly just serves to make his passive work (Though it also gives temp prots too)
But she's not terrible. Rend + PoA has always been unmissable, high-damage poke that also provides strong early clear. She's strong partly for the same reason as Thor--easily-confirmed, long-range, absurdly-high early-game damage.
Nike is really badly designed and overall pretty boring. Most of the time she'll just end up being a walking (broken) passive and ult bot. Earlygame she is pretty easy to clear and poke with, but otherwise yea she's just another ability-warrior that's just... there.
Can't think of any other god who is more boring than Nike. Literally the worst designed kit in SMITE history.
The problem is she just is to weak in too many areas she needs cooldown she needs alot of hp she needs armor she needs two slots for weapons. She needs some speed she needs power. she simply doesn't have the requisite slots to bring her up to basic levels of other warriors.
I have been trying to find a strong arena build for her now for a week best one i made up still falls short.
If i do find a solid build ill post it. I pretty much have a solid base build for everything but warriors even still she is exceptionally hard to build.
The one thing remarkable about her is her wide area swing which can be amazing to unload on a group if you have built her mostly offensively. But then she is super squishy. Still im trying to find a build that takes advantage of that asset.
I like Nike but then I don't like her. One of my issues with her is I have to constantly wear cool down items in order to feel I can do combos better. So I feel I'm reliant on ensuring her cool downs are maxed at least 30-40% kind of like how I play Aphro. However, what I like about her is she can is a great pusher and has an ability to escape and save herself with her ult. Another great aspect that I find is if you give her attack speed LOL she can whoop your ass but the downfall is she can be put down easily as well. So with Nike for me, I have to ensure she has armor and max her cool downs in order to feel productive. So technically, I feel she is better as a bruiser pusher.
It just seems funny that two large matches are slotted for the same day (M1A and Vintage), and then two small matches are slotted together (Roosevelt and Sniper) on Friday.
Last year M1A had 330 shooters, while Roosevelt didn't break 100. Perhaps due to the lack of Krags and 1903's still in circulation?
I am sure that SA has a lot to say about where their match goes, and wants it on the weekend, rather than Friday.
Frankly, I prefer this to Rev1, with JC Garand and M1A on same day. Some on my team will only shoot a single match each day, and were choosing between the Garand and M1A. They were letting the SA match go.

I mentioned in another thread that I have incorporated grappling in the curriculum for Jr students (adults too but this thread concerns jrs only). I thought/hope that the experienced grapplers out there would lend some insight.
First off, Uechi is the core curriculum and the grappling is presented that way. We incorporated the grappling in slowly as part of our 'Virtue Over Violence' program. This gave us an oppurtunity to gauge the interest and reactions by students and parents. Overwhelming success...
Tacticaly/Practicaly the VOV/grappling gave us (the school) more tools to present to the kids for dealing with violence aka bullies etc... In Northborough, a small service based community (read no retail survives, but we have more donut shops, dry cleaners, hair salons and pizza places than towns 3 time the size) of some affluence. Violence is definitely frowned upon. In high school, an ordinary fist fight ended up with police arresting and charging both kids. School policy. In the middle school, any fighting is dealt with by suspension. Same for elementary school. A ZERO TOLERANCE environment. Karate is viewed (right or wrong) as 'violence' here. Wrestling isn't, it's taught in the schools. Maybe a student will still get in trouble for taking a 'dog mount' and holding a bully down but when he explains that he was taught to do that, to control a bully and only hit when absolutely neccessary..well I think you get the drift..
VOV/Grappling gives us a differentiator! We have a great technical program wrapped in a great philosophy.
The kids relate to VOV/Grappling more than they do to kata. We use this to encourage and promote kata! We'll take a move from the kata and show it as a takedown for example.. (sometimes we really have to stretch :-) ). The VOV/Grappling really gets the kids excited.. especially since we have incorporated the grappling into standard sparring class.
Well we experimented, intro'ed the techniques slowly.. Now we are having our first exclusive VOV/Grappling class. I envision demonstrating a flow drill. One that starts off with a punch flowing into a takedown, maybe a side mount, passing into a full mount, an umpa, followed by a passing of the guard. Not meant to be realistic but to get the kids used to doing a technique more live but still controlled...like kumites that they are used to. The class will take 10 minutes to review and practice the current move. Since this is the first class that move will be the last one, a guard pass. A few weeks from now it might be going from side mount to 'dog mount'. We will pause at every position to explore options, dangers etc.. the next 10 minutes to practice the actual kumite or flow drill to whatever point we are at. Finally 15 minutes at the end for randori. We generally start the randori off with kids taking a position and working from there. We take the more experienced kids and start them from their knees... others from standing in a collar tie. We give them a fixed amount of time (like 20 secs) to get something going. If they are being unsafe or just pulling/pushing on each other we move them down a position (from standing to their knees for example).
We will still have 10 minutes to 'flex time' as needed. All participants are required to wear headgear, mouthpiece and cup all in the right places...
Sounds like a class I wouldn't mind taking. What do your sparring classes look like, especially the children's? I bet there are a lot of takedowns, and lots of grappling to follow.
kids sparring class is straightforward.. full gear to start. we work on one technique.. then we spar. we start with warm up sparring which is slow speed sparring with a partner. Next we will do either point sparring or 'self defense' sparring...sometimes we break it up with tag team sparring..btw this works great with randori. We will generally have a take down of the day that the kids can use (limited to that take down). If there is a takedown, then we give them 30 secs to follow up with a dominant position (knee on stomach, mount etc..). With the equiptment it really limits technique to the positions. Next we take off the vest, hands, feet and finish with randori. We start them from a known clinch... if nothing happens after 15 secs. we move them to their knees, then to fixed position (side mount etc)..
Sounds like a great program. I love the Name "Virture over Violence". Grappling skills will certainly round out a young personals self defense arsenal as well as help them develop physically. As you mentioned the kids will love and look forward to this type of interaction.
The flow drills sound excellent and their are endless combinations that can be worked in. Guard passes, moving from pinning positions to other pinning positions, guard sweeps to guard passes to sidemounts. They will have the oppotunity to get the needed high speed play that will be needed to overconme when Virtue meets Violence. I also like the fact that you have not mentioned choking and joint locking for this stage of development.
PS A little trick you can use for groups of youngsters with to much energy to listen to the lesson is to randori before the lesson of the day. After a few rounds they will be anxious for instruction.
While they freestyle I give them instructions on ways to escape holds. I vary this by sparring one week and grappling the next week. If a kid is testing for a belt, depending one which week they fight every kid in the class on the mat or sparring (learned that from Joe P.).
It also gives my daughters good practice for Judo competition. I separate the sparring and grappling work just because it's so hard to grab with gloves on, and falling with a helmet doesn't teach them to keep their head up.
Hey Jim.. excellent advice. we will do the randori first next time.. we do have a couple of 'rowdies'. Wish I could take credit for 'Virtue over Violence' but I can't. This excellent concept came from GEM and (with his permission) I have been using it as a cornerstone for our kids program. We don't do any submission work with the kids yet...not sure when or if we will work it in.
Sorry I missed last Sunday and unfortunately I will miss this sunday too (my parents are flying in and I am getting together with them and the kids). Job/dojo/family makes it tough to find personal time. Please keep a spot open for me though and I will be back the following week.

The idea of converting the solar energy into electricity and/or storable chemical energy (e.g. hydrogen) has been translated into extensive research for decades in many laboratories across the globe. Despite these tremendous efforts, an efficient, sustainable, environmentally friendly and economical system of solar conversion is yet to be found. My project is aiming at developing semiconductor-based nano(or sub-micro)films to be employed as efficient and robust photoanodes in a photoelectrochemical cell, producing hydrogen via water splitting upon solar illumination.
The films are prepared by a spray pyrolysis method which is well-known for its simplicity, versatility, low cost, and short processing time. Variety and reproducibility of the produced films are adjusted and controlled simply by tuning the composition of precursor solutions and the operating conditions under which the deposition is carried out. By utilising these means, important features of the semiconducting films (e.g. optical properties, thickness, surface morphology, recombination rate, chemical composition, degree of crytallisation, etc) can be conveniently modified. In addition, organic wastes are also used as sacrificial hole scavengers in order to hinder the recombination of photocharges (electron-hole pairs) hence enhancing the photocurrents as well as reducing the required external bias for the hydrogen evolution to take place.
The outcome of this research is expected to give a significant contribution in synthesising a green photoconversion system, in which energy is produced from renewable sources (solar light and water) and, at the same time, organic pollutants are photodegraded.

In Early 1997 Rob, with other trikers, planned and flew the first "Great River Safari" which involved joining up with 50 Trikes in total at Wangaratta in Victoria and then most continued on to follow the River Murray with numerous stops through to the Murray Mouth in South Australia.
In Mid 1998 Rob was privileged to fly for Airborne Windsports (the only manufacturer of Trikes in Australia) in Florida USA to demonstrate their aircraft at one of the largest Air shows in the World called Sun 'n Fun.
In Early 2001 Rob was selected with 8 other instructors to assist Airborne in New Castle, NSW to train 18 Israelies to learn to fly in 10 days.
In September 2001, Rob once again was asked to conduct some instruction by Airborne Windsports but this time on his own in Beijing, China. The visit lasted for one month in which many students enjoyed the new experience of Trike flying. The lessons continued with many more students, on the beach in the South of China for the month of April 2002. China is now an established and important export for Airborne.
With Rob's experience in flying, instruction, and support structure, you can be assured of the best training and quality service available.

Tony Conrad plays a mischievous student, who’s broken into his tutor’s study in an effort to grab hold of some test papers. Jaro Stone, in addition, enters the room with exactly the same motive; but he quickly convinces his mate that there’s more to life than exams. Needless to say, Conrad doesn’t take much persuading. Before you know it both lads are laid out on a nearby sofa, engaged in a heavy session of fellatio – during which we reckon most viewers will be hard pressed to choose a favourite between these two mates.
Indeed, by the time that Stone has taken the advantage and is gently rimming and fingering Conrad in anticipation of the inevitable fuck to come, there’s little doubt that most folk will be completely at a loss as to which of these two beauties is the most adorable. A conclusion that’ll only be compounded further by seeing Conrad sink his lithe frame down on his pal’s cock cowboy-style, before he gets taken from behind and promptly spews the contents of his nads over his belly. Leaving Stone to wrap up a classic scene by erupting over his mate’s ass, then sinking his shaft back into Conrad’s hole!

The 2017 New York Yankees season was the 115th season in New York City for the Yankees, and the 117th season overall for the franchise. It was also the final season with manager Joe Girardi. The Yankees finished the regular season with 91 wins and 71 losses. This season was considered a breakout season for many players, including starting pitcher Luis Severino who emerged as arguably the Yankee's best pitcher as well as rookie outfielder Aaron Judge, who broke the rookie record by passing Mark McGwire for most home runs by a rookie (50) on September 25, 2017. Judge ended the season by leading the American League with 52 home runs. The Yankees also clinched a playoff berth after missing the playoffs the previous year and won at least 90 games for the first time since 2012. They struggled to catch up to the defending American League East champions the Boston Red Sox after being in first place for the beginning of the season but managed to clinch their sixth wild card berth, their third in seven seasons. They defeated the Minnesota Twins 8–4 in the Wild Card Game (their first postseason game win in five years) and the Cleveland Indians in five games (after falling into an 0–2 deficit after the first two games in Cleveland) in the Division Series before losing to the Houston Astros in seven games in the 2017 American League Championship Series. Notably, during the postseason the Yankees were 6–0 at home, yet 1–6 on the road, and played an ALCS series that saw every single game won by the home team.
December 15, 2016: Signed closer, Aroldis Chapman to a five-year, $86 million deal, the largest ever for a reliever.
December 20, 2016: Traded Nick Goody to the Cleveland Indians for a player to be named later or cash considerations. The transaction was completed on May 5 with the Yankees acquiring RHP Yoiber Marquina.
The Yankees had one of their most successful spring training performances in recent memory, finishing with a 24-9-1 record - the best in the major leagues.
The team had many players participate in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, including shortstop Didi Gregorius (Netherlands) and relievers Dellin Betances (Dominican Republic), Tyler Clippard (United States), and Tommy Layne (Italy).
One of the most notable elements of Yankees camp in 2017 was the presence of top prospects. Infielders Gleyber Torres, Miguel Andujar, Tyler Wade, and Jorge Mateo, outfielders Clint Frazier, Dustin Fowler, and Aaron Judge, and pitchers Chad Green, James Kaprielian, and Jordan Montgomery highlighted the Yankees' strong farm system's presence at spring training.
Another prominent story in the early going was the rotation battle, with six pitchers battling for the final two spots following Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, and CC Sabathia: Luis Cessa, Green, Bryan Mitchell, Montgomery, Luis Severino, and Adam Warren. Each pitcher performed well in the first few weeks of Spring Training, making manager Joe Girardi's decision a difficult one. In the end, Severino came away with the fourth starter role, with the team waiting until April 10 to announce that Montgomery had won the fifth starter job. He'd make his MLB debut on April 12 against Tampa Bay.
Other position battles in Tampa included that for the starting right field job, between former first-round pick Judge and fourth outfielder Aaron Hicks. Another key competition was an unforeseen battle for the Opening Day shortstop job, as Didi Gregorius was lost for the first month with a shoulder injury suffered in the WBC. Prospect Wade, non-roster invitees Pete Kozma and Ruben Tejada, and utility infielder Ronald Torreyes all competed for the job. Not included in the shuffle were top prospects Torres and Mateo, much to the chagrin of Yankees fans. The jobs were eventually awarded to Judge and Torreyes.
On March 17, three Yankees pitchers combined to no-hit the Detroit Tigers. Tanaka allowed two walks and an error over 4 1/3 innings, Chasen Shreve retired the two batters he faced, and Montgomery shut down Detroit's final 12 batters as the Yankees won, 3–0. It was the first no-hitter in Spring Training since the Atlanta Braves tied the Houston Astros in 2015, and the first for the Yankees since an 11–0 drubbing of the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1983.
Going into the start of the regular season, the Yankees were a mystery to many analysts, as the team was not expected to do much while putting up historic numbers in spring training. Masahiro Tanaka, who had put up spectacular statistics during the spring, including having pitched in a combined no-hitter, was tagged to start Opening Day against the Tampa Bay Rays, in which he'd struggle greatly. CC Sabathia pitched the second game of the young season, pulling the team to a 1–1 record, but the rest of the rotation continued to struggle. Through the team's first five games (3 at Tampa Bay, 2 at Baltimore Orioles) the Yankees were 1–4. In the third game of the series against the Orioles, the Yankees came from behind to win the game, going into their first home stand of the season having gotten their second win.
This momentum would benefit the team greatly, as the Yankees would sweep the first 2 series at Yankee Stadium (3 games against the Rays, 3 games against the St. Louis Cardinals), and taking 2 of 3 against the Chicago White Sox. The Yankees would continue to maintain this momentum through the rest of April, finishing the month with a record of 15–8.
One of the main storylines of the early season were the series of injuries the Yankees suffered. The team started the season without their shortstop, Didi Gregorius, who had maintained an injury playing in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. The team also lost rookie sensation catcher Gary Sanchez within the first five games, and Greg Bird, the first baseman who had missed the entire 2016 season, was performing abysmally, recording only six hits in his first 60 at bats. However, the team managed to work around these issues. Ronald Torreyes[3] and Austin Romine,[4] who were brought in to replace Gregorius and Sanchez, respectively, blew away the expectations placed on them and put up some of the best numbers for players at their positions. Aaron Hicks, who had struggled for much of the 2016 season played exceedingly well, Chase Headley put his lackluster performance in April of the previous season to shame, Starlin Castro hit well enough for the second-best batting average in the American League, and the rotation as a whole pitched amazingly, putting up some of the best numbers in the American League.
By far the biggest story of April, though, was rookie outfielder Aaron Judge. Having struggled in his debut season of 2016, Judge worked extensively over the offseason to adjust his mechanics, reducing his strikeouts and increasing contact rate, while honing his impressive natural power. The adjustments were wildly successful, as Judge dramatically reduced his strikeout rate, put up one of the best batting averages in the league, and tied the record for most home runs by a rookie in the month of April, with 10. He would continue his slugging ways, hit 10 home runs in April, tying a Major League record for rookies.[5]
In a very dramatic game, on Friday, April 28, 2017, the Yankees, at home facing the Orioles, struggled offensively to start the game, with starter Sabathia proving to be ineffective. At the middle of the 6th inning, the Orioles held a 9–1 lead over the Yankees. The Yankees would then put up 3 runs in the bottom of the 6th, to which the Orioles responded by adding 2 more runs, making the game 11–4. The Yankees would attempt to shorten the gap with a Jacoby Ellsbury grand slam to make it 11–8. The Yankees would then score a run in the 9th with an RBI groundout by Ellsbury, followed by a two-run shot by Castro to tie the game. Then, with one out in the bottom of the 10th, Matt Holliday won the game with a 3-run walk-off homerun, capping off an "impossible" comeback win. With it, the Yankees won their fourth come-from-behind game in which they were losing by 8-or-more runs since 2005, twice as many as the next best team.
The Yankees entered May tied with the Baltimore Orioles for first place in the AL East with a 15–8 (.652) record, much better than their 8–15 (.348) 23-game start in 2016. During the opening series of May, Jacoby Ellsbury sustained an injury that would sideline him for nearly a week after colliding into the Yankee Stadium center field wall in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays.[6] On May 2, first baseman Greg Bird was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a nagging ankle injury.[7] The next day, right fielder Aaron Judge was named Rookie of the Month for April, 2017, beating out solid performances from Boston's Andrew Benintendi and Seattle's Mitch Haniger.
On May 7, the Yankees completed a sweep of the defending-champion Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago with an 18-inning 5–4 victory that extended deep into the night (it lasted over six hours by the time the night was done). After closer Aroldis Chapman blew his first save of the season by allowing three runs in the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees' bullpen carried the team through another complete game's worth of extra innings. Of note in this game was the fact that the Yankees and Cubs set the MLB record for strikeouts in a single game with 48. The Yankees also set a major-league record of seven pitchers with multiple strikeouts in their appearances (Luis Severino, Dellin Betances, Chapman, Tyler Clippard, Adam Warren, Jonathan Holder, and Chasen Shreve). Following the victory (and the Washington Nationals' loss), the Yankees held sole possession of the best record in the major leagues at 20–9.
The Yankees retired Derek Jeter's No.2 jersey and played a single-admission double-header on Mother's Day, May 12.[8] The rest of the month would see the Yankees cool off, a result of struggles from Tanaka, a lower output by the offense in general, and a slow-down in the rate Judge hit homers, though he would still finish out the month with 17 homeruns on the season and the AL Rookie of the Month for May. The Yankees would compete with the Orioles for first place until the last week of the month, with the Orioles falling to third, being leapfrogged by the Red Sox. On May 31, the Yankees sat in first place with a record of 30–20 (good for the second-best AL record, behind the 1st place Houston Astros), the Red Sox sitting at 29–23 and the Orioles at 27–24.
From June 7–11, the Yankees scored 8 or more runs in 5 straight games for the first time since 1956.
On July 18 the Yankees acquired Todd Frazier, David Robertson and Tommy Kahnle in a 7-player trade with the Chicago White Sox.
On August 24, 2017, at Comerica Park the Yankees and Detroit Tigers game broke into a brawl. The altercation led to several suspensions and fines for players on both teams, with the game being labeled as the "MLB's wildest game of the 2017 season."[9]
With the Tigers up 6–3, Yankees pitcher Aroldis Chapman began to warm up in replacement for the ejected Kahnle. Yankees catcher Austin Romine and Tigers designated hitter Miguel Cabrera were standing facing each other behind the plate, as Romine was due to catch and Cabrera was due to bat. With Torres' back turned facing them, the two exchanged phrases until Cabrera stepped towards Romine, leading Romine to take off his catcher's mask. Cabrera then shoved Romine in the chest. Romine tackled Cabrera to the ground, with the two throwing punches at each other.[10] At this point, the benches on both sides cleared, and a fight formed in the center of the field. Gary Sánchez ran out from the dugout and landed punches on Cabrera and Tigers' third baseman Nicholas Castellanos before his teammate, injured Yankees' outfielder Clint Frazier, attempted to restrain Sánchez.[11] Austin Romine ended up beside his brother, Tigers infielder Andrew Romine. As the fight cleared, both Austin Romine and Cabrera were ejected from the game for their roles in the fight.[12]
In a postgame press conference, Girardi visibly expressed frustration with the umpiring crew for their mishandling of the situation, specifically the lack of a warning after Fulmer's hit on Sánchez. "If you can't see that Fulmer clearly hit Sánchez on purpose, there's something wrong. I think it could have really been avoidable."[13] He stressed the importance of the game due to the Yankees' playoff aspirations compared to the 4th-place Tigers, and cited an inconsistent strike zone at the end of the game. Regarding Romine's ejection, he said "Cabrera went after him and you're gonna throw my catcher out for protecting himself? I mean, pay attention. Somebody's gotta pay attention to what's going on in this game." He demanded additional discipline for Ausmus, rhetorically asking, "Brad Ausmus is going to say 'F-you' to one of my players? Come on, Brad. What is that?"[14]
Romine claimed that Cabrera asked him, "You got a fucking problem with me?", then took off his mask and got shoved to the ground. "It felt like he wanted a confrontation there and I just tried to defend myself the best I could."[15] Sánchez, who was seen throwing punches, stated through his interpreter that "At that moment, instinct just takes over, because you want to defend your teammate. That's your family out there."[16]
Gardner, who was involved in altercations with Ausmus and Iglesias, said "I thought the way things were handled, things got out of hand in a hurry. You'd like to see that get squashed from the start. It's not good for the game... I think any time you go through some controversy, it can bring guys together." Todd Frazier, on getting hit by Wilson, said "I thought everything was done with. I just kept asking him, 'Did you do that on purpose?' He wouldn't say a word, just kept staring at me, and that's when I got pretty excited."[17]
The next day, Major League Baseball announced discipline for the players involved in the brawl, including the suspensions of five players and managers and the finings of seven additional participants. Cabrera received the longest suspension at seven games, while Yankees catcher Sánchez received the longest suspension on his team at four games. All disciplined players had their suspensions reduced by one game following appeals.
The Yankees were swept at home by the American League-leading Cleveland team from August 28–30, after which Cleveland went on to record a historic 22-game win streak.[18]
In September, Aaron Judge broke out of a prolonged slump[19] and the Yankees pulled ahead in the American League wildcard race by winning 23 of their final 34 games. From September 11–13 a three-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays was relocated from Tropicana Field to Citi Field due to Hurricane Irma, marking the first time since 1998 that the Yankees played a game in Queens not against the Mets.[20]
The Yankees clinched a post-season berth in Toronto on September 23. The Yankees continued their 6 man starting rotation throughout the month. Both relief pitchers Dellin Betances and Aroldis Chapman showed some struggles during this month.
On September 25 in a makeup game against the Kansas City Royals, Aaron Judge tied and broke the MLB rookie record for home runs hit in a single year. In doing so, he also became the youngest player to have 7 multi-home run games in Yankee history since Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle.
Yankees won the AL Wild Card Game 8–4. Yankees rallied from trailing 0–2 to rally to win the ALDS in 5 games against Cleveland Indians. Yankees also trailed the ALCS 0–2 and were 1 win away from heading to the World Series but failed and lost in 7 against the Astros. On October 26, 5 days after the Yankees were eliminated the team announced that they would not bring back Joe Girardi for the 2018 season.

Brigadier General Arthur Melland Asquith, DSO & Two Bars (24 April 1883 – 25 August 1939) was a senior officer of the Royal Naval Division, a Royal Navy land detachment attached to the British Army during the First World War. His father, H. H. Asquith was the British Prime Minister during the first three years of the conflict and later became the Earl of Oxford and Asquith. Arthur Asquith was wounded four times in the war and three times awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his bravery under fire. In December 1917, Asquith was seriously wounded during fighting near Beaucamp and was evacuated to Britain where one of his legs was amputated. Asquith retired from the military following his wound and worked for the Ministry of Munitions.
Arthur Asquith was born in 1883, the third son of politician H. H. Asquith and his wife Helen Melland, who died when Arthur was seven in 1891. Asquith was educated at Winchester College with his brothers and later attended New College, Oxford as an undergraduate. After completing his studies, he joined the trading firm Franklin & Herrera, with whom he did extensive business in Argentina.[1]
When the First World War broke out in the summer of 1914, Asquith resigned from Franklin & Herrera and joined the Royal Navy, explaining that he could not "sit quietly by reading the papers" during the conflict. His elder brothers also joined up, Raymond Asquith was commissioned in the London Regiment and was killed in action in 1916 while Herbert Asquith joined the Royal Artillery. As the Royal Navy had too many recruits in the early months of the war, they formed a separate division to deploy on land known as the Royal Naval Division. This force was rapidly deployed to Belgium with Asquith as a junior officer.[2]
The Royal Naval Division suffered heavy casualties in the Siege of Antwerp, and was withdrawn shortly before the city fell, but in 1915 it was redeployed to the Mediterranean for use in the Gallipoli Campaign. Shortly after arrival, Asquith's friend and colleague Rupert Brooke died from an infected mosquito bite. During the Gallipoli Campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions but was also wounded, resulting in his withdrawal to staff work.[3]
In 1916, The Royal Naval Division, now designated the 63rd Division, was sent to the Western Front. Asquith remained as a staff officer until April 1917, when heavy casualties forced him to replace Bernard Freyberg in command of the 189th Brigade. At the head of this formation, he participated in heavy fighting throughout the year, earning two Bars to his DSO and being wounded twice more.[3]
On 17 December 1917, Asquith was badly wounded forcing his evacuation to Britain. Despite extensive surgery, his leg was amputated in January 1918, forcing his retirement from the military with the rank of brigadier general. He then served the remainder of the war with the Ministry of Munitions, in the Controller of the Trench Warfare Department.[1] Asquith retired from the Navy following the end of the war to his home Clovelly Court, Devon.[citation needed]
Following the end of the war, Asquith chaired the committee which established the Royal Naval Division War Memorial outside the Admiralty building in London.[4]
In the Directory of Directors for 1935, the Hon Arthur M Asquith of 1 London Wall Buildings EC2 is listed as chairman of Brazil Plantations Syndicate Ltd, chairman of Parana Plantations Ltd and a director of San Paulo (Brazilian) Railway Co Ltd.[5]
Asquith came across many risk factors throughout his military career and eventually died of Hodgkin Lymphoma at Clovelly Court, Devon on 25 August 1939.[6]

The cosmos (UK: /ˈkɒzmɒs/, US: /-moʊs/) is the universe. Cosmos is used at times when the universe is regarded as a complex and orderly system or entity; the opposite of chaos.[1] The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in cosmology, which is a very broad term covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concept of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.
The philosopher Pythagoras first used the term cosmos (Ancient Greek: κόσμος) for the order of the universe.[2][3] The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath Alexander von Humboldt resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, Kosmos, which influenced modern and somewhat holistic perception of the universe as one interacting entity.[4][5]
Cosmology is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and philosophical systems have a cosmology.
When cosmology is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In physical cosmology, the term cosmos is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular spacetime continuum within a (postulated) multiverse. Our particular cosmos, the observable universe, is generally capitalized as the Cosmos.
In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term cosmic signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the Big Bang), 'cosmic rays' (high energy particles or radiation detected from space), and 'cosmic microwave background' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).
According to Charles Peter Mason in Sir William Smith Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), Pythagoreans described the universe.[6]
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from Philolaus) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)
Cosmology is a branch of metaphysics that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.[7] The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the Big Bang theory is the dominant postulation.
In theology, the cosmos is the created heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and fixed stars). In Christian theology, the word is also used synonymously with aion[8] to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the afterlife or world to come.
Thales dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by Thales, was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the Milesian. (p. 1016)
Plato, describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes teleologically, as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes cosmologically, as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the cosmological, as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)
Aristotle says the poet Orpheus never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain Cercon (see Cercops).
The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus.

The Republic of Ireland football league system currently consists of 12 levels. Traditionally association football leagues in the Republic of Ireland have been classified as either senior, intermediate or junior. These leagues are effectively national, provincial and district leagues respectively. The two highest level leagues/divisions, the League of Ireland Premier Division and the League of Ireland First Division are both national leagues. Together they make up the League of Ireland. The third level currently consists of three provincial leagues – the Leinster Senior League Senior Division, the Munster Senior League Senior Premier Division and the Ulster Senior League Senior Division.
The original top level league for what is now the Republic of Ireland was the Irish Football League. Founded in 1890, this league is now the Northern Ireland Football League. Before the partition of Ireland, three Dublin clubs – Bohemians, Shelbourne and Tritonville – played in the Irish Football League.[1] The League of Ireland was founded in 1921 and its Premier Division is now the top level division.[2]
The two oldest association football leagues in what is now the Republic of Ireland are the Leinster Senior League and the Munster Senior League. The former was founded in 1896 [3] while the latter first appeared in the early 1900s. The Leinster Senior League's jurisdiction included the Greater Dublin Area, the most populated region in the country, and as a result it was effectively a de facto second level league between 1896–97 and 1964–65. In 1964 the League of Ireland formed the first formal national second level division, the League of Ireland B Division.[4] In 1985, following a reorganisation, the B Division was replaced as the second level league by the League of Ireland First Division. As part of this reorganisation, a promotion and relegation system involving the top two national divisions was introduced for the first time.[5]
From 1964–65 until 2008 the Leinster Senior League and the Munster Senior League formed the third level. They were subsequently joined at this level by the Connacht Senior League in 1981 and the Ulster Senior League in 1986. Between 2008 and 2011, the provincial leagues were briefly replaced as the third level by a short lived national third level league known as the A Championship. Following the demise of the A Championship, the provincial leagues regained their third level status.
A promotion and relegation system has existed between the League of Ireland Premier Division and the League of Ireland First Division since 1985–86. Between 2008 and 2011, A Championship teams were also eligible for promotion to the First Division. Promotion and relegation systems also operate within the separate provincial league systems. There is no formal promotion and relegation relationship between the provincial leagues and the League of Ireland. Teams have been invited to join the League of Ireland however. In 2015, Cabinteely of the Leinster Senior League became the most recent team to accept an invite.
Organised in the structure of a football pyramid, but in reality operates as a number of separate unconnected entities with no movement between each of them.

The 2014 Tour De France is underway. Hundreds of elite cyclists are racing through the picturesque mountains of France in an amazing feat of endurance. Although I am not a big cycling fan, I am a huge fan of acupuncture! So, I was thrilled to learn that super star cyclist Alberto Contador is using acupuncture to help him with his knee pain during the race. He injured his knee early in the race and uses acupuncture to combat the pain and inflammation. I also learned that Tyler Hamilton, who is now retired, also used acupuncture during the 2004 Tour.
knee. He hurt it twice in the opening stages of the Tour de France, first as part of his two crashes in stage five to Cap Fréhel and again on Sunday’s stage to Saint Flour.
Back in 2004 Tyler Hamilton received acupuncture after a bike accident during the race injured his back and shoulder.
From the associated press during the 2004 Tour De France: Acupuncture Helped Rider with Back Pain in the Tour de France Race
“Just a week into this year’s race, Hamilton flew off his bike again, hurting his back and shoulder in another big spill.”
“I was involved in the crash three days ago and hurt my back pretty badly,” Hamilton said. He has been receiving treatment since. “I just finished doing some acupuncture on my back.”
Side note: I read Tyler Hamilton’s book ‘The Secret Race’ (written with Daniel Coyle) while on vacation and really enjoyed it.
I never realized that so many athletes use acupuncture to overcome different injuries that they may receive. I have never tried out acupuncture personally, but have learned quite a bit about it. I figured that if it has worked so well for millions of people in the past, then why couldn't it work for me too? http

They say there are 365 ways to cook cod in Portugal. Here’s one of them, a recipe for cod in Paleo clam sauce.
They say there are 365 recipes to cook cod in Portugal, one for every day of the year. During my trip to Lisbon, I got to try a handful, and there’s no doubt this Bulhão Pato cod served with a paleo clam sauce simmered to perfection by the chef of the Four Seasons in Lisbon was one of the most remarkable.
The name for this popular Bulhão Pato clam sauce comes from a famous Portuguese poet, Raimundo de Bulhão Pato, who was fond of this clam sauce and often mentioned it in his writing.
This version of cod served with a paleo clam sauce differs a little from the original and aims to create a healthy version of the dish which is paleo, gluten free, dairy free and compliant to the requirements of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP).
When I interviewed the Executive Chef of the Four Seasons Lisbon, Pascal Meynard, I saw him lit with the same passion for food, travel and adventure that’s a common trait in all the other chefs I had the honor to meet around the world. “I love to travel and learn about new cultures, cooking techniques, dishes and ingredients”, he told me to start off our interview, making his biggest passions crystal from the very beginning.
Chef Pascal started his career studying and working at a Michelin star restaurant in France, where he’s from. After that, he worked in several Four Seasons across the globe: from Montreal, Canada to Milan, Geneva and London. He got to feed the guests of some Michelin Star restaurants in France, and he even ventured to the rugged island of Tasmania, where he consulted for the opening of a specialty seafood restaurant in Hobart.
With such an eclectic background, how could I not ask him the question I ask every Chef I meet: “What’s the one ingredient you’d take with you from the countries you visited?”
Chef Pascal doesn’t need to think twice: “Well, I take lobster from Canada, small milk lamb from Tasmania and risotto from Milan. From London instead I’d like to take with me the British passion for fusion cuisine, as well as the amazing fresh food and great fish markets”.
Only when it’s time to select French ingredients Chef Pascal has a hard time making a choice. Not only is France home for him, but also the place where he learned to make magic in the kitchen at Alain Ducasse’s School and in Paris.
“French food is all amazing – he tells me – but if I can only pick one thing, I would say black truffle, duck and foie gras”. “…Wait, weren’t those three Chef?!” ;)
Portuguese food quickly became a big favorite too for Chef Pascal. Being an avid fish lover, from the kitchen of the Four Seasons in Lisbon, he can express all of his inventiveness cooking with the immeasurable seafood choices that the ocean has to offer.
“I love the amazing fresh, local fish you can find here in Lisbon. I get to be so creative combining the Portuguese gastronomic heritage and the local fish and seafood with the expertise and cooking techniques I learned throughout my career”.
This is exactly how his signature dish “Bulhão Pato Cod” (confit cod with a paleo clam sauce) was born. And in today’s recipe, we got to redesign it together in a healthier way, avoiding dairy and soy lecithin (which is normally used to thicken the clam sauce).
In this dish Chef Pascal mixed a bit of Portugal (the clam sauce called “Bulhão Pato”) with a typical French technique to make cod “confit” (a French word that means “preserved”, used when meats of fish are cooked in fat at low temperatures until tender).
I had a blast watching Chef Pascal in action and learning from him in the spotless kitchen of the Four Seasons Lisbon… and can you imagine my excitement when I found a custom made gluten and dairy free cake delivered from his team to my room?!
Anyways… it’s not time for dessert now (yet); so check out the recipe for this gourmet Cod Confit with Paleo Clam Sauce. It’s not every day that you get to peak into a Michelin Star Chef’s kitchen and cook like one while keeping it healthy!!
NOTE: Some of the ingredients used in this recipe are a bit unusual (like the pickled pearl onions, goose barnacle, and the Salicornia you see on the side). Don’t get discouraged and use the replacements that Chef Pascal suggested. The dish will be equally delicious!
10 Pickled Pearl Onions (you can find them in the pickle isle of your grocery store, OR replace them with 1 tbsp of lemon zest to cut the fattiness of the sauce)
Add 1 lt of extra virgin olive oil in a pot, together with the bay leaves, garlic cloves, coriander stems and seeds. Bring the temperature to 80 C (make sure the oil does not fry) and add the 4 portions of cod fish.
Let the fish cook for approximately 7 minutes (or, if you have a kitchen thermometer, until the interior temperature of the fish has reached 45 C).
When the clams start to open (this should take about 3 minutes, depending on how fresh the clams are and if the pot is hot or not minutes), strain the liquid for the paleo clam sauce and set the clams aside.
Repeat the same procedure for the razor clams. While it is possible to cook all the clams together at the same time, the Chef would not recommend it because different types of bivalves open at different times so one would end up over cooked.
Combine the sauces obtained from straining the razor clams and the clams, add lemon juice to taste and a few drops of olive oil and process with a hand blender mixer. This will help your paleo clam sauce thicken and give it a nice texture and volume.
Place the cod confit in the middle of a plate, scoop the paleo clam sauce around it and top it with the goose barnacles, pickled beet pearl onions and sea sprouts.
Like always, if you like this recipe, save it on your favorite Pinterest board and share with your friends on Facebook, so that it will be easier for you to find it when it’s time to cook!

After Nebraska took the lead early in the second half, Colorado almost turned the game into a rout after halftime. The Ice used the big play on offense and an outstanding defensive game plan to snap the Danger's 14-game home win streak to earn a 41-28 win in front of nearly 3,300 fans.
"You have to give Colorado a whole bunch of credit," Nebraska coach Mike Davis said. "They had a heck of a game plan and we allowed way too many big plays on defense. Against a good team, you can't do that and expect to win."
One play, seemingly, did the trick for Colorado who scored four of their five touchdowns on plays of 40 yards or more.
After Nebraska took a 20-17 lead on Kayne Farquharson's 6-yard touchdown catch to open the second half, the Danger added a point on Darnell Terrell's rouge for a 21-17 lead. But, Colorado regained the lead for good on a desperate third-and-9 play from their own six.
On the play, the IFL's leading passer, Willie Copeland, was forced to scramble back to his own end zone before he connected with former Nebraska-Kearney receiver Kyle Kaiser for a 44-yard touchdown. Nebraska was never the same.
Nebraska quarterback Jameel Sewell — who had turned the ball over just once in the Danger's five-game winning streak — was intercepted for the second time of the game on the next possession and Colorado quickly turned it into a 29-yard yard touchdown from Copeland to Jasonus Tillery.
"Our turnovers were big and we didn't force any either," Davis said. "That's huge in a game like this. You have to win the turnover battle or it is going to be an uphill battle."
The Danger fought back late and had one final chance. Down 34-28 and facing fourth-and-4 from their 10 with 21 seconds left, Sewell's pass to Farquharson was broken up perfectly by Corey Sample preserving the victory for Colorado. Two plays earlier, it appeared Sewell had connected with Andre Piper-Jordan in the end zone but the ball went through his hands.
"We have to be able to bounce back," Davis said. "And, we have to do it quickly. We'll see how our guys we respond."
Colorado hung on to a 17-13 halftime on a pair of big plays in the first quarter. After Nebraska opened the scoring on a Joe Houston 28-yard field goal, the Ice struck on their first play from scrimmage when Copeland connected with Kaiser for a 45-yard score.
The Danger drove to the Colorado 1-yard line on their next possession but a mishandled snap moved the ball back to near mid-field and Houston missed a field goal. On the next play, Copeland connected with Tillery for another 45-yard score and a 14-3 lead at the end of the first period.
Nebraska chipped in to the lead early in the second quarter when Sewell hit new wide receiver OJ Simpson for a 5-yard touchdown that capped a 9-play, 45-yard drive. The teams then traded field goals as Houston's 31-yard kick with no time left cut the Ice lead to four points at the break.
Colorado now controls its destiny for hosting the IFL playoffs even though Nebraska (9-3) has clinched a berth. The win for the Ice draws them even in the loss column with the Danger and they would own head-to-head tiebreakers. Colorado (8-3) can clinch a berth in the playoffs with one win in their final three games.

This class implements a label bureau. The database for labels is provided by the underlying file system. The organisation is as follows:
The LabelBureau is attached to some directory D. For each service it handles, you have to create a subdirectory, according to the service name (its identifying URL). So for example, if you want to provide ratings as www.rating.com, you will have to create a D/www.rating.com directory.
Uner this service directory, for each site you want to label, you have to create a sub-directory. In our example, if our rating service wants to label www.w3.org, you will have to create a D/www.rating.com/www.w3.org directory. This directory should reflect the space of the labeled server (ie having the same file hierarchy), and each file should be the label itself (as transmited).
Create a new LabelBureau. The configuration files from the label bureau (the place were it takes its labels from), is given by the provided directory.

Linelly Olmeda Santos is a Puerto Rican dancer, choreographer, dance educator and advocate as well as a dance/movement therapist and counselor. She grew up at Puerto Rico and started dancing at Academia Iveth Mejías, now Beyond Dance Studio at Toa Baja, PR. She began classes at the University of Puerto Rico and finished her BA in Dance Performance and Choreography with a minor in Psychology from Hope College in Holland, MI in December 2012. In June 2015 she completed her MA in Dance/movement Therapy and Counseling from Drexel University. Some of Linelly’s professors include: Militza Arzola, Solimar Arzola, Carla Curet, Petra Bravo Hernández, Viveca Vazquez, Steven Iannancone, Matthew Farmer, Crystal Frazier, Mary Linda Graham, Alicia Díaz and others.
Linelly believes that dance can be used to bring awareness of social and environmental problems as well as build community and provide solutions in an experiential way.
Cataño is a water front municipality from Puerto Rico right across from Old San Juan. There are numerous communities in this area as well as factories and restaurants and the water in the area has been reported to be contaminated multiple times. Around the whole island we have an issue of too much trash, especially in and close to bodies of water. Cataño already began a recycling program and multiple organizations continue to advocate and educate about the problem of contamination that we have in our rivers and beaches, but a lot of education still needs to happen in our communities.
Local musicians will be collaborating and composing the music that will be used in the first two sections of the dance. It will be recorded for the day of the performance.
The performance will be the closure of a cleaning event of the area. It will have approximately 7 dancers from Beyond Dance Studio, plus staff from the Municipal office that will join in the third part. The dance is planned more as a flash mob, where not everyone participating in the cleaning activity knows about the dance. We will be wearing blue T-shirts during the whole event to be able to be easily identified.
During the cleaning event we will be dividing the trash into recyclable materials to use the activity as an opportunity to actively recycle and educate about recycling. We are planning to provide Boxed Water as an alternative to plastic bottled water. We are also planning to develop a workshop in collaboration with local organizations to do a summer workshop next year where we integrate the arts to educate about reusing and recycling and changes that we can locally make and produce the piece from that experience.

Frequent link audits can save your site from the dangers of negative SEO. If you constantly monitor your links, it’s easier to spot a sudden change before it becomes uncontrollable. Focus on keywords that have higher search volume but don’t neglect long tail keywords. If optimized right, you can get more traffic from keywords with less search volume. While you should not hide your heading tag in an image, you should still give search engines more opportunities to link to your website by adding keywords in the image alt text and file name. Enter one of your keywords into the search box of the search engine of your choice to determine the sites with the top search engine placement for this word. You are aiming for keywords that are frequently used by your target audience, but do not have many competing pages.
Having a domain name that makes sense is one of the most basic and obvious ways you can help to boost your website’s SEO. When deciding on a name for your domain, you must make sure it is relevant to your business. Best practice dictates that the simpler it is, the better. There have been many minor changes to the layout of Search Engine Results Pages. Local and more location-specific searches have become more commonplace — especially on mobile devices. Google will show less information in the search results on mobile than on a desktop. Your meta descriptions and your titles will be truncated if you made them too long. Thinks about that when you optimize your posts and pages. It takes time for Google to recognize your website and assign it the authority it deserves. It takes time for it to see that changes have been made, compare the quality of your website and your content to everyone else in the same space.
Machines are writing stories and that is often something Google is not a fan of. The number of external links you receive is important. Some of the top SEOs say external links are simply invaluable to your ranking power. Users searching for your site on Google might not necessarily want to land on your homepage. SEO success relies heavily on the keywords you choose to target.
When website copy contains a wider variety of terms and keywords all relative to the same topic, it appears more natural, resulting in higher rankings. The content flows naturally, more like a conversation you might have with someone. SEO experts have been talking about mobile technology for a while now. This year, it’s even more important than ever that you sit up and listen to what they’re saying. It’s now extremely common for people to use their mobile devices to perform a search instead of using a desktop or laptop computer. As you spend time identifying your target audience and conducting keyword research, you’ll begin to uncover long tail keywords that will help you identify the best options for naming and describing your product or service. Gaz Hall, from SEO Hull, had the following to say: "Search engines are invested in providing users a great mobile experience."
Clearly define your objectives in advance so you can truly measure your ROI from any programs you implement. Imagine what a one-second increase in website load time could do for Amazon? More importantly, what could it do for you? SEO is not about one-time actions. It is a continuous optimization process. One crucial basis for optimization is valid data about user behavior. Regular monitoring is one of the key tasks of search engine optimization that makes it possible to quickly react to traffic decline or other occurrences. Whether or not a specific page ranks for a particular keyword depends largely on the quality of that individual page (content, user experience, number and quality of the backlinks, page load speed etc), and not the quality of your website as a whole.

Loretta Lynn's first hit single, "I'm a Honky Tonk Girl" was released on the tiny Vancouver, B.C. label Zero Records in 1960. The singer was living with her husband Doolittle (aka Mooney) and their four kids in Custer, Washington, a short hop across the border from the Canadian city. Loretta explains in her 1976 autobiography Coal Miner's Daughter that Norm Burley, a wealthy, retired timber executive from Vancouver, saw her perform on Buck Owen's Bar K Jamboree TV show out of Tacoma. The lumber baron was so impressed with her performance on Buck's hoedown that he decided to start a record label specifically to record her.

During a long nighttime stakeout kneeling in some desert weeds in the spring of 1980, U.S. Customs Agent Tommy Austin tells Arizona Department of Public Safety Officer Ron Cox his problem.
His wife’s friend Linda has a small son named Chris Greicius who is probably going to die of leukemia. The seven-year-old boy yearns to be a police officer “to catch bad guys” with Austin. Running into bureaucratic hesitation at Customs, Austin asks Cox if maybe DPS can do something. “I’ll rent a helicopter myself if I have to,” Austin says.
Cox takes the request to DPS spokesman Allan Schmidt, who asks DPS Director Ralph Milstead. He gives Schmidt carte blanche to grant Chris’ wish. Soon Austin receives a call from Chris’ mom saying that she doesn’t think he can hang on much longer.
“None of us had any idea what we were getting into at the time,” Schmidt will recall 30 years later. He draws other people in: Officer Jim Eaves will bring his patrol car, and Officer Frank Shankwitz his motorcycle, to meet the DPS helicopter flying Chris to headquarters. On April 29, Chris comes from Scottsdale Memorial Hospital to the empty lot by DPS at Lewis and 19th Avenue. There he and his parents are given a tour. That’s when Lt. Col. Dick Schaefer gives the boy a “Smokey Bear” hat and one of his own old badges, and Chris becomes Arizona’s first and only honorary DPS officer.
Everyone who meets the beaming boy chewing bubble gum wants to help. At the end of the day, some of those involved meet in a spontaneous group hug and realize they don’t want the day to be the end of it. They also know they don’t have much time.
Two of them, Cox and Eaves, go to John’s Uniforms, the business that makes all DPS uniforms, and order one Chris’ size. Employees work all night to have it ready the next day. A group of officers take the uniform to his house, where Shankwitz sets up cones for Chris to steer his battery-powered motorcycle through to qualify for a motorcycle officer’s wings.
But when they return the next day to present the wings to Chris, he’s gone back into the hospital. With his DPS gifts all around him, clutching his new wings, Chris gives a last smile for the men who have done so much for him in such a short time. He passes May 3.
He was only seven years, 269 days old when he died. But he taught me about being a man. Even though he was only a boy. I can tell you that because of meeting Chris, I am an entirely different man. Ron Cox said the same thing. He said he didn’t fear death anymore, because he knew Chris would be there waiting for him. ”
Officers Frank Shankwitz and Scott Stahl fly back to Illinois for the funeral; Chris is given the ceremony of a fellow fallen officer.
From the time the two officers land in Chicago to when they leave again, word spreads of their story, and they are amazed at how strangers are affected by it. They talk on the flight home of making this the beginning of something wonderful for children.
Meanwhile in Phoenix, similar discussions are taking place. At an officer's retirement party, Shankwitz talks to Kathy McMorris, the wife of a DPS officer, about creating a wish-granting organization.That summer, a group of working-class DPS officers, friends and family gather. That meeting marks the beginning of Make-A-Wish.
The first donation is $15, given to Shankwitz by a grocery store manager. For month records, bills and change are kept in envelopes carried around by founders. In November of 1980 the group receives its tax-exempt status as a non-profit organization. By the following spring the group has raised $2000 and can grant its first official wish.
Frank "Bopsy" Salazar is the first official Make-A-Wish® kid. He's 7 and has leukemia - just like Chris.
Shankwitz is president at the time and decides to grant Poncho “Bopsy” Salazar all three of his wishes: to be a fireman, go to Disneyland and ride in a hot air balloon.
So the Phoenix Fire Department gives Bopsy an experience similar to Chris’ as a police officer; he becomes a member of the Engine 9 crew. Since the first wish is also the first Disney wish, the Anaheim Fire Department picks up the baton, taking Bopsy and his family around Southern California. Shankwitz keeps the first “wish kid art,” a picture Bopsy drew him, on which he wrote, “Poncho (Frank in Spanish), I got to blow the siren.”
Upon returning home, Bopsy goes into the hospital. His physician, Dr. Paul Baranko, is surprised at hearing a commotion coming from the boy’s room and going into see firemen climbing in through the third-story window off the fire engine ladder! Bopsy passes that night.
As his mother, it was very meaningful to me that people who didn’t know us stepped forward to be in Bopsy’s life. ”
The following spring, in 1982, the television show NBC Magazine sends a reporter to do a story about this small new charity that’s granting wishes to children fighting for their lives.
As millions of viewers across the country see the piece, DPS telephone lines are jammed with calls from people who want to be part of it. The new organization isn’t positioned to harness the explosive enthusiasm. But its founders are undaunted by the challenges and determined to succeed.
Under the leadership of Jack Stanford, the little engine that could, does, and the national Make-A-Wish Foundation is incorporated in May of 1983. More chapters open across the nation.
Our volunteers are essential to making wishes come true. Find out how to volunteer for Make-A-Wish® Iowa.

Learn about long-term budget and finance planning modeling to minimize guesswork and maximize productivity. Experts from Piper Jaffray and ISFIS developed this model to explore the concepts of long-term general fund budget planning and financial projections. This new projection model will minimize your work in this effort. The team will demonstrate how this model takes the guesswork out of your long-term planning. This model is simple to use, allows for input of assumptions, either district-developed or developed by third party (such as enrollment projections). The model gives district leaders and school boards easy access throughout the year to multi-year budget projections based on real data, thus fostering better policy-level decision making, in an easy to use, intuitive interface. (This session will repeat three times throughout the conference, allowing for a smaller class size, so each SBO in attendance can enter assumptions into the model, see the impact of those changes on taxes and spending authority, and work with their line-item budget tab to determine how best to track expenditures.)
Learn from two economics and tax policy experts about state tax policy as they share their recommendations for Iowa in comparison to the tax cuts legislation enacted during the 2018 session. Randy Bauer and Dave Swenson will share tax policy trends from around the nation, explain the economic impact of tax policy changes, anticipate what impact recent Iowa legislation will have on the state’s revenues, and correspondingly, the legislature’s ability to adequately fund education in the future.
This information is critical for school business officials to understand and best inform their work in long-range planning and projections, as well as being able to support school administrators and school board members in their advocacy work with state policymakers on behalf of the staff and students in their school districts.
Kevin W. Techau will share his history in leading the Iowa Department of Public Safety in implementing emergency procedures changes after the 9/11 bombing of the world trade center. Kevin will also share his understanding of critical planning steps to prevent incidents as well as planning to deal with the unknown, such as an active shooter, or food borne pathogens and viruses. Kevin will discuss the new Iowa law requiring emergency preparedness plans, including working with local law enforcement and other stakeholders, and prepare district leaders to take their next planning steps to keep staff and students safe.
Jon will explain the basics of Iowa Property Taxes, in light of recent disruptive reforms. This session will review the commercial and industrial property tax reform of 2013, including how that is playing out for residential property taxpayers down the road. Jon will also show how the state’s recent practice to assume all of what would otherwise be property taxes in the formula will continue to demand more of the state budget every year and how school budgets will be affected. Recent research on how Agriculture assessments are currently undervalued and how there may be some errors with the application of State Law on assessments will also be highlighted.
Margaret will share her insights about the challenges of investing in and appropriately compensating school leaders when many voices critical of education champion reduced administration and investments directly into classrooms. This session includes data and research about the valuable role of administrators to student learning, and the heavy workload of Iowa school administrators compared to other states’ educational system and the private sector. Leave with talking points and information that local leaders can use to explain the importance of administrative leaders, whether with the school board, with local constituents or with state-level policymakers.

(Repeat session)
Margaret will share information about the continued legislative effort to build local control. The 2018 legislative session passed new bills which drastically expand school district expenditure flexibility and local authority. This builds on the efforts of 2017, (Categorical Flexibility, Super Flex Fund, and Home Rule). Margaret will explain the new opportunities, provide new information about last year’s efforts, share resolution templates and other resources needed to take advantage of the new flexibilities, explain the requirements which must be met before accessing flexibility, warn of some pitfalls to avoid, and answer questions.
Student Lunch Shaming Legislation Including Debt Collections - Ann Feilman (Chief, Bureau of Nutrition and Health Services, Department of Education)
Ann Feilmann will help attendees learn about legislation preventing district actions that identify students who owe lunch money, requirements of state and federal law regarding student fees and school lunch processes, and new options for collecting unpaid lunch debt owed to your district.
Jon will share an update on the state of solar energy with respect to Iowa schools. A number of changes in state law have made it easier for some districts to finance projects, but these opportunities are not right for every district, depending on the district’s capital structure as well as the type of utility that services the district. Jon will explain the primary factors your district needs to consider with respect to the economics of solar projects, as well as how to structure RFPs and financing to maximize benefit to each district’s particular circumstance.
Tim Oswald will share their philosophy of debt management policy development, including strategies to ensure district financial flexibility without over-regulating district financial choices. Tim will discuss sample language from real policy examples that will help local leaders comply with financial regulatory requirements while preserving options for the most advantageous future financing of bonds and other debts.
Margaret will explain the details of proposed state penny extension legislation HF 2481, that was approved by 95 Representatives but did not receive floor debate in the Iowa Senate in the 2018 session. Margaret will share successful strategies for continued advocacy, helping district leaders take the next steps to collaborate with other entities that care about this legislation moving forward. Leave with talking points and resources for local leaders to connect with candidates before the November 2018 election so they will arrive at the statehouse in the 2019 Session supportive of the proposal.
Dr. Tom Lane will share ideas that surfaced during the 2017 Legislative Session about AEA restructuring, AEA services, AEA investment, dispel some myths about AEAs, and discuss where the AEAs are headed now, with priorities of continuing to support school districts in providing special education services to students, in generating new mental health options and services, and working with school districts to effectively share and provide cooperative services that will help overburdened school leaders work efficiently and effectively for students.
With the new iPad just released, I expect that we will have some first-time iPad users stopping by looking for help with their new devices. Also, some of you who may be upgrading from an iPad 2 or 3, or an original iPad Mini may find some of the tablet features in the latest version of iOS unfamiliar. With more new iPads likely still on the way, this is a good time to get back to some basics and brush up on some of the handy features of the current iPad lineup and iOS 10. As such, I will be posting a new Tips and Tricks article each week for a bit. For this first installment, I want to take a look at an unsung feature that came to us in iOS 9.

Whether it’s on the field, indoors, or on the track, injuries are an unfortunate commonality in the world of sports. Sometimes, these injuries can be a relatively minor scrape or bruise, but, for those who don’t protect themselves correctly, sometimes, serious accidents may occur. A prime example of one of these serious accidents is a concussion. A concussion, which is a temporary unconsciousness or dizziness caused by a blow to the head, can occur in sports and are much more serious than many might imagine.
Neurologists all over the world have observed that concussions do not only result in temporary headaches, but also can result in traumatic after effects to the brain. According to the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine, “Chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI) represents the cumulative, long-term neurological consequences such as memory loss and cognitive deficits due to repetitive concussive and subconcussive blows to the brain.“
National Public Radio recently stated that, “Nearly all former NFL players examined in a recent study showed signs of brain damage. In recent years, football has gotten scrutiny for the long-term damage it can do to players’ bodies. The game has been linked to CTE, a disease believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head that can lead to symptoms like memory loss, depression, and confusion. It can only be diagnosed after a player dies, when docs can get a look at the brain. In this recent study, doctors checked out more than 100 brains of now-deceased NFL players and found that all except one had CTE. They also found it in people who only played football in high school or college.”
Understandably, much of the early concussion risk studies focused on professional football, a game that involves fast, full contact between players. However, current research has expanded to incorporate any type of sport involving physical contact such as soccer, hockey and lacrosse.
Heritage focuses heavily on preventing concussions, especially in physical contact sports such as football. The New York Times writes, “Teaching players how to protect themselves from direct hits are essential to their safety.”
“[The school] has great quality helmets that are up to date on checks, and they teach us not to hit with our heads,” senior John Fris said. “The blocking techniques we use do not involve hitting with our heads.”
Not only are students trained to protect themselves, but coaches and staff are also always taught how to treat students with concussions.
“All of our coaches are required to take courses on concussions, as well as pull us from practice or games if they suspect we have any pain or impairment while playing due to a head injury,” senior Zack Zambrano said.
Heritage provides readily available trained coaches and nurses, and also introduces courses in which players are made aware of the dangers of concussions. With all of the resources given to our players, concussions are much easier to prevent and treat. Although concussions are still considered frightening to the public, many players, especially football players, don’t see them as a common issue. Even armed with the knowledge of the dangers concussions pose, many sports players, especially football players, are undeterred from pursuing their passion.
“From the perspective of a football player, concussions are simply the price you pay to play the game you love,” junior Paul Yermish said. Nevertheless, all players are aware of concussions and their dangers. They do their best to avoid direct impact to the head if at all possible.

CIDR notation like this: 10.10.1.32 with a mask of 18 bits allows 14 bits (18 + 14 = 32) to be used for host addresses. This notation is important when defining rules for a security group in order to control the inbound traffic that's allowed to reach your instances.
In CIDR notation, an IP address is represented as A.B.C.D /n, where "/n" is called the IP prefix or network prefix. The IP prefix identifies the number of significant bits used to identify a network.
For example, 192.9.205.22 /18 means, the first 18 bits are used to represent the network and the remaining 14 bits are used to identify hosts. Common prefixes are 8, 16, 24, and 32.
A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of a subnet. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.
A network ACL is a numbered list of rules that we evaluate in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. We suggest that you start by creating rules with rule numbers that are multiples of 100, so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.
A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL; by default, it allows all inbound and outbound traffic.
Each subnet must be associated with a network ACL; if you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL. Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic.

Mayor Jimmy Davis and his team have been endorsed by the International Longshoreman’s Association (ILA) Local 1588 in the May 8th municipal election. Citing Mayor Davis’ record of moving the city forward, Local 1588 joins several other local unions in supporting Team Davis including the PBA, FMBA and IBEW.
“I would like to thank the hardworking men and women of Local 1588 for their support because it reaffirms our commitment to making sure that Bayonne’s future is brighter for everyone and that no one in our community is left behind,” said Mayor Davis.
ILA Local 1588 endorsed Davis four years ago, becoming one of the few local unions to support the challenger in the 2014 election.
“Many of our members live here in Bayonne and they are seeing the progress in our city every day with Mayor Davis and his team in city hall,” said Local 1588 President Virgil Maldonado. “From bringing in new development that’s revitalizing the city to investing in parks and recreation to creating a new sense of community, Bayonne is better today than it was four years ago and we need to keep moving the city forward with Mayor Davis.”

Great Britain's senior women secured a magnificent win over Israel to start off their FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2019 qualifying campaign
There must be something in the Manchester air that inspires Great Britain's senior women, after a stunning overtime win over Israel to get their FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2019 qualifying competition.
They held onto win one of the most thrilling international games seen in this country for many a year, by 90 points to 87, in front of a raucous crowd at the National Basketball Performance Centre.
With Greece only edging past Portugal (66-60) prior to tip-off, the stakes were high for both teams. GB started as expected with Stef Collins, Jo Leedham-Warner, Rachael Vanderwal, Temi Fagbenle and Azania Stewart.
Britain edged the first quarter which was already proving to be closely fought. The lead changed hands eight times with Leedham-Warner a presence at this early stage, to leave GB 21-17 up. Handily, Head Coach Chema Buceta's scoring options were numerous with seven of the nine players called on during the opener producing points.
But Israel appeared to settle in the second quarter, forcing GB into mistakes. A 14-2 run encouraged the vociferous Israel support behind the bench and they would lead 36-30 at the interval despite the absence of their talisman Shay Doron. Leedham-Warner had 6 points and seven rebounds, with Georgia Jones - on the occasion of her 50th appearance - with 6 points as well.
Leedham-Warner was again at the forefront of Great Britain's persistence in the third quarter and the home team lifted the crowd with a proper response.
With greater ball movement and energised outside defence, they seemed to rattle the visitors in a physical game which oddly produced very few fouls called. Jones, Leedham-Warner and Fagbenle were strong in a period where GB scored 26 points to lead 56-51.
With 2.12 remaining, Fagbenle was super-strong to layup for a four point lead while Chantelle Handy - whose three-point shooting was proving prominent - levelled at 74 with 39.4 seconds left.
Zairy's huge 3 looked to have given Israel a vital lead with just 8.1 on the board but back came Handy to post up another clutch three to tie again at 77. Overtime was just and no-one wanted to go home anyway at that point.
With 1:31 left in overtime, Jones landed both from the line to let GB lead by one, but the decisive moment came with 35 seconds remaining.
A fast break from Vanderwal was only halted with an unsportsmanlike foul and while the officials took their time to be sure, GB landed both from the line, retained possession. Leedham-Warner followed up and Great Britain would not be denied a hugely impressive comeback.
Leedham-Warner finished with 22 points and thirteen rebounds, Fagbenle 19 points/ eight rebounds, Jones 14 points and Handy 13 with three vital three-point plays.
GB captain Stef Collins spoke after the game, "Really really ecstatic about that win. We played our hearts out and it was great to have the crowd behind us today. We were able to hit some clutch shots down the stretch and showed some great GB spirit."
GB Coach, Jose "Chema" Buceta said Israel were terrific opposition. "They showed today that they are very strong and they have good shooters and they play good defence. We were able to play at that level today and finally win the game. We were six points down at halftime but the girls did a great job to overcome that situation."
British Basketball can confirm that the National Basketball Performance Centre in Manchester will host the final two FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2019 qualification games and the Great Britain Men's first game in round two of FIBA EuroBasket 2021 Pre-Qualifiers in November.
Great Britain finished off a summer of international action with a 52-49 overtime win over Switzerland at the FIBA U16 Women's European Championship in Podgorica.
Great Britain were edged out 58-66 by Ireland in the latest game at the FIBA U16 Women's European Championship in Podgorica.
Great Britain went down 28-42 to Estonia in the first of their classification games at the FIBA U16 Women's European Championship in Podgorica.

William "Bill" Meyer, age 74, of Grove City, passed away February 15, 2017 at Mt. Carmel Medical Center. He was born September 5, 1942 in Columbus, Ohio to the late Leonard and Emma Meyer. He retired from The State of Ohio Human Services Administration and was a life member of The OSU Alumni Association. He is survived by sisters, Mary Kennedy and Martha Scotillo; nephews, Brian and Matthew Kennedy. A graveside funeral will be held 10 a.m. Friday at Concord Cemetery (old section), with Pastor Donald Allman officiating.
They continued, “All 7 people involved have been sentenced with acts of violence and legal violations but they are not slapped with a restraining order and are thus not going to prison. As for Kangin, we acknowledge the fact that Kangin tried to keep himself away from the fight. He tried many times to ignore the one person that kept following him and using violence against him. We will count Kangin’s acts of violence as self defense.”
The police concluded that the fight involved Kangin, two men who escaped the fight, one person who was with Kangin, and three extra people.
Kangin had denied the charges made against him 5 days ago and now the truth is finally out. The police have decided Kangin did try to stay out of it which makes it self defense but he must go to court for a further and more detailed decision about his punishment because he is charged with an act of violence violation.

E: I’m worried. 8 members of SJ are looking at me that I feel faint. I’m a woman too. I wonder if the interview will go well today.
E: You’re sitting in the middle of the table, because you’re the team leader? You have the force of a boss. Are you quite strict with your members?
LT: Not at all. They’re actually strict with me. You saw when we were taking photos, what they were doing to me.
On May 12th, everybody attended the filming at Yeouido park had seen Kangin shed tears after the filming was finished. The last scenes of the drama were filmed from 11th’s dawn until 12th’s dawn.
Kangin said “Although every filming day was very hard and I feel that it has reached my limit but all the staffs and the director were really like a family and I appreciated it”.

Ashburn is located west of Washington, D.C., just beyond Sterling. The community is part of Northern Virginia’s well-developed tech corridor that stretches from Reston to Leesburg. Ashburn’s substantial growth has been bolstered by the presence of a range of telecommunications, IT and Internet service companies.
Before reaching its current state, Ashburn resembles many of the other communities found in Loudoun County. Farmland was in abundance and Ashburn was home to a number of large-acre estates. The community’s name is said to have been taken from Ashburn Farm. Today, Ashburn Farm is one of many subdivisions that can be found in Ashburn.
Ashburn is a medium-sized community with a large number of recently built townhomes and single-family residences. The car is king in Ashburn although that may change with the arrival of the planned Silver Line metro in 2016.
Proximity to Dulles International Airport is a luxury many in Northern Virginia are not afforded.

Lori Putnam is recognized for her expressive brushwork, contemporary compositions, and intelligent use of color. The Nashville, Tennessee, native paints small to medium-sized works en plein air and creates large paintings in her studio.
Lori grew up in the Tennessee countryside. With no neighbors for miles, she credits her love of the outdoors and creative spirit to those many hours spent exploring and entertaining herself as a young child. Her high school art classes became one of the first places she recognized an internal spark for drawing and painting. However, her development as an artist was not realized until much later in life, once her own children were in high school themselves. At age 35 she took up oil painting for the first time. The feel of the paint immediately ignited her love affair with the medium and she knew there was no turning back.
Prior to becoming a full-time, fine artist in 2005, Lori owned and managed a graphic design company for 13 years. In 2008 and 2009, she and her Mark husband sold their home and belongings and traveled to the Italian countryside to live for more than seven months with the sole purpose of the painter's self-study and artistic experimentation. A catalyst for Lori's artistic growth, the concentrated work accomplished during that period culminated in an impressive breakthrough. Advice and support from artist friends Scott Christensen, Quang Ho, and Dawn Whitelaw, have further impacted the artist's development and success.
No stranger to hard work and dedication her work and career soared at an astounding rate, and collectors and publications have taken note. Featured in numerous issues of American Art Collector Magazine, Plein Air Magazine, Southwest Art, Fine Art Connoisseur, and Art of the West, Putnam is recognized as one of the finest American Impressionists of our time. As an Artist Faculty Demonstrator for the Annual Plein Air Convention, she shares her philosophy and painting methods with its 700 attendees annually. Her sold-out workshops are a testament to her gratitude to those who taught and nurtured her.
Lori is a member of, and has exhibited with many respected organizations including the Salmagundi Club in New York City, the Oil Painters of America, Laguna Plein air Painters Association, the California Art Club, Plein Air Artists of Colorado, and is past Vice President of the American Impressionists Society. Additionally, Lori participates annually in several invitational plein air events, winning awards in Colorado, California, Wyoming, Florida, Georgia, Maui, and Ireland. Her studio work has also received many awards — most notably from the Salmagundi Club in New York City, the Portrait Society of America, The American Impressionist's Society, and the Oil Painters of America. Latest honors for first place were given to her paintings "Up She Rises" in the All Along the Sierra Exhibition in Crockett, California, and "A Bird's Eye View" in the 2016 Forgotten Coast Plein air Invitational.
Museums including The Tucson Museum of Art and The Brinton Museum in Big Horn, Wyoming have sought out Putnam's works for exhibition. The High Museum in Atlanta, Georgia and the Irvine Museum in California have honored her paintings with significant prizes. Her work has been included in the Out West Art Show and Sale in Great Falls, Montana and the Heart of the West Auction in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. She has work in the permanent collection at The Academy Art Museum in Easton, Maryland, the Jack Warner Collection, The Strotkamp Collection, the collection of Plein Air Magazine, and in private and corporate collections, and galleries worldwide. Putnam keeps a studio in Charlotte, Tennessee. Visit the artist's website.
The wind chills your bones. You walked four unnecessary blocks, lost when you finally reach Ilene Kristen's West Side New York apartment, her blond head poked out the door is a welcome sight.
While you defrost, she offers you fruit juice, and a bowl of fresh fruit. She isn't at all what you epxected. You're used to seeing her as Delia (Dee) Ryan on Ryan's Hope. You remember the manic verve she displays as that troubled, erratic personality. You aren't prepared for someone as together, so articulate, so sane.
Its colors are warm and bright, suggesting a girlish exuberance - the happy side of Dee, so often betrayed by the "sick" side of her.
Then Ilene says something surprising. Despite all the condemnation heaped on Dee by irate fans, Ilene prefers to think that this portrait represents the real Delia. And she defends her against her detractors.
Her petite, 5'2" frame sunk back in an enormous, high-backed armchair, she speaks with authority, and some passion, about
"I don't condome some of the things she does," she begins, "but you have to understand where she came from. She grew up
without parents, without security or guidance. Her father was locked away in a mental institution, her mother was never around. There's a lot of love locked up inside her, she just doesn't know the right way to let it out.
"Do I think she's insensitive to others? She might be, but no one has more contempt for herself than Delia. She doesn't like what she does. But isn't everyone guilty to a certain extent? The people around her are not very helpful. They're so self-indulgent in their own ways, it's unbelievable!"
But if Ilene takes the side of the "sick" Delia, she's also happy to see the humorous side. "I think the scenes where she decorated her apartment was marvelous," she laughs. "Did you see what she did to the furniture? Turned all the chairs toward the wall."
She is proud of the fact that her character has more than one dimension. "If I had a friend like her, I'd never be bored!"
Her first floor, brownstone apartment reflects Ilene's all-consuming interest in the arts. Besides her "Delia" painting, there are several other original works. The dominate colors are tans and beiges, offsetting darker wood surfaces and the polished parquet floors.
The high-ceiling living room has a real wood-burning fireplace. Shelves in two corners, opposite one another, display her collection of beautiful, turn-of-the-century objets d'art. And in the bedroom, on the wall, are sequined handbags from New York's Flapper Era, given to Ilene by her grandma.
There's an impish sense of humor behind all this exquisite tastefulness, however. Ilene's favorite piece is a marvelous hat rack, carved and painted in the likeness of Popeye the Sailor, tatoos and all!
The whole impression is both an active body and mind, seeking the unusual in antique shops and flea markets.
"I'm a doer," Ilene agrees. "I get involved in so many different things, my life gets extremely complicated."
A recent involvement, at once painful and joyful, was with her Jean Renoir theater, which she co-founded with Ray Blanco. "I know how hard it is for people to get a break in the arts. So much red tape, I thought I could give beginners a showcase, where we could put on films and also plays and poetry readings."
Ilene still has rueful memories of landlord trouble and other problems that forced the closing. "I'm not a businesswoman. Sure, we wanted to make a profit, but whatever money was made we planned to plow back into the theater....I just can't deal with people who aren't human beings..." She hopes next time, things will be easier.
"I am incredibly patient in bad situations. But when someone is trying to take advantage of me and not treating me with respect, I blow up!"
Once, she got so angry she kicked a phone plug out of its socket. But that is rare behavior. Basically, she's a pushover.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, she took a liking to "Latin and Jazz rhythms" early in life. By the time she was eight, she was taking ballet lessons and dreaming of becoming like her idol, dancer Bambi Lyn. Her first professional work was in the Broadway hit, Henry Sweet Henry, at age 15. Her father insisted she get a higher education but Ilene lasted only one year at Finch College, studying drama. Real life was going to be her school, and the only delay came when she became deathly ill at 18.
The illness kept her in the hospital for a long time and involved her thryoid. "I had been perfectly healthy up to then," Ilene remembers, "and I've been fine ever since."
She did satirical skits with a group called Six New Happenings, worked in the produciton of off-Broadway's Lenny, and helped design sets for Jesus Christ Superstar. She also studied guitar and piano at the New School, and won a role in the 1971 film, Preacherman.
Her big break was when she was selected to play Patty, the central character in New York's longest running show, Grease. Althought Ilene calls herself "mild-mannered" and has a cheerful, upbeat outlook on life, she found the role of the goody two-shoes Patty difficult to relate to. "It was hard work, trying to understand Patty" she recalls. She perservered however, and stayed with Grease for two and a half years.
Althought her parents live in Florida now, Ilene keeps in close contact with them, either through phone conversatins, or an occasional holiday visit. She has an affectionate nickname for her younger sister, "Me too." Because Ilene was the elder, her sis would follow her around on her advantures, saying, "Me too, me too."
One thing her childhood experiences taught her was a joy of lifel Her sense of fantasy was enhanced by frequent visits to the Japanese Botanical Garden in Brooklyn, and she created puppet shows for the amusement of her sister and their friends.
In talking about her childhood, and the influence her parents had on her life it becomes clear why Ilene's attitude toward Delia is one of compassion and understanding.
"It was an unspoken rule in my home that you never said anything about someone you wouldn't want said about yourself." Ilene tries to live by that rule. But if this makes her sound like a forbearing saint, Ilene recognizes there are times you must put your foot down too.
A Leo, born on a July 30, she's trying now to be more assertive in her dealings with others. "Sometimes I've found it hard to say no. When someone wanted me to do something I didn't want to do, I used to go along with it, just to avoid a hassle. Now I'm learning to be assertive. If you aren't, you wind up feeling miserable, and you have no one to blame but yourself."
Although her thyroid condition persists, and she has to keep her weight down, she finds this easy to do. Her natural vitality and small appetite help her plus an occasional swim or simple exercise.
She's happy that she's completed her first directing effort -- a twenty minute film, After the War, for New York University Film School. And she is optimistic about opening a new theater complex, perhaps with a subsidizing federal grant.

The county was created in 1975 by joining the former counties of Iserlohn and Lüdenscheid, and the [until then] county-free city of Iserlohn. Lüdenscheid county was named Altena county before 1969 when the (formerly county-free) city of Lüdenscheid was integrated into it.
The name of the Märkischer Kreis county refers to the former County of Mark (in the medieval sense) or Grafschaft Mark which included the area south of, but not including, Dortmund. A map of this medieval county can be seen in this map of German Territories in 1789 at the Baden-Württemberg mailing list website [v-shaped, light blue, labelled 'Gft. Mark', east of the Netherlands and just south of the Bishopric of Münster]. The name is not quite appropriate since the modern county includes only the southeastern part of the former Grafschaft Mark, and because some parts of it belonged to other territories (Duchy of Westphalia, belonging to the Archbishopric of Cologne, and the County of Limburg). All of these territories were part of the Prussian province of Westphalia after 1815, but their symbols still occur in the municipal arms (and hence the flags):
County of Limburg: on a silver field a red lion armed and crowned blue [blazon: Argent, a lion Gules, armed and crowned Azure].
While cities traditionally had the right to bear arms, municipalities in Prussia were not entitled to them until 1933. In the years thereafter, many municipalities in Prussia and all municipalities in the area of the Märkischer Kreis county adopted arms. A number of the newly adopted or changed arms of this time owed their symbolism to Nazi ideology. Therefore, after 1945, all civic arms in Germany were taken under scrutiny, and swastikas and other deprecated symbols had to be removed. However, none of the arms in the Märkischer Kreis county were required to change.
The modern county uses a flag that is prescribed in the Hauptsatzung (statutes) of the county which are available online. The flag-relevant part reads:
Here at Family Chiropractic Clinic, we are proud to offer our patients specials! We change these specials regularly, so make sure that you check the expiration date prior to redeeming your great deal!

Anti-fracking protests outside Third Energy’s fracking site at Kirby Misperton, 30 November 2017. Photo: Colin Gong
Anti-fracking campaigners in North Yorkshire have vowed to continue to resist plans to frack at Kirby Misperton, despite what looks like a delay following the discovery of a legal loophole.
Yesterday, DrillOrDrop reported on a written ministerial statement revising the law on fracking consent.
Under the Infrastructure Act, companies are required to get final consent from the Secretary of State for Energy before starting to frack. But it has emerged that the act covered only wells drilled from April 2015.
Third Energy’s application, currently with the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), is to frack the KM8 well at Kirby Misperton, drilled in 2013. Technically, the company did not need ministerial consent.
The loophole was closed with a directive laid before parliament. But as a result of the loophole, BEIS suggested the approval of Third Energy’s fracking plans had been delayed and was not imminent.
“Third Energy has followed the regulatory regime for associated hydraulic fracturing as required by the Infrastructure Act of 2015. We are very conscious of the obligations under this regime and have done everything that is required by regulations.”
“We have all the required approvals from the regulators for associated hydraulic fracturing and we await the Secretary of State’s consent.”
“It looks like this legal loophole will delay the frack for a few weeks which is very welcome over the Christmas period and means that local people can sleep peacefully over the holidays.
“However this is just a stay of execution – we will continue to fight the industry which is unwelcome and unwanted in Ryedale. The anti-fracking lobby continues to grow locally and nationally and we will not give up the fight until this short-sighted Tory government sees sense and withdraws it support for this dirty industry.”
“In a week when it comes to light that Third Energy has already breached environmental regulations before it has even started fracking at KM8, it now appears that the Government has also not adhered to its own legislation and has been forced to scramble about to alter it to fit its obsession with driving the fracking industry, despite widespread and growing public opposition.
“In this few weeks respite I would urge more people to write to Greg Clarke MP and ask him not to give the final go ahead for fracking in Ryedale. The government is treating people like guinea pigs by inflicting an industry on us that has so many health and environmental risks associated with it, instead of pursuing clean, sustainable energy sources.
“We are not prepared to stand back and let them industrialise our county and ride rough shod over local democracy in this way.”
We salute you for all you are doing to try to stop this industry!! Noted that the London Mayor Is not keen to have fracking in London, as the process can generate toxic silica dust, which can cause chronic lung damage and pollutants which can worsen neurological problems, according to a BBC report!!
Is that Richard Harrington hanging from the gate? Doesn’t look happy! He probably doesn’t know where he is?
Any donation, however small, will help us continue to report independently on fracking, onshore oil and gas and the reactions to it.
There is news today, but since everything is crazy, let’s step back, take a drink, and look at January 2017.

There are many ways that can help you to share information from your CD with other people. You can simply share it with the help of internet connection or you can find some CD duplication service. The second option is considered to be preferable by many people as it allows sharing the information in a traditional way, by providing people not only with the content but with a data storage device represented by CD-R or DVD-R as well. Furthermore, it provides the unlimited access to the content, so the owner of a CD can use it whenever it is needed. The only thing to remember when it comes to choosing CD duplication service is that the company you choose needs to have a stellar reputation for quality work, fast service, and good value for any budget.

They were the gods of the beasts, but grew decadent and cunning with the passing of time. They fell, finally and irreversibly, when they gave themselves names and rose to walk on two legs. Now, they are rejected by the wild and spurned by civilization. They have retreated to San Serafín where they wage a glacial and mostly invisible war on the dead.
The greatest of their number is Madama Yaguar, the first beast to hunt and the first being to kill. She is sick now, and will teach the secrets of her illness to the strong
The forms of the devils are confused, they are furred and scaled and feathered and fanged. They hide their shapes in ragged finery and ivory masks and golden wire armatures.
If defeated or entreated, the may agree to form a pact with an adventurer. To do so, the signatory character must sacrifice 15% of the XP needed to reach the next level. They learn the devil's true name, and can summon it at any time with 1 turn of effort.
Once summoned, a devil makes a reaction roll. If it doesn't try to eat everybody, the signatory can ask it for a favor. It might demand a service, a soul, or a burnt offering, depending on its Reaction.
Wealth Devil: Will sell you anything on the standard equipment list for 10 times the original price.
Weather Devil: Will change the weather to anything you wish for one day, as long as it is appropriate for the local climate (so no snowstorms in deserts)
Weapon Devil: Will sell you any standard weapon for 10 times the original price. +1 to damage and +1 to hit for 24 hours.
Desire Devil: has power over a single random MU spell with a spell level of 1d4. It can grant the ability to cast it once to a single person. It can grant the ability to cast more spells by eating scrolls.
Warfare Devil: will fight for you until it fails a Morale/Loyalty check. Loyalty/Morale is 2+signatory's level. Warfare devils do not fear being outnumbered.
Beauty Devil: Will change the Morale of all hirelings to 11 for a day, but failure means they have become enamored with the beauty devil and will henceforth follow its wishes in all things.
Ascended Devil: Will grant three Wishes. They can be made one at a time or all at once, with any amount of time between them. Once it has granted them all, the pact terminates and it will try to kill you.
Blood Devil: Will make a creature at 0 or fewer HP immune to damage for a day or until they reach 1 or more HP.
Knowledge Devil: Has a 4 in 6 chance of truthfully and correctly answering any yes or no question asked of it.
Truth Devil: Will enforce any oath made in its presence. Should any party break the oath, the Truth Devil will do all in its power to kill them.
When in a pact, devils add half their signatory's level to their HD. They can cast spells as a MU with half as many levels as they have HD. The appearance of all devils is similar, but they have stats as one of the following creatures.

Cadillac president Johan de Nysschen knows very well it could take years before the brand begins to truly turnaround and post sales numbers on par with other luxury automakers. Most people don’t like change, but that’s exactly what his job is all about, even if it’s not going to result in strong short-term results.
A recent USA Today article discussing Cadillac’s sales, which were down 5.9 percent in the first 11 months of 2014, pinned the brand’s poor market performance on the higher prices of its cars. The vehicles are better than ever, but the prices also reflect this, which has driven former Cadillac customers away.
“You’re putting the brand at a different price point than the traditional Cadillac customers are used to,” de Nysschen told USA Today. The former Audi exec admits their target buyers, the one’s who currently buy BMWs and Audis, “can afford it (the price), but don’t have it on their priority lists.”
Cadillac’s marketing chief, Uwe Ellinghaus, calls this a “relevancy problem.” Cadillac has a good name and reputation, however most consumers with the money to buy a luxury car simply don’t consider the brand when shopping around. So they’ve driven away former customers with raised prices, and those who can afford the cars don’t know about them.
“They increased the price and had high (sales) volume expectations. You can’t do that unless you’re a brand with the right reputation,” explained Michelle Krebs, an AutoTrader.com senior industry analyst.
But de Nysschen has more than a few tricks up his sleeve which he believes will result in a boost for Cadillac. Between the relocation of about 100 employees to the trendy SoHo neighbourhood in Manhattan, the introduction of the CT6 and several other crucial products and reporting its earnings separately, he just might earn it the spot at the cool kids table it needs in order to move more metal.
I believe that Cadillac’s prices are ridiculous and that this new guy raising prices is to blame. I bet if Cadillac lowered prices they could be selling more cars and making lots of money.
Luxury is not affordable by nature and it doesn’t need to be. This isn’t Chevy or Buick. This is Cadillac. Current prices are competitive and actually lower when you start adding comparable options as on the Caddies to the German rivals. If anything, Cadillac needs to get better on leasing rates and residual rates for leasing.
The bigger problem is that Cadillac as a brand doesn’t yet have the same image as BMW, Benz or Audi or Lexus. The way to earn that image isn’t by lowering prices. It’s by years and years of product substance, great marketing, and uncompromising customer experience. Do all that, and the current prices are fine. But until the brand’s image changes in the mind of the general public, sales will be stifled. This will be the case no matter how great the product is. But good product, marketing, and customer experience is the way to get there.
All I’m saying is I don’t like the prices and I remember them trying to say we want to attract younger customers. I know some Cadillac’s are priced fairly but they cant get younger people to buy unless they some how manage to get rich.
You’d think so. But if the ATP is kept high, GM makes more money per unit sold. It’s the old “Quantity versus Quality” mantra. The hardest part for GM is getting the public to accept Cadillac and it’s higher ATP for what Cadillac offers. The product is better than Cadillac has ever built, but the public will take decades to give a damn and welcome Cadillac back into their lives.
When that’s done, they can ramp up volume PROVIDED GM can sell every Cadillac they build; there shouldn’t be an end of year incentive sales to push last year model off the lots.
That, and a low sticker price doesn’t look good on a Cadillac and wouldn’t attract the kinds of buyers that usually buy luxury products. If it’s suppose to be the best GM builds, why price it like it was Chevrolet?
An other thing I would like to mention is that look at the ElR and how it did. They priced it to high and no one really wanted to buy it because of price, they overstocked and lost money, Now some vehicles are priced accordingly in Cadillac’s line up but not all. I don’t mean lower the prices to where you cant make a profit just make them a little bit more affordable, like a decrease just of a few thousand dollars.
When your cars cost more than they used to, of course sales are going to dip, it’s common sense! What Cadillac needs right now is a strong ad agency to educate the target consumer about the brand and its excellent products, minor adjustments with every model year, diesels (lots of them), crossovers (a lot of them), shed all those dealers who carry the name but don’t sell that many cars or offer less than stellar customer service so that the ones actually working get the funds they need to attract more customers, and last but not least, continue to improve with future generations. For example: why stop at being 100 lbs lighter than the closest competitor, why not 120lbs lighter? Why stop at being 0.1 seconds faster, why not 0.2? The 2.0T is going to be purchased by the majority of ATS buyers, continue to refine it, the V6 should be replaced by something with lower displacement, more hp, and more torque. Manual transmission: can someone explain to me why Cadillac offers the ATS 2.0T as the only vehicle equipped with a manual? I understand they don’t sell in high volume as the automatics, but BMW offers plenty of manuals, why can’t Cadillac? The 8-speed meets to be in every single car now, not the clunky 6-speed.
First off you need to look at the numbers not the percentages. With the ATS it was it was hundreds different not thousands.
It is misleading like Chrysler sales as while they are up 20% the raw numbers are still pretty much smaller than most other companies. So when they pick up 500-1000 sales it can be a major percentage.
Also Cadillac is a work in progress. It is like building a house and right now with the recent changes we are to the point they are just building the foundation. They are now putting more into their cars than in the past and that cost money.
Also they are moving from the low end luxury buyer to the ones with real money. This means they are giving up the easy cheap buyer sale but have yet to earn the trust of the real player in the real luxury market.
Why is GM doing this? Well first off we have Buick and they need room in the middle to grow. But the real reason is if they can fix Cadillac they can be more profitable than even the Pick Up trucks. The luxury market is one of the most profitable segments in the industry. You do not have to sell as many cars but you can make so much more per unit sold. This will be important as it gets harder and harder to sell large trucks.
If you look to Ford many wanted to Axe Lincoln but what saved them. The folks who pointed out that they make money and can make more money if they fix them. The issue at Ford is unlike GM they have not fully gone all in to fix them and that is what it will take but until those in Ford win the argument for Lincoln they will continue to struggle.
While many are getting mad they can no longer be a Cadillac man that proves to be one of the points of todays segement that Cadillac has lost. Years ago not just anyone could own a Cadillac. You had to have the means to buy and not be a pretender. But Cadillac became Walmart Luxury and that is an image killer. Generally if you own a Benz or BMW in this country you have the means or a very large lease payment but the fact is not everyone can afford a new one and that sets these folks apart.
Going back to a cheap Cadillac will only damage the efforts to establish a new image and it will also hurt the content of the cars as you will not get the cut and sewn interiors. You would not get a TT V6 etc. You would have basically a XTS and that is not what they need if they want to be taken seriously
Scott, i have discussed this with you before but in your opinion how much of all these changes are Barra? What do you think Chairman Tim Solso and the Board has to do with this? And do you think we will see Cadillac advertised as Cadillac Motor Company without any mention of GM in a few years?
Another point to mention, when Cadillac does well, so does the rest of GM. For example, Cadillac is getting the right to build its own engine family built to its standards and able to better compete with the Germans. What does that have to do with GM? Hand-me-down innovation is how it all connects. Cadillac will get the money that Chevrolet/Buick/GMC would never receive funding to tech they can’t introduce in their own vehicles. Then, after a year or two, they’ll be passed down to the rest of GM’s divisions, similar to how VW does business now that Porsche is the biggest money maker under their umbrella.
I am glad that Cadillac is taking their brand seriously and pricing their cars accordingly. The way their cars are price is an indicator of who can afford a Cadillac and who can not. If anyone have a problem with Cadillacs current pricing, it is a good indication that you can’t afford them.
If you want a new Cadillac, go back to school to learn a new trade, open up a business or whatever that will make you wealthy.
I love my cadillac. In fact, I like it more than the BMW. However, we are in the market for a replacement, and I don’t think I even have plans to even test drive a cadillac. When I bought the CTS, it was bigger than the 3 series, but smaller than the 5 series- a perfect compromise. It was also priced much less than the 5 series, and looked great.
The problem though, is its NOT a BMW. So when its priced the same as a BMW, why would I buy a Cadillac if I can buy a BMW? Dismall comparative resale, and frankly when I pull into a sales meeting, are they more impressed by a Cadillac or a BMW? Cadillac is a “luxury” brand, but so is Acura and Lincoln, and I don’t put Acura or Lincoln on par with BMW either.
And frankly I’m not a big BMW fan either, but for the same price, I can get an imported german luxury, or a high end GM car? thats kind of the catch 22 in all of this. I bought the CTS because it was a heck of a value proposition. However, when it comes down to it, would I pay more for the BMW name than cadillac? without a doubt. Cadillac is trying to go head to head with BMW in all ways, Size, performance, and price. So even if the performance wins by a hair, the size is the same, and the price is the same, I’m going to go with the preferred brand, BMW.
This does make me sad because I really love my CTS. So much so that I’m probably going to hold onto it for another year or two. I love it, but it doesn’t carry the same prestige as the BMW nameplate, especially now that they nolonger have any niches, they are just an alternative- the offbrand alternative.
Last but not least, how long to Cadillac owners hold onto their vehicle for over 5 yrs vs. the others?
I’m really interested in the ELR. So much so that I purchased the entire, four volume set of service manuals. My interest is not as a daily driver, but building a racing platform. To appreciate what these guy’s (engineers, designers…) have done, you need to look at these manuals. Having degrees in mechanical, electrical, and computer science, I understand the engineers’ excitement, appeal, and ease of adding more bells and whistles – it’s fun and very cool. But after reading some of the diagnostic codes and looking at what is being checked and reported, it looks like the engineers were like the “kid in a candy store”.
While I have not looked at the “lower-end” MB, BMW…, attracting younger clients to performance sedans may be as simple making the cars less intelligent, letting (or forcing) the driver become more than just a passenger being shuttled around.
Cadillac has an image issue that will take a while to dispel – my grandmother always owned Cadillac land-yachts. They have the talent to design and build cars for the next generation. They may need to step on some Corvette toes. How about some Drifting? Or (hint, hint) an ELR competing in endurance racing? There’s a guy in Florida wanting to build a Pikes Peak ELR who is now looking at an endurance race at Road Atlanta, the 10-hour Petit Le Mans. Just an idea.
Cadillac sucks I bet if that gave Buick every thing cadillac has Buick would kill in sales its only thing keeping gm from going down right know. Buick has a better name then Cadillac right now it sales better in the two biggest markets gm has
Too bad Buicks ATP is far less than Cadillacs. That, and what does Buick have to offer as a halo that the V-series offers?
The brand went bankrupt less than 5 years ago and therefore isn’t a symbol of success or it is very tarnished. The solution is to build cars which are better than the competition at a 25% discount for up to 10 years. Build up the brand, fix the horrible dealership experience and then profits will come along with increased market share. That’s how the Japanese do it.
The current severely flawed strategy will only lead to a progressive state of panic in the short-term and then to an inevitable fire sale with further deterioration of the brand image.
There was a manual in the V-series CTS in 2011. I have yet to see a manual in the V-sport, but oh wouldn’t that be interesting. And with the ATS V-Sport on the way…. who knows.
I’m really glad I bought my 2014 CTS Coupe in the fall of 2013, mainly for the price difference. To get the same package in the new coupe would cost a LOT more. In fact, I wouldn’t pay that much. There were several cars in competition when I made my selection and the higher price of the Cadillac would now put that model out of competition.
That type of publicity about Cadillacs being over priced doesn,t do any good for the brand . Somehow Cadillac needs to tell the public what you are getting for the price . Just because you have a price point like they do does not mean quality . And in addition they are loosing their old clientelle . So they will go elsewhere . Lexus has been trying for years to compete in the luxury market actually building knock off look alikes back in the 1990’s . And their cars were actually better in quality than Mercedes . But now they have decided to stop trying and settle for the top # 4 spot in sales . Its just an example on how tough it will be for Cadillac . Sell fewer cars at a high price ( which makes them exclusive !? ) , or move more cars at a reasonable price . It isn’t a good sign when you have new products to sell and your sales plummet and you have to lay people off because of high inventory .
Cadilac’s old clientele (re: traditional buyers) were even more stingy and whiny about price than Gen Y’s are. The trads can be ignored, especially when their demands of luxury car are so limited, they can be summed up in 5 words: “big boulevard cruiser, no tech”.
That formulaic approach doesn’t work for Gen Y’s and Z’s, and most definitely doesn’t work with luxury consumers outside of 60+ North American demographic.
Here’s the deal. Only one of two factors will give Cadillac a reason to keep on building cars; Product or Price.
Price will give them an advantage in volume and the unit sales will look good at the end of the model year, but a lower price will destroy the luxury consumers perception of Cadillac as a worthy product to equal that of Mercedes or Lexus. Residuals will fall flat, and any excess inventory GM has will need incentives to move off the lot. Luxury consumers will take their money elsewhere, and Cadillac will have to settle for people who think they are luxury consumer, but haven’t the means to live like a luxury consumer.
Product will give them an advantage in appearance and public perception, but it needs to be upheld and managed consistently and carefully for many years without fail or compromise. Decades will past and there can’t be any screw-ups or change of heart after the course is set. Sales numbers will be low as the long slow climb to build the public’s trust will be hard fought, and the day that Cadillac can offer and sell a $250K car are far, far away. Whoever replaces de Nysschen has to see luxury as being a product driven industry, not a sales race, and this attitude and approach to product has to endure.
For me, product dictates what is a luxury and what is a common good. I apply the same measure for my whiskys as I would for a luxury car. I ignore the price as I know that what’s on offer is better than those that are ‘value driven’.

There's been a general sense of disappointment about the iPad, which I suspect is only natural given the enormous hype leading up to the announcement, as well as the fact that the applications shown were fairly conventional. Personally I don't think book reading is where the action is. For time-sensitive stuff like newspapers, and rich, complex documents such as scientific papers, sure, but physical books strike me as a piece of technology that we're not really going to improve on, rather like knives and forks.
But some grasp that this is magic. What I hope the iPad will do is finally move some visualisation tools into the main stream (as much as phylogenetics can be thought of as mainstream). The challenge of visualising large phylogenies has yielded some cool tools which, sadly, remained under-developed, such as TreeJuxtaposer, which seems clunky and counter-intuituve when using a mouse, but with a touch screen would just be awesome.
Tools such as Paloverde would also be more intuitive to use, as would the magnifier feature in Dendroscope. Imagine "pinch and zoom" in TreeJuxtaposer or Dendroscope, or for viewing large a sequence alignments.
There would be some work involved porting these tools to the iPad (e.g., porting code from Java to Objective C in the case of TreeJuxtaposer and Dendroscope), but the person who does this is going to have an impact on this field comparable to Maddison brothers when they released MacClade in 1986.

I was born in Murphysboro, Illinois and my family moved to Centralia, Illinois when I was two years-old. I grew up in Centralia. I gratuated from Centralia High School in 1970. I attended Union Univerisity in Jackson Tennessee and moved back to Illinois. I now reside in Centralia, Illinois. One of my mentors who encouraged me to write was Illinois editor, writer and storyteller Robert J. Hastings.
I am an ordained Southern Baptist minister. I have pastored churches in Illinois for thirty-four years. I have also written devotional article for newspapers during this time.
Ken Qualls Just Thinking Out Loud is a compilation of articles about various aspects of Christian thought and life. It takes a look at our foibles, follies and flaws and gently encourages us to remember that we are ambassadors of the kingdom of God. Sometimes humorous, sometimes serious the author stands firmly on the Word of God and understands the grave responsibility Christians have to rightly interpret it. He strongly believes that we owe it to the world to be equipped to give an intelligent, well-reasoned explanation for the faith we profess. This book inspires, admonishes, encourages and edifies. The reader will quickly sense the passion Qualls has for the Bible and his compassion and respect for both fellow believers and unbelievers. Ken Qualls is an ordained Southern Baptist bi-vocational pastor. While a junior in high school he answered the call to preach which was a surprise to his pastor and his wife, Ferdie and Margaret Shimpf, who thought that God would use Ken as a professional comedian. Ken attended Union University, Jackson, TN where he sang with an amateur gospel quartet known as Living Proof. His first article appeared in the July 8, 1981 Illinois Baptist as a guest editorial and for the next thirty years people throughout the Midwest have enjoyed reading Qualls insightful articles. He is now pastoring Blaze Chapel Baptist Church where he began his pastoral ministry many years ago. Through Reigning In Life Ministries he hopes to encourage small, struggling churches to be about the Father's business regardless of their size or circumstances.
CHICAGO, Ill. - Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) announced today that it has been voted into full membership by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III Membership Committee, beginning with the 2018-19 academic year. The result of a five-year process, membership allows access to NCAA championships, post-graduate education opportunities for student-athletes, conference and national student-athlete leadership development, seminars and workshops for athletic department personnel, and other benefits.
“We are thrilled that our athletes will have the opportunity to compete at the Division III level for the first time in school history this fall,” said Illinois Tech President Alan W. Cramb. “Division III athletics is an excellent complement to the world-class education our students receive.”
“This vote comes as a result of the hard work of many members of the Illinois Tech campus community,” said Director of Athletics Joe Hakes. “The process allows the institution to really explore the importance of intercollegiate athletics and the long-term benefits it can provide student-athletes in their personal and professional development.”
Division III is the largest division in the NCAA with more than 180,000 student-athletes competing from 450 institutions. Approximately 80 percent of Division III members are private institutions.
Illinois Tech is also joining the Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference (NACC) this fall. Conferences provide the pathway for regional and national ranking and access to championships. Formed in 2006, the conference consists of 13 members located in Illinois and Wisconsin. The NACC sponsors championships in 19 sports, including men’s baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and volleyball. Women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and volleyball.
This can be an outstanding, considerate, and thorough precis of the background of air strength. Prof. Buckley artfully and succinctly weaves the nationwide options, technological, and aeronautical features of the foremost air strength international locations (and their respective and sometimes competing air prone) right into a coherent tale of the development of air conflict from balloons to abandon typhoon, puncturing a few conventionally-accepted myths alongside the best way. this isn't a treatise on undefined, yet at the usually conflicting expectancies and features of air strength over 50 years of recent struggle.

Well this IS exclusive to the blog – for the next 3-4 hours anyway. I had a chat with CiW and their manager, Lloyd Meredith of peenko fame the other day in a very noisy room at Leith FM. You may notice some choice ambient sounds in the background from time to time, but it was a nice wee blether none the less. We would have melted if the window had been closed!
The guys provided a couple of tracks, as listed below and will be appearing at The Liquid Ship in Glasgow on Thursday 1st July – a free event, if you are up for the trip.
I’m hoping to have this chat broadcast on Leith Talk (Thursday 1st July edition), with Alan Dudley – so I better get those proverbial wheelie shoes on…
Included will be two live session tunes and some words of wisdom from their manager, Lloyd Meredith aka peenko – the music blogger’s music blogger.
Grande Dowager Diva Billie Ann Miller returned, after missing last year due to an unfortunate accident, to welcome all to the 13th Annual Imperial Court revue at the Ice Palace. This year's theme was "The Envelope Please" An Evening of Awards (a clever way to get performers onstage), as presenters and winners mixed and matched so that everyone got a chance to perform on Harold Seeley's lush Academy Award set. Regally seated onstage she turned the MC duties over to Rich Parisi and Demi Tasse
The first of the "winners" was Fantasia & Geful Tefish singing "You & Me" in close harmony, Tefish appropriate in a Victor/Victoria outfit combining trousers with drag.as they launched into a snappy softshoe routine.
Winner: Ariel as a demented doll turned evil little girl in her typically schizophrenic number "I Want It Now" (how does she find these songs?)
Winner: Bella commanded the stage in true veteran manner as she swirled and swooped her way through Pearl Bailey's "Dolly" number
Winner: Ann Tigue, a tall column in sequinned plaid, proving you can look cute and sexy, even at 7' singing "Almost Like Being In Love"
Billie Ann finally took the stage singing "I'm in the Mood for Love"...and there was lots of love to go around, thanking Isaac Vaughn and the Ice Palace for being one of the few places to always open its doors to AIDS fundraisers. The proceeds of this evening benefit The Cherry Grove Arts Project and the Imperial Court, a global charity organizaton.

Kawasaki is now returning in Pakistan with the new and latest bikes. Kawasaki bikes are now appearing in the Pakistan once again. We are providing some key bikes of the Kawasaki including 70cc, 100cc, 110cc, 125cc and 150cc.
Kawasaki GTO 70 is the latest bike of the Kawasaki. It has sleek design and new shape. Powerful engine and durable performance are the features of the new model Kawasaki GTO 70. It has the latest 4-stroke engine. The mudguards are in new shape and give the more protection.
Kawasaki always launched the quality bikes. Kawasaki motor cycles are famous in reliability, fuel economy, resale value, performance and good looking. Kawasaki GTO 110cc generates high horsepower with low fuel consumption and that’s why fuel consumption even on the tough roads is very good. It has tachometer with fuel gauge which indicates the remaining amount of the fuel which helps the riders to refill the fuel before the tank gets empty. Kawasaki GTO 110 gives the best experience to the rider.
Kawasaki GTO 125 is manufactured by the Kawasaki. . It is the development and addition of new cutting-edge technology that makes a motorbike or some other automobile take lead. 125cc shocks are in elastic shape and feel the sense of the comfortable traveling even on the tough roads. Its average is about 45 km/liter which is very good and it has smokeless engine which helps to protect the environment.
It is a four-cylinder in the street fighter or standard style. Kawasaki Z1000 comes with 4-stroke, liquid cooled, DOHC, four valves per cylinder, inline four engine. Its displacement is 1043cc. This design makes front suspension adjustments easier, even while you’re out on a ride. Steeples compression and rebound damping are adjusted on one fork leg, and spring preload is adjusted on the other. Rear suspension is handled by a horizontal back-link rear shock, which is adjustable for rebound damping and preload, and is located away from the possibly performance-degrading exhaust heat.
Married couples who come in for counseling tend to fall into two broad categories: the ones who come in primarily for relationship enhancement and to further enrich their marriage, and the ones who come in to try and resolve serious problems and issues that are disrupting or jeopardizing their relationship. Both types share a desire to stay married and to remove the obstacles that stand in the way to greater happiness.
In marriage enrichment or marriage repair, I utilize one of two frequently-updated online assessments with excellent reliability: the Prepare Enrich Assessment or the Gottman Relationship Checkup.
These assessment tools help identify and analyze each spouse’s attitudes and beliefs on an extensive range of topics, including communication patterns, conflict resolution skills, partner styles and habits, personality traits, and many more.
The assessment results, which I share with the couple, help establish a baseline for the following sessions in working through the deeper issues and the individual differences that need both partners' attention.
With married couples that have hit a plateau, or with those who are encountering serious difficulties while remaining committed to their relationship, I follow a specific counseling structure which is designed to: (1) help me help the couple stay on track, (2) identify the unique underlying reasons of their issues, and (3) ensure maximum achievable change.
If the relationship is dysfunctional, both spouses are contributing by action or by omission to co-creating this dysfunction.
Since the spouses are both the authors and main actors in their interplay, they can re-author the script and decide to play it differently.
Often a marriage needs to be refreshed by agreeing to a new set of rules, a new contract between the spouses which takes into consideration their changed circumstances and the changes that have taken place in each of them since they first got together.
Not all marriages can be saved, but the most serious of attempts should be made to clearly identify why it cannot.
When a marriage is worth saving, no stone should be left unturned in trying to identify and address the deeper causes of the dysfunction.
Relationship skills can be learned and refined at any age and by both spouses, if the will is there.
Problems in the marriage often have to do with external factors, but most of the times the external factors simply serve as a catalyst to reveal internal factors that exclusively concern the two spouses.
Lack of time, children, jobs, finances are problems that may not have easy or immediate solutions, however a stronger couple relationship can make these problems much easier to address or much lighter to bear.
Some dietary supplements may be helpful with symptoms of anxiety and depression that often accompany relationship problems, when used in conjunction with individual or couples therapy. Click here for more information about dietary supplements.

how did you verify that the 'new' ram module you got works? (not the aspire one, but the memory module)
[The flag of the Märkische Kreis is divided along the length of the flag into yellow, red, and yellow in proportions 1:3:1 and shows the arms of the county in the centre of the red field.]
Hostert 1979 also shows a banner of the same description. Flags and arms were adopted in 1976. The lion in the upper half corresponds to an older version of the arms of Mark.
The county Märkischer Kreis in Northrhine-Westphalia issued Hostert 1979, a book describing the symbols of the county and its 15 municipalities. With the assistance of Falko Schmidt, who kindly lent me the book, I drew the flags displayed in it, based on scanned images which were treated in the usual ways (changing palette, resizing, removing artifacts etc.) Therefore all Märkischer Kreis information I send is from Hostert 1979 with the exception of some additional material marked as such.
Aside from times of natural disasters and large-scale accidents, electricity prices tend to be steadily dictated by electricity demand. Typically, the price of electricity rises when demand rises. In turn, the lower demand is, the cheaper electricity rates become. This pattern is due to the fact that increased demand requires increased energy production. When extra energy is demanded, utilities are forced to use alternative sources of energy production that may cost more to operate. For example, when electricity demand reaches a high point in Texas, coal plants are used alongside the typical natural gas plants. These coal plants are costlier and less effective than natural gas plants, but are necessary to meet high electricity demand levels.[1]
There’s some smart money placing big bets on a rebound for oil. Blackstone Group LP BX, +0.75% President Hamilton “Tony” James said last month that the company was “scrambling” to invest up to $10 billion in energy companies, according to Bloomberg. Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman said during the company’s earnings call on Jan. 29 that the majority of Blackstone’s energy investments were “oil-price agnostic, including energy-transportation infrastructure where we have off-take agreements, merchant power, renewables and other types of energy-oriented investing.”
The simplest model for day ahead forecasting is to ask each generation source to bid on blocks of generation and choose the cheapest bids. If not enough bids are submitted, the price is increased. If too many bids are submitted the price can reach zero or become negative. The offer price includes the generation cost as well as the transmission cost, along with any profit. Power can be sold or purchased from adjoining power pools.[112][113][114]
A feed-in tariff (FIT) is an energy-supply policy that supports the development of renewable power generation. FITs give financial benefits to renewable power producers. In the United States, FIT policies guarantee that eligible renewable generators will have their electricity purchased by their utility.[2] The FIT contract contains a guaranteed period of time (usually 15–20 years) that payments in dollars per kilowatt hour ($/kWh) will be made for the full output of the system.
The two most common distinctions between customer classes are load size and usage profile. In many cases, time-of-use (TOU) and load factor are more significant factors than load size. Contribution to peak-load is an extremely important factor in determining customer rate class. Consumer loads may be characterized as peak, off-peak, baseload, and seasonal. Utilities rate each load differently, because each has different implications for a power system.
How does that work? Spark Energy buys electricity and competes in the market for the best price -- a competition that ultimately drives prices down and allows us to deliver more value for your money. In Texas, switching to a different electricity provider is kind of like changing to a different long distance company. When you switch to Spark Energy, the utility will continue to deliver electricity to your home but Spark Energy will handle all the billing, including the utility’s delivery fees and the electricity you actually use.
July 2018 data, the latest available, show that the average U.S. price – 13.12 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) – was down 0.7% compared with a year ago. If you live in Louisiana, you pay the lowest average residential electricity rates of any state in the country – 9.37 cents per kWh. The next lowest rate is in Washington, where residents pay an average of 9.79 cents per kWh.
Fixed-rate, long-term (contract) plans provide stability in electricity rates. If market energy costs suddenly trend upward where you live, you can rest assured that you won’t have to pay more out of pocket. However, if you want to switch to a different, lower-cost plan before the end of the contract term, you’ll likely have to pay a cancellation or early termination fee.
HANG TIME HEADQUARTERS — When Doc Rivers revamped his bench in the offseason he made sure the Los Angeles Clippers would be one of the most intriguing teams in the NBA this season.
Even now, after shipping both Josh Smith and Lance Stephenson out, the Clippers remain a team of intrigue. They have an elite coach in Rivers, superstars in Chris Paul and Blake Griffin (yes, he’ll be back), one of the league’s best rim protectors and rebounders in DeAndre Jordan, a super sixth-man in Jamal Crawford and one of the league’s deadliest pure shooters in J.J. Redick.
It might have something to do with the reigning champions up in Oakland. The Golden State Warriors on a historic roll this season and the San Antonio Spurs aren’t far off the pace. And then there is the matter of that two-headed superstar monster from Oklahoma City.
So perhaps it’s understandable, the Clippers’ current predicament. Even as they continue to shine without Griffin in the lineup, they still have ground to make up in the standings.
We dig deep on the Clippers and much more on Episode 230 of The Hang Time Podcast featuring J.J. Redick.
As always, we welcome your feedback. You can follow the entire crew, including the Hang Time Podcast, co-hosts Sekou Smith of NBA.com, Lang Whitaker of NBA.com’s All-Ball Blog and renaissance man Rick Fox of NBA TV, as well as our new super producer Gregg (just like Popovich) Waigand.

Project-based learning opportunities come in all forms at MIT, as Melanie Chen discovered during her internship at Lincoln Laboratory this year. A computer science major, she served as a teaching assistant, curriculum developer, and mentor to high school students participating in Cog*Works, part of the Beaver Works Summer Institute. Now, finishing up her fall sophomore semester, Chen is finding plenty of opportunities to apply the lessons she has learned from her hands-on experience teaching others.
“One of the greatest skills I’ve learned is effective communication,” she notes. “Whether it’s students, peers, colleagues, or mentors, I’ve learned what it takes to be able to create a trusting relationship, so that we can effectively work on a project of this scale together.”
Cog*Works, a summer course offered to talented rising-senior high school students, gives interns hands-on experience developing technologies used in artificial intelligence applications. Created by Ryan Soklaski, a technical staff member at Lincoln Laboratory, it promotes project-based learning using Python and other open-source technologies, introducing students to powerful and accessible tools for customizing their own cognitive assistants.
In the months leading up to her internship, Chen helped develop the curriculum for Cog*Works, and was responsible for creating course materials that would teach students how to “hack” the Amazon Echo Dot, allowing them to customize the on-board cognitive assistant, Alexa, using their own code and hardware. At the beginning of July, she took on the role of teaching assistant throughout the intensive, full-time, four-week course. She and the other course instructors worked with 28 high school students from around the country, introducing them to audio processing, computer vision, and natural language processing techniques. Students created their own song-recognition algorithms, trained neural networks, and coded search engines from scratch. In one project, students equipped Alexa with a camera and access to a neural network capable of performing state-of-the-art face detection and recognition. Alexa could thus “recognize” who is speaking to it — a capability that is expected of next-generation cognitive assistants.
“Cog*Works empowered its students,” Chen stated. “It taught them that they are capable of creating impressive tech, and that this creative process is exhilarating.”
As impactful as the experience has been for the Cog*Works interns, it also left a lasting impression on Chen. “I have some prior teaching experience, but I’ve never really taught students who are this close to my age range,” she said. “The challenge was to project myself as what I would want to see in a mentor.”
The experience also jump-started Chen’s facility with machine learning techniques, which are covered in 6.867 (Machine Learning), a course she is currently taking this semester. “Being able to prepare myself such that the students could actually ask me questions, and I’d be able to understand the material to an extent that I could answer all the questions they have, was challenging in the weeks leading up to the course.” But Chen persevered, and is now applying her newfound skills to her coursework and research in the Spoken Language Systems Group in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. She plans to pursue a master’s degree with a focus in machine learning. She is also the MIT Animation Group public relations director, a radio show host at WMBR, and an MIT Arts Scholar.

28 It was clear that despite popular perceptions of the reactionary and conservative attitudes of the armed forces, most were not averse to investigating the possibilities of air power, following the revelations of the Wrights. Certainly, public pressure grew and was fuelled by the nationalistic fervour then prevalent in Europe. The influence of the Zeppelin, the “flyers” of the Wrights and the literature of writers such as Wells and the burgeoning aviation press is undeniable. With ever increasing arms expenditure swallowing up huge proportions of national spending, and with militarism rife, any expenditure on new weapons had to be very carefully considered.
In reality, what they were perhaps demonstrating so vividly was that air power was not sufficient to avoid industrial wars, and indeed was actually a prime accelerating factor in the deepening and widening of total war. While the achievement of the Wrights in propelling the first true aircraft into the air was remarkable, especially considering their background and their lack of formal scientific and academic training, in reality aviation had been around for quite some time in a variety of guises.
Germany’s airships and France’s lead in aeroplane development caused considerable consternation in British circles. In fact, although the potential of aircraft was significant, in the years leading up to World War I, air power was decidedly embryonic and even in World War II the importance of naval supremacy and the English Channel was reaffirmed. Nevertheless, rivalry with Germany and long term military considerations meant that Britain could not stand by and let others dictate air 34 THE BIRTH OF AIR POWER power development.

Jiske Griffioen, a wheelchair tennis athlete, that has been in the top 8 of the international women ranking for years. Follow her Tennis career, read her blog about her training days, physical work off court and social events. Make sure you stay up to date on her achievements in high level events, such as Grand Slams, Super Series and Paralympics.
Read about Jiske's training base, coaches, trainers and partners that make it all possible for her to succeed in her success.
When Jiske is in the Netherlands she is training at the 'Dennis van Scheppingen Tennis Academy'. You can find more information about this academy at http://vanscheppingentennis.nl.
She started working with Dennis van Scheppingen in 2009. He was a top player who ended his professional tennis career in 2007. His highest international ranking was 72nd. He started as a coach in 2007 at Goldstar and worked at tennis academy Amstelpark. In 2016 he started his own tennis academy. He's working with a lot of talented able bodied juniors as well.
"What I like about working with Jiske, is the challenge to find little changes to make her game better. Wheelchair tennis is a part of tennis, but still there are different things to work on compared to the able bodies players I'm training." Dennis van Scheppingen
Jiske also works with Paul Franklin, who is her physical trainer. He was a sprinter, who ended his career in 1994. He's been Dutch champion twice on the 100 m. sprint, his fastest time 10.39 and Dutch Champion on the 200 m. sprint, fastest time 21.03. He also played American Football. Highlight was the 2nd place of the Europe Cup in 1997 with the Rotterdam Trojans. Other able bodied players who he worked with are Thomas Schoorel, Antal van der Duim, Peter Wessels, Elise Tamaela en Danielle Harmsen.
"What I like about working with Jiske, is the challenge to create a training program that really benefits her tennis and trains all the parts that she's able to train." Paul Franklin
Besides her personal training program, Jiske trains at the National Training centre in Almere. The Davis Cup team, Fed Cup team and Dutch elite juniors train here as well.
Jiske works with head coach Dennis Sporrel, physical trainers Miguel Janssen en Bas van Bentum, physiotherapist Annelies van Asch and the rest of the staff members that KNLTB has located there to provide a training program for the elite Dutch wheelchair tennis players.
International bestselling author Ken Follett has enthralled millions of readers with The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, two stories of the Middle Ages set in the fictional city of Kingsbridge. The saga now continues with Follett’s magnificent new epic, A Column of Fire.
In 1558, the ancient stones of Kingsbridge Cathedral look down on a city torn apart by religious conflict. As power in England shifts precariously between Catholics and Protestants, royalty and commoners clash, testing friendship, loyalty, and love.
Ned Willard wants nothing more than to marry Margery Fitzgerald. But when the lovers find themselves on opposing sides of the religious conflict dividing the country, Ned goes to work for Princess Elizabeth. When she becomes queen, all Europe turns against England. The shrewd, determined young monarch sets up the country’s first secret service to give her early warning of assassination plots, rebellions, and invasion plans. Over a turbulent half century, the love between Ned and Margery seems doomed as extremism sparks violence from Edinburgh to Geneva. Elizabeth clings to her throne and her principles, protected by a small, dedicated group of resourceful spies and courageous secret agents.
The real enemies, then as now, are not the rival religions. The true battle pitches those who believe in tolerance and compromise against the tyrants who would impose their ideas on everyone else—no matter what the cost.
Set during one of the most turbulent and revolutionary times in history, A Column of Fire is one of Follett’s most exciting and ambitious works yet. It will delight longtime fans of the Kingsbridge series and is the perfect introduction for readers new to Ken Follett.
In this culmination of five decades of acclaimed studies in presidential history, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Doris Kearns Goodwin offers an illuminating exploration of the early development, growth, and exercise of leadership.
Are leaders born or made? Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the leader make the times or do the times make the leader?
In Leadership, Goodwin draws upon the four presidents she has studied most closely—Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson (in civil rights)—to show how they recognized leadership qualities within themselves and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entries into public life, we encounter them at a time when their paths were filled with confusion, fear, and hope.
Leadership tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to shatter forever their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times.
No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities, and temperament, these men shared a fierce ambition and a deep-seated resilience that enabled them to surmount uncommon hardships. At their best, all four were guided by a sense of moral purpose. At moments of great challenge, they were able to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.
This seminal work provides an accessible and essential road map for aspiring and established leaders in every field. In today’s polarized world, these stories of authentic leadership in times of apprehension and fracture take on a singular urgency.
Congrats to the Chronicles of EMS team for the debut of their new program: Fire Responders Network.tv.
This great new network uses the power of entertainment, education, technology and partnership to work with and improve the health care industry. If you're an EMT, firefighter, filmmaker, social media expert, or just interested in our nation's EMS and health care system, make sure to check out this new platform to learn about the latest EMS news.
Filmmaker Julie Winokur and I traveled to Baltimore last week to present FIRESTORM at this year's EMS Today conference. Although we were only there from Thursday to Friday, our schedules were jammed pack. From attending a few educational sessions and exploring the exhibition floor to meeting up with old EMS friends and networking with new ones, EMS Today was a great success as well as a blast!
Julie was interviewed by GenMed host Natalie Queubedeaux and we also met up with EMS bloggers Chris Kaiser (Life Under The Lights) and Scott Kier (EMS in the New Decade), podcaster Jamie Davis (the Podmedic), and Ted Setla, Justin Schorr, and Sam Bradley of Chronicles of EMS. We also met paramedics from other countries including Switzerland and Germany. It was amazing to hear their thoughts after watching FIRESTORM and to compare notes about each of our country's EMS and health care system.
With a turnout of about 80-100 people, Julie and I couldn't have been more pleased with the screening of FIRESTORM. The more EMS professionals we show the film to, the greater the reach of our outreach campaign. And the greater the outreach campaign, the greater the chance of successfully reducing overcrowding in our nation's EDs.
So many EMTs tell us "ER overcrowding, wall delays, ambulance diversion -- all of this is currently happening in my community too!" Unfortunately, it's the public at large who remain unaware and uneducated about our nation's EMS crisis. Communities across the US (both urban and rural) are facing the same ER problems as seen in Los Angeles, and (as many of us discussed at the conference) 'If these problems exist on a day-to-day basis across the country, then how can EMS be prepared for and adequately respond to a disaster situation?' Americans have no idea that our EMS systems are overwhelmed and facing dire circumstances. That's why opportunities such as screening at EMS Today is so important to our film and campaign's success....We need more EMS members to learn about FIRESTORM so they can then use the film as a tool for advocacy and awareness in their communities.
Thank you to EMS Today for giving us this opportunity and to all our EMS friends for supporting our film and helping us spread the word. Our nation's EMS system is made up of such dedicated, skilled, intelligent, and humble men and women. It was such a privilege to be welcomed into their tight knit community with open arms.
Every minute in the United States, an ambulance gets turned away from an emergency room because hospitals are simply too full. In Los Angeles, where the wait time in some ERs is as long as 48 hours, the entire 911 system is being challenged in ways that are alarming. FIRESTORM is a feature-length documentary that examines the health care crisis through the prism of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The LAFD handles all emergency medical services for the city of Los Angeles, and currently 82% of the department's work is medical, rather than fire-related. Eleven hospitals have closed in just five years in LA, and the challenge of delivering more than 500 patients per day to a shrinking number of hospitals is overwhelming to LAFD paramedics. With resources strained, and 911 being used for everything from heart attacks to stomach aches, LAFD paramedics have become virtual 'doctors in a box'. FIRESTORM asks, who will rescue the rescuers?

A Horizon poll finds Labour is seen as better to manage health, housing, immigration, education, household income, child poverty, cost of living, welfare benefits, the quality of life and the environment.
National is seen as better on traffic congestion, new transport infrastructure, retirement income, crime and the economy overall.
It is weighted by age, gender and region to ensure it represents the New Zealand adult population at the last census. At a 95% confidence level, the maximum margin of error for the decided voter sample is +/- 3.4%. The poll complies with Research New Zealand’s code for political polls.
In the past being viewed as the best to manage the economy has been considered important to winning.
The survey finds that among those registered to vote and 100% likely to vote, 52% feel National is best for the overall economy and 38% think Labour is.
A key question is whether this issue will outweigh the overall 10 to 6 issue deficit National has when people weigh up their overall feelings when they vote.
In fact, they rate Labour better than National on 15 of the 17 major issues – but on the overall economy measure, 47% of them believe National is best, while 42% feel Labour is.
57% of Male voters, on the other hand, felt that National is best for the overall economy, with 34% feeling Labour is best. Male voters rate National better than Labour on 10 of the 17 major issues.
Overall, respondents under 35 years old who were registered and 100% likely to vote rated Labour better than National on all the major issues. National was rated as better for the overall economy from those aged 35 or more.
First home buyers: Among the 9% who said they were looking to buy their first home in the next 12 months rated Labour ahead on 14 of the 17 major issues: National was ahead on new transport infrastructure, retirement income and crime.
Buying a home (not first home): It was a different story for those who were looking to buy a home – not their first one – or sell a home. These respondents rated National as better than Labour on nearly all major issues – the exceptions being the environment and child poverty, and for those looking to sell, and health.
Note that at the last census, 64.8% of homes were owned by their occupier or held in a family trust. Housing policy could therefore be a potentially important issue for a much larger proportion of the population than just those looking to buy a first home.
Starting or finishing tertiary education: Those starting tertiary education or finishing it (13% of the sample), together with the 4% who were intending to start their first full-time job rated Labour ahead of National on all factors.
Full table results for which party is best to manage analysed by 12 activities people plan in the next 12 months are included in this poll summary.
– She was diagnosed with a hysteric condition and advised to rest with the assurance that her eyesight would be restored- it never did for three years later
A 52-year-old mother of two and school teacher Tabitha Maina has regained her eyesight after three years of blindness.
She went blind three years ago while teaching students at the Ndarugo primary school in Nakuru. She was correcting her students books when everything went black. She was was rushed to the Egerton University hospital for treatment.
She was diagnosed with a hysterical condition and advised rest with the assurance that her sight would be restored. Unfortunately, she did not get her eyesight back. Her life as she knew it, took a downhill spill.
She sought specialized care at the Rift Valley General Provincial hospital but no ailment was detected. It was the same story when she sought prognosis at the Kikuyu hospital.

At the Kenyatta National hospital, she was referred to a neurologist for specialized check-ups but gave up the chase as she didn’t have the money for it.
Her life worsened when she could neither work nor perform her duties as a wife and a mother. Her husband despite the tragedy, remained supportive throughout the hurdles even at the time when she could not take a shower by herself.
With the help of the Distric Human Resource officer, she was able to enroll in a special school. She learnt how to use a white stick, the braille and resigned to fate.
She graduated from the Machakos School for the blind after a six-month course and was re-posted to her former school as a special teacher.
In March 2016, while at a prayer service, her eyesight came back. No ophthalmologist has been able to explain her ‘miracle’.
Maina no longer needs help moving around. She can use the chalk board and no longer uses the braille or the walking stick. While speaking to Standard, she said that she had learnt how to make the best of whatever circumstances that she may find herself in.
If you believe in horoscope or just like to read it (so if it matches what happens - it was right), why don't you do your hair according to your horoscope sign? The change will certainly look great, it will do you good, and it will please the stars under which you were born.

Sweet, little Taurus. They are kind people, but sometimes they can be very stubborn and then it is not easy to deal with them. They are practical and reliable, so long, the layered haircut is perfect for all ladies born in this sign.
Gemini is practically two women in one. One moment they can talk about politics and the other one about a reality program. They are not afraid to share their opinion and they easily get bored ... Just like with one and the same hairstyle. One side of the head to be bald? Why not! Because if you get bored with that side, you can always switch to the other and get a whole new hairstyle.
Cancer is represented by three epithets: calmness, passions and persistence. You are sensitive and sometimes reserved, which makes you more difficult to recognize in a crowd of people. Bangs are a great idea to add a little chic and rock touch to your look. Consult your hair stylist which hair-do would suit you best and start being noticeable... At least thanks to good hair.

Scorpios are a dangerous mix of mystery and sexy. You are also exotic and magnetically attractive, but you can also be moody. Play with the mystery by not cutting your hair at all (except for split ends) and let it grow. You are confident and strong, so why not?
You have a good sense of humor and enjoy life, with all ups and downs. Being versatile and vivacious people requires a hairstyle that shows such a character! Shaving hair on the sides and leaving the middle is good and cute look, exactly for you. You are an adventurer and you love fun, and this hairstyle shows it.
Don't be afraid to go for your goals and achieve them aggressively. You are powerful and responsible and you are not afraid to show it. Experimenting with new things is what Capricorns love.

"Undercut" or shaved part of the hair, which can only be seen when you lift it, would be perfect for Pisces because they would understand the beauty and creativity behind this hairstyle. Not everyone can see it, unless you lift your hair up, which gives it a small dose of mystique.

How often you assess the success of Primary PCI with degree of ST segment regression or resolution ?
I posed this query to a freshly hatched , Intelligent and energetic cardiologist in an upscale dedicated heart care center.
He said, “No, we don’t .We always go with TIMI flow in IRA .TIMI 3 flow with less than 30% narrowing of IRA is success, that’s it ! He continued ,very often ,we don’t even Insist to take serial ECGs after the procedure . . . forget about analysing ST segment ! His body language seemed to suggest, he didn’t expect such a question (Silly !) from me , talking about ECG in this era of hyper Interventionism where we literally live within the coronary artery !
But , as of 2017 ST segment regression is not considered worthy to define success of pPCI by the all powerful world scientific cardiology community .This is unfortunate (Or Intentional ?) we have ignored this Inspite periodic research papers showing the importance of the same. (Link to this land mark Brodie BR AJC 2005)
Do you know , none of the trials that celebrated the superiority of primary PCI in the last two decades used ST segment criteria. But then ,we realised much later even TIMI 3 flow can have near zero myocardial perfusion. So ,can we now say all these trials are invalid ?
We also never bothered to include no reflow as a liability during pPCI. We have enough data to say even restored No reflow during pPCI has worrying long-term outcome as reocclusion and tissue level perfusion is dismal .(Can we call it a pPCI failure equivalent ?) This is because the Cocktail of anti no-reflow drug we administer often give us a momentary satisfaction with transient myocardial blushes ! (Only to occlude minutes later as the patient is wheeled out of cath lab .We will never ever know how often this happens !) This is because , microvascular bed integrity is notoriously unpredictable and defies the conventional salvage time window . We have seen patients with ultrafast pPCI ending up with severe LV dysfunction.
If you apply the ST regression criteria by 90* minutes after pPCI (as we do for lysis ) the true success rate of pPCI will emerge .My prediction would be , if you do that routinely the hype of perceived superiority of pPCI might go down the drain (At Least in all low risk STEMI ! ) Let us do a large-scale trial comparing ST regression with TIMI flows, blushes ,frame counts etc and rediscover the true face of our beleaguered coronary microcirculatory sense !
*In fact ST regression should occur much early with pPCI than lysis (May be 10 minutes after restoring IRA patency ! )
If coronary thrombus laden IRA is the chief culprit in STEMI battle field , Why is that Immediate , routine aspiration of thrombus in the ground zero is counter productive ?
Surprisingly , a Danish(DANAMI) study showed ST regression may not be Important in pPCI .This appears curious , especially when it suggests , ST segment regression didn’t occur because of more complete revascularisation by PCI !

Experience would tell us only about 70-80 % of STEMI are truly eligible for a good quality pPCI .(Multivessel CAD, Complex bifurcation lesion, difficulty in identifying IRA, No IRA-sapsms , complete spontaneous reperfusion ) The remaining 20-30 % should , logically be included in the failed pPCI category .This fact is largely concealed in the literature .
Beware of huge thrombus load in every patient with STEMI .The contribution of mechanical occlusion vs thrombus (in the total occlusion ) is the single most important factor in determining the intervention strategy.
Deploying a stent in a poorly prepared (debrided of thrombus ) lesion confers further continuous risk of a STEMI .Stents smartly jail even large thrombus against the coronary vessels and they release it into the lumen in a controlled fashion and prolong the acute coronary risk phases
If thrombus aspiration does a neat job and establishes a good flow , if the lumen appear good , think twice or even thrice before deploying a stent .It is akin to stent a zero % lesion and we know it is foolish to do that at any stretch of imagination .(Stenting has never been proven to convert a vulnerable ulcerated lesion into stable one )
IVUS, OCT are not the answer in the above situations as we are dealing with emergency coronary fire fighting !
Of course the intensive anti-platelet protocols , will take care of potential after effects of the intra coronary contact sport we play ! . But . . . there is a limit for every thing. So spend as little time as possible when attempting catheter based reperfusion during STEMI.
( *Probably because , we know “Time” ( fate !) is still the most crucial determinate of ultimate outcome of STEMI )
Any experienced interventional cardiologist will be aware of the surprises and difficulties they encounter during primary PCI.
The pPCI is all about opening up the IRA rapidly and wheel out the patient from cath lab at the earliest.
(* There are some hyper-talented cardiologists who would never consider IRA recognition as an issue .This article is not meant for them.)
STEMI in patients with preexisting CAD . Is it a CTO ? ATO ? (Acute total occlusion ) A CTO ,which is fed by collaterals from contralateral artery , if this feeding vessel is occluded even partially , STEMI will occur in CTO territory . Here , for rapid salvage you need to open the vessel that feeds the CTO territory.
Post CABG and post PCI form a special subset . Some times it is very difficult or even impossible to label a graft as an IRA
Finally and most importantly , when there is no visible lesion in any of the coronary arteries and look near normal ! Is that no IRA ? or Wrong diagnosis of STEMI ? Every one blinks in cath lab . The consultant howls the fellow to verify the ECG . Finally it may well turn out to be an early repolarisation syndrome . These are wages we often pay for the modernity !
The good old ECG will come to our rescue sometimes. Realise in a multivessel CAD , ECG is also vested with errors.
Echocardiography rarely gives a convincing answer to localise IRA. (Segmental overlap , preserved sub epicardial contraction , residual ischemia all tend to confound )
Most confusions occur between LAD and diagonal /LCX as there can be a huge overlap in the ECG territory anterolateral segments
In a infero posterior STEMI, if you have both RCA / LCX lesion and you wonder which is the IRA it is easy to solve by looking for RV involvement. (LCX lesions however dominant they are . 99/100 times can not infarct the RV significantly !)
This is modern-day cardiology at its scientific low ! . Cardiologists indulge in such things much more commonly than one would imagine.
Probably they would reason , it is safe to stent every vessel that is potentiality an IRA , rather than missing it. Though the concept of multivessel stenting in STEMI may help patients with complicated MI , like pump failure , it generally increases risk of primary PCI outcome in otherwise stable STEMI. Primary PCI procedure must be as short as possible. The other option is to do plain balloon angioplasty in less deserving vessels.
IRA identification can indeed be a difficult task during primary PCI. Sound knowledge and experience about coronary anatomy and its draining territories especially in the setting of multivessel CAD is essential to avoid errors.

This simple process was, no doubt, employed anterior to engraving by the lathe; to this it probably gave way, as the accurate artistic effects of the lathe far surpass the crude work of steel or diamond etching. Etching by fluoric acid has been introduced, but its bite is not sufficiently rough, and is not found effective for general purposes. Pleasing effects are produced by engraving through an outer casing of coloured Glass, usually afterwards decorated with gold, and painted in arabesques, or other patterns. This work is chiefly the produce of Bohemia, Bavaria, and France; it has recently been executed at the Falcon Glass Works with success, in engraved classical designs.
Stoppering is usually done within Flint Glass premises. The lathe is similar to that employed by Glass engravers, being what is termed a mandril tool. The mouths of the bottles are opened by a steel projecting cone, or mandril, to the required size to suit the stopper; and emery powder and water being applied, the rotating friction soon effects its object. The stopper must be fixed in a wooden chuck, and rotated by the lathe, to be first reduced to the dimensions of the mouth of the bottle, by emery and water; and finally introduced into it, carefully grinding the one into the other, reducing the speed, and supplying by degrees finer and finer emery (and water), until the stoppering by the lathe is completed; a few turns of the stopper with the hand follow to finish.

The American Library Association has teamed up with Well Read, the popular weekly public television program for those who love books and lively, engaging conversations with the authors. On each Well Read episode, series host Terry Tazioli introduces viewers to first time and best-selling authors, including Timothy Egan (the 2013 winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction, an award presented by ALA), Jodi Picoult, James McBride, and Amy Bloom, where lively conversations about characters and philosophies of the books reveal the author’s unique perspectives. Following the informal interview, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and former V.P. of the National Book Critics Circle Mary Ann Gwinn joins Terry to recommend other compelling books that share similar themes.
“Librarians have long played a pivotal role in shining a spotlight on great books through nationally renowned awards, Booklist reviews or by simply bringing great books to the public through carefully curated collections,” says Courtney Young, ALA President. “In addition to being a unique show, Well-Read is shining a spotlight on these unique functions of our profession through public television. I am eager to watch this partnership grow.”
“We are elated to be partnering with American Library Association,” said Well Read co-host Terry Tazioli. “Our hope is that Well Read will encourage reading and promote literacy by introducing people to fascinating, wonderful authors and helping them discover great new books. Libraries develop literate and informed communities through reading, so we at Well Read are excited to support those important efforts.”
Well Read is currently airing in 83% of the U.S. and is an independent production of TVW (Washington Public Affairs Network) that is presented for distribution by Detroit Public Television (DPTV). Well Read is distributed nationally by American Public Television is also carried weekly on WORLD, a 24/7 multicast channel featuring public television’s best documentary, nature and news programming.

Of all the billions of things that keep wildlife rehabilitators from sleeping at night, public releases are one of the big ones. Ideally, we like to release birds where they came from (as long as it’s not a dangerous area), and with as little fanfare as possible. Releases are magical, of course, and they’re what make our insane way of life worth it, so you want to share the feeling … but not with too big a crowd.
You might include those who rescued the bird, possibly a couple of completely fried fellow rehabbers who need a lift, and one or two like-minded friends who realize that letting a bird go isn’t as easy as it sounds. This is the trick with public releases: not everyone understands the extent to which luck is involved.
You plan the release for a gorgeous day, and suddenly a hailstorm arrives. You schedule it for 1:00, and key people don’t show up until 2. You open the door, and your fit, strong bird flaps once and plummets to the ground, overcome by the stress of the car ride.
But every once in awhile, there’s a reason to do a big public release. My latest Red-tailed hawk was one of them. The starving young male had been rescued from the side of a road, recovered at my house, then went to my rehabber friend Lisa’s for live prey training, where he sharpened his skills until he was a mouse-killing machine. We were ready to release him when Lisa received a phone call from her high school friend, Cindy, whose 5-year-old son had been battling brain cancer for the last two years.
The day of the release was perfect – cool and clear, with brilliant sunshine and the trees just starting to turn. Word had gotten out, the event had turned into an inspirational fundraiser, and over a hundred people gathered in the parking lot of a rural firehouse. Ty was home in bed, his mother by his side; but his father and brother were in the crowd, with photographers and videographers stationed at strategic spots.
Lisa had done her homework. One of the area’s resident hawks had recently been killed by a car (“I know this,” said Lisa, “because I’m the one they called to pick him up”), which left a possible territorial spot open for a young one. Hedging her bets, she convinced the fire department to let her release him from their cherry picker, over the heads of the crowd and closer to the sky.
The pastor said a prayer, the cherry picker rose, Lisa opened the crate, and the redtail barreled out. For a heart-stopping second he lost altitude, then he raised his wings and rocketed up toward the far trees. Suddenly he changed direction and flew across the parking lot, directly above the gathered crowd. In an instant, he was gone. There were cheers, applause, and minutes later people were pointing upward, swearing that the tiny speck in the sky must be Ty’s hawk.
That night Ty and his family looked through the photos. Cindy described the event and posted photos on the blog she had been keeping since Ty was diagnosed, on the home page of the Ty Louis Campbell Foundation, a non-profit organization she and her husband Lou set up to spread awareness and fund research for pediatric cancer. Cindy wrote on her blog that from now on whenever she sees a hawk in flight, she’ll wonder if it’s Ty’s.
Suzie Gilbert is a licensed wild bird rehabilitator whose shameful secret is that on one occasion (well … maybe more than one) she has received a little brown job, or a fledgling whatever, and has been completely unable to ID it. Luckily, she has birder friends who will rush to her aid, although she must then suffer their mockery. She runs Flyaway, Inc. out of her home, and has been caring for injured and orphaned wild birds for 20 years. Why go birding when you can just stroll through the house? Honestly, though, she is wildly envious of birders and their trips to exotic locales. She is the author of Flyaway, her bird-rehabbing memoir, and Hawk Hill, a children's book, and is the sole parent of two teenagers. Never a dull moment.
I know this is off-point, but I could not help imagining that the boy was named “Gus”. Then you would have people correcting your spelling and telling you “No, that’s a Red-tailed Hawk.”

Lexington, Ky. – The conditions could not have been more perfect for a day of brilliant cross-country action, and the riders and horses did not disappoint. Defending champion Michael Jung of Germany and fisherRocana FST showed the depth of their partnership to take over the top spot after adding only 0.4 penalties to his dressage score to lead with 27.5.
Breathing down his neck is Australia’s Chris Burton and Nobilis 18 (27.9) and Oliver Townend of Great Britain on Cooley Master Class (28.7). Townend also tied for fourth aboard MHS King Joules (31.3) with Lynn Symansky and Donner (31.3). Less than a rail separates all of them as they head into the show jumping finale.
Symansky (Middleburg, Va.) and Donner, the 15-year-old Thoroughbred owned by The Donner Syndicate, LLC, are the highest-placed American combination and currently lead the Land Rover/USEF CCI4* Eventing National Championship. Overnight leader Marilyn Little (Frederick, Md.) and RF Scandalous, Jacqueline Mars and Phoebe and Michael Manders’s 13-year-old Oldenburg mare, added 8 time penalties to drop to sixth overall (32.8), and second in the national championship.
Donner is competing in his ninth CCI4* and their experience showed as he and Symansky cruised around easily. “I don’t have any complaints,” she said with a smile. “He takes a bit to get into the groove, especially with the crowd… He went around like clockwork. It’s a tribute to knowing the horse so well and having a great partnership with him. He tried his heart out, and I’m pleased with how he came home.”
Overall, 11 pairs came home double-clear around Derek di Grazia’s course. Thirty-six horses finished the course, six with jumping faults. Three were eliminated and four retired on course.
Course designer di Grazia, who will design courses for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, was pleased with how his course rode, even though more made the time than he was expecting. “I’m generally very happy about how the course rode,” he said. “I think the faults were spread out, quite a number clean without jumping faults and I think all the combinations rode well and, at the same time, [the riders] didn’t have to do them all the same way. People did things differently and it still worked out for them. And, we didn’t have any horse falls or rider injuries, and, to me, that’s all a positive.
“I think that the ground ended up being quite fast today,” di Grazia continued. “[In part because] the conditions couldn’t be better. A little rain would have been different, but you never know. We also had a very good field of riders today. It may not have been a huge field, but the ones we had were good.”
The Plains, Va. – The Land Rover U.S. Eventing Team won the FEI Nations Cup™ CICO3* at the Great Meadow International, presented by Adequan, for the second consecutive year. Now that betting is legal in the US as of April 2018, you can get a free Twinspires promo-code and learn the tricks of the trade.
The team of Jennie Brannigan, Lynn Symansky, Phillip Dutton, and Boyd Martin defeated teams from Canada and Great Britain in the only FEI Nations Cup™ Eventing competition outside Europe. Brannigan also captured her second individual title at Great Meadow, having won previously in 2015.
Cross country course designer Mike Etherington-Smith reversed the direction and order of the fences from last year with the intention of generating interest for both the competitors and spectators. The change proved to be challenging for some, though not for the U.S. team. All four riders completed the course without any jumping penalties.
Brannigan had an unforgettable day. The Reddick, Fla. resident went third in the team order and secured the victory for the U.S. incurring only 1.6 time faults on Nina Gardner’s Cambalda. Brannigan came into the final day in fourth place and catapulted to the top spot with a final score of 49.8 penalties.
“The first time I came it was so exciting because it earned me a spot as a traveling alternate for the Pan Am Games, which was quite special to me,” said Brannigan. “It’s such an honor to get to ride for your country and ‘Ping’ has been an incredible horse in a lot of ways and is wonderful to me. I really appreciate him stepping up to the plate.”
By the time second U.S. team rider Lynn Symansky took to the course, two riders were eliminated from the British team and the Canadians had already secured a team score. The Middleburg, Va. resident jumped clear, finishing just above the optimum time on Donner, owned by The Donner Syndicate, LLC. They incurred 1.2 time faults for a three-phase score of 50.1 penalties, which was good enough for second place individually. Symansky was originally the alternate, but was named to the team after Buck Davidson, Jr. withdrew Carl Segal and Sherrie Martin’s Copper Beach.
“It’s such a great cohesive group. Everybody just works together and supports each other. We’re all out here to win and do the best that we can,” said Symansky. “It was awesome. The whole way around I heard people cheering me on, saying, ‘Come on Lynn, you can do it!’ It’s cool to ride at your hometown event. It was an honor.”
U.S. pathfinder Boyd Martin of Cochranville, Pa. was the first rider to complete the course within the optimum time of 6 minutes and 33 seconds, finishing within two seconds at 6:31. Riding Steady Eddie, owned by Denise Lahey, Pierrie Colin, George and Gretchen Wintersteen, the Olympic veteran finished on his dressage score of 58.3 penalties.
“He came through for me; he was the only horse that finished on his dressage score,” said Martin of the New Zealand Thoroughbred. “It was a bit hard to gauge the course because the first rider Justine Dutton (GBR) fell and second rider Jessica Phoenix (CAN) was held on the course, but I zipped around and everything rode really well.”
Dutton, of West Grove, Pa., already knew that the U.S. had won the Nations Cup prior to going out, but an individual win was on the line. Riding Kristine and John Norton’s I’m Sew Ready, the six-time Olympic veteran finished outside the optimum time adding 5.6 time faults to his cumulative score of 51.6 penalties and putting him in third place.
“My teammates did it all for me. Jennie came home and I had a minute to go before I went in the box and they said she only had a couple of time faults,” said Dutton. “I thought it was a good run for the horse. He’s not the fastest, but I think I could have done a little better job at the galloping fences. Overall, though, I think it was a good run for him and pleased that he went so well.”
The winning score for the U.S. was 151.5 penalties. Team Canada finished on 168.6 penalties for second place. Because Great Britain failed to have the required three qualifying scores, they were awarded a drop score penalty of 1000 points, and finished third.

Stamford, England – The Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials CCI4* came to a close on Sunday with the show jumping phase in the main arena of the prestigious venue. Fifty combinations moved forward to the final phase over Richard Jeffery’s show jumping track. The U.S. combinations had a day of solid performances, led by USEF Land Rover Competition Grant recipients Lynn Symansky and Donner, who finished 14th in their Burghley debut.
Symansky (Middleburg, Va.) and The Donner Syndicate, LLC’s Donner began their week at Burghley by scoring 47.7, a personal best at the CCI4* level, in the dressage phase on Thursday. On Saturday, she and the 2003 Thoroughbred gelding made light work of the massive track, though took some time to settle into a rhythm and went the long routes at Maltings 360 and Discovery Valley, collecting 13.2 time penalties. In its show jumping round, the pair had a rail at fence three for four faults, but finished strongly, ending on a score of 64.9 in 14th place.
“I think jumping on turf is a challenge since we don’t practice on it a lot at home. He felt great this morning, but he got a little spooky in the ring and the footing is a bit holding so we had a rail,” Symansky explained. “Being the person that I am, I always want to do better, but I am thrilled with such a great finish in our first appearance at Burghley.”
Colleen Rutledge (Frederick, Md.) and her own Covert Rights, recipients of a Jacqueline B. Mars Competition Grant through the USET Foundation, had a great showing in the horse’s second CCI4* start and first appearance at Burghley. Rutledge gave the 2006 Thoroughbred Cross gelding solid rides throughout the three phases, beginning with the dressage phase where they earned a score of 46.5. On cross-country day the pair came home with no jumping penalties and 28.4 time penalties. Their weekend came to a close with a phenomenal double-clear round in the show jumping phase, putting them in 22nd place with a score of 74.9.
Laine Ashker (Henrico, Va.) and her own Anthony Patch also made their debut at Burghley and earned valuable experience on the international stage. She and the 1999 Thoroughbred gelding had a respectable dressage test to receive a score of 48.8. The pair completed the renowned cross-country course, but had a few issues along the way, collecting 40 jump penalties after stops at fences 4B of the Lion Bridge and 20A at the Land Rover Trout Hatchery and 46.4 time penalties. They knocked three rails for a 12-fault show jumping round, ending on a score of 147.2 in 48th place.
Michael Jung (GER) and La Biosthetique-Sam FBW claimed top honors with a final score of 40.0. Tim Price (NZL) and Ringwood Sky Boy finished in second with a 41.5, while the only combination to finish on its dressage score, Chris Burton (AUS) and TS Jamaimo, was third with a 45.0.
Lexington, Ky. – The United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) has named the combinations representing the United States at CICO3* Aachen, held in Aachen, Germany, August 12-14, 2015. The U.S. has been invited to send a team of three athlete-and-horse combinations.
Per the USEF press release detailing the 2015 fall eventing grant recipients, the following combinations will compose the U.S. Team (listed in ranked order):
Dutton and Kieffer have been awarded, through the USET Foundation, Karen E. Stives Endowment Fund for High Performance Eventing Competition Grants. Symansky has been awarded a Land Rover USEF Competition Grant.
Pau, France – Cross country day at the 2013 Les Étoiles de Pau CCI4* saw American combinations climb the leaderboard with efficient, clear performances. Pierre Michelet’s 33 obstacle track produced trouble throughout the day with thirty six combinations coming home without jumping penalties and of those only six were able to finish within the 11:48 time allowed. Phillip Dutton, Clark Montgomery, Marilyn Little and Lynn Symansky proved their mettle with classy efforts on a day that saw many top names in the sport fail to finish.
Dutton (West Grove, Pa.) and the Mr. Medicott Syndicate’s 14-year-old Irish Sport gelding Mr. Medicott set out on course lying in seventh place and climbed three places with a classy performance. The pair cruised effortlessly around Michelet’s track to finish one second over the optimum time and add .4 time faults to their dressage score of 44.2. They will head into the show jumping in fourth place on a score of 44.6 just 3.1 points out of the lead.
“It was good; obviously he’s a great horse. I’m still trying to get to know him and we were trying to go fast without making a silly mistake,” remarked Dutton of his ride on Saturday. “This wouldn’t be the ideal course for him but he got better and better as the course went on.”
Both Dutton and Mr. Medicott brought a wealth of experience to Pau but are contesting their first CCI4* together. Dutton has represented both the U.S. and his native Australia at numerous Olympic and FEI World Equestrian Games, including winning Olympic Team Gold with Australia in 1996 and 2000, while Mr. Medicott completed the 2008 Olympic Games and 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games with Germany’s Frank Ostholt. He was also ridden by Karen O’Connor to ninth place at the London Olympic Games.
“It gets better with each time. He’s got to get to know me and my reactions but I think this weekend is good for us,” remarked Dutton about his growing partnership with Mr. Medicott.
Dutton looks to secure Mr. Medicott’s third top-10 Pau completion on Sunday. The gelding was third in 2008 and 10th in 2011 with Ostholt.
Montgomery (Wiltshire, UK) and Jessica Montgomery, Carole Montgomery, Janet Higgins, and Elizabeth Smith’s Universe were the pathfinder for the U.S. as the first American pair on course. The Land Rover Competition Grant recipients set the tone for the U.S. camp by flying around the course faultlessly to finish two seconds inside the optimum time. The talented pair are looking for their second CCI4* completion of 2013 after having placed 27th at the Mitsubishi Motors Badminton Horse Trials in the 12-year-old Dutch Warmblood gelding’s first attempt at the level.
Montgomery and Universe, who stood 31st after the dressage, head into the show jumping in ninth place on a score of 52.
Little (Frederick, Md.) and Raylyn Farms and Team Demeter’s 11-year-old Oldenburg mare RF Demeter were the final U.S. pair on course and cruised to a clear round finishing just four seconds over the time. The pair, which was seventh at the Luhmühlen CCI4* in June, is competing in Pau on a Land Rover Competition Grant and is poised for another top 12 CCI4* finish as it heads into the show jumping on a score of 52.8. With its quick clear round on Saturday the pair climbed 16 places after the dressage and now stand in 11th places after two phases.
Symansky (Middleburg, Va.) and her own Donner were the second U.S. combination to produce a double clear effort on Saturday. The pair, which is contesting its first European competition after having been awarded Jacqueline B. Mars Competition and Training Grant, proved its place among the top in the world with a scorching round. The 10-year-old Thoroughbred gelding utilized his classy galloping style to finish 15 seconds within the time allowed. The 2011 Pan American Games Team Gold medalists climbed 26 places with their clear round and will enter the final phase on a score of 53.3 in 12th place.
Michael Pollard (Dalton, Ga.) and Carl Bouckaert’s 15-year-old Thoroughbred gelding Mensa looked on target to produce another clear round for the U.S. until a run-out two-thirds the way around the course. The Land Rover Competition Grant recipients collected 20 jumping penalties for a run-out at 20B and added a further 24.8 time faults. They head into the show jumping in 47th place on a score of 100.
Land Rover Competition Grant recipients Hannah Sue Burnett (The Plains, Va.) and Jacqueline Mars’ Harbour Pilot set out on Saturday laying in equal 11th place. The 2011 Pan American Games Team Gold and Individual Silver medalists slipped between elements at the first water and were subsequently eliminated when Burnett came out of the tack.
Kristi Nunnink and her own 12-year-old Holsteiner mare R-Star travelled to Pau from their base in Auburn, Calif. on a Land Rover Competition Grant. The pair ran into some trouble at the first water and was eliminated after jumping the option in the wrong order.
Great Britain’s William Fox-Pitt again proved why he’s among the best in the game as he produced three double clear performances to hold the top three spots at the conclusion of the cross country. The 2012 Olympic Games Team Silver medalist leads with Seacookie TSF on 41.5, Cool Mountain stands second on 42.2, and Neuf Des Coeurs is third standing on 43.2.

Keep your skin glowing and healthy, on and off the runway, with NY-based celeb Dermatologist, Dr. Whitney Bowe.
This week, I will be speaking at New York Fashion Week to over fifty models about keeping their skin healthy and radiant, not only for today, but for years to come as well. I wanted to share some of this insight with you guys because even if you aren’t hitting the runway this week, these healthy skin pearls will help keep your skin looking its most beautiful.
If you are an energy drink lover, listen up! Energy drinks oftentimes contain even more caffeine than coffee, other stimulants, and sugars. Sugar molecules link directly to your collagen fibers in a process called glycation, targeting them for destruction. When you break down collagen faster than you can replace it, you not only set yourself up for early signs of aging like fine lines and loss of firmness, but your pores will expand. Think of a pore like a basket made of collagen. If that weave loosens up, because you lose more collagen than your body can produce, the basket grows wider. We call this a “peau d’orange” appearance to the skin, because your skin looks like an orange peel.
More and more energy drink companies are reducing their sugar levels and artificial ingredients to make way for options like stevia and natural flavorings. That’s the healthy hydrating team you want to be on! One of my new favorites to hit the market is HALO SPORT.
If coffee is your go-to, aim for no more than 2 cups of caffeine per day, ideally taking your last sip before 2pm. In fact, drinking coffee within 6 hours of bedtime can impact the quality of your sleep. Caffeine can be fine in moderation, and has even been shown to protect against certain forms of skin cancer. Even though new science shows that coffee is not dehydrating, I still recommend alternating cups of Joe with a cup of water for truly radiant skin.
Equally important, watch what you put IN your coffee! Skim milk may seem like a good choice for models and people who are generally looking to cut calories, but studies show skim milk is most strongly linked with acne flares and inflammation in the skin! The milk proteins, including whey and casein, trigger an inflammatory cascade and increase blood levels of something called Insulin Like Growth Factor- 1 (IGF-1) which has been correlated with breakouts and unhealthy skin. Instead, add a splash of unsweetened almond or coconut milk to your morning Joe.
Even experienced models who say that the shows don’t stress them out still suffer from irregular sleep schedules during fashion season. To be candid, Sunday night is never my most relaxing or restful (you too?)! Our sleep cycles are meant to be regular, and when that schedule is disrupted, it messes with our hormones. Our body functions on what’s called a circadian rhythm, which is like our own internal clock. Red-eyes and changing time zones that results from long-distance travel not only disrupt our melatonin release, but erratic sleep schedules can cause our baseline levels of cortisol to shoot up. Yup, our body perceives loss of sleep, or lack of quality sleep (yes, quality and quantity matter) as STRESS.
Even if your mind feels like it’s totally in control, your body AND your skin will be receiving stress signals. Those stress signals not only cause breakouts, but also make skin less capable of trapping moisture and it slows down skin cell turnover. Translation? Deep juicy pimple on your chin, dull skin, dry skin, and blotchy skin. What can you do? Carving out time for meditation or even just focusing on your breathing for 10 min every day can help keep those cortisol levels under control. Try to get outside in natural light every morning, and try to shut off artificial sources of light at night.
Many of my patients travel with copper infused eye shields like this one and even download white noise apps on their phones to block out the elevators or extra noises in a busy hotel. Some patients carry calming mushroom sachets to add to hot water before bed and others swear by melatonin gummies. While in general, melatonin gummies should not present health concerns if you are simply adjusting to a new time zone, I recommend that my patients make every effort not to rely on melatonin supplements for longer than needed for instances like this. Studies indicate that they’re safe in the short term, but it remains to be seen whether taking these supplements daily is safe in the long term.
Fashion season involves hopping from city and city. What do those cities have in common? Pollution. We now know that pollution can take a major toll on the skin. When your skin is exposed to pollution, those tiny invisible particles can not only land on the skin but can even dive into your pores. When they interact with your skin, they release a flood of tiny missiles called free radicals and expose your skin cells to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress from pollution can not only cause inflammation in the skin, but has been linked to acne, aging, and even to brown spots on the skin. You can protect your skin from oxidative stress by applying an antioxidant serum directly to the skin twice a day and making sure you’re getting enough antioxidants in your diet. I also recommend that my patients take an antioxidant supplement like Heliocare every morning. You can also get antioxidants from deeply colored fruits and veggies (emphasis on the veggies to keep your daily sugar levels low), green tea and dark chocolate.
So, whether you’re walking the runway like the models I’m with here at NYFW or you’re walking the hallway back into your office after a summer vacation, take these tips to heart for your healthiest, gorgeous skin!
We all deserve a treat every now and then, but chances are you have more added sugar in your diet than you realize. Too much added sugar can damage your skin through a process called glycation, in which sugar molecules bond to proteins, fats, and amino acids in the body. “When proteins become glycated, they become stiff and much less functional, so imagine what that does to the proteins in your skin,” says dermatologist Whitney Bowe, MD, author of The Beauty of Dirty Skin. Collagen and elastin, the fibers that keep skin firm and elastic, are greatly impacted by this process, she says. “Sugars are rapid stimulators of glycation, as they easily attach themselves to proteins in the body—you really must reduce your sugar intake to maintain healthy skin.”
If you have a serious sweet tooth, but want healthy skin, this video is for you! Sugar in any form causes multiple changes in our body, from our cellular membranes and our arteries to our hormones, immune systems, gut, and even microbiome—the microbes in our intestines that affect our biology all the way out to our skin. Now, there’s a lot going on when it comes to how sugar impacts your skin through myriad pathways in the body. Spiking insulin and inflammatory pathways are just a couple of ways. There’s another big reason to avoid too much sugar that has a direct hit on skin: glycation, which is our focus today.

The first and primary function of this Association is to have a legislative program that benefits, serves, and protects the interests of its members, along with furthering those legislative objectives as established by convention delegates.
The FPF Executive Board shall establish the legislative agenda prior to each session. The FPF Executive Board will notify the FPF Executive Council 30 days prior to the FPF Executive Board Pre-Legislative meeting that the legislative priorities will be reviewed and amended as necessary. The FPF Executive Board will notify the FPF Executive Council within 30 days of the conclusion of the Executive Board Pre-Legislative meeting of the revised legislative agenda. Such agenda shall be selected from the Legislative Objectives as outlined below. This language shall in no way limit the number of legislative issues to be lobbied.
In recognition of the dynamics of the legislative process, nothing shall preclude the FPF Principal Officers from pursuing other Legislative Objectives as opportunities and situations may arise.
On a yearly basis, these objectives shall be reviewed at the pre-convention meeting of the FPF Executive Board, who shall decide which if any of the Legislative objectives for the following Legislative Session and/or recommend changes if needed.
It remains a priority to preserve, enhance and protect all current benefits, programs and services, and oppose any legislation that would be harmful to FPF members.
The FPF shall give each District Vice President and affected Local Affiliate(s) as much notice as possible when a meeting is set with any State or US Legislators within the DVP’s District boundary.
Any FPF District Vice President, Council, or Local holding a meeting with its Legislative Delegation, or State Legislator outside of their individual FPF District (as defined in Policy 24) shall advise the FPF President of such meeting in advance so that an FPF representative designated by the President, has the opportunity to be present at any such meeting(s).
18.1.1 Lobby for legislation and/or rules which would: (1) place restrictions and conditions upon those who wish to become certified as Firefighters and EMS Personnel; and (2) prevent further abuse of using non-certified persons in place of paid full-time firefighters.
18.1.2 Seek a sponsor to introduce legislation raising the minimum standards requirements for certified Professional Firefighters in the State of Florida by amending Chapter 633, F.S., in order to be hired by a public employer as a professional firefighters this legislation shall include passing a rigorous physical fitness exam incorporating many of the job tasks used by Firefighters and EMS personnel in the field; passing a medical exam; criminal background check investigation; being a U.S. citizen; and having a minimum of 30 college credits or two years of satisfactory military service or be a Florida certified paramedic. The FPF will also introduce either separately or in conjunction with this legislation a provision that in order to enroll in Firefighter minimum standards training, a candidate must be sponsored by a publicly funded Fire Department in the State of Florida similar to the language currently pertaining to police officers. Should any of these goals prove to be in conflict with any applicable state and federal laws, then the FPF should continue to lobby for the rest of the goals.
18.1.3 Seek to introduce legislation to mandate using the IAFF/IAFC Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT) as part of the minimum standard for the certification process of all Firefighters in Florida, as soon as reasonably possible. The FPF shall invite the Florida Fire Chiefs to set up a committee to draft language for this legislation and will actively seek bi- partisan sponsorship of this legislation in future sessions.
18.2.1 Preserve, reform and otherwise improve Chapter 447, F.S. - Public Employees Collective Bargaining Law - including Binding Arbitration for Resolution of Impasses, Abolishment of all existing Mini-PERCs and seek revision language which will set "proper cause" as an employee right and which will further subject all matters of discipline and discharge to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in Chapter 447, F.S. The FPF shall obtain House and Senate Bill Sponsors to accomplish the abolishment of Mini-PERCS. Upon introduction, the FPF will lobby and work to successfully pass Legislation that eliminates the seven (7) Mini-PERCs currently operating under Chapter 447, F.S.
18.2.2 Seek changes to Chapter 447, F.S. necessary to provide our fire service public employees in the State of Florida a collective bargaining process that provides at a minimum:
18.2.3 A demand that the representatives of the State negotiate in good faith. That provides an impasse procedure that allows both sides to select a Special Master from a list supplied by the Public Employees Relations Commission to conduct an impasse hearing as outlined in Chapter 447, F.S. for other public employees.
The ability to accept or reject the recommendations of the Special Master with the ability to have the outstanding contract matters settled at public hearing in much the same manner as other public employees currently enjoy. Provide these public employee organizations the ability to file unfair labor practice charges when these procedures are not followed or these rights are violated.
Seek wage and benefit parity, through negotiations, for these statewide fire service FPF members, with the State's law enforcement employees and US Forestry Firefighters, and make this issue a Legislative Priority each year until meaningful changes are made to this process. The FPF will advocate fair and just wages for members of Local S-20 and, in solidarity with IAFF/FPF members working for the State of Florida, will introduce legislation, as a major priority of our state organization, to give State Firefighters a series of raises to bring them to parity with US Forestry Fire Fighters within five years. Make it a legislative priority to work with our friends in the House and Senate to strike the Financial Urgency (F.U.) statute from the State's law books, which would result in public employers in the state of Florida abiding by the collective bargaining agreements they should have negotiated in good faith in the first place.
18.3.2 Submit legislation that provides coverage to public employees professional Firefighters, Paramedics, and EMTs going to and from place of employment, similar to the coverage given to police officers, and said legislation provide injury/illness/disability/death coverage.
18.4.2 Seek to introduce legislation prohibiting state, local, and County governments from restricting the residency of Fire Fighters and EMTs/Paramedics.
18.5.2 Submit legislation until monthly educational incentive benefits are increased to the level of $125.00 for an Associate degree, $200.00 for a Bachelors degree, and $300.00 for a Masters degree. These funds should be increased each year in accordance with a cost of living adjustment. The money for these increased benefits should be identified from a source that does not take away money from Chapter 175 plans.
18.6.1 Seek changes to appropriate Florida Statute Sections and/or Florida Administrative Codes necessary to establish a first offensive punishment at a "written warning" when EMTs and Paramedics licensed in the State of Florida are found to have not filed their address changes with the State of Florida, Department of Health, Bureau of EMS, and that the FPF begin work to seek these changes as soon as possible and continue working on this issue until these Statute and/or Rule changes are made.
18.6.2 Seek legislative changes necessary to grant public third-service EMT and Paramedic employees the same protections from distribution of their personal information that is granted to law enforcement and fire service public employees under Florida Statutes.
18.6.3 Lobby for an EMT and Paramedic Bill of Rights and improve the Firefighters Bill of Rights (ss 112.82) to be similar to that of Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers (ss 112.532).
18.6.4 Work on a legislative bill that would transfer the Bureau of EMS under the Office of the State Chief Financial Officer.
18.6.5 Work with other EMS interest groups and seek legislation that will clarify and permit certificate of needs (CON’s) be granted to any political subdivision to engage the services of a medical director and provide ALS non-transport services within the State of Florida.
18.7.1 Seek legislation or administrative rules that would prohibit the privatization of Fire and Emergency Medical Services of governmental (publicly controlled) systems in Florida.

Health Insurance Safety-Net - Support any viable attempts to increase the Health Insurance Subsidy (Safety-Net) for active and retired members that may arise in the future and to help our retirees keep up with the escalating costs of retirement insurance
Functional Disability – An FRS special risk member who becomes disabled in the line of duty will be considered totally disabled if he or she is wholly prevented from rendering useful and efficient service as a firefighter or paramedic
Non-Rehire provision to FRS – Seek legislation that prevents the rehiring of Special Risk members into FRS Special Risk positions.
Increases disability retirement to 66 2/3% and changes definition of disability similar to language in Chapter 175, F.S.
Seek changes in the language in Chapter 175, regarding Line of Duty Death for non-vested members, to match FRS Line of Duty Death benefit language.
Support the mechanism for funding Chapter 175, F.S. plans to include a like percentage of vehicle, windstorm, and hurricane insurance fees, and that the current 6% of payroll cap on Chapter 175, F.S. money rebated to chapter pension plans not apply to this new funding.
Support legislation to allow either Chapter or Local Law 175 plans the option to change the terms of their trustees by either municipal ordinance, special act of the legislature, or resolution adopted by a special fire control district from 2 years up to 4 years.
Support legislation to eliminate the current investment restrictions and to allow 175 plans the same investment opportunities as the FRS system.
Support an amendment to Section 175.101, F.S. which would authorize a municipal Fire Department which provides protection services to other local units of government, consolidated government of areas of unincorporation of a county through a contract, agreement or other instruments of intent shall receive the premium tax as provided in Chapter 175, F.S. providing it does not jeopardize any benefits currently received by members of the FPF.
Support legislation that will allow municipalities that provide fire service in other municipalities (which are not receiving 175 insurance premium taxes) to receive Chapter 175 insurance premium tax from the municipality that they provide service to.
Introduce legislation to charge a set surcharge on all property and casualty insurance tax premiums being collected in order to adequately fund the educational incentive program. Such surcharge shall be set high enough that educational incentive funds can be increased. The FPF shall submit legislation until monthly educational incentive benefits are increased to the level of $125.00 for an Associate degree, $200.00 for a Bachelors degree, and $300.00 for a Masters degree. These funds should be increased each year in accordance with a cost of living adjustment. The money for these increased benefits should be identified from a source that does not take away money from Chapter 175 plans.
18.9.1 Support, endorse and promote NFPA 1710. Seek to introduce legislation that will adopt NFPA 1710 throughout the State of Florida.
18.9.2 Support legislation to mandate a minimum level of Fire/Rescue protection for Sea Ports throughout the State of Florida.
18.10.4 Make Invasive Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus a presumptive category under State Law, and family members who acquire this pathogen, be afforded the same medical coverage afforded the member employee under the State Workers Compensation Law, and any legislation drafted, be known as the John (Rusty) Homolka MRSA BILL.
18.11.1 It shall be a goal of this organization to draft legislation and coordinate the lobbying effort to secure the following considerations of the appropriate sections of Florida Statutes during the Legislative Session:

The AccuSculpt procedure starts with a physician consultation to outline the areas of concern and discuss expected results. After a small amount of local anesthesia numbs the treatment areas, your physician will make very small incisions at the edge of each treatment area. He or she will then treat the areas with the AccuSculpt laser contouring system to liquefy controlled amounts of fat. Once all treatment areas have been addressed and the fat has been removed, the entry incisions are closed with a small suture.
I'm pretty new to gyms, and well still slightly scared by the whole thing. But this place had a pretty relaxed and friendly atmosphere and the staff are really nice. There is a great selection of equipment and a lot of each machine, so even at the busiest of times you're pretty much sure to get on what you want to use. Being open 24hrs is great too as it makes avoiding the busiest times pretty easy. The price is excellent too, £17.99 per month at the moment. The only drawback is, with being the but cheaper there aren't paper towel machines about to wipe down machines after use, and for a pretty big gym it only has 1 drinking fountain and so queues can be a bit annoying when youre a knackered and parched it feels like hours!
Signs of a sharp instructor: Instructors should tell you to use moderately heavy weights so that you don’t do more than 15 reps per set. Watch out for instructors who do dozens of repetitions with light weights: You’re not going to build much strength or tone that way. The instructor should correct your form and remind you where you should feel the exercise. Watch for a warm-up and cooldown, too.

I previously started in the Newtownabbey branch but it had just opened and was very busy. I much prefer the St.Annes Square branch, big open gym, lots of machines and trainers floating about if you need any help. The classes are a bit daunting, not really a great confidence booster for a first timer in the class, but if you are happy to just go in and get on with it. Don't expect much help from the trainer in there they're just barking out orders. There is a large volume of different types so plenty to choose from. I recommend downloading the app and booking in advance as the popular classes tend to book up. Cheap pay as you go contract, and clean facilities, the only down side it the posers that go in full makeup and pretend to workout, taking up the machines!

PureGym was launched in 2009 and pioneered the model for affordable, flexible, high-quality fitness clubs in the UK. Members pay monthly and have no contract commitment. Most of its gyms are open 24 hours a day across the UK and offer a full range of top of the line equipment including cardiovascular equipment, fixed-resistance and free weights. Each gym typically offers over 220 pieces of fitness equipment and up to 80 group exercise classes each week delivered by around 2,200 personal trainers. In November 2017, affiliates of Leonard Green & Partners, L.P. acquired a controlling interest in the business. The business has appeared 4 times on the Sunday Times Fast Track Top 100 list, won awards as the overall Fast Track Brand of the Year in 2017 and the Fast Track Outstanding Achievement Award in 2018, and was a winner of the Virgin Media Disruptor Award in 2016.
Incisions are hidden in natural folds or stretch marks. During the procedure, the patient is awake and comfortable. After the procedure is finished, the incisions are closed and a surgical garment or binder is recommended to provide support. It is usually worn for about 3 weeks, which is how long full recovery will take. Most patients are able to go back to a desk job in 2-3 days.
Other factors that can affect the treatment include your budget. Some treatments are more expensive than others. Body sculpting treatments without surgery is much more cost effective than traditional surgeries. Your skin condition will also effect how the treatment is conducted. If you have skin allergies, the treatment method will vary accordingly. Your doctor’s recommendation will be a crucial factor on how the treatment sessions are carried out.

What was once a friendly and organised gym has turned into a miserable experience since pure gym took over from soho gym in Lewisham. They released nearly all the instructors, some of whom had been working there for 20+ years and had built up a loyal clientele. No notice, no suitable replacements and now most classes are taken by PTs who have had little or no training. It's a joke and dangerous to train with instructors who do not appear to be qualified to teach group classes. The entire atmosphere has changed and loyal gym members have left in their droves. The low prices are not an incentive to stay. I'd rather pay more and have the excellent Les Mills classes taught by proper Les Mills instuctors thanks... just as they were before.

JKSRTC has come a long way since its revival a few years back. It is easy to look over the past few years with a great deal of satisfaction at what we at JKSRTC have achieved. But looking back should not be our style. Yes, we shall look back – to do a self-introspection, to check out our strengths and build on them for the exciting journey that lies ahead.
The room seems far bigger inside than outside, even when full of relaxing weyrfolk and travelers. Towards the front, in the western corner, is a small stage, providing the intoxicated or just plain brave a chance to display their talents. Several tables with chairs decorate the floor and a small area is open for dancing. The bar is rather long and well stocked, glasses of different shapes and sizes hanging suspended from a rack above the bar. Behind the bar is another open window that gives one a view of the forest behind the tavern. Turning around, one is greeted by a lovely view of the lagoon. A decent breeze helps to cool the room. Up above, rafters provide a perch for fire lizards and local avians. The thatch roof, made of straw, rarely lets in any rain.
There is a table in this Tiki Bar. Well, there /are/ other tables. But there is one specific table with a specific person who has a specific drink. YES! THERE IS! It is evening - most of the Weyr residents had dinner in the past few hours, and have made their way to do their various nightly activities. Rhadan, that specific person, has just sat down at a table (that specific table) which is in a corner of the room, near a window. Summer is coming to an end… but, well, that means little here at Western. The night is a little cooler than it was the past months, but not much. There is a red drink that Rhadan sets on the table in front of him as he sits, and his eyes can the trash left on the table by the previous occupants. Nope, not going to clean it! That red drink is in a tall glass - and right now, Rhadan is sipping it. It is not his normal alcoholic beverage. Nope, not for a candidate! But… it still has /something/ in it. Just less. His hair is a darker brown than normal, due to its dampness, and the teen idly brushes some strands from his forehead as he sets his glass down on the table. And siiiiigh.
Jeyinshi has been sporting her wetsuit less and less lately, but it seems that this evening is an exception. The dolphineer arrives fresh from a swim, brownish-red locks soaked and sticking to her face and a towel wrapped around her waist. At least it looks like she's dried enough not to be dripping anywhere. The only slightly off thing about Jey? She's got a pair of baby blue high heels on her feet. Not exactly beach wear, but she likes them. The dolphineer click clacks her way into the lounger, brown eyes lighting on the vaguely familiar of a fellow candidate. "That was a pretty long sigh….mind if I invade your table?" The corner of Jey's mouth moves up in a lopsided grin, and while she does put her hand on the back of an empty chair, she won't sit unless she gets an okay!
Sundari peeks into the room before she makes her way on inside, not all that far after Jeyinshi it would seem. There is a smile seen and she waves towards the pair and is making a bee-line that way. It can be a candidate table now, right? Well maybe! "Hey guys. Mind another?" This is questioned with a hopeful tone. Strider is perched upon her shoulder, the little brown looking rather sleepy though.
Well! Finally, someone with some manners! Rhadan's eyes had only begun traveling their way around the lounge after his sigh. Jeyinshi was already there at the table. Well - at a chair. /And/ she was asking to sit! Rhadan eyes turn to his fellow candidate and there is a moment where his face is almost blank and his head tilts /just/ slightly. Then he is yawning as he nods his head and a hand waves for her to take a seat. Once the yawn is finished verbal permission is given as well, "Yes, yes - please!" He pauses as his hand pats his mouth. "Sorry. Little tired, is all." And there! Sundari is waving at them, and Rhadan catches it from the corner of his eye and he waves to her as she approaches. His eyes turn to Jeyinshi again before Sundari's arrival, "I don't know if I've actually introduced myself yet. I'm Rhadan." And there is Sundari! "Please! If we don't stick together, us candidates, someone'll come over and try to give us more to do!" Yes! Candidate table! White knots only!
Jey's attention is caught by Sundari's arrival and she waves over to the other girl, "Hey Sundari! You all done for the day too?" The dolphineer smiles before shifting the same expression over to Rhadan. "Thanks!" It doesn't take very long for the dolphineer to slip into a seat. She doesn't have the energy to really sit up though and ends up kind of sliding down and slouching. Though as introductions begin, Jey /does/ sit up fairly straight. See? Manners. Sort of. "The name's Jeyinshi, but you can just stick to Jey." She offers a hand to her fellow candidate along with her words. "You're…a hunter? I forgot who mentioned that, either Iolain or Sundari." For confirmation, she'll look to Sunny!
"Yup! And thankful for it. Don't think I have ever seen so many dirty undies I rather not see anymore." Sundari had laundry duty it seems. At the talk of it being ok that she takes over a seat she grins to Rhadan and nods while settling upon a chair. "Thanks." Is offered a few moments after Jey. "That is so true; we can totally hide in numbers… Or something along those lines." Sure, it'll work out fine. A glance is sent to Jey and she ahs softly, thinking. "I don't remember actually." Well a lot has happened lately in her life so she may have forgot a few things here and there.
They are all candidates and sleep in the same dorm, afterall - so they have passed each other before. Rhadan remembers seeing Jey. But… well, he never told her he was a hunter, that is for sure. So when Jey makes mention of that fact and looks to Sundari, Rhadan does likewise. Ahhh! Not remembering! Rhadan shrugs and lift his glass to his lips, taking a drink before he speaks, "No matter who told, I guess. It is true. I work - worked, I guess? - as a hunter here. Apprentice. Stuff to like… stuff to hate about it. You know." And now he is drinking more. "Are you two going to get a drink? We can't get drunk. There a good drinks here without alcohol, though. And a little is okay, I think." The drink is back on the table now, a third of it gone. "And I had a free day today… but I still kept busy." He was yawning, ya know?
Jeyinshi makes a face at the mention of dirty undies. "Ugh. That and stables are the worst…I'll just stick to dolphins. They're nice. And clean." The woman shudders before leaning back into her chair. There's a tiny shrug when no one can really seem to remember who mentioned what. She's not so clear on it herself after all. "That's pretty cool, I've been once or twice…never really got the hang of it. But speaking of drinks…" Her stomach rumbles audibly, VERY audibly, causing the dolphineer to pat it a few times and then proceed to flag down a waiter. Her order? Two burgers and a glass of redfruit juice. And the waiter dude will raise both eyebrows , but will also stick around in case there are any more food or drink requests!
The waiter receives only a shake of Rhadan's head. Nope, the teen boy needs not! "Well, we do more than hunt game." Rhadan is now leaning with one elbow propped on the table in front of him, chin in his hand, "Tunnel snakes. Wild felines. Other stuff that people would run into. We keep them in check. Though, here on the island it isn't too bad." Less area to hunt, and less wild life - excluding the fish. His smile is directed at Sundari now, though he does allow some tire to show through the smile, "Ye-yeah, I guess. Not bad. Got a lot of time to work out, and run some errands for the hunter journeyman." The hitch is the 'yeah' was brief. It was a day off that could have been better for the teen, but he wouldn't say /that/. And now to Jey one more time. "You work with dolphins, then?" Wet suit didn't give it away, Rhadan? Excuse him, he can be slow.
"I /hate/ mucking stables…but ah well, can't do anything about that." Jey says with a small shrug and grin. The waiter shoots Sundari a grin before disappearing to go and fetch the orders. It doesn't take him very long to return. A glass of cider is immediately slid Sunny's way while the juice and both burgers dropped off in front of Jeyinshi. The dolphineer bobs her head in thanks before immediately digging in. It doesn't take her very long for to finish half of one, and it's only afterwords that Jey puts it down to jump back into the conversation again. "Then I guess I know who to find if I've ever got a tunnelsnake problem." Jey smiles before taking a sip of her juice and nodding. "Mhm, dolphineer by trade, like the rest of my family. Sometimes I think we're all half-fish." Her last words are said in a complete dead-pan. Joke? Perhaps. Her eyes seem to be laughing if not her mouth!
Sundari ohs as she peers curiously at Rhadan, pondering the 'yeah' but doesn't press the matter it seems. "So, have you seen a feline? I've seen their pelts an all, but never actually seen a live one." There is a pause while she takes the waiter and then looks back to Rhadan. "Are they all feral wild as everyone says they are?" She is a curious that that is for sure. A glance is sent to Jey and she nods with a smile about the comment of things running in the family. "Sort of like me and my family. Just.. with the boats and fishing and so forth."
Rhadan is out of place, slightly. He is at a table with two women who both are from families that have deep roots in the sea. Rhadan, "I actually have no sea legs. I get sick anytime I'm on a boat." His smile is only half there, his mind recalling the bad memory of one of those trips on a ship. Ohhhh…. yeah, that was no fun at all. "I can't imagine doing anything at sea." He's be horrible at it. Really. His is sipping his drink again, hand coming out from under his chin to take the glass up. He replies to Sundari about the felines, "There are feral ones. Some can be tamed, but those are small. The bigger feral ones are in the South. They aren't great in the cold." He pauses for a moment, thinking before he speaks, "They get big. I was down there and got caught up with one, once. She… well, she almost got me. Was a few turns ago." He pauses as he sips of his drink. "She chased me up a tree, actually. They climb well, you know? I have a huge scar on my leg now." Huge. And sip.
Jeyinshi grins over at Sundari, "Any of your family around here? Sungie might try and suck up to them for some easy fish. Though that's just him being silly…and lazy." The dolphineer picks up her burger again, quickly polishing off the first one and setting the plate aside. One down and one to go! The question is, how long will this one last? While she was nomming though, Jey was keeping her ears pricked to the conversation. "You good with swimming though? Or maybe surfing…that's fun. Being out in the middle of open water isn't for everyone. Just like hunting felines isn't for me." She runs her finger along the rim of her glass before letting out a soft whistle, "You got chased up a tree? That must have been a heck of a day…but hey, scars are cool?"
Sundari grins as she hears Jey and nods. "They come by the Weyr a lot actually. They are out at sea at the moment though but my family always gives dolphins fish whenever they come around the boat. My father says it's good luck and all." A glance is sent to Rhadan at the talk of the feline attacking him and she blinks a few times. "Woah.. I bet that was not a good experience." She rubs at her left hand a moment. "I once got a hook set through my hand before. Hurt like the dickens."
Rhadan gives a shrug after his story, along with a light smile. He doesn't tell it much - no reason to, really, most of the time. "It was a bad day… but, I survived, she didn't. That's what matters." And look! There is a necklace being pulled out from around his neck to be shown off. There is a rather large tooth on it, too. Couple of inches, at least. It is yellowed around - he has never seen fit to bleach it clean. "This is one of her teeth." Another shrug is give before he replaces the necklace under his shirt. "I never would want a hook in my skin. Ow." Like… hand, too? That must have hurt! "I can swim. It is good for the body, so it is part of my working out. Not much for surfing, though. Never really saw a point in it." And his drink is now to its last quarter, with all that he has been sipping between his speaking.
Jeyinshi laughs, "I'm sure Sungie will tkae it upon himself to become your dad's personal sea escort or something if there will be fish." The expression fades into another wince at the talk of getting hooked by the hand. "I…can't even imgaine how painful that must have been. The feline either." The dolphineer doesn't have any big scars to speak of. At least, not physically. Mentally…well, she's mostly sane! The dolphineer leans forward a bit to peek at the tooth necklace that Rhadan pulls out. "Impressive! You're good. Seriously…if I've got tunnelsnake or feline problems, you'll be hearing about them. And as for the surfing…it's just for fun. At least for me." Jey grins and shrugs before starting on her other burger. "Especially when the dolphins swim through the wave. It's kind of funny actually."
Sundari lifts her hand showing off the scar within her palm that is a strange shape and also about the size of a dime. Needless to say it hurt. "My father had to cut one end of the hook and then yank the other bit out. It was not a fun time." She is lucky that it didn't hit anything majorly and she still has use of her hand. She eyes the tooth, a soft ah escapes her and she nods. "Did she bite you with it?" A glance is sent to Jey and she grins before nodding. "My dad would love to have him around. Keeps bigger things away after all." She's seen some crazy things when out on the boat.
Rhadan is now leaning back in his seat, his eyes traveling from Jey to Sundari briefly before his eyes close and he breaths in deeply. Then he is leaning forward and taking up is glass again, speaking before he drinks, "She didn't bite, no. They attack with their claws - cripple their prey first, and then finish them off when they can't fight back." He drink in some of his remaining drink, "And it wasn't good, really. Lucky. There was a firelizard who helped me." He smiles briefly now before finishing the remainder of his drink. He stand then, "I'll be right back. Gonna get some more. Anyone need anything?" And he'll wait for them to reply before walking to the bar.
Jeyinshi is unfortunately imagining everything that Sundari's saying about the hook, resulting in scrunched up features. "I'm just glad that you can still use your hand…not that it's impossible to go without, but…well, you know." She ends witha tiny grin before nodding, "Tch, bigger things…and nasty too. If he does want anything like that, just let me know. I'm not on official S&R duty, but I can talk to Sungie about it." Her gaze drifts over towards Rhadan then, and she tilts her head slightly. "Well…I'll send my ethereal thanks to that flizzard. You're a cool guy to hang out with." There's a grin, but the question of needing anything else gets a quick, "Nope." Jey will just finish off that second burger she's got!
Sundari makes a face as she hears Jey. "Ya.. I'm too." She would be where she is at the moment if she couldn't use her hand after all! She glances to Rhadan and nods, pondering this before glancing towards her dozing firelizard and smiles. "They are useful for some things, for sure." A shake of her head is seen. "Nope I'm good, thanks though."
Off the the bar we go! Off to the bar we go… Rhadan give a nod and smile to both Sundari and Jeyinshi before he says, "Okay then." His feet walk and his hips move from side to side as he moves his way towards the bar, sliding around and dodging people as he goes. He gives off an, "Oh, sorry!" as he bumps into the chair at one of the tables he passes, the forgiving patron of the lounge nodding a forgiveness to the young man. Rhadan shrugs a bit before he finishes his trip to the bar, and his drink is set down. The bar tender, though, is busy. And Rhad? Well, he is going to wait a little. LITTLE.
Jeyinshi grins, "I've got one little green, Mizu. She's a doll…not particularly good for running errands or anything, but it's fun to have her around." Her gaze wanders briefly over to Rhadan before moving back to Sundari. "You should see it when Sungie's got free time and they're both playing together…I've gotten in trouble with the Istan guard once or twice because they kept spraying the ones on duty with water…"
Sundari nods to Rhadan and smiles before she looks back to Jey with a soft oh. "Really? That much be fun to see how they play and all." She ponders a moment. "Would it be possible if I could maybe meet Sungie sometime? I've never gotten to actually meet one before. I'm sore of interested to some degree." There is a pause and she grins. "That and I would love to tell my older brothers that I got to met one and they didn't."
Jeyinshi smiles widely, "Of course! He loves meeting new people…and since you're a sea-type this probably won't be an issue, but don't wear any nice clothes or anything. There usually isn't any risk of fish being thrown or dropped on anyone…water though? Tons." The dolphineer finishes off the rest of her burger before stacking one plate on top of the other and bringing her glass of juice closer. "The youngest ones should /always/ have something to lord over the elder siblings."
Sundari grins at this and nods. "Great!" There is a pause and she chuckles and nods. "No problems there. I'll wear my boat clothes and all." This said with an amused tone at the idea. There is a nod seen as she takes another sip from her glass. "That is how I feel about it as well. Have to have /something/ that they don't to talk about and hold over them."
Jeyinshi laughs, "Exactly! When I was four it was fine…now it feels like I have to hold my own or something. And it's kind of fun to watch them squirm." The dolphineer leans back in her chair and idly crosses her legs. "Then again, it's revenge for all the pain they put me through playing overprotective older siblings."
Sundari grins and nods as she hears Jeyinshi. There is a pause and a soft oy escapes her while she finishes her drink and is soon up onto her feet. "I hate to run but I just remembered I need to finish a few things before lights out tonight. Tell Rhadan I said bye and all." A wave is seen while she turns to flee. "Have a good night Jey!"
How /long/ does a teen candidate have to wait for a drink? Well, for Rhadan it was a while! The bartender had many older and taller customers who came first in his eyes. Rhadan? Well, even /when/ he is approached, the drink is hard enough to get. "Ya know, this is the last one that I think you'll have tonight. Be careful. No getting drunk, remember. This one will be weaker than the last." Rhadan's eyes are rolling at the bartender then, and he head nods, "Yep. I know. Don't worry." And there is payment on the bar once the drink is refilled, and the drink is in Rhad's hand and he is making his way back to the table, dodging through people. Once back his drink is set down and a frowns for a moment, eyes on the empty seat, "Sundari left?" Awww! And the teen is sitting.
"Bye! See you in barracks!" Jey calls over to Sundari before leaning back in her chair. She stifles a yawn and rubs at her eyes a bit, but doesn't budge much until Rhadan returns. "Yeah, she had some things to finish up before heading to bed. That drink was a while in coming, they give you a hard time or something?"
There is a moment where Rhadan doesn't reply. He can't, you see, because he is drinking that drink. Yum! He gives off a light 'ahhh' once the drink glass is sat down on the table. He gives a nod at the question, his eyes darting to the bar briefly before he speaks, "Yeah. Its normal, though. The bartender keeps reminding me of the drunk rule. I understand it. I do. I won't get drunk." there is a pause, "It doesn't help that I'm younger. Harder to get people to see me, I guess." There is a shrug then. "Where are you from, again? I don't recall. I'm from here." Born and bred weyrbrat, mostly.
Jeyinshi shoots the boy a sympathetic smile, "And the white knot makes sure we're scrutinized all the time. But it's worth it in the end." She gives a tiny shrug before draining the rest of her juice. "Rubiconii by birth, stayed up there with the family and hall. Then came down here to Western…then went over to Fort Sea Hold…then Eastern….and then Ista….and now I'm back here for a bit." The dolphineer chuckles as she lists all the moving. "Shards, guess I've been around a lot of Pern."
"Yeah, I'll say!" Rhadan's expression got more and more surprised with each addition to the list of places Jey had moved to. He shakes his head when she is finished, "I can't /imagine/ living in that many places. I was born here. Live here. I've only ever been off the islands a few times - mostly for working and training." Western is a good island to stay on. Rhadan likes it! "Why did you guys move so much? Dolphincraft kept sending you to different places?"
Jeyinshi chuckles, "The move to Western was…well, there were some things I wanted to leave behind at the Hall. The move from Western to Fort Sea was me chasing after a gent…and then to Eastern was when all of that didn't work out. After that, the Dolphincraft moved me because they had some vacancies down at Ista. It's been an interesting sort of life." The dolphineer smirks before stifling another yawn and stretching. "I should probably go wash the sea salt out of my hair before I head to bed. See you in the barracks?" As she speaks, the dolphineer stands and gives her fellow candidate a wave. Don't want the barracks smelling like the ocean? Not that /she/ would mind.
Rhadan gives the other candidate as she stands, "That sounds like quote a life. And yeah, I'll see you there. I'm just going to finish my drink and head over, I think." He has already washed, himself. A smiles to her before raising his glass to drink from it. Yum!
I just found this artical online it goes hand and with the theory and belief of the Administration of this group. But keep this in mind as you read this that I believe that if you see an orb with your naked eye and not thru a view finder on a camera than it is an actual spirit orb and not dust or a bug .There are those rare occassions that yes you will get a real spirit orb in a picture .But these however need to be analized very carefull . Here is the artical enjoy :
There is a huge debate amongst the skeptics and the paranormal enthusiast. Can orbs be caught on camera or are orbs actually ghosts. There has been proof that orbs that show on pictures can be nothing more than dust, air borne pollen, or bugs.
The invention of the digital camera have really introduced this into the forefront. The flash has been found to have a reaction to dust, air borne pollen and even bugs. When the picture is analyzed they appear on the picture as orbs.
This has cause some real intense skepticism toward orb pictures, so much so, many large based and experience ghost hunting websites have now forbidden the submission of orb pictures. These website are looking for creditability in the paranormal realm, and if they chose to back these types of photos, their creditability is in danger.
I too understand that backing this type of evidence can be extremely hard, because there are now some many know tangibles that are associated when evaluating a orb picture. With this said, there are actual orb pictures out there, but finding and identifying a true orb picture is harder than ever.
Even though orbs are real, it is too tough to actual identify a true orb. Some believe that a true orb is one that gives off it's own energy, and will show as a large extreme ball of light, not the usual dim version of the dust orbs we come to know.
Some also believe that real orbs will have off color, such as bright orange, or reddish in color. Some believe true orbs will show on pictures with tails or trails attached to them. Some have also have reported of seeing an orb with there own eyes and not with a picture, now this can't be dust.
All of this leaves the question. How are any paranormal investigator ever going to prove that orbs are paranormal and orbs are real. This is a question I can't wait to see the answer. I do expect with the current growth of technology, at some point investigators will have some type of photo equipment, aside from night vision camera's, to give us the proof.

Registration for these teams will close on 1/31/19. Why do we do this? HYLA has to register their teams with the league in the beginning of January. If we do not have an accurate count of players and more register, we will end up registering too few teams, which means larger teams and less lacrosse for all the players that registered on time.

Started scouting out the Deerfield river. Ive been reading up on places to fish along the river and on recent trips out east I drove around and stopped a couple places. Found this map at one location. It was the most helpful thing Ive found so far. Shows me catch-and-release areas and picnic spots. Also shows rougher water.

Presidential elections, particularly the one that just mercifully ended, can drum up pointed opinions from all sides of the political spectrum.
Anton Media Group prides itself on reporting the facts in a straightforward manner, without any bias. However, on this page, the editorial page, we are free to expose our opinions in well-thought out and deliberately written pieces. Last week, we published an editorial by staff member Joe Catrone (“Divided We Stand, Divided We Fall”) that we felt perfectly encapsulated the hindsight of post-election ruminations. In the article, Catrone included many insights as to why Hillary Clinton lost the election to political newcomer Donald Trump.
While we expect criticisms from readers who chose to vote for Trump, we feel compelled to explain what exactly an “editorial” is and why it is appropriate for a newspaper to publish. The editorial page serves as a place for newspaper staff and local residents to express their opinions on hot-button issues that divide a community.
Yes, we published a strong opinion last week that can be viewed as anti-Trump. However, the pendulum swings both ways. In the weeks running up to the election, we published numerous letters from residents that were in support of the Republican candidate. And in the weeks ahead, we expect to publish more opinions from both sides of the argument.
America is full of opposing views. Anyone who holds a belief should be ready to defend their convictions against criticism and scrutiny, otherwise why have beliefs at all? We cannot exist in an echo chamber. When you hear an opinion that is contrary to your own, it should be accepted and digested. Then, if you wish to respond with your own viewpoint, do so with grace and intelligence.
Political discourse in an open forum is one of the tenets of this country. It is one characteristic of America that does not need to be made great again.
The Lighthouse Waterfront Café—formerly The Boathouse Waterside Café—has undergone big changes in the past couple of months and is now operating under a new name and new ownership. Brothers Jerry and Mark Murray, originally of Glen Cove, bought the restaurant in the spring and overhauled the staff, menu and facade to bring high quality fare to boaters and locals alike.
“We want this to be a place where fishermen and stockbrokers can belly up side by side and have a good meal,” said Mark.
“We looked to improve the food significantly and we’ve done a whole facelift on the place,” said Jerry, who was a regular customer of The Boathouse and jumped at the opportunity to take it over when he heard it was available.
A ribbon cutting ceremony was held for the Lighthouse Waterfront Cafe on Friday, June 26 (Photos by Jill Nossa)
“We’ve never done this before, but it’s in our family, it’s in our blood,” said Mark. “We’re very aware of the high failure rate of these things, but we’re coming into it very seriously.”
The family tradition of fine dining is strong among the Murray family, who owned Lauraine Murphy Restaurant in Manhasset, The George Washington Manor in Roslyn and The Milleridge Inn of Jericho. The desserts for the new cafe are supplied by the Milleridge Inn bakery.
Jerry, who lives in Roslyn Harbor and is currently a prevailing wage investigator for New York State, worked in a restaurant in Cozumel where he learned classic French and Mexican cuisine and said he looks to incorporate his experience in the new restaurant. Though Mark noted the bulk of their personal restaurant experience comes from a consumer’s standpoint.
“Our expertise comes in the consumption of fine food and liquor,” Mark said, an attorney with general practice in Suffolk County. “We set it up as the kind of place that we would like to hang out and our friends would like to hang out.”
In addition to enjoying quality food, the brothers are both boaters and have high praise for the Brewer Yacht Yard, which supplies the restaurant with six guest slips. Plus, they both believe in the revitalization of Glen Cove’s waterfront and are excited to be a part of that.
“If we can keep the standards of quality exemplified by our neighbors, Brewers Marina, we will be extremely happy,” said Jerry.
“Most people who own waterfront restaurants want a top shelf place where they can charge top dollar, and that’s not us,” said Mark. “We want it to appeal to casual diners.”
Both men are big on supporting community events and not-for-profits and hope to make their restaurant a “hub” for charitable events.
Todd Janelli is staying on as manager of the restaurant, a person who both brothers stressed as being a “key part” of the restaurant’s operation. Janelli, of Sea Cliff, joined the restaurant last year.
“We’re very proud of our service and our product,” said Janelli. “We wish more locals would come see us. We may be located within Brewer’s Marina, with a fence around it, but we are open to the public.”
Also on staff is Chef Daniel Echeverria of Glen Cove, who has had 20 years of experience in the kitchen, including venues like Costello’s, JD Gates and Gallaghers. The menu includes lobster and clambake specials, classic casual fare and lighter fare, including gluten-free and dairy-free.
With an outdoor bar and tables that can seat a total of 48, it’s a great place to sit outdoors; one of the few waterfront dining venues in the area. They’ve installed misting fans to keep customers cool and fire pits to keep them warm on chilly nights.
They will have live music every Friday night and a jazz quartet for Sunday brunch and anticipate keeping the restaurant open year-round. And with Shore Thing Rentals next door, people can spend the day out on the water and then come in for a meal.
“It’s a dream come true for me,” said Jerry. “I feel like the customers are a guest in my house and I am not going to disappoint them.”
Went for the first time today for brunch at 1pm. Was told there was going to be a party at 2pm, but we could eat until then. Cobb salad was served without the dressing. When I asked if I could have a roll, the server looked at me like I had three heads, and said if I needed bread, they could toast a piece of white bread. Sent sale back to have it tossed in dressing and add some blue cheese (as there was only a pich on it). I think the owner should care about all is customers, not just those investing in a party. Could take some lessons from Tavern on the Plaza, in Locust Valley. He Cobb salad has added chicken, for less money, and comes with a basket of rolls and bread.
When David Armstrong's wife Damita was being cared for by Mercy Hospice Auckland, he never dreamt one day he would end up being employed by them.
"has been a big part of my life for a long time now. They supported both of us through what was an incredibly hard time and cared for Damita in such an amazing way. I'm not sure I can ever thank them enough." David stayed in touch with Hospice after Damita died in September 2009 aged 44, popping in to take part in the Open Doors Programme, as he had done so many times with Damita.
"Open Doors is for patients and their support people and all sorts of activities are arranged from pampering to art. I found it immensely helpful to meet and talk with other carers facing a similar situation. I could just be myself because they too understood what I was going through." David says the counselling Mercy Hospice Auckland offers also assists him to live every moment.
"Kiwi blokes aren't great at sharing how we feel but I'm a huge advocate for the counselling, it's helped me immensely." David says when he got the job working at the Mercy Hospice Auckland shop in Ellerslie, heading up the furniture division, he was thrilled.
"I'd given up my job to care for Damita. The opportunity was timely for me to return to the work force. While I'm employed I do feel it's a way for me to give back and thank Hospice by doing the best job I possibly can. I regularly add value to donated goods, ensuring we can get the best possible price when they're sold."
The shop is a hive of activity as more people become aware of the quality of goods they have on offer.
"We're always busy so thankfully I've got a great team of volunteers as we are open Monday to Saturday 10am-4pm."
Please note: David says he's always in need of good quality furniture and electronic goods. There is a delivery van to collect items from people's homes if necessary, please call on 579 1208 if you can help.
Mercy Hospice Auckland opened its newest shop in January at Mt Roskill's bustling retail centre at 22 Stoddard Road (just along from the Coffee Club and next to the soon to be opened ASB) on Monday 16th January. » Read more

Simran has left for India to be married to her childhood fiancé. Raj leaves for India with a mission at his hands, to claim his lady love under the noses of her whole family. Thus begins a saga.
The Good Lives Model (GLM) is a framework of offender rehabilitation which, given its holistic nature, addresses the limitations of the traditional risk management approach. The GLM has been adopted as a grounding theoretical framework by several sex offender treatment programmes internationally and is now being applied successfully in a case management setting for offenders.
The GLM is a strengths-based approach to offender rehabilitation, and is therefore premised on the idea that we need to build capabilities and strengths in people, in order to reduce their risk of reoffending. According to the GLM, people offend because they are attempting to secure some kind of valued outcome in their life. As such, offending is essentially the product of a desire for something that is inherently human and normal. Unfortunately, the desire or goal manifests itself in harmful and antisocial behaviours, due to a range of deficits and weaknesses within the offender and his/her environment. Essentially, these deficits prevent the offender from securing his desired ends in pro-social and sustainable ways, thus requiring that s/he resort to inappropriate and damaging means, that is, offending behaviour.
Intervention should be viewed as an activity that should add to an individual’s repertoire of personal functioning, rather than an activity that simply removes a problem, or is devoted to managing problems, as if a lifetime of restricting one’s activity is the only way to avoid offending.
The following text provides a description of the GLM key theoretical components and conceptual underpinnings. For a detailed understanding of the model, please consult published references or contact the relevant person from the profiles page.
The GLM is a strength-based rehabilitation framework that is responsive to offenders’ particular interests, abilities, and aspirations. It also directs practitioners to explicitly construct intervention plans that help offenders acquire the capabilities to achieve things and outcomes that are personally meaningful to them. It assumes that all individuals have similar aspirations and needs and that one of the primary responsibilities of parents, teachers, and the broader community is to help each of us acquire the tools required to make our own way in the world. Criminal behaviour results when individuals lack the internal and external resources necessary to satisfy their values using pro-social means. In other words, criminal behaviour represents a maladaptive attempt to meet life values (Ward and Stewart, 2003). Rehabilitation endeavours should therefore equip offenders with the knowledge, skills, opportunities, and resources necessary to satisfy their life values in ways that don’t harm others. Inherent in its focus on an offender’s life values, the GLM places a strong emphasis on offender agency. That is, offenders, like the rest of us, actively seek to satisfy their life values through whatever means available to them. The GLM’s dual attention to an offender’s internal values and life priorities and external factors such as resources and opportunities give it practical utility in desistance-oriented interventions.
The GLM is a theory of offender rehabilitation that contains three hierarchical sets of conceptual underpinnings: general ideas concerning the aims of rehabilitation, aetiological underpinnings that account for the onset and maintenance of offending, and practical implications arising from the rehabilitation aims and aetiological positioning.
The GLM is grounded in the ethical concept of human dignity (see Ward and Syversen, 2009) and universal human rights, and as such it has a strong emphasis on human agency. That is, the GLM is concerned with individuals’ ability to formulate and select goals, construct plans, and to act freely in the implementation of these plans. A closely related assumption is the basic premise that offenders, like all humans, value certain states of mind, personal characteristics, and experiences, which are defined in the GLM as primary goods. Following an extensive review of psychological, social, biological, and anthropological research, Ward and colleagues (e.g., Ward and Brown 2004; Ward and Marshall 2004) first proposed nine classes of primary goods. Empirical research performed by Purvis in 2006 (published in 2010) tested these aetiological assumptions and actually found that relatedness and community required separation, as did excellence in play and excellence in work, thus producing eleven classes of primary goods. These are now defined as:
Whilst it is assumed that all humans seek out all the primary goods to some degree, the weightings or priorities given to specific primary goods reflect an offender’s values and life priorities. Moreover, the existence of a number of practical identities, based on, for example, family roles (e.g., parent), work (e.g., psychologist), and leisure (e.g., rugby player) mean that an individual might draw on different value sources in different contexts, depending on the normative values underpinning each practical identity.
Instrumental goods, or secondary goods, provide concrete means of securing primary goods and take the form of approach goals (Ward, Vess et al. 2006). For example, completing an apprenticeship might satisfy the primary goods of knowledge and excellence in work, whereas joining an adult sports team or cultural club might satisfy the primary good of community. Such activities are incompatible with dynamic risk factors, meaning that avoidance goals are indirectly targeted through the GLM’s focus on approach goals.
Recent empirical research which tested the original aetiological assumptions of the GLM provided comprehensive support for the model’s aetiological underpinnings (see Purvis, 2010). In testing these assumptions, this research also found that there are actually two primary routes that lead to the onset of offending: direct and indirect. The direct pathway is implicated when an offender actively attempts (often implicitly) to satisfy primary goods through his or her offending behaviour. For example, an individual lacking the competencies to satisfy the good of intimacy with an adult might instead attempt to meet this good through sexual offending against a child. The indirect pathway is implicated when, through the pursuit of one or more goods, something goes awry which creates a ripple or cascading effect leading to the commission of a criminal offence. For example, conflict between the goods of intimacy and autonomy might lead to the break up of a relationship, and subsequent feelings of loneliness and distress. Maladaptive coping strategies such as the use of alcohol to alleviate distress might, in specific circumstances, lead to a loss of control and culminate in sexual offending (Ward, Mann et al., 2007).
The GLM argues that there are four types of difficulties or problems that people can have in the way they are currently living their life (i.e. lifestyle) or the life plan they have mentally constructed. A ‘way of living’ refers to how a person is currently living their life in terms of daily activities, functioning, behaviours, and generally represents a lifestyle that reflects certain individual values and attitudes. A ‘life plan’ refers to how a person plans (either implicitly or explicitly) to live their life, now and in the future. Often, the way a person lives their life can be very different to the way in which they plan (or planned) to live their life. According to Ward (2002a; 2002b; Ward and Fisher, 2005), there are four primary types of problems that can be evident in a person’s way of living or life plan: capacity, scope, means and coherence.
The first problem with ways of living and life plans concerns capacity. There are two types of capacities to consider, internal capacity and external capacity. Internal capacity refers to conditions internal to the individual, such as one’s skill level or ability to secure goods; problems with internal capacity are referred to as internal obstacles. It may be that an individual lacks the internal conditions necessary to secure certain goods, and as such, the enhancement or acquiring of particular skills or internal conditions should be a focus of treatment. For instance, an individual may wish to emphasise the good of excellence in work, however may lack the skills to gain the type of work that he believes will give him the sense of achievement and fulfilment he seeks. Barriers to functioning at one’s full potential (capacity) can occur on several levels, cognitive (the individual lacks knowledge or mental ability), psychological (the individual lacks belief in himself and/or has motivational problems), and behavioural (cognitive or psychological issues result in behavioural problems that limit the individual’s abilities).
External capacity, on the other hand, relates to those conditions or contexts external to the individual (e.g. availability of social supports, employment opportunities, access to education) that are needed to achieve goals and secure goods. Therefore, problems with external capacity are referred to as external obstacles. For example, an individual may want to become an artist (this is the goal, but the good sought may be excellence in work, excellence in play or creativity), however because he lives in an isolated location (external obstacle) there are no courses nearby that he can enrol in. Internal and external obstacles can therefore govern the means used to secure a good. In the above example, the external obstacle of geographical isolation may direct the individual to buy an art book and teach himself. Alternatively, the individual may just resolve to give up and therefore allow the goal and associated goods to go unfulfilled, which may lead to problems in scope.
It should be noted that empirically identified criminogenic needs are conceptualised in the GLM as internal or external obstacles that interfere with the acquisition of primary goods (Ward & Maruna, 2007). That is, internal and external conditions may be viewed as changeable factors that drive offending behaviour (referred to as dynamic risk factors). This means that people who have many internal and external obstacles, and very few strengths, are at greater risk of engaging in problematic behaviours, such as offending. This is because they are unable to utilise skills or strengths to seek out desired goods or outcomes in pro-social ways, thus forcing them to resort to anti-social or maladaptive behaviours. Indeed, as outlined by Ward and Maruna (2007), each of the primary goods can be linked with one or more criminogenic needs. Taking the primary good of agency as an example, impulsivity might obstruct good fulfilment or result in unstable or short-term attainment. Similarly, poor emotional regulation might block the attainment of inner peace or lead the person to resort to less adaptive means, such as alcohol abuse.
The second problem with ways of living and life plans concerns their degree of scope. When a person either fails to strive for or secure (at some level) each of the eleven basic human goods, their life or plan is considered to lack scope. A lack of scope may lead to a neglect of one of the three clusters of goods, either the body, self, or social life. A neglect of one such cluster could lead to either physiological dysfunction, psychological distress leading to mental health problems, or social maladjustment (Ward 2002), all of which will invariably lead to decrease one’s overall life happiness. Problems in scope can simply be caused by a disinterest in some goods; however a lack of scope is usually caused by problems in capacity. For example, a lack of interpersonal skills and a distrust of others are likely to cause problems in securing the good of relatedness and community, and may also create difficulties at work (excellence at work) and reduce engagement in leisure activities involving others (excellence in play), causing a neglect of a cluster of goods. This person’s life would be said to lack scope, which can have negative impacts on psychological functioning and overall happiness.
The third problem concerns the appropriateness of means. Goods can be sought in any number of ways and sometimes, goods can be sought in a way that hinders one’s chances of either securing the good successfully, or receiving the true benefit of the good. For example, an offender may seek the good of relatedness through a sexual relationship with a child. However children, due to their physical and mental immaturity, are unable to respond to adults in a deeply intimate way (Ward 2002). Therefore, due to the inappropriateness of the means by which the offender is seeking this good, it is unlikely that this good will be properly secured and the offender’s needs fulfilled. Contrary to what he might have hoped for, the offender may experience decreased levels of happiness due to his frustrated efforts at achieving certain goods.
The final problem with ways of living and life plans may be the coherence of goods. It is important that in each person’s life, goods are ordered and coherently related to each other. Ward and Stewart (2003) argue that a life that lacks coherence is likely to lead to frustration and harm to the individual concerned, and may also lead to a life lacking in overall sense of purpose and meaning. There are two types of coherence problems; horizontal coherence and vertical coherence. Horizontal coherence refers to the extent to which goods are explicitly related to each other in a mutually consistent and enabling way. Essentially, goods need to complement each other or at least exist harmoniously along side one another, rather than being antagonistic or conflicting. For instance, a person may be committed to securing the primary good of relatedness through a romantic relationship, however may also be committed to securing the good of excellence in agency. Though the two goods may be equally important, they may also conflict due to the type of means used; the individual wants to feel close and secure with someone, but may also behave oppressively and abusively so as to feel autonomous and in control. The problem is that the means used creates conflict between goods sought. This type of conflict between goods is likely to cause relationship problems, the thwarting of the relatedness good, emotional distress, and ultimately, unhappiness. Obviously the problem lies in seeking certain goods in ways that ultimately harm other people, whilst also seeking to be close and connected to people. Conflict between goods can also lead to a lack of scope, and research has found that goal conflict and failure to achieve important personal goals has negative effects on physical well-being (Emmons 1999).
The second form of coherence, vertical coherence, requires hierarchical clarity (i.e. ranking) among goods. Whilst the GLM specifies that all goods should be sought in each person’s life, it does not specify the level of importance assigned to each good. This is an entirely individual process, informed by each person’s preferences, skills, likes and dislikes, social norms, and cultural values. Individuals need to have an understanding of which goods are most important to them and have the most priority in their life, as this should govern what activities the individual engages in on a daily basis. Someone who weights the good of relatedness over excellence in work is going to be relatively unhappy if they actually live their life as a single person who works long hours, seven days per week. It is plausible to argue that a lack of vertical coherence causes people to feel unfulfilled in how they live their life, and leads to a sense of meaninglessness and unhappiness, potentially making people focused on immediate gratification over the fulfilment of long-term life goals (Ward and Stewart 2003).
In sum, there are a variety of problems that may be evident in people’s ways of living and life plans. It should be the aim of rehabilitation to identify what problems exist so that lifestyles and life plans can be altered to suit each offender’s preferences, capabilities, skills, temperament and opportunities. This would then allow the offender to access goods in pro-social ways that are also intrinsically beneficial and meaningful.
To reiterate, the aim of correctional intervention according to the GLM is the promotion of primary goods, or human needs that, once met, enhance psychological well being (Ward and Brown, 2004). In applying the GLM, assessment begins with mapping out an offender’s good lives conceptualisation by identifying the weightings given to the various primary goods. This is achieved through (i) asking increasingly detailed questions about an offender’s core commitments in life and his or her valued day to day activities and experiences, and (ii) identifying the goals and underlying values that were evident in an offender’s offence related actions.
Once an offender’s conceptualisation of what constitutes a good life is understood, future oriented secondary goods aimed at satisfying an offender’s primary goods in socially acceptable ways are formulated collaboratively with the offender and translated into a good lives rehabilitation plan. Treatment is individually tailored to assist an offender implement his or her good lives intervention plan and simultaneously address criminogenic needs that might be blocking goods fulfilment. Accordingly intervention might include building internal capacity and skills and maximising external resources and social supports to satisfy primary human goods in socially acceptable ways.
The GLM has been adopted as a grounding theoretical framework by several sex offender treatment programmes internationally (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli & Ellerby, 2010) and is now being applied successfully in a case management setting for offenders.
The GLM offers a comprehensive, targeted and individually meaningful framework for rehabilitative work with offenders. It should be noted that the GLM is ultimately a framework for healthy human functioning and as such, should be considered as a necessary approach for therapeutic work with any offender or client base. If we are truly serious about not seeing offenders return to the criminal justice system time after time, then we must be holistic in our treatment and case management approach and be committed to equipping offenders to live better, pro-social and personally meaningful lives.

If you (or someone you love) has committed an offence and are working on self improvement, you may be interested in what the GLM says about offending behaviour. As such, this document has been prepared for you, in everyday language. If you are attending a rehabilitation or treatment programme, your therapists may use the GLM in their work and therefore, we encourage you to talk about the GLM with your therapist and support persons. Ultimately, the goal is that you will be able to live a more fulfilling life without hurting yourself or other people.
There are a large number of programmes that have been developed and implemented based on the GLM framework. These programmes provide rehabilitative services to a wide range of forensic populations, including:
It is almost impossible for us to know exactly how many programmes worldwide are using the GLM and as such we cannot provide an exhaustive list. This is emphasised by a recent report by McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli & Ellerby (2010) who found that a significant number of Canadian sex offender treatment programmes identified the GLM as one of their preferred theoretical frameworks. Within the next five years, as more GLM programme evaluations are finalised, we hope to provide at least a list of those GLM programmes that have been meaningfully measured and tested for theoretical adherence and rehabilitative outcomes.
If you would like advice, consultancy or training with regard to particular offender programs, please contact us.
An increasing number of offender rehabilitation programmes utilise the GLM as a guiding theoretical framework, a movement particularly evident in sex offender treatment programmes (McGrath, Cumming, Burchard, Zeoli, & Ellerby, 2010). Empirical research into the effectiveness of GLM based rehabilitation programmes is underway, and preliminary findings have been published. This page provides references to empirical studies and will be updated as additional publications become available.
Leigh Harkins is currently working on a multi-national research project looking at whether responses to treatment differ in terms of the treatment approaches used (e.g., GLM, Relapse Prevention). Response to treatment will be measured in terms of ratings on group process variables, participants’ satisfaction with treatment, facilitator ratings of treatment progress, and recidivism. The results of this study will allow for a comparison of treatment outcomes as a function of different approaches to treatment.
Development of Good Lives Approach evaluation tools and their use in measuring human good fulfilment for adolescents who sexually abuse.
Helen Griffin has published some preliminary results of a GLM evaluation study focused on the development of GLM evaluation tools and their application to therapeutic work with adolescents who sexually abuse. These tools consist of pre/post-treatment scoring manuals and an additional considerations booklet that acts as a guide to clinicians and researchers should they require additional help in scoring the manuals. A description of the development of the evaluation tools and initial findings are to be published in October 2013 in B.

“Sugarcane was introduced to Ko‘olaupoko in 1865, when the Kingdom’s minister of finance and foreign affairs, Charles Coffin Harris, partnered with Queen Kalama to begin a partnership known as the Kāne‘ohe Sugar Company.”
“After Queen Kalama passed away in 1870, Mr. Harris purchased the land from her estate to continue the sugar production, which, by 1880, was yielding as much as 500 tons of sugar annually. At about this time, the He‘eia Agricultural Company (HAC) was also cultivating about 250 acres of sugarcane”.
“To transport the sugar, HAC built a pier in Kāne’ohe Bay (He‘eia Kea pier) so that rail cars could take the sugar out to ocean vessels for transportation to Honolulu harbor.”
“The ocean steamer ‘J.A. Cummins’, owned by John Adams Cummins of the Waimanalo Sugar Plantation Company, made trips twice a week between He‘eia and Honolulu, exporting sugar and returning with supplies and goods.”
“After almost four decades of a thriving sugar industry in Ko‘olaupoko, the tide eventually turned bad and saw the closures of all five sugar plantations by 1903. The closures were due to poor soil, uneven lands, and the start-up of sugar plantations in `Ewa, which were seeing much higher yields.”
“As sugar was on its way out in Ko‘olaupoko, rice crops began to emerge as the next thriving industry. The demand for rice in Hawai‘i increased as the number of Asian sugar workers migrating to the islands from Japan and China increased. In the upland areas of Kāne‘ohe and He‘eia, Chinese farmers converted terraces and abandoned taro patches (lo‘i) to rice paddies.”
“Another agricultural crop, pineapples, emerged throughout Ko‘olaupoko in the early 1900s as sugar and rice steadily declined. From 1901 to 1925 lands in several ahupua`a previously unused for agriculture were now being covered up with pineapple fields, especially the hillsides and upslopes.”
“It was estimated that approximately 2500 acres of land throughout the Ko‘olaupoko region was converted to pineapple cultivation. A pineapple cannery along with numerous old-style plantation houses popped up in 1911, and became known as ‘Libbyville’ (named after its owners, Libby, McNeill, and Libby).”
“The pineapple industry in Ko‘olaupoko did not prosper as well as those on the ‘Ewa plains of central O‘ahu though, and the result was the closure of the cannery in 1923.”
“After the closure of the cannery, the pineapple fields were left to grow over and was then converted to grazing pasture land for cattle.”
“By the mid-1920s, large landholdings were converted to ranch land, such as the Judd Family’s Kualoa Ranch, the McFarlane Family’s Dairy in Ahuimanu, and the ranch lands of the Kāne‘ohe Ranch Company, which was originally a part of 20,000 acres belonging to Queen Kalama.” (History of Ko‘olaupoko)
“Today Ahuimanu is proud of the fact that it has one of the best dairies on Oahu. This dairy is called the Hygienic Dairy and is visited by many people. The dairy was started in 1924 by Mr Young.”
“At that time it was called the Ahuimanu Stock Farm. It was located below its present site. Mr. Young raised cows, pigs and chickens. There were about ninety milking cows in his herd.”
“In 1927 Mr. Young shifted his dairy to the present site. In 1930 he sold it to (Col Charles E) Davis.” (Hawaii Educational Review, 1938)
“Work is being rushed on the new hygienic dairy which the Ahuimanu stock farm is building on its property in windward Oahu. A milk house and a milking barn are under construction.” (Star Bulletin, June 23, 1931)
Apparently, the operation fell under hard economic times and in November 1931, creditors were organizing and bankruptcy was contemplated. In 1932, the dairy property was sold at auction to Shattauer, the former manager.
“Located in the very heart of the picturesque Ahuimanu Valley, a section of Oahu rich in legends and Hawaiian folklore, lies the Hygienic Dairy, one of the most up to date and modern in the territory.”
“Ownership of the dairy was taken over the first of the year by Herman von Holt and GW Knowles, who have been sparing no expense in making constant improvements. The herd now consists of many high grade cows. (Advertiser, February 12, 1934)
“The Hygienic Dairy, Ltd., has acquired 5,000 acres of land at Ahuimanu on a long term lease from the He‘eia Co., according to Herman von Holt, president of the dairy.”
“The estate adjoins 2,000 acres already controlled by the dairy, in addition to 1,000 acres at Kaneohe. The company therefore has 8,000 acres of grazing land for a herd of 1,000 cattle.”
“GW Knowles Is vice president and general manager of the dairy company. The New Fair Dairy Is the distributing agency. (Nippu Jiji, February 12, 1937)
The remaining remnant of the Hygienic Dairy (reportedly once the largest dairy in the state) is the Hygienic Store. “Simon Chong, took over the store from the dairy in 1950”.
“(It) was a full-service gas station and general store, complete with fresh meat and produce, hardware and rubber boots. In the late ’70s, the Chongs leased the store to Millie Kim, who ran it with her son Michael through 2003, when So Cha Hashimoto took over.” (Keany; Honolulu)

It was during Summer’s senior year that she learned about GEM while researching options for her capstone internship. After connecting with GEM founder and director, Debbi Weinberg, Summer became GEM’s first intern.
“I really got to know the program and the girls, and shortly after I started I became a part-time leader while I was still in school,” she says. “When it was time to graduate college, I did not want to leave GEM. I did not want to leave the girls. My dream of starting my own nonprofit organization to help children shifted to staying and continuing to support a program that already existed.”
Devoted to the organization, Summer proposed a new position, program coordinator, and became GEM’s only full-time employee. A decade later, Summer has seen more than 100 girls successfully graduate from high school and pursue college thanks to GEM. “I know they need us, and I know they would not have what they have today without GEM. It feels good to help and make an impact, teaching and guiding them. Most importantly, they know they have someone.”
Over the past 10 years, Summer has seen the girls through happy and very challenging times. “There have been occasions where I’ve just sat at home crying because—through no fault of their own—these girls have been through really horrible things and it’s heartbreaking,” she says. “I’ve wondered many times if I brought her home with me, could that help make her life better.”
Now a mom to a young son, Summer says her GEM experience has positively impacted her approach to parenting. “As a parent, I feel even more for these girls who I consider like my own daughters,” she says. “My heart just explodes when I see them as college students and working women because I know it was all possible because they were in GEM.
Summer maintains the girls’ lives would be vastly different than they are today if it were not for GEM. “There would be no college, no opportunity to see a show or experience staying in a cabin, no ropes course, and no exposure to amazingly influential and inspiring women,” she says. “Every girl should have a pack of women who surround and support them. It’s gravely important for GEM girls, and in order to provide support we need money to do these kinds of activities and expose them to new and different things so they start thinking and believing there is a whole world beyond their home and community.”
If you’re interested in donating your time to speak to GEM girls so they can learn about a new passion, a new career or a new skill they might want to try, sign up to become a speaker.

The box art for the upcoming Star Wars Miniatures Starship Battles game has been revealed, and it looks as though the ships included are going to be rather large. Also, it looks as though both the Executor and the Mon Calamari cruiser are really, really big -- if the starter box is to scale with the Revenge of the Sith starter box, the ships could be as big as twice or three times the size of the WotC standard Huge-sized miniatures. If so, this set could be one of the best things to come out of WotC (especially for fans of the RPG) in years! ...
Wizards of the Coast's product catalogue has been updated to include the releases for September through December of 2006, and one of the new products is a highly-anticipated starship combat game. Here is the blurb from the catalogue:
Star Wars Starship Battles is a new collectible miniatures game based on the popular Star Wars Miniatures Game. Long anticipated by fans, Starship Battles presents authentic starship figures from across all eras of the Star Wars saga. This 40-figure set is made up exclusively of space vehicles of all sizes, from starfighters to capital ships, all represented in relative scale. The starter game also contains two exclusive, non-randomized figures not available anywhere else, the Super Star Destroyer Executor and the Mon Calamari Star Defender Viscount.
Drawn from the popular films, computer games, comics, and novels, the starships in this set are presented in relative scale to each other and not scale with other Star Wars Miniatures figures.
Sounds pretty interesting. Also of note, I have a Dungeons & Dragons book coming out in September, co-written by Star Wars d20 author Owen K.C. Stephens. Here's the blurb on it:
Dragon Magic changes the way dragons are used in D&D campaigns. By imagining a world in which dragons openly share their magical secrets with humans and other races, this supplement encourages characters to form associations with dragons and learn ancient dragon secrets. Intended for both players and Dungeon Masters, Dragon Magic offers players new feats, spells, and magical items tied to dragons, while it gives DMs information on how to run a challenging new setting or enrich a current campaign.
SWRPGNetwork staffer GMSarli is reporting that the upcoming Attack on Endor Scenario Pack expansion for the Star Wars Miniatures Game will include new game material for the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. Apparently, the package includes statistics for several characters and creatures. Here's the scoop:
New vehicle, new creature, bunch of NPCs ... some of these guys had stats previously (several from Rebellion Era Sourcebook), but they're updated to the revised rules. Ponda Boba, Dr. Evazan, and Baron Sootir Fel are all new (AFAIK), and Kyle Katarn is the only one who already had revised stats (Power of the Jedi, but then no one seems to be able to get a copy of PotJ anymore!). Complete list:
A step in the right direction, at the very least. Here's hoping that sales do well and roleplayers show enough interest to encourage the production of more RPG material. ...

My older brother is always looking at porn and I told him that I was going to be one of those sexy babes in those porn mags too when I get older. Without even looking up, he asked what made me think anyone would want to look at my little teen tits.
I told him that when I was centerfold that I bet lots of guys would be jerking off to my pictures and shooting cum on my tits. He just laughed and said, “Yeah? Show me what you got.”
He probably thought I would be too embarrassed to show him, but I wasn’t at all. I just slipped down my sundress and struck a pose, thrusting my small breasts forward.
I honestly think I took him by surprise, because he had a funny look on his face, seeing his little sister posing like that. About time he realized that his little sister was turning into a hot young teen.
Think I’m going to start teasing him more with my teen boobies and teen ass just to see that look on his face again. Brother fucks little sister has a nice ring to it, and besides, brother-sister incest might be fun!

I have been looking for a stable company to provide some guidance in using Plesk. I hope a came to the right place. I am vary new to Plesk.
So First thing, I need some guidance to have the correct OBDC Database server settings to run an Access Database.
Do I know you? We only provide support to customers of Advantagecom on this forum, but if you're someone I know personally I might be willing to help on my own time by email or phone.
Choose MS Access Driver if you're going to us MS Access. I really don't know a whole lot about Microsoft Windows servers in a hosting environment, so that is only an educated guess. We use Linux and FreeBSD exclusively here.
I know quite a bit about Plesk for Linux and FreeBSD, but Plesk for Windows is a completely different beast. About all they share in common is the name "Plesk" and similar icons, though most functionality and configuration boxes are completely different.
Please do not private message me. My regular management duties preclude responding to every customer that sends me a support issue. Instead, post on the forum or contact tech support.
No. Plesk for Linux can use MySQL or PostGres. Our tech support staff can give you guidance on how to get data into MySQL. Depending on how much data you have, you could key by hand or use a utility to export and convert the data. We also offer services in which we'd can do this for you for $75 an hour if you're running short on time or patience for doing it yourself.
As far as shopping carts, osCommerce is what we usually recommend to our customers and it is included for free with any Plesk based account we sell. It is very easy to setup and use.

We stopped at Bobrof for a little while for some kayaking and dinghy riding. Bobrof is only 2-3 miles long. There is a big sea cave on the north end I kayaked into. It was pretty weird.
From Bobrof we headed along the north coast of Kanaga Island, then to the Bay of Islands on the west side of Adak. Crossing from Bobrof to Kanaga, we saw a pod of killer whales, or orcas. That was really cool.
We anchored for the night off North Island in the Bay of Islands around 11:00 p.m. Josh and Melinda took the dinghy out, and I went kayaking at midnight and climbed to the top of the island, an amazing feat with an elevation of 322 feet.

Chris Travers continues his warning about CVE-2016-1238 and gives some general advice about testing your frameworks.
Because I have lost confidence in the approach taken by those in charge of fixing this problem, I have decided to do a full disclosure series on CVE-2016-1238. As mentioned in a previous post, the proposed fixes for the minor versions don't even remotely fix the problem and at most can provide a false sense of security. For this reason, it is extremely important that sysadmins understand how these exploits work and how to secure their systems.
A lot of the information here is not specific to this CVE but concerns security regarding running tests generally. For this reason, while this CVE is used as an example, the same basic concepts apply to PostgreSQL database testing, and much more.
As I mentioned in my previous post, prove cannot currently be run safely in any directory that is world writeable, and the current approach of making this a module problem makes this far worse, not better. Moreover, this is not something that can be patched in prove without breaking the basic guarantee that it tests the application as it would run on the current system's Perl interpreter — if you break that, all bets are off.
All the exploits I cover in this series are exploitable on fully patched systems. However, they can be prevented by good system administration. In every case, we will look at how system administration best practices can prevent the problem.
One key problem with the current approach is that it fails to differentiate between unknowing inclusion and user errors brought on simply by not understanding the issues. The latter has been totally disregarded by the people attempting stop-gap patches.
Test harnesses generally are insecure by design. The whole point is to execute arbitrary code and see what happens ,and with this comes a series of inherent risks. We accept those risks because they are important to the guarantees we usually want to make that our software will perform in the real world as expected. Moreover, even the security risks inherent in test harnesses are good because it is better to find problems in an environment that is somewhat sandboxed than it is in your production environment.
So testing frameworks should be considered to be code injection frameworks, and they can be vectors by which code can be injected into a tested application with system security implications.
Understood this way, testing frameworks are not only insecure by design but this is desirable because you don't want a testing framework to hide a problem from you that could bite you in production.
This is a generic problem, of course. A database testing framework would (and should) allow SQL injection that could happen in the tested code so that these can be tested against. So whether you are working with Perl, Python, PostgreSQL, or anything else, the testing framework itself has to be properly secured. And in each platform, this means specific things.
In PostgreSQL, this means you need to pay close attention to certain things, such as the fact that the database tests should probably not run as a superuser, for example, because a superuser can do things like create functions with system access.
In Perl, one of the most important things to consider is the inclusion of modules from the current working directory and the possibility that someone could do bad things there.
Prove guarantees that your Perl code will run, in its current configuration, in accordance with your test cases. This necessarily requires arbitrary code execution and arbitrary dependency requirements resolved in the way Perl would resolve them on your system.
Prove guarantees that the guarantees you specify in your test cases are met by your current Perl configuration. It, therefore, cannot safely do any extra sandboxing for you.
The basic architecture of prove is that it wraps a test harness that runs a specified program (via the shebang line), parses its output assuming it to be in the test-anything protocol, and generates a report from the rest. For example if you create a file test.t:
What prove has done is invoke /bin/bash, run the file on it, parse the output, check thatwo2 tests were run, and that both printed OK (it is a little more complex than this, but...), and let you know it worked.
The most obvious attack scenarios would occur with an automated test environment that is poorly secured. In this case, if prove runs from a directory containing material more than one user might submit, user A may be able to inject code into user B's test runs.
Now, this is intended to run a custom.pl file, at most once, when the code is run, and it checks the current @INC paths. If this doesn't exist, it falls back to the current working directory, i.e. the directory the shell was working in when prove was run. If this directory shares information between users, user B can write a custom.pl file into that directory, which will run when user A's scheduled tests are run.
The code would then run with the permissions of the test run and any misbehavior would tie back to user A's test run (it is harder to tie the behavior to user B). In the event where user A's test run operates with more system permissions than user B's, the situation is quite a bit worse. Or maybe user B doesn't even have tests run anymore for some reason.
Now, it has been proposed that prove prune its own @INC, but that doesn't address this attack because prove has to run Perl separately. Additionally, separation of concerns dictates that this is not prove's problem.
As we have seen, there are inherent risks to test frameworks, and these have to be properly secured against the very real fact that one is often running untrusted code on them. However, there are a few things that really should be considered safe. These include:
Running tests during installation of trusted software as root. If you don't trust the software, you should not be installing it.
Running tests from directories that store only information from a single user (subdirectories of a user's home directory for example).
Understand that test systems run arbitrary code and avoid running test cases for automated build and test systems as privileged users.
Properly secure all working directories to prevent users from unknowingly sharing data or test logic.

Policy Starter: Policy Starter includes a sample policy manual provided and maintained by ISFIS, in consultation with school attorneys, legislative and executive branch decision makers, and school leaders. The sample policies are available online, are simple to use, and completely searchable. The sample policy manual is broken down into manageable sections.
Policy Booster: From federal, state or administrative law to a continuous outpouring of state and federal court decisions, schools need to make sure the board is protecting the district, employees, and most importantly, the children served. Policy Booster provides an email blast of recommended or mandated changes in policies with a description of the laws and rulings driving the changes.
Online Policy Manual Hosting Service - ISFIS will host your district's policy manual online. This is a public web site so your school policies are accessible anywhere, anytime, by your board, employees or community members. The board secretary can edit the manual online, with an audit trail of all changes, so all stakeholders will always have access to the most current policies. Begin with the ISFIS Policy Manual or upload your current custom policy manual. ISFIS will provide the web site template and handle all aspects of site hosting. A simple training video will instruct your staff on the upload process and most sites are up and running in two days or less, depending on your current format. ISFIS will upload your manual on behalf of your district for an additional fee. There are no monthly service fees to host your district specific policy website. The service is included as part of our Supplemental Policy Services Subscription, which also includes Bargaining Exhibit Services, Policy Starter, Policy Booster, and Policy ER/HR Advice Line. The Online Policy Manual Hosting service is also available as a stand-alone service for a reduced fee. Contact Marissa Gaal for more information.
Policy Examination Consulting Services: If your policy manual needs an overhaul, on a time and charge basis, ISFIS will help your district locate an attorney who specializes in reviewing and updating your entire policy manual. The review includes updates, specific recommendations on required changes, and best practices and flexibility available to your district. Call us for more information, especially if you have an accreditation review coming up in the future.
Policy/HR/ER Phone Support: Subscribers to this slate of services will also receive access to contact information you can use if you have any questions regarding your district's policies, human resources issues, and employee relations.This is an extremely efficient and inexpensive way to get quick answers to many of the routine questions about such things as open meetings, public records, and best practices. If a formal opinion is required, you may request a referral or consult with your attorney.
Bargaining Exhibit Services: ISFIS has created a series of exhibits for use in negotiations and arbitration, which was recently cited in a successful arbitration case. These exhibits are district specific and easily customized. Find a variety of comparability groups, literally with one or two clicks of the mouse, including charts and specific narrative, to best tell your district’s unique circumstances. This tool will drastically reduce the time and money you spend collecting comparability information and developing charts, while minimizing consulting and legal fees. This information is available to you before you even begin bargaining to help you develop sound negotiations strategy and stay ahead of the game, avoiding the last minute data gathering scramble. This service was developed with input from school district users, attorneys, and bargaining and negotiations experts.

One of the best-known prayers of the Orthodox Church speaks of the Spirit of God being "present in all places and filling all things." This profound affirmation is basic to Orthodoxy's understanding of God and His relationship to the world. We believe that God is truly near to us. Although He cannot be seen, God is not detached from His creation. Through the persons of the Risen Christ and the Holy Spirit, God is present and active in our lives and in the creation about us. All our life and the creation of which we are an important part, points, to and reveals God.
There are special experiences in our corporate life as Orthodox Christians when the perception of God's presence and actions is heightened and celebrated. We call these events of the Church Sacraments. Traditionally, the Sacraments have been known as Mysteries in the Orthodox Church. This description emphasizes that in these special events of the Church, God discloses Himself through the prayers and actions of His people.
Not only do the Sacraments disclose and reveal God to us, but also they serve to make us receptive to God. All the Sacraments affect our personal relationship to God and to one another. The Holy Spirit works through the Sacraments. He leads us to Christ who unites us with the Father. By participating in the Sacraments, we grow closer to God and to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit. This process of deification, or theosis, as it is known by Orthodoxy, takes place not in isolation from others, but within the context of a believing community. Although the Sacraments are addressed to each of us by name, they are experiences which involve the entire Church.
The Sacraments of the Orthodox Church are composed of prayers, hymns, scripture lessons, gestures, and processions. Many parts of the services date back to the time of the Apostles. The Orthodox Church has avoided reducing the Sacraments to a particular formula or action. Often, a whole series of sacred acts make up a Sacrament. Most of the Sacraments use a portion of the material of creation as an outward and visible sign of God's revelation. Water, oil, bread and wine are but a few of the many elements which the Orthodox Church employs in her worship. The frequent use of the material of creation reminds us that matter is good and can become a medium of the Spirit. Most importantly, it affirms the central truth of the Orthodox Christian Faith: that God became flesh in Jesus Christ and entered into the midst of creation thereby redirecting the cosmos toward its vocation to glorify its Creator.
The Holy Eucharist, which is known as the Divine Liturgy, is the central and most important worship experience of the Orthodox Church. Often referred to as the "Sacrament of Sacraments", it is the Church's celebration of the Death and Resurrection of Christ offered every Sunday and Holy Day. All the other Sacraments of the Church lead toward and flow from the Eucharist, which is at the center of the life of the Church.
The Sacrament of Baptism incorporates us into the Church, the Body of Christ, and is our introduction to the life of the Holy Trinity. Water is a natural symbol of cleansing and newness of life. Through the three-fold immersion in the waters of Baptism in the Name of the Holy Trinity, one dies to the old ways of sin and is born to a new life in Christ. Baptism is one's public identification with Christ's Death and victorious Resurrection. Following the custom of the early Church, Orthodoxy encourages the baptism of infants. The Church believes that the Sacrament is bearing witness to the action of God who chooses a child to be an important member of His people. From the day of their baptism, children are expected to mature in the life of the Spirit, through their family and the Church. The Baptism of adults is practiced when there was no previous baptism in the name of the Holy Trinity.
You may schedule the celebration of the Sacrament of Baptism by contacting the Annunciation Church Office. Please read beforehand: Your Child's Baptism at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church. Please note that baptisms may not take place on the following days unless it is absolutely necessary, and permission is obtained from the local Hierarch:
The Sacrament of Chrismation (Confirmation) immediately follows baptism and is never delayed until a later age. As the ministry of Christ was enlivened by the Spirit, and the preaching of the Apostles strengthened by the Spirit, so is the life of each Orthodox Christian sanctified by the Holy Spirit. Chrismation, which is often referred to as one's personal Pentecost, is the Sacrament which imparts the Spirit in a special way.
In the Sacrament of Chrismation, the priest anoints the various parts of the body of the newly-baptized with Holy Oil saying: "The seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit." The Holy Oil, which is blessed by the bishop, is a sign of consecration and strength. The Sacrament emphasizes the truths that not only is each person a valuable member of the Church, but also each one is blessed by the Spirit with certain gifts and talents. The anointing also reminds us that our bodies are valuable and are involved in the process of salvation.
The Sacraments of initiation always are concluded with the distribution of Holy Communion to the newly-baptized. Ideally, this takes place within the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. This practice reveals that Orthodoxy views children from their infancy as important members of the Church. There is never a time when the young are not part of God's people.
When a person comes voluntarily from another confession and seeks to be a member of the Orthodox Church, they must first be instructed in matters of the Orthodox Faith and practices that govern the inner life and outward behavior of an Orthodox Christian. Once this has been completed, candidates are accepted by means of whichever of the three modes prescribed by the Sixth Ecumenical Council (Canon 95) is appropriate:
For those interested in being received into the Orthodox Church, an initial appointment may be scheduled by contacting the Church Office.
As members of the Church, we have responsibilities to one another and, of course, to God. When we sin, or relationship to God and to others is distorted. Sin is ultimately alienation from God, from our fellow human beings, and from our own true self which is created in God's image and likeness.
Confession is the Sacrament through which our sins are forgiven, and our relationship to God and to others is restored and strengthened. Through the Sacrament, Christ our Lord continues to heal those broken in spirit and restore the Father's love to those who are lost. According to Orthodox teaching, the penitent confesses to God and is forgiven by God. The priest is the sacramental witness who represents both Christ and His people. The priest is viewed not as a judge, but as a physician and guide. It is an ancient Orthodox practice for every Christian to have a spiritual father to whom one turns for spiritual advice and counsel. Confession can take place on any number of occasions. The frequency is left the discretion of the individual. In the event of serious sin, however, confession is a necessary preparation for Holy Communion.
Participation in the Sacrament of Confession may be arranged by contacting the Annunciation Church Office.
God is active in our lives. It is He who joins a man and a woman in a relationship of mutual love. The Sacrament of Marriage bears witness to His action. Through this Sacrament, a man and a woman are publicly joined as husband and wife. They enter into a new relationship with each other, God, and the Church. Since Marriage is not viewed as a legal contract, there are no vows in the Sacrament. According to Orthodox teaching, Marriage is not simply a social institution, it is an eternal vocation of the Kingdom. A husband and a wife are called by the Holy Spirit not only to live together but also to share their Christian life together so that each, with the aid of the other, may grow closer to God and become the persons they are meant to be. In the Orthodox Marriage Service, after the couple have been betrothed and exchanged rings, they are crowned with "crowns of glory and honor" signifying the establishment of a new family under God. Near the conclusion of the Service, the husband and wife drink from a common cup which is reminiscent of the Wedding at Cana and which symbolized the sharing of the burdens and joys of their new life together.
If you are interested in celebrating the Sacrament of Marriage in our Parish, you may contact the Annunciation Church Office. Please read beforehand: Getting Married at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church. Also, please note that the date of the wedding will be tentative until all requirements have been completed. According to the official policies of our Archdiocese and Metropolis, weddings may not be celebrated on the following dates:
Exceptions can be made only rarely, in extreme circumstances, with the consent of the priest, and with the permission of the local Hierarch.
The Holy Spirit preserves the continuity of the Church through the Sacrament of Holy Orders. Through ordination, men who have been chosen from within the Church are set apart by the Church for special service to the Church. Each is called by God through His people to stand amid the community, as pastor and teacher, and as the representative of the parish before the Altar. Each is also a living icon of Christ among His people. According to Orthodox teaching, the process of ordination begins with the local congregation; but the bishop alone, who acts in the name of the universal Church, can complete the action. He does so with the invocation of the Holy Spirit and the imposition of his hands on the person being ordained.
Following the custom of the Apostolic Church, there are three major orders each of which requires a special ordination. These are Bishop, who is viewed as a successor of the Apostles, Priest, and Deacon, who act in the name of the Bishop. Each order is distinguished by its pastoral responsibilities. Only a Bishop may ordain. Often, other titles and offices are associated with the three orders. The Orthodox Church permits men to marry before they are ordained. Since the sixth century, Bishops have been chosen from the celibate clergy.
When one is ill and in pain, this can very often be a time of life when one feels alone and isolated. The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, or Holy Unction as it is also known, remind us that when we are in pain, either physical, emotional, or spiritual, Christ is present with us through the ministry of His Church. He is among us to offer strength to meet the challenges of life, and even the approach of death.
As with Chrismation, oil is also used in this Sacrament as a sign of God's presence, strength, and forgiveness. After the reading of seven Epistle lessons, seven Gospel lessons, and the offering of seven prayers, which are all devoted to healing, the priest anoints the body with the Holy Oil. Orthodoxy does not view this Sacrament as available only to those who are near death. It is offered to all who are sick in body, mind, or spirit. The Church celebrates the Sacrament for all its members during Holy Week on Holy Wednesday.
The Orthodox Church has never formally determined a particular number of Sacraments. In addition to the Eucharist, she accepts the above six Mysteries as major Sacraments because they involve the entire community and most importantly, are closely related to the Eucharist. There are many other Blessings and Special Services which complete the major Sacraments, and which reflect the Church's presence throughout the lives of her people.

Science and beauty have moved ever closer over the past few years, heralding the era of the cosmeceutical. Luckily for the believers who worship at its altar, many of the scientific claims seem to hold up. So are men in white lab coats—like 10 Years Younger's Dr. Jan Stanek—the purveyors of a modern beauty ideal, nipping and tucking us into alien-chic perfection? N.V. Perricone's senior nutritionist and trainer Christian Lee says, “Today's consumers want more than a cosmetic effect form a beauty product. They want proper results and cosmeceuticals are in a position to deliver those.” Science has brought once-exclusive beauty treatments and their often life-changing results to the masses—watch the makeover shows and judge for yourself. A bit of DIY micro-dermabrasion will cost you about the same as a coach ticket to Norwich. Plus, cosmeceuticals' multi-taking abilities are legendary. Susie Rogers, founder of London's Beauty Works West, says, “Natural, organic skincare would be the ideal, but unfortunately in most cases it is not as effective as cosmeceuticals.”
We say, approach with caution in this new and relatively uncharted territory. Give us the cold, hard facts and a layman's explanation of terms like ProXylane (Lancome's new patented anti-ageing molecule) and hyaluronic acid (a generic name for Restylane). A lack of industry regulation and credible long-term studies, coupled with hard-to-prove claims, mean skepticism is a must, there's no need to forego cosmeceuticals completely. Through science we'll no doubt continue to search for the elusive (and patently unscientific) fountain of youth.

Sermon: “Now You’ve Invited Me to Ask…” | Church of the Holy Cross Sermon: “Now You’ve Invited Me to Ask…” | God's still speaking from Hilo
Last week, our story of Elijah on the mountain, listening for the still, small voice, ended with God giving new instructions to that prophet, and sending Elijah back to work. Among his new tasks, which we didn’t read, was that he was to appoint Elisha as his successor. By the time we get to this part of Second Kings, the two have worked together for some time, and the time has come for the succession to happen. Elijah will depart, and Elisha will take on his responsibilities as a prophet to the nation of Israel.
If you’re having trouble keeping the names straight, I don’t blame you. Bible students have lamented the fact that the names Elijah and Elisha sound so much alike for centuries. It’s not much better in Hebrew: Elijah was pronounced Eh-lee-yah, meaning “My God is the Lord,” and Elisha, pronounced Eh-lee-sha, means “God is salvation.”
I’ll try to make it clear as I go through which I’m talking about, which will mostly be Elisha, the younger, the successor prophet. But if you’re confused, you might wave or something, and I’ll try to make it clear. In any case, just know that you’re in good company.
Elijah, the elder, has spent his career opposing King Ahab of Israel and his successor, King Ahaziah. Both monarchs had turned from the God of Israel to worship the god Baal, and both had also repeatedly demonstrated that they cared more for their own welfare than they did for the welfare of their people.
For Trevor Eppheimer, the dean of Hood Theological Seminary, those kings echoed an earlier figure in the history of God’s people: the Pharaoh of Egypt. The kings of Israel had adopted the same fascination with political power, forgetting that God intervenes on behalf of the oppressed.
Eppheimer writes: “The unique call of the prophet, in this context, is to open the nation’s eyes to the illusory nature of Pharaoh’s power and the ultimate reality of [God]’s.”
That had been Elijah’s ministry, to speak for God amidst drought, war, murder, and threats against his own life. He would now pass that ministry to Elisha.
Elijah told Elisha three times to stay behind on their journey – we’ve left one of those out to shorten the reading. He didn’t say why. Elisha didn’t ask why, and the authors of the book of Kings don’t offer an opinion, either. What matters is that Elisha insisted, each time, on coming along, right across the Jordan River in a miracle that echoes Israel’s entrance with Moses’ successor, Joshua, into the Promised Land.
Finally, Elijah asked the critical question: “Tell me what I may do for you.” That’s Elisha’s opening. I can just see him jumping at the chance, even leaping like a fish to a lure: “Well, Elijah, as long as you’re asking: How about a double share of your spirit?”
I know how that sounds, but Elisha wasn’t being greedy or power-hungry. At that time in Israel, when a landowner died, they divided the wealth among his sons (and if that sounds sexist to you, it does to me). The oldest son received a double portion – twice as much as any of the other sons – because he was the principal heir of the land.
What Elisha asked was to be recognized by Elijah, and by God, as the principal heir of the great prophet. “Yes, give guidance, inspiration, and power to these other prophets we’ve been meeting on our journey, but me: I’m the eldest son.”
Elijah, however, couldn’t make that promise. Prophetic ministry is not property that can be divided (you heard it here first, folks). Prophetic ministry is a vision that can be declared. That’s why the test is one of vision. Will Elisha see what God is doing?
As Eppheimer writes: “Elisha excitedly cries out, ‘The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!’ in order to confirm that he has, in fact, seen Elijah taken up. He has the requisite vision to perceive the reality of [God]’s activity in the midst of a world held under the illegal and illusory jurisdiction of Pharaoh and his heirs. This, finally, is what marks him as Elijah’s rightful successor.”
As Second Kings goes on, we’ll see that Elisha’s career as a prophet showed more signs of success than his mentor Elijah’s. He was welcomed by royal courts in Israel and Judah, and also in surrounding nations. Elijah was really only welcomed there while under arrest. Elisha was consulted by the rulers of Israel, not ignored or persecuted as Elijah had been by Ahab.
Some of that was because the times changed, and the descendants of Ahab were overthrown. Some of it, I think, was because Elisha asked for that double portion, to be a true heir of Elijah, and with that vision he made a difference. Building on what Elijah had begun, he changed the world around him.
Dare we accept the challenge offered by Eleanor Roosevelt: “You must do the thing you think you cannot do”?
This story might lead you to think that this kind of decision is a once-in-a-lifetime question. When the previous generation’s work is done, you decide whether to step in or not. Simple.
But it isn’t, is it? We certainly face moments of big decision in our lives – career choices, relationship choices, whether to become parents – but the big picture decisions lead to small picture ones. “What to do” becomes “Who to work for,” “Who to work for” becomes “How do I do this job,” “How do I do this job” becomes “What’s the important thing to work on today,” “What’s the important thing to do today” becomes “What’s next?”
All those questions and answers, and their analogues in relationships and homemaking and community service and parenting and all the rest of life – all those questions and answers matter. Details matter. God is in the details. How we do a thing is as important as what we set out to do.
At any place along the journey, at any point in the process, in any state of confusion or of certainty, it’s appropriate to ask once again for that double portion of Spirit, to seek to renew the vision.
The United Church of Christ is taking just such a time right now. General Minister and President the Rev. Dr. John Dorhauer and others in the UCC’s leadership have developed some prospective statements to guide the mission of our denomination. And they’re looking for our input. We’ve posted a link to a survey which includes those possible mission and vision statements and asks for consideration and comment on the church’s website and Facebook Page. I also plan to offer a time for people to get together in a group to look them over, discuss them, and submit feedback together – that will come in the next few weeks.
As Elijah passed the mantle to Elisha, Dr. Dorhauer has recently received the mantle of leadership in the UCC, making this a great time to seek that double portion and invite a vision. I’m very glad that we’re all invited to participate.
Likewise, this church has new leadership – I think that’s me – and we’ll continue to have new leadership. Now, I’m planning to minister here for a long time, but I’m also planning to grow and to change. I really hope to have ideas tomorrow that didn’t occur to me yesterday. I really hope to become a more faithful disciple of Jesus next week than I was last week.
We’ll see others among us as well who step up with ideas, energy, and expertise that we haven’t seen before. I truly believe that we’ll also be blessed with new ideas, energy, and expertise from people who are as new to us as their imaginations.
After just two months, I make no claim that I’ve a grasp on the vision of this church’s work, but I am certainly praying for it. At the least excuse, any indication that I’ve been invited to ask, I’m praying for that double portion of the Spirit. After all, I must do the thing I think I cannot do.
It’s not just a question for the Church, for national organizations or congregations. It’s not just a question for pastors or denominational presidents. We all of us, at any stage of life, and for any question of life, can ask for that double portion of Spirit. We can ask to renew that relationship with God in which we are beloved children, and heirs of the promise. That’s not looking back from the plow, or inviting distraction which Jesus warned about. That’s refreshing the vision and reviving ourselves as disciples of Christ.
Sister Joan Chittister writes: “Prophets are those who take life as it is and expand it. They refuse to shrink a vision of tomorrow to the boundaries of yesterday.”
As followers of Jesus, we are all called to take life as it is and expand it, to ask for a double portion of the Spirit, to have it confirmed by holding a vision of a more loving world, to bring it to being with work and with prayer. So ask for the Spirit, search for the vision, learn from the leaders who came before, and step out to make a difference.
HRP-2 is the final robotic platform for the Humanoid Robotics Project headed by the Manufacturing Science and Technology Center (MSTC), which is sponsored by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) through New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).
The total robotic system was designed and integrated by Kawada Industries, Inc. together with the Humanoid Research Group of National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). Yaskawa Electric Corporation provided the initial concept design for the arms and AIST 3D Vision Research Group and the Shimizu Corporation provided the vision system.
HRP-2’s height is 154 cm and its mass is 58 kg, including batteries. It has 30 degrees of freedom (DOF) including two DOF for its hip. The cantilevered crotch joint allows for walking in a confined area. Its highly compact electrical system packaging allows it to forgo the commonly used "backpack" used on other humanoid robots.
The height, mass, and DOF of the new robot are the same as the HRP-2P that was released in March 2002. The following features have been upgraded in the new model.
Performance Upgrade: Cooling systems incorporated in the leg actuators allow enhanced continuous stepping endurance. Feet are designed for walking on an uneven surface. Links and axial stiffness are significantly upgraded to improve walking motion and operational performance.
Reliability Upgrade: Electrical device noise was reduced to improve system reliability. Cooling systems were installed in both the computer and the actuator drive systems to improve temperature control.
Compact size upgrade: Electrical harnesses were made into ICs and a specially designed battery cage was developed to make the torso even more compact.
The external appearance of HRP-2 was designed by Mr. Yutaka Izubuchi, a mechanical animation designer famous for his robots that appear in Japanese anime, including the well-known "PATLABOR." Mr. Izubuchi also named HRP-2 "Promet."
HRP-2 will be used for experiments to further develop robotic technologies in the areas of "walking on uneven surfaces," "tipping-over control," "getting up from a fallen position," and "human-interactive operations in open spaces."
Meanwhile, Kawada will start renting renting HRP-2 as a humanoid robot R&D platform. Internal API for HRP-2 is expected to be open to the public and its users will be able to develop their own software. It is anticipated that HRP-2s will greatly enhance humanoid robot technology research activities.
Experiments to realise "walking on uneven surfaces," "tipping-over control," "getting up from a fallen position," and "human-interactive operations in open spaces" are planned.
The Erasmus+ programme offers young people the chance to make a difference through the European Voluntary Service.
The European Voluntary Service (EVS) gives young people the opportunity to express their personal commitment through full-time voluntary work in a foreign country within or outside the EU.
The EVS aims to develop solidarity, mutual understanding and tolerance among young people, while contributing to strengthening social cohesion and promoting active citizenship. Their learning experience is formally recognized through a Youthpass . Volunteers receive free board and lodging, insurance cover and a grant for the duration of the project (in some cases they may be asked for a contribution for travel costs).
EVS volunteers working for more than two months abroad can get additional support to learn, and test their progress in, the language used during their volunteering.
One of the organisations involved plays the role of coordinator and applies for an EU grant on behalf of the partnership. Organisations perform a number of roles:
The EVS core values and quality standards are laid down in the EVS Charter (294 kB) . To uphold these standards, organisations interested in sending or hosting EVS volunteers, or coordinating an EVS project, need first to be accredited. To do this organisations must first submit an application for accreditation (not the same as a funding application). If their application is approved, they can take part in applications for EVS projects. An accreditation can be withdrawn immediately in cases of non-compliance with the Charter. Organisations accredited to take part in EVS can be found in the EVS database .
Are you aged 17-30 and willing to spend from 2 weeks to 12 months abroad as an EVS Volunteer? Start by having a look at the European Youth Portal for information, volunteering opportunities, and the database of EVS organisations.
Are you an organisation willing to develop an EVS project? The Erasmus+ Programme Guide provides detailed information about the conditions for participating. In most cases, the application for funding and accreditation is submitted via the Erasmus+ National Agencies in each country participating in the programme. The Agencies are the primary information sources for the users of the programme: organisations are invited to contact them for information and advice.
Below you will find a "checklist" of important information and resources related to applying for and implementing EVS.

How the hell do you download this? I was able to download each update for the entire existence of the game, now I can't. I'm able to do less and less each year. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to single out Shrapnel Games, generally it's the whole computer industry. It's like you have to be a certain class to use the personal confuser (I mean PC) nowadays, and it's getting worse and worse, and if I might add ... pretty ridiculous. I bet it's a 3rd party internet program like Winzip, or some stupid error on my part, like a bad connection or something. Either-way, I'll figure it out (well I hope). I just hope I don't have to spend a whole bunch of money in the process.
I have NO IDEA what the problem seems to be but it's at your end or everyone would be complaining. I click on the link, wait a few seconds and it starts to DL and ( for me ) about 45 seconds later it's on my HDD. I use Chrome, Internet explorer works slightly different but the end result is the same
I got it to work. I simply used someone else's computer to download it to my flash drive and then downloaded it to my computer at home. Good update!
其他摘要 Long period start-up is one of the main restraining factors of the single-stage completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON) process. This study investigated the fast start-up of the CANON process initiated by a submerged biological aerated filter (SBAF) method. With conventional activated sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank of municipal waste water treatment plants as the seed sludge, the CANON process was successfully started up after the acclimation of sludge microorganisms for 48 days under the experimental conditions of (30±2),organic carbon free and controlled dissolved oxygen(stage I: 0.3-0.5mg·L-1; stage II-IV: 0.1-0.2mg·L-1), with the maximum removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen achieved at 99.9% and 86.5%, respectively. The population structure characteristics of microorganisms in the system were studied using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rDNA amplicon. The results demonstrated that the two dominant microbial strains in the system were Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, accounting for 26.6% and 17.8%, respectively. The major contributors of nitrogen removal were Nitrosomonas in β-Proteobacteria and Candidatus brocadia in Brocadiae. Through the above experiments, it was revealed that the investigated SBAF based CANON possesses had the advantages of fast start-up, efficient biological nitrogen removal and stable operation process.

The creator can publish the work, copy it, and authorize copies and so on at his or her discretion. Alternately, they can deny permission to make copies for any reason.

Images are one of the most abused mediums on the internet. It's common and actually widely accepted for people to scan in an image, then put them on their web site, send them in emails and post them to newsgroups at will. "Common" and "accepted" does not translate to legal.
If you take a photo of Bill Gates from a magazine and scan it, then add it onto your website, you are violating copyright. If you take that same picture and run it through a filter and then post it on your website, you are still violating copyright. If you take that same picture and modify it heavily, say photo-manipulate Bill Gates into superwoman, you are still violating copyright. If you take that original scanned image then use your graphics program to heavily modify it into something else, say a fractal image, you are still violating copyright, at least technically, although it would be difficult to enforce. If you make a thumbnail of the Bill Gates picture and put that on your website with a reference to the original, then you may be allowed to do so under "fair use". If you link to a legal copy of Bill Gates's picture on the internet using "A HREF", you are not violating copyright. If you link to a legal copy of Bill Gates's picture on the internet using "IMG SRC", you are violating copyright and also bandwidth theft. If you are doing anything significant with the photo, it is generally wise to get a model release signed by the subject(s) in the photo.
The general rule is, if it's on the internet you can link to it. It's considered good form to only link to web pages (TEXT, HTML or HTML-like objects). It's considered bad form to link directly to images, sounds, zip files, and so on using A HREF without permission. It is a copyright violation to link using IMG SRC. This includes linking to pictures on other people's websites from message boards and forums.

Rajgira Halwa is very easy to prepare and absolutely delicious! Also it will give enough energy for a few hours after eating it so that you won’t feel hungry immediately during fasting 🙂
It is usually prepared during Ashadi Ekadashi, Shravan upwas, or even fasting days such as Navratri upwas and Maha Shivratri.
Amaranth also known as Ramdana or Rajgira is usually consumed during fasting in India. The word ‘Amaranth’ is derived from the greek term ‘amarantos’ meaning ‘unwithering’. The Hindi term for Amaranth, Ramdana, means God’s own grain. This grain contains more than 3 times the average amount of Calcium and is also high in minerals such as Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorous and Potassium. It is the only grain which contains Vitamin C. Amaranth is also easy to digest because of the presence of amino acids.
In a cooking pan (I used a ceramic fry pan to prevent the halwa from sticking to the ends), heat ghee.
Add the Rajgira flour/ atta to the ghee and roast while stirring with a spoon/ spatula till it starts giving out a nutty aroma and turns slightly brown in colour. Keep the gas flame low to medium to avoid the mixture from getting burnt. It will take about 4-5 minutes for the Rajgira flour/ atta to get roasted well. Keep an eye on the milk as well.
Once the flour is roasted, slowly add the warm milk and sugar mixture while stirring the flour continuously so that there are no lumps formed. Be careful if the milk is too hot it may splutter.
Cook while stirring continuously till the mixture becomes thick and ghee starts to ooze out from the sides. Also the halwa will start leaving the sides of the pan. Turn off the gas flame.
Also see other fasting recipes – Sabudana Khichadi Recipe, Aloo Jeera Recipe, Rajgira Paratha, Shakarkandi ki Kheer (Sweet Potato Kheer), Sweet Lassi, Mango Lassi, Nimbu Pani (Shikanji). Please note that since the rules for vrat/ upwas/ fasting are different across different communities and regions in India, please feel free to modify these recipes as required.

Serbia signed and ratified the UN Convention against Corruption and the Council of Europe Convention (Criminal and Civil) on Corruption. All three conventions came into force by a special decree and thus became part of the legal system of Serbia; however, the full implementation of these conventions is yet to be seen.
In Serbia, there is no specific national anti-corruption legislation. The anti-corruption framework is scattered between various pieces of legislation. The principal legislative enactment is the Criminal Code, which recognises both passive and active bribery (which applies both to private/commercial bribery and public bribery) and trading in influence.
Active bribery − bribing public officials or employees, agents or shareholders/owners of private companies with the intention that they act, or omit to act, contrary to/in accordance with their duties.
Passive bribery − where public officials or employees, agents or shareholders/owners of private companies accept advantages in exchange for an act, or the omission of an act, contrary to/in accordance with their duties.
Trading in influence − whoever solicits or accepts, either directly or through a third party, a reward or any other benefit for himself or another in order to use his official or social position, or his real or assumed influence, to intercede for the performance or non-performance of an act; or whoever makes a promise or an offer, or gives to another either directly or through a third party, a reward or any other benefit, so that they might use their official or social position, or real or assumed influence, to intercede for the performance or non-performance of an official act.
The main investigating authority is the Public Prosecution, and the sanctions range from six months up to 12 years’ imprisonment. In parallel and in order to eliminate circumstances or conditions that may influence the perpetrator to commit criminal offences in future, the court can impose a security measure of prohibiting a certain duty, e.g. directorship. Similarly, the legal consequence of a guilty judgment can be the termination of employment/appointment.
The corruption ranking for Serbia for 2016, according to Transparency International, is 72nd out of 167 countries in the world. The main corruption issue in comparison with regional countries and the rest of the world is the proportion of firms that expect to give gifts to secure government contracts, according to Enterprise Surveys (http://www.enterprisesurveys.org), The World Bank.
In recent years, there have been a few big cases relating to corruption in both the private and public sectors, but considerably more corruption cases come from the public sector, as private companies seek to avoid media publicity on corruption issues. Regardless of the sector where corruption occurs, there are no final or binding convictions for high-profile cases.
On the basis of the existing final and binding convictions, mostly cases of smaller and medium corruption, the analysis made by Partners Serbia found the following rate of convictions:
1) For the crime of “Passive bribery”, 68% of convictions were prison sentences, 21% of convictions were fines, 8% of convictions were house arrest, and 3% of convictions were conditional sentences.
2) For the crime of “Active bribery”, 7% of convictions were prison sentences, 4% of convictions were fines, and 89% of convictions were conditional sentences.
Most final and binding convictions for the crime of “Passive bribery” came from the public (police) sector (45%), construction sector (25%), medical sector (10%) and educational sector (8%). On the other hand, for the crime of “Active bribery”, most final and binding convictions came from the judicial sector (14%), medical sector (14%) and educational sector (7%). It is expected that enforcement activity will be boosted by the proposed new legislation and government strategy, as set below.
A bribe can be monetary or non-monetary and there is no specific monetary limit up to which a person can offer gifts without being held criminally liable. However, under the Anti-Corruption Agency Act, an official can accept a protocol or holiday gift (the gift may not be in money or securities) if its value does not exceed 5% of the value of his/her average monthly net salary in Serbia.
The donor of the benefit who reports the offence prior to becoming aware that it had been detected may be remitted from punishment.
Self-reporting is relevant in cases of active bribery, meaning that the perpetrator who reports the offence before becoming aware that it has been detected, may be remitted from punishment. In other cases, self-reporting is relevant for mitigation of the sentence.
Also, the Board of Directors, managers and employees are criminally liable if they knew that a criminal offence was being prepared (only offences punishable of five or more years), but fail to report this during the time of the preparation (when its commission could have still been prevented), and the offence is later committed or attempted.
In principle, deferred plea agreements (DPAs) do exist in a certain form and the prosecution can defer criminal prosecution for certain criminal offences (up to five years) if the perpetrator accepts one or more of the following obligations: 1) to rectify the detrimental consequence caused by the commission of the criminal offence or indemnify the damage caused; 2) to pay a certain amount of money to the benefit of a humanitarian organisation, fund or public institution; 3) to perform certain community service or humanitarian work; or 4) to fulfil another obligation determined by a final court decision.
The prosecution shall determine a time limit, during which the perpetrator must fulfil the obligations undertaken, with the proviso that the time limit may not exceed one year and if the suspect fulfils the obligation within the prescribed time limit, the prosecution shall dismiss the charges.
In principle, an aggrieved party (in this case, the state) can seek civil compensation before a criminal court and usually the criminal court further refers the party to seek redress in the civil court, once there is a guilty judgment.
Generally speaking, this kind of agreement has not yet gained its full scope, as seen in purely adversarial systems. However, according to the Serbian Criminal Procure Code, the court shall, upon written agreement between the parties (the prosecution and the defendant/perpetrator), accept the agreement, if: 1) the defendant has knowingly and voluntarily confessed the criminal offence or criminal offences which are the subject matter of the charges; 2) the defendant was aware of all the consequences of the concluded agreement, especially that he has waived his right to a trial and that he accepts a restriction of his right to file an appeal; 3) the other existing evidence does not run contrary to the defendant’s confession of having committed a criminal offence; and 4) the penalty, other criminal sanction or other measures in respect of which the prosecution and the defendant have reached an agreement, was proposed in line with criminal and other law.
Agreement on testifying by a defendant− an agreement may be concluded with a defendant who has confessed entirely to having committed a criminal offence, provided that the significance of his testimony for detecting, proving or preventing the criminal offence outweighs the consequences of the criminal offence he has committed.
Agreement on testifying by a convicted person–the prosecution and a convicted person may conclude an agreement on testifying if the significance of the convicted person’s testimony for detecting, proving or preventing the criminal offences referred outweighs the consequences of the criminal offence for which he has been convicted.
Under the newly adopted whistle-blowers’ legislation, whistle-blowers are protected when reporting suspicions relating to corruption, violation of human rights or the exercise of public authority contrary to the entrusted purpose, danger to life, public health, safety, environment, and prevention of major damage.
Those making disclosure within one year from the day he/she learned about the action which is subject to disclosure, and no later than 10 years from the performance of such action, are entitled to protection in accordance with the law, provided that, at the moment of disclosure, based on available information, an average person with similar knowledge and experience as the whistle-blower would believe that the disclosed information is true.
The employer of a whistle-blower may not, through its actions or omission to act, put the whistle-blower in an unfavourable position due to whistleblowing (in relation to employment or work engagement, promotion, evaluation, acquisition or loss of vocation, disciplinary measures and penalties, working conditions, termination of employment, salary, etc.).
The whistle-blower is entitled to file a motion for protection to the competent court and request the court to: declare that damaging action was taken against him/her; ban the damaging action or its repetition; remove the consequences and grant pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages; and publish a court decision in the media.
Unlike regular civil proceedings, the burden of proof lies on the defendant, meaning that the defendant will have to prove (if the whistle-blower initially demonstrated the likelihood that the damaging action was a result of whistleblowing) that the damaging action is not related to the whistleblowing.
In principle, the Criminal Code of Serbia shall apply to anyone committing a criminal offence on its territory.
However, Serbia is also no stranger to the extra-territorial application of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and, to a lesser extent according to the practice so far, the UK Bribery Act. Recent years have seen the investigation of, and subsequent DPAs on, bribery allegations concerning several multinational pharmaceutical companies.
Bribery and trading in influence also extend to foreign officials, meaning that the foreign official who has committed the offence shall be liable under the same regime as the domestic official.
Serbia recognises corporate criminal liability and a company can be held liable if: (i) the responsible person, acting within their authority, culpably commits a criminal offence with the intention of obtaining benefits for the company; or (ii) the person acting under the control or supervision of the responsible person was enabled to commit a criminal offence due to the lack of supervision or control of the decision-maker.
A compliance programme or compliance defence is considered when determining the punishment within the limits for the particular offence, and serves as mitigation. A private company can be exempted from the punishment if it voluntarily and immediately takes necessary actions to remove harmful effects or returns unlawfully obtained property. In addition, a company may be exonerated from a punishment if: (i) it detects and reports a criminal offence before learning that criminal proceedings have been instituted; or (ii) on a voluntary basis or without delay removes incurred detrimental consequences or returns the proceeds from crime unlawfully gained.
The year ahead should see the start of the application of newly adopted whistle-blowers’ legislation. It should be noted that the relevant whistle-blower legislation does not see breaches of whistle-blowers’ rights as criminal offences, nor misdemeanours. It is yet to be seen whether these will be included in the Criminal Code amendments, as announced.
In addition, the announced Law on Property Origin should secure a more efficient system for the fight against corruption, officials claim.
Further changes of the Criminal Code have entered into force, especially the part referring to criminal actions in economic areas, with a special focus on the crime of tax evasion, cartels and public procurement. Important roles in the actual implementation of this amendment lie with the respective regulatory bodies and the Public Prosecution.
Finally, the Financial Investigation Strategy for 2015–2016 comprehensively addresses the problem of financial crime by: enabling efficient and effective financial investigations so as to keep track of money flows and assets and have proactive identification of criminal offences; facilitating efficient cooperation of relevant agencies responsible for collecting data and conducting financial investigations; providing advanced training to judicial officers and civil servants who handle financial investigations; and preventing shifting of unlawfully gained funds into lawful business flows. One of the features is the introduction of liaison officers to serve as a contact with the prosecutor’s office, the police and other authorities, i.e. the Administration for the Prevention of Money Laundering, the Tax Administration, the Tax Police, the Customs Administration, the National Bank of Serbia, the Business Registers Agency, the Central Securities Depository, the Privatisation Agency, the State Audit Institution, the Cadastre, the Аnti-Corruption Agency, the Pension Fund, the Property Directorate and databases of different ministries. Also, in complex cases, the prosecutor may form a task force to handle such a case, comprised of police officers and officers of other governmental authorities. Also, a forensic accountant will be introduced to combine knowledge of finances, accounting, audit, banking and exchange operations, information systems, and knowledge of the legal framework, the criminal procedure code, the procedures of government institutions, investigation techniques and other financial skills, all in order to clarify facts and economic transactions for the purpose of criminal proceedings.
Adoption of this mid-term strategy seeks to improve financial investigations overall, and to keep track of money flows and assets for easier identification of criminal offences, and is one of the objectives set by the National Anti-Corruption Strategy for the period 2013–2018.

If you want to become a teacher, you are in for a very exciting career. Of course, the most important aspect of teaching is helping people. There is much work ahead of you, too. Make no mistake about it, teachers work long hours. When you love what you do though, it’s all worth it, and you are going to be a dedicated and passionate teacher.
You are going to need great communication skills. For some, communication comes a little easier. No matter who you are, however, and how good of a communicator you are, you are going to need to work to improve your communication skills. By the way, teachers are always focused on learning, and they continue their education long after graduating from college. There are workshops, seminars, online resources and even advanced degrees.
You can be a teacher with a bachelor’s degree, but many teachers continue their education and get a master’s degree and even a doctorate degree. With a doctorate degree in your field, you can also choose to teach at a university. Many universities also allow teachers that have master’s degrees, but those teachers don’t always hold the title of professor.
One thing you will also want to do aside from growing your communication skills is to work on organizational skills. Teachers have to be highly organized, yet flexible at the same time. They often spend as much time working outside of the classroom drawing up lesson plans, grading papers, etc., as they do inside the classroom. Are you willing to make that time commitment?
Don’t worry, you will still have time for family and entertainment. Teaching is just a very demanding career that requires you to be dedicated to the students and the lessons you provide. You are going to need to be planning your exit from school well in advance, too, so that you are ready to apply for your first teaching job. You will need letters of recommendation, and of course, you are going to need to prepare yourself to get certified and know all the requirements for getting your teacher’s license.
The decision you have made to become a teacher is going to find you have a direct impact on many people’s lives. You will have an impact on the lives of many students, parents, as well as other teachers and school faculty. Always think about what’s next as you prepare yourself for a mountain of an adventure as a teacher.

Based on the popular series of pregnancy guides by the same name with more than 14.5 million books sold through 2011.

Synopsis: Over the moon about starting a family, TV fitness guru Jules and dance show star Evan find that their high-octane celebrity lives don’t stand a chance against the surprise demands of pregnancy. Baby-crazy author and advocate Wendy gets a taste of her own militant mommy advice when pregnancy hormones ravage her body; while Wendy’s husband, Gary, struggles not to be outdone by his competitive alpha-Dad, who’s expecting twins with his much younger trophy wife, Skyler. Photographer Holly is prepared to travel the globe to adopt a child, but her husband Alex isn’t so sure, and tries to quiet his panic by attending a "dudes" support group, where new fathers get to tell it like it really is. And rival food truck chefs Rosie and Marco’s surprise hook-up results in an unexpected quandary: what to do when your first child comes before your first date?

•The website has no contact information. A legitimate business has a way for you to reach them. Look for an "About" page that offers information on the company or CEO, along with a phone number, address or contact email. (Try calling the number to see if anyone answers.) A website with only a contact form and no other way to get in touch with an actual human is suspicious.
I forgot to also share that I will be starting work with On Point as an Advocacy Coordinator too. It sounds like a great job that helps our fellow Americans keep informed about political issues. On Point is the voice of the average citizens that may have an opinion to share with their politicians but have no way of knowing how to contact them. On Point makes sure those voices get heard. In orientation the trainer said she will be hiring agents again around the middle of June. If you have good writing skills and are a good conversationalist then you may want to check it out. It also seems like if you put forth a little effort, you can make decent wages with them and they do pay weekly. I’m not big into politics but excited about this new venture.
If you actually enjoy putting together Ikea furniture or standing in long lines, you may be cut out for doing tasks for others.

Moving, cleaning, delivery and being a handyman have the “highest earning potential,” according to the company. Read about how to get started on TaskRabbit.

I have several blogs promoting all different products. The hardest thing I find about affiliate marketing is that once you’ve sold someone something you need to find a new product to sell them. I’ve found that promoting a subscription service where you sign up a customer is a great way to go. This way every time they renew or buy something you get paid. You only have to sell them this once.
How to Get It: Begin with sites like UserTesting.com, YouEye.com and Userlytics.com. Register with multiple companies for opportunities to test as many websites as possible. Once you're in the system, you'll be emailed when testers are needed, and if you're one of the first to respond, expect to spend 15 to 20 minutes completing the test. Many sites require a microphone and/or webcam, which are built into most laptops—but if you need to buy one, they aren't expensive. The tester sites typically pay within a week or two via PayPal.
I’ve had a quick look at your site and the first thing I noticed is that it’s not sexy. Site design is so important. Anytime I come across an ugly website I hit the back button faster than you can say call-to-action. I also see that you only have two pages, there’s no identity or branding behind the site. You’ve also got a generic header logo that is usually applied by default when you install a theme. No custom logo’s or anything.
Massage therapy is a rewarding field, but starting out is tough. You have to build a client list or find a job at a massage center. That's where Zeel is looking to change things. The app lets clients connect with massage therapists for same-day massages in their homes. As the massage therapist, you receive a notification when someone near wants an appointment. Zeel says that massage therapists get a 75% cut of each payment, plus it automatically handles fees for late cancellations. For safety, Zeel says it has an ID verification system on the client side, and massage therapists can rate clients, so problematic ones get weeded out. It's currently available in over 50 cities.
Yes, you read correctly, that is $0 per article. Despite being one of the largest publications online with a great travel section, Huffington Post is pretty stingy when it comes to paying freelance writers. But this is a very heavily trafficked site and a link back from this domain is probably worth over $1000 in itself, so I’m still including it. They’re also quite easy to write for.
Think long and hard before shelling out any money: Some work-at-home jobs will require you to purchase materials or equipment to get started, and while that doesn’t mean they’re not legitimate, it should be a red flag. If you are asked to pay for equipment, make sure you understand what you’re buying, and from whom. Also ask about the return policy for your equipment if your new gig doesn’t work out.
In this increasingly digital world, there has never been a better time to work from home. At-home jobs are a great work alternative, whether you are struggling to secure a local gig, need to stay home for your own health or to care for a loved one, or simply don't relish the thought of hustling to a workplace every day. More than 40 million Americans work remotely, according to the advocacy group Telework Coalition, even if it's just a part-time side hustle to supplement their income. And as the economy improves, more companies will be looking for additional staff to telecommute. For remote jobs, you'll need a computer and an Internet connection, some basic skills, and a can-do attitude. Click through this list of employment areas that are booming right now, plus find even more ways to make money from home.
Wanderful is looking for pieces that are engaging, personal and inspiring with the attempt to speak to their audience and community. They are looking for topics related to all things women, particularly those between the ages of 25 – 40. They want to provide tips for female travellers to show them how to make the most of their overseas experiences.
Achievement is an app that allows you to earn money by walking (and swimming, biking, and other exercises too). Your exercise is tracked by the app, and you earn points – up to 80 per day. The downside to this app is that payout is minimal. It can take up to four months to earn a mere $10. So while this is an easy way to earn a little without adding any additional work hours to your day, it's not a way to make a living.
Nick is the co-founder, editor and author of Goats On The Road. He contributes to numerous other media sites regularly and shares his knowledge of travel, online entrepreneurship and blogging with the world whenever he can. Nick’s advice has been featured on the Lonely Planet, CNN Money, Business Insider and Forbes and he spoke at the World Tourism Forum in Istanbul about the business of travel blogging.
There were also technological developments, like the advent of Web 2.0 and the introduction of the cookie, that made it much easier to track the impact of advertising on the purchase funnel. Add to that the explosion of ecommerce in the late 1990s, of blogging in the early 2000s, and of user generated content soon after, and the field was set for affiliate marketing.
Thanks for stopping by. I’ve yet to come across “copying and pasting” email jobs that are legitimate. These jobs typically come with a fee for “training materials” — essentially you’re paying to “learn” how to access these jobs which is really no more than trying to get other people to pay the fee so they too can learn the secret to finding these jobs — it’s a pyramid scheme of sorts. Your best bet is to stick with legitimate companies that offer real work from home jobs 🙂 Let me know if you have any questions!
Okay while i agree the list is very useful….i think that everyone should disreguard the online surveys they are awful if u want to make money doing it you have to fill out one form which just brings you to another site to give u more forms to fill out. Its pretty bad, plus kids should be getting out of there houses to make money not sitting inside all day.
If you are a confident web developer then designing your own themes is an obvious path to follow if you are looking to make money online.

They are looking for local writers, bloggers and journalists to write deep storytelling about all the good things in life—food, music and booze. The site aims to inform and inspire its readers about destinations around the world. This travel site won the 2017 James Beard Publication of the Year award and SATW’s Best Travel Journalism Site award.
One of my favorite ways to make money online is to find used books at my local thrift stores and sell them for profit. It’s not uncommon to find a few books that sell for well over $100. Thanks to the free and easy-to-use BookScouter App, you have all the information you need right in the palm of your hand — after scanning a book’s ISBN it will tell you how much sites are willing to pay you for that book.
It's a little more involved. Companies, especially those with stores, will want to get the opinion of the customer as they go through a transaction. For a bank, it might be opening up an account. For a retail clothing store, it might be trying on a shirt and checking out. Sometimes it's just calling up their customer service line with a problem and seeing how the representative treats you.
Still, your options for earning money online aren’t limited to just part-time work and internet resale – and not even close. Thanks to innovative new technologies, the creativity of certain start-ups, and marketers’ eternal desire to better understand consumers, some websites will actually pay you just to use the internet – whether that’s for searching the web, taking surveys, or conducting extensive online research.

And, don’t worry, you don’t need any kind of developer or QA experience whatsoever. All you need is an ability to speak your thoughts out loud while completing tasks. I’ve been a longtime usability testing at User Testing. Sometimes, I’ll get the chance to visit a website, pretend to make a purchase, and give my thoughts about my shopping experience and the overall checkout process. New website owners may ask for testers to give their unabashed first impressions of their site. Really, there are endless possible scenarios you may be tasked with as a usability tester.
Although the demand is expected to decrease over the next decade, the opportunities are still there for travel agents who can harness the Internet to earn clients and help them plan their adventures. According to the BLS, job prospects may be best for travel agents who offer expertise in certain regions of the world, have experience planning tours or adventures, or who focus on group travel.
You can find home agent jobs listed on regular job boards like Indeed.com, Monster.com and others. Or you can go right to the source with dedicated home agent companies like Convergys, TeleTech and Sitel. These companies generally treat you as an employee with regular hours and health benefits, but if you want to be an independent contractor, check out a site like LiveOps.
Because the fee is so small but the task takes so little time, the strategy is to do as many of them as possible. However, be sure to read the fine print because many of these companies have a minimum payout, meaning that if you earn $8.55 doing 20 micro jobs, you may have to wait until you’ve earned as much as $50 to actually get your money. Read more about some of the pitfalls of this kind of work.

Sound up your aisle? Fill out an application through the site, which pairs brides and bridesmaids based on personality and location. You could make between $200 and $2,000 per month, says Glantz, working anywhere from a few hours a month to a couple of hours a week, and you'll generally handle everything on nights and weekends. Most projects—er, weddings—require between 3 to 11 months of your time.
More and more companies and startups especially are embracing remote work—where you use online collaboration and communication tools to do your work from wherever you want. And you don’t have to be a 20-something hotshot designer or coder to reap the benefits of working remotely. Many remote positions are for customer support positions or other customer-facing positions that don’t require specialized skill sets.

Babysitting isn’t just for teens. Everyone from college students to recent retirees can make money watching other people’s children. Word-of-mouth referrals from friends and family are still a great way to get started, but you can also create a profile on Care.com or Sittercity to expand your reach. Note any specialized skills, such as CPR certifications or experience with special needs children, to make yourself more marketable.
Rescue battered wood. Pallets and pallet stock are cheap (or free) and easy to come by. Look for untreated specimens at construction sites, community colleges, buildings under renovation, or shipping warehouses and plane them down and/or kiln-dry them in a homemade kiln-dryer to uncover their hidden beauty. You can then resell the wood as is or even turn it into beautiful furniture. (Be sure to advertise that the wood is “reclaimed,” as people are often willing to pay much more for this.)
As far as internet jobs, there are no shortage of options to become a crowdworker. If you’ve never heard the term before, crowd working is an inexpensive way for companies to get work done quickly. This work is made available to a pool of workers and is claimed on a first come first serve basis. A lot of times, this kind of work is referred to as micro jobs and can be found on short task sites.
While this is not technically “at home,” you can still earn great money without ever getting on the phone using your personal car, bike, or scooter to deliver food, give people rides, and even picking up groceries. The great thing about these companies is that it's also very flexible work. No one is telling you when to start and stop. You just do as much work as you can, when you can.
The prep work before you open up shop is more time-consuming. You need merchandise to sell, photos and descriptions to post, a name for your shop and a business plan to help you succeed. Once that’s done, you’ll still need to find customers. Depending on what you’re selling, that could take weeks, which is why you should expect the overall time for this gig to be slow.
Websites like Survey Junkie will pay you a decent chunk of change for the low-maintenance, borderline mindless task of completing surveys. Companies want to understand consumers better, and one way they do that is by compensating survey-takers (a.k.a. you). Most surveys pay between $0.50 and $1.25, and many of them take less than 5 minutes to do. You can read our full Survey Junkie review for more info.

Even in the age of automation, some jobs still require a human touch. Companies often outsource those jobs via services like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. These jobs can be tedious — tagging images, transcribing videos, classifying receipts — and can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Pay depends on the task, and the person requesting the work gets to approve the finished product before paying you. That can leave room for scams, so do your research and join a community like TurkNation, which can steer you away from shifty dealers. Read more about doing tasks on Mechanical Turk.
This is a fantastic article and it really has given me help. I want to go to this thing in the summer called Creation Fest and it has music and speackers to celebrate God and it costs a lot!

Find your niche partners, collaborators, and champions: As you’re creating your course, look for notable people who are also creating content in the space. Look at how their businesses operate and incorporate that into your own plan. You can also reach out to any influencers and make them affiliates for your own course. This way, they’ll be incentivized to share your content with their own audiences (which can be a major way to generate your first sales and start building your own community!)
With over 20 million active members, Swagbucks is the premier destination for paid survey takers looking to earn money for giving their opinion online. Swagbucks provides access to tens of thousands of paid survey-taking opportunities every day. With every online survey, you are affecting key decisions from major companies and organizations. More survey opportunities means more chances to make your opinion count - and more earning potential for you! Unlike most other online survey sites, Swagbucks will even give you a bonus when you don’t qualify for a survey, meaning you never miss out on getting paid.
Create a killer course experience: With your course validated and in the works, you need to figure out how people will take it. Most course creators choose to host their courses from their own websites. This way, they get all the value of bringing customers back to their site on a regular basis. I host my own courses from a subdomain on my own site so I can easily add more. The course experience is incredibly important as well. And after trying most of the solutions, I highly recommend Teachable—an online platform designed specifically for courses.
Write and publish an eBook. You don’t need a traditional publisher and financial backing to publish your own book anymore.

26. Services – You can offer a paid service, such as life coaching, blog coaching, goal setting or financial planning. Just be sure to investigate all the legal implications and make sure you’re not claiming to be a professional if you’re not one. With a service like this, you’re basically using your blog to sell yourself. You’ll need to convince people that you’re worth buying and then be able to back up your claims once they purchase your service.
We charge the members (the people who want to contact you) a small fee to access our website. They pay a small fee to us, which allows them to contact you. There are 2 great benefits to a system like this. The first benefit is that this only allows you to be contacted by paying members of our website, meaning you won't have random people contacting you. The second benefit is that if a member contacts you to make plans, they have paid a membership fee and are 100% serious about hiring you.
A word of caution: Remember that where very little is required, very little is offered. These jobs don’t pay much, and they are not going to provide a reference for your resume. It may take working at several different of these online jobs to pull in the income you want. And as always, know the signs of a work-at-home scam as you sort through the opportunities.
I have been researching Affiliate Marketing for a while now, but I got confused each time I read new article on the subject. I was hoping to get more confused when I started reading this write up, but instead it explained to me in clear terms, the meaning of Affiliate Marketing. I can say that the foundation for leaning the subject has just been laid in my mind.
You shouldn’t notice any difference and the link will never negatively impact the product. Plus the editorial line (the things we write) is NEVER impacted by these links. We aim to look at all available products. If it isn't possible to get an affiliate link for the top deal, it is still included in exactly the same way, just with a non-paying link. For more details, read How This Site Is Financed.
File-Sharing: Web sites that host directories of music, movies, games and other software. Users upload content to file-hosting sites and then post descriptions of the material and their download links on directory sites. Uploaders are paid by the file-hosting sites based on the number of times their files are downloaded. The file-hosting sites sell premium download access to the files to the general public. The websites that host the directory services sell advertising and do not host the files themselves.
An excellent online travel magazine headed by a good friend of ours, Tim Leffel, Perceptive Travel has won many awards and has one my vote as the best submission guidelines page of any website on this list. They’re looking for well-written travel pieces and not cliché magazine type titles. They want around 6 images included with each submission, but Tim claims to be “light-handed” on the editing. Tim is also one of the longest running veterans when it comes to travel writing, so he knows what it’s like when you’re trying to get paid to write online and he can likely help you out.

Hey friends! I am so sorry that I have been absent the last week. We had some unexpected family circumstances come up, and truthfully...my full attention was needed by my family. They are my first priority, and I need them to know that! To briefly let you know what's going on, I'll try the edited version. My husband has been reassigned to an Army medical facility, where he will stay for the next 6 months to a year...10 hours away...without his family. He got the call Monday afternoon that he was to report the next morning, so he threw his stuff in the truck and had to hit the road. It all happened extremely fast and unexpectedly and we are still reeling. At least, I am! It has been a rough week adjusting to some major changes in our lives, but we are making it. I keep reminding myself that things could always be worse...because I know that's true. I am thankful that we are all healthy and happy (for the most part), and that is a blessing!
In the midst of my meltdown, I received a package in the mail. I had forgotten about the cutie patootie vintage fan I ordered from Etsy last week. It was a much needed pick me up when I really needed it the most. My friend, Kate...Centsational Girl, opened her etsy shop recently and I absolutely fell head over heals in love with this little fan. As soon as I saw that it was my signature color... I knew it had to be mine!
And because I am a loser and didn't even realize my 1 year Bloggiversary came and went...I'm having a giveaway to celebrate...a month late! It's a great little package full of some of my favorite things. The most ginormous nest you've ever laid eyes on. The BEST Martha Stewart book...Crafts and Keepsakes for the Holidays (hardcover). A sweet little apron made with the most adorable Amy Butler fabric and pom pom fringe! And a personalized Christmas ornament made by ME for YOU.
Look at these precious stockings made with old sweaters...buttons, collars, and all! This is one of my favorite craft ideas from the book. It is absolutely full of wonderful ideas. Martha never disappoints!
To enter to win, just leave a comment on this post...nothing more, nothing less. Easy peasy. I will leave the giveaway open until Sunday November 15 at noon, and announce the winner Sunday night.
I just want to say thank you to all of my wonderful readers, who I feel, are also my friends! I am so glad that I started this blogging journey, and never could have imagined what it had in store for me. I've met some lifelong friends who I treasure and look forward to meeting many more! I am truly blessed to be a part of something so special. So...thank you...for reading, commenting, coming back every day even when I'm not here, being my friend, and sticking with me! For that I am grateful!
Maybe because I'm first it will be my lucky day! I love the giveaway. So generous and so adorable. Be strong for your family. Mom's are the glue.
Sorry to hear about your sudden shift, your family is in my prayers. Thank you for the service your husband and your family offer to protect our freedom. Thank you will never be enough. I'm excited about the giveaway! Happy Blogiversary!
I can understand what you are facing in the next year...my husband has been in the same type of situation where he was needed at an air force base that was far enough away that he had to live there for a year, but we couldn't go with him. I'm sorry you are having to deal with this right now.
I'm sorry to hear you were thrown a curve this past week with your hubby's reassignment. Of course, family comes first ~ always!

I love your etsy goodies! :) I'm sorry to hear your family is to be seperated...I'm an army wife as well and get to experience my first deployment in March when my husband is expected to leave for Afganistan:( Glad to have "stumbled" across your blog this morning:) God Bless~aubrey

Prayers are being sent your way... As a former Air Force wife, I know full well how deployments can throw you and your family completely off... how desperately you try to keep things stable and how it always seems that the moment your husband walks out the door, appliances commit harri-karri, the car develops a mind of its own, your children turn into monsters from the deep, and you can't sleep for weeks.
Thoughts to you and your family. Remember God is in control and His plan is greater than ours. (Simple for me to say, huh...)
Know that my prayers are with you and your family, I know it must be difficult especially when the holdays are around the corner. Thank you for taking the time to blog, I look forward to reading it!! You give so much inspiration and encouragement. Keep your chin up!!!!
My prayers are with your family! I can't imagine having my husband gone for that long, but the Lord will definately provied for you all during this time!
Love following your blog and love the giveaway! Congrats on being a big 'blogger' for a year now! :) I'm hoping to follow in your footsteps too! :)
I'm so sorry to hear that your husband is having to go for 6 months. God bless him for protecting all of us! I know that you will miss him. I love your blog and I read it everyday. Sometimes I don't have time to leave a comment but just know that I do enjoy reading it everyday. Happy first blog anniversary!
Sorry to hear about your husband being so far away. Especially at the holidays. I just love your blog. Happy blogiversary!

That fan is adorable! I can see why it was a "pick me up"! I hope the adjustment will go smoothly for your family. Having been married to the military before, I understand completely how hard it can be, especially with children! With Veterans Day being yesterday I want to say THANK YOU to YOU ALL for the sacrifices you make daily, for my family, and this country as a whole!! It truly is humbling. Reminds me of this quote that I love, "There are only two forces who have ever offered to die for you. Jesus Christ and the American G.I. One died for your freedom, the other for your soul."-Unknown
Hi Amanda! I want you to know that I'll be lifting up you and your family in my prayers. What a crazy thing to have to go through. I'll be praying for strength for you all.
Definatly love the giveaway! Funyn story about that book - I have my grandmother's copy of it (she is now in a nursing home with alzheimers and hasn't known who any of us are for years now) so that book is extremely important to me. Well, two Christmas's ago, I left it sitting on my couch and a dog that we were baby sitting chewed the binding right off the book! I was soo upset. The book is still usable and good but boy was I ticked at that dog!

The HELICON LIFE project has been finished at 31 December 2016, meanwhile a new international project has been started. Hungarian, Slovak, Austrian, Czech and Serbian colleagues are working together in the PannonEagle LIFE project for the conservation of imperial eagles and for the elimination of predator poisoning between 2017 and 2022. Please visit the imperialeagle.eu site for actual information!
Read more about Follow the further news of the imperial eagles and the anti-poisoning program in the Pannonian region at the imperialeagle.eu site!
Although, fight against illegal bird poisoning may seem to be tilting at windmills, fortunately close cooperation of stakeholders has greatly improved the situation in recent years. MME/Birdlife Hungary had coordinated the EU and government funded Helicon Life programme between 2012 and 2016, which aimed to reduce poisoning of the Imperial Eagle.
MAVIR (the Hungarian Transmission System Operator Company Ltd.), in collaboration with MME/Birdlife and the Herman Ottó Institute, organized an international bird conservation conference on 7-8 November 2016.
Another, satellite-tracked Saker Falcon was electrocuted, this time in Slovakia. The case was revealed by the bird's transmitter. So far, six adult Saker Falcons have received GPS-based tracking devices in the frame of the conservation project "Securing prey sources for endangered Falco cherrug and Aquila heliaca populations in the Carpathian basin” (RAPTORSPREYLIFE) LIFE13 NAT/HU/000183, supported by the European Union.
Birds of preys have always been considered by game-keepers as pests which take a serious toll on the populations of their “precious” small game species. One would never think that certain raptors, notably Imperial Eagle and White-tailed Eagle in Hungary, being on the top of the food chain, are the most effective regulators of the populations of such species, mainly corvids and mammalian predators, which are hunted legally otherwise, therefore benefitting hunters.
The main objective of the HELICON LIFE+ programme, which runs from 2012 through 2016, is to reduce the number of crimes (poisoning, shooting and nest robbing) committed against raptor species among them the Imperial Eagle as our main priority. One of the project elements is nest guarding carried out by volunteers.
HELICON LIFE project paid particular attention to informing professional groups and coordinating different fields of expertise. Within the framework of the project, 79 workshops and conferences were organized, and associates held presentations on 55 further events between 2012 and 2016. Altogether, more than twelve thousand people attended these events.
Among several projects, the HELICON Life project also shared its experiences at a recent platform meeting in Athens.

Beer #7 was a wonderful Tripel Karmeliet (or here in Dutch which you can translate with Google). Belgian beers oftenimes come in Singles, Dubbels, and Tripels (yes that is the correct spelling), which refers to the amount of malt, and therefore the alcohol content. More malt, more to ferment, more alcohol. Read about it here:
Dubbels and tripels generally have rich malt aromas with raisiny or fruit esters. Tripels may even have a citrus-like essence, with mild to moderate clove spiciness. There should be no detectable signs of butterscotch or diacetyl. They may have a balance of moderate hoppiness, or may only have a faint touch of pleasant bitterness. There should be no roasted malt aromas.
Dubbels are generally a dark amber to rich brown in color. Tripels mimic tones from golden sunlight to the rich amber of a topaz gem. The head retention varies, and may be adversely affected by the high alcohol content. Tripels, however, are usually highly effervescent, without disturbing the smooth body feel.
Beer #8 was last night at WOS Bar, which does not serve Belgian beers but has a wide selection of other international beers.
I had a Kilkenny, an Irish Beer. It was dark so the picture didn't come out well (despite Alex's best effort to light it up with his iPhone screen!)
A huge jazz friend back home recommended I visit Le Petit Journal, referred to as the "high temple" of New Orleans Jazz. Their website (in French) is here.
They have a different show every night except Sunday, with most acts returning monthly, looking at their calendar brochure.
The club is just a 5 minute walk from our apartment at 71, Boulevard Saint-Michel in the heart of the Latin Quarter across from Luxembourg Gardens just as you exit the Luxembourg RER B station.
I will get a better picture of the street entrance later but this was taken at night with my iPhone.
The name comes from the daily newspaper published in Paris from 1863 to 1944. I assume the jazz club now occupies the same building as there are framed copies of old newspaper on the walls.
As you can see from the picture above, it would be very easy to pass this non-descript storefront and assume nothing interesting takes place there.
This is some of the best New Orleans Jazz you will ever hear. Take it from someone who knows nothing about jazz :)
The price is 17-20 EUR which includes a mandatory first drink. Subsequent drinks are normal price. You can also have dinner for 44-47 EUR which also includes the first drink. And of course you get about 3-4 hours of jazz in a cozy cellar.
When I say cozy, I mean cozy. I don't think you could fit more than 100 people downstairs and even then they might have to be standing. Some of the tables are so close to the band you could almost reach out and touch them. I would guess there were no more than 50 people there for this show.
The peformer was a soprano sax player named Marc Laferriere although the band was a quintet (acoustic guitar, sousaphone, clarinet, and drums).
I was able to talk to the drummer, also a woman, during their first break and discovered that the clarinetist and drummer (Deborah Tropez) are sisters and later found out that the drummer is dating the guitarist who is the son of Marc Laferriere. Only the sousaphonist was disconnected :)
I discovered that they play about 43 "gigs" a year, with greater frequency in the summer. They live in the Paris region but travel to jazz festivals and other events primarily throughout France. I also learned a little about the French "welfare" system as I asked if they could support themselves playing less than one night a week. She explained that part-time workers receive government subsidies. I don't believe the US has "part-time" unemployment compensation -- maybe they do -- but this allows them to focus on their music and still support themselves apparently.
The other interesting fact is that they had only played with Marc once before and they do not practice with him in advance. As he travels from location to location, he simply brings in the people (and instruments) he needs and they improvise from there.
You could see Aurelie reading a song sheet between songs and discussing with Marc what to play next. They would ask each other which songs they knew and when they settled on one, off they would go. Solos were very frequent as each musician would "hand off" to the next and then all would come together on the "chorus." As a non-musician, I found it all rather fascinating the way they could make it work.
My brother-in-law Joe played the alto sax for 7 years and thought all the musicians were flawless but was particularly impressed with Aurelie.
If you Google her, she shows up quite a bit. One site, Jazz Lives, shows several videos of her paired with a pianist at the Whitley Bay International Jazz Festival in July.
Around midnight, two other musicians showed up, a trumpeteer and alto saxist. Aurelie later told me that they had finished performing somewhere else and just showed up to "jam." So now we had 7 musicians and each would take turns with a song and do a little showing off.
I was able to record 3 of their songs (5 to 8 minutes each) with my iPhone to give you a taste of what the evening was like. If you listen carefully, you should be able to distinguish the instruments in each solo section.
Here are a couple of grainy pics with my iPhone, the second taken from our table. You can see how cozy the jazz cellar is.
One of the benefits (or curses?) of visiting a large city like Paris is running into street performers. Sometimes it is a musician in the metro or in front of a cafe, or a painter on the street, or a comedian near a monument.
(Of course, the hope for all of these "entertainers" is that you will throw a few coins in the hat at the end of the performance.)
Brittain took a few videos of some break dancers last week. I think you will find them pretty entertaining. The first one is almost 5 minutes long but it is worth waiting to the end to see the guy slide across the pavement on his head (ok, he did have a helmet on but it was still pretty crazy).
The other two are at the Trocadero across the river from the Eiffel Tower (which you can see in the first video at the end as the dancer slides into the group photo of some Indian tourists -- the photog was not amused) and are 70 and 39 seconds long, respectively.

Sept 22, 2001 was HF Day dedicated to new and newly upgraded hams to see, touch and operate HF rigs, ask questions and get advice from old timers.
It was a beautiful blue sky day at Sand Island Park as over 40 hams and ham-wannabes came out from 10 AM until almost 5 PM. Seven stations were set up with everything from QRP, SSB, RTTYand CW. First QSO went to Finland followed by Sakhalin Island (Russia), Argentina, Japan, Australia and a bunch of states.
Special thanks to two guys, Kimo KH7U and Walt AH6OZ for efforts over and beyond the call of duty to make the day a success.

Scott Kelly and his twin brother, Mark Kelly-also an astronaut-were the subjects of the study that sought to find out exactly what happens to the body after a year in space. Per Live Science, even though Scott and Mark Kelly once boasted the same DNA makeup, Scott's almost yearlong trip on the International Space Station in 2015 and early 2016 changed all of that-leaving him with a lower body mass, altered gut bacteria, and a seeming growth spurt of 2 inches, among other shifts. It is clear that most of the changes that the astronaut went through have reversed following his return to planet Earth, however, 7 per cent of Scott's genetic code remains altered and it might as well stay the same permanently.
NASA attributed this to "the stresses of space travel, which can cause changes in a cell's biological pathways and ejection of DNA and RNA".
In 2015, when Scott Kelly spent a year in space, NASA gave NASA the opportunity to examine the possible differences between monozygotic twins and to draw conclusions on how the human organism is affected by space. At present, astronauts only spend six months on the International Space Station as standard. A Mars mission would last as long as three years, which would obviously be the longest stretch that any human has been away from Earth.
"Oftentimes, when the body encounters something foreign, an immune response is activated", Christopher Mason, a Twins Study researcher and associate professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, told Business Insider.
The Twins Study Investigators came from around the country to meet and share their final research results at the annual Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop held in Galveston, Texas in January 2018.
The researchers linked space travel to oxygen deprivation stress, increased inflammation and striking nutrient shifts that affect gene expression. When Scott returned to Earth 340 days later, one thing became evident - the brothers were no longer identical. Some changes returned to baseline within hours or days of landing, while a few persisted after six months. "Additionally, a new finding is that the majority of those telomeres shortened within two days of Scott's return to Earth". Researchers now know that 93 percent of Scott's genes returned to normal after landing. At least this was the result of NASA analyzes, after which the scientists announced that their DNA had been changed by 7%. This summary is set to be released later this year.
Here's a great review from a game designer of a book from 1951 about a 1938 match of a relatively unknown game (in the United States at least). I know, it sounds esoteric and boring, but it's really about what happens when you make a slight change to the rules of a game, and how the game can forever be changed.
Updating match settings (patches!?!), claims of gaining the system (hacking!?!) and rage quitting - they're not new concepts no matter what online video gamers may think. Even if you don't know the first thing about the ancient Japanese game of Go (I don't) or ever intend to read the book, check out the review. It's pretty interesting.

I can’t believe the how many cables and wires and batteries (and the things that need them) are going on this trip with me. How did people travel 20 years ago?! Here’s my list of items that plug into the wall and I’m sure I’m forgetting stuff…
This trip is A LOT more planned out than I normally would want it to be, but the World Cup schedule and the number of travelers it brings to South Africa (not to mention the questionable security and other safety concerns) demand for that sort of preparation. Some of the cities that are hosting World Cup matches aren’t used to this volume of tourism, and they don’t have the accommodation to support an influx of hundreds of thousands of (mostly) Americans and Europeans. That made it essential to book the entire trip in advance… which has not been easy. I didn’t make it any easier on myself as I arranged a crazy itinerary to try to see a lot of the country in the 23 days we’re there. Here’s the snapshot of our whirlwind tour of South Africa.
Looking at that now, I’m kind of intimidated at the pace. But for those of you scoring at home that’s at least 6 World Cup matches, 6 domestic flights, 5+ days on safari, 1 run-in underwater with apex predators and some wine. And much more.
But it’s all about the Beautiful Game. Maybe you have World Cup fever, maybe you don’t…. but ESPN is rightly (and finally) treating this World Cup like the Great White Shark of sporting events – top of the pyramid. Since I don’t have any fun photos to share today, here’s a link to an ESPN promo spot that perfectly captures what the World Cup is all about.
Now the fun part: Pick a team. Well, pick a second team – as we should all be supporting our guys. But pick another team. It doesn’t matter what the reason… maybe you like Argentinian wine, or Australian shepherds, or Ivory Coast’s orange uniforms, or you’re perplexed by North Korea’s bizarre America-hating/Americana-loving leader, or curious about Slovenia and its population of only 2 million. It’s fun to learn the stories of the teams and athletes from parts of the world that we’re not familiar with.
US will finish second in the group, win in the Round of 16 and lose to Argentina in the quarterfinal due to questionable officiating.
Hey! Watched the Germany-Australia game today on ABC-TV. Couldn’t see you in the crowd, however! Assume you were there tooting on one of those noisy horns!
looking back at your predictions: 0-fer! remind me to not come to you for predictions…see my page with prediction that US would win our group.

You know what makes me sick? You know what makes me so mad I just wanna cook clams with the steam coming out of my ears?
Yeah – today I actually want to talk about being angry. Did you ever go monkey – nuts on somebody and just about lose it. Maybe somebody cut you off in traffic – or your kid did something stupid. And you kind of transform into a raving, spittle covered lunatic. Yeah – we all been there.
But when you get done… you think to yourself – it was good to let that out. You can’t let rage like that stay bottled up inside you. You’re liable to dent some organs or something.
Well – it turns out – your angry outburst is actually more dangerous for your health. Scientists say right after going crazy – butt nuts – your chances of having a heart attack increases eight fold. Paint-peeling anger can also lead to stroke, illegal heartbeats, sleeping problems… and a general decline in your chances of being alive.
You know what this means, don’t you? I am living on borrowed time. In fact – I hope y’all appreciate the fact I come here every day to commentate – at great personal risk to my own health and well-being.
Now some people might be thinking – if Earl Pitts is gonna make it through this life another ten years or so… he has got to learn to control his anger. He has got to let stuff roll off his back. He’s got to learn to roll with the punches.
I only get angry because I run into certified, brain-dead, butt-wipes on a regular basis. I don’t enjoy being angry. I don’t take blood pressure pills because they taste good. I don’t got to channel my anger. Y’all got to channel the stupid.
I got caught Smuggling Snacks in a Movie Theater - Earl Pitts. American | Political Humor | Redneck Commentary | Earl Pitts Radio Bits
I ain’t proud to say this… but me and my ‘ol lady have engaged is lawlessness. That’s right – we got caught…smuggling. I might as well tell you what happened… it’s probably gonna be in all the papers anyhow.
So anyways… what happened was – they caught us smuggling snacks into the movie theater. Yeah – we got caught up in that big Twizzler sting this weekend.
First of all – I disagree with the rules. I don’t know what freedom-loving, god-fearing country on this planet would allow their movie theaters to be a police state. In America… you got the freedom of speech. You got the freedom of religion… the right to bear arms… the right to assemble. An’ yet – you can walk into a movie an’ you ain’t got the right to have a box a’ Sno Caps already in your pocket??!!? How did the founding fathers miss that one???

Home / Sectional Title & Estates / Sectional title corner – is my balcony’s repair my responsibility?
My balcony is leaking and I need the body corporate to fix it. But the chairman tells me that it is each owner’s responsibility as you are the only one who has access to your balcony. Is this true? – Shahiem
The answer is unfortunately not that simple. We will first have to determine the status of your balcony. There are three possibilities of what it could be:
An exclusive-use area: this is the complicated one. If it is exclusive use in terms of the plans (registered exclusive use) then the body corporate must maintain but recover the costs by having you pay an exclusive-use levy. If it is exclusive use in terms of the rules (rule-based exclusive use) then the rules will determine who is responsible for maintenance thereof. If the rules state that the owner is responsible, the body corporate cannot charge an exclusive-use levy for this and if the rules say nothing about responsibility for maintenance then the body corporate must maintain and charge an exclusive-use levy to cover the costs.

For years, Republicans and Democrats have used an arcane budget rule known as reconciliation as a bulldozer of sorts to blast through threats of a filibuster and achieve major budget and tax measures. Reconciliation has been used more than 20 times to pass measures ranging from a sweeping welfare reform and children’s health insurance program to massive tax cuts in 2001 and 2003.
The Democrats used reconciliation again in March 2010, to amend the Affordable Care Act three days after the landmark legislation was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama. But until now, the rule was never envisioned as a legislative jackhammer to literally wipe out a major piece of legislation before it fully took effect. .
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 ruling that validated the health care reform law largely by concluding that the penalty it would impose on people who refuse to buy insurance constituted a tax, enraged and galvanized Republicans are vowing to repeal the legislation any way they can.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky confirmed on Fox News Sunday that budget reconciliation would be the weapon of choice in killing off the health care reform law – provided, of course, the Republicans manage to unseat Obama, take back control of the Senate and retain control of the House in November. By employing this fast-track procedure, the party in power can pass major tax and budget legislation with a simple 51-vote majority, instead of the 60-vote super majority that’s typically needed to overcome a filibuster and get anything done in the Senate.
“Look, reconciliation is available because the Supreme Court has now declared [the penalty] a tax,” McConnell said. “They have unearthed the massive deception that was practiced by the president and the Democrats, constantly denying it was a tax.”
Budget reconciliation, a provision of the 1974 Congressional Budget Act, is designed to force committees to make changes in revenue or entitlement spending, such as Medicare and Medicaid. It was conceived by lawmakers as a way to bring down the deficit by easing the path for budget and tax deals.
The rules for budget reconciliation in the Senate restrict the procedure to provisions dealing with the budget. They also set strict protocols for consideration of the bills in both chambers. Under the procedures for reconciliation bills, debate in both houses is limited to 20 hours, and no Senate filibusters are allowed. The late Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), the patriarch of the Senate and a master of its rules, helped design a set of six conditions under which any portion of a reconciliation measure could be deemed "extraneous" to the budget – neither adding to nor subtracting from the deficit – and could be removed unless it garnered at least 60 votes.
Yet Congress has employed reconciliation many times to make major policy shifts that went far afield of simple deficit reduction initiatives. A sharp break with past practice took place in 2001, when Congress used the budget maneuver to enact a large tax cut proposed by President George W. Bush that greatly increased federal deficits and debt. Prior to that, every major reconciliation package enacted into law reduced the deficit. In 2003, Congress used reconciliation to pass another round of deficit-boosting tax cuts.
Democrats seized on the strategy again two years ago while trying to put together majorities in the House and Senate to pass Obama’s health care reform proposal. After a year of deliberation and wrangling, the Democratic-controlled House and Senate each passed a different version of health care reform in 2009. On November 7, the House passed its version of the bill on a 220-to-215 vote. On December 23, the Senate voted 60 to 39 to end debate on the bill, eliminating the possibility of a filibuster by opponents. The bill then passed on a party-line vote of 60 to 39 the next day.
For a variety of complex political reasons, the most viable option for the proponents of comprehensive reform was for the House to abandon its own health reform bill, and instead approve the Senate-passed bill. But in order to placate a number of House and Senate Democrats who had reluctantly backed the president on health care reform, the Democratic leadership agreed to pass separate legislation amending the Affordable Care Act to address those members’ grievances.
One amendment struck out a widely detested provision that would have provided a higher rate of Medicaid reimbursements for Nebraska – the so-called “Cornhusker Kickback” that was designed to win the support of Democratic senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Another amendment permitted dependent children through age 26 to be included on parents' plans.
But this time, the Democrats used reconciliation to pass the amendments. After Republican Scott Brown succeeded the late Democratic Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the Democrats could no longer count on a 60-vote majority, and turned to reconciliation as a safeguard. On March 26, 2010, the Senate approved the amendments, 56 to 43, and the House passed them, 220 to 2007.
The reconciliation tactic could now be used by the Republicans as a way to scuttle the Affordable Care Act next year. Of course, that depends on a GOP sweep: winning the White House and both chambers of Congress. That’s a tall political order but nonetheless plausible as Mitt Romney, the presumptive GOP nominee, closes in on Obama in the polls. “The single best thing we could do for the American health care system is to get rid of ‘Obamacare,’ get rid of that half a trillion dollars in Medicare cuts, get rid of the half a trillion dollars in taxes,” McConnell said over the weekend.
Asked by Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace whether he could undo Obamacare through budget reconciliation, McConnell replied, “Yes, the Chief Justice said it is a tax, and taxes are clearly what we call reconcilable. That's the kind of measure that can be pursued with 51 votes in the Senate. And if I'm the leader of the majority next year, I commit to the American people that the repeal of ‘Obamacare’ will be job one.”
Democrats have vowed to fight and thwart any GOP effort to dismantle the new law, including a vote scheduled in the House shortly after the July 4th recess to repeal the legislation. McConnell said he would press for a similar vote in the Senate before the November election, but that has no chance of passing as long as the Democrats retain control.
“I don't think the American people want to have this debate again,” White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew said over the weekend. “I don't think they want to be pulled back to decades of debate to get to where we are. We now have a law. The law is constitutional. We should implement it.”
To be sure, there are portions of the huge Affordable Care Act that may be immune to attack via reconciliation, and the Senate’s Parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, will have to rule on them. But most of the key provisions of the law – including the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, the creation of insurance exchanges where low-income families can buy subsidized policies, and Medicare and Medicaid funding measures – undoubtedly would be subject to reconciliation.
“The vast bulk of the important stuff is budgetary” and thus subject to reconciliation rules, Richard Kogan, a senior budget experts with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told The Fiscal Times on Monday. “It either costs money or saves money, and it’s either on the revenue side or the spending side – and it’s budgetary.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter said Tuesday that it plans to buy Indian mobile marketing company ZipDial as it tries to reach new users in developing regions.
ZipDial connects brands with consumers in emerging markets where mobile data is expensive and Wi-Fi connections are limited. With ZipDial, consumers bypass data charges. They call a unique phone number, hang up and ZipDial sends them free texts or voicemails with sports scores, coupons or other content and information.
Calling and hanging up is also a way to follow users of Twitter. A phone number can be assigned to politicians or celebrities, for example, and users automatically receive tweets through texts instead of going to Twitter's website or app. Phone numbers can be printed on billboards, newspaper ads or TV commercials. Founded in 2010, ZipDial has created campaigns for beverage maker PepsiCo and toy maker Mattel Inc., according to its website.
At the end of June, Twitter had 271 million average monthly users. The company said the acquisition will give people access to its service in Brazil, India, Indonesia and other countries where people are going online for the first time.

If we're honest, most of us could do with loosing a few pounds? However, it's one thing actually admitting we're over weight but quite another doing anything about it.
Many people set out to lose weight with good intentions of sticking it out until they reach their goals. In fact, they intend to lose those unwanted extra pounds for good without ever seeing them again. So then, why is it that so many people lose weight only to gain it all back again? And why is it that so many people get frustrated and quit trying before they even lose any weight?
Of course dieting to lose weight takes some planning and some will power to stay with it, but a big part of the reason why so many people seem to be on a perpetual diet but never seem to lose weight often has less to do with their will to want to do it, and more to do with falling victim to some common mistakes dieters regularly make. Let's look at some of these mistakes and some solutions to them.
One big mistake that dieters make is assuming that certain foods can be eaten in high quantities such as fat-free foods. It needs to be understood that just because a food is fat-free doesn't mean it is calorie free. When you consume more calories than you use, you will gain, not lose, weight.
Many people who tried one of the many low-carb diets out there thought that they could eat as much as they wanted as long as the food they ate had low or no carbs. This way of thinking is wrong. It is still a matter of controlling the size of your portions that makes the difference. Keeping track of your overall calorie intake each day is imperative to a proper weight loss plan.
Another mistake that is made by dieters is expecting too much too soon. When you come to the conclusion that you want to lose 30 pounds, this is a realistic goal. When you decide that you want to lose those 30 pounds in one month, this is not a realistic goal. Maybe your 25th high school reunion is coming up and you want to be able to fit into that dress or suit you wore 25 years ago.
This is only possible if you take the time to allow yourself to properly attain that goal. Weight loss is best done at 1-2 pounds a week, not at 1-2 pounds a day, so set a small goal of say losing 5-7 pounds in a month, then set another similar goal and so on, until you reach your ultimate goal.
Not eating enough is yet another common mistake dieters make. The fact is, if you eat too little calories, your metabolism will slow down and you will go into what is known as "starvation mode". This promotes major fat conservation for survival purposes and any weight loss will therefore come from the breakdown of muscle tissue, not fat! For the average adult female, it is not recommended to consume below 1000 calories and the average adult male should not consume below 1200 calories unless under the direction of their doctor.
for how to keep their weight down once they lose it. Often, people make the mistake of going on a "miracle" diet that promises super weight loss and although these types of diets are very dangerous and I absolutely do not recommend them, some people actually do lose weight on them. The problem is, these types of diets are designed to end at some point (which is a good thing since you would probably make it into the obituaries with a prolonged stay on these diets). That means that you would likely resume your old habits when it's over thus accounting for the returning of all the weight you lost on the diet.
Of course getting some exercise is a key part in successful weight loss as well, but putting together a well thought out eating plan designed to stay with you for the rest of your life is the real key to taking that extra weight off and keeping it off for good. Be careful not to get caught making the mistakes mentioned here and you will have a much better chance at weight loss success.

When Isolation Routing double sided PCB’s I drill two holes in the PCB blank (one is the datum and one the reference) to locate the work on two pins in the spoil board on the machine. This method enables good location of the tracks when machining each side and also for hole drilling etc. (always using the same datum point for X zero / Y zero).
After reading this post, on the Artsoft forum and watching the video http://www.machsupport.com/forum/index.php/topic,22555.0.html I thought I would try visual location of the datum and reference holes (using my cross hair pointer) and use ‘Local System Rotate’ just to see if it was an easier method.
Then using 3 CB buttons (at the bottom of my Mach screen) it is as easy as ABC. Well it’s almost that easy.
Obviously this was only experimental so it is bit of a ‘quick & dirty’ solution and it needs work to tidy up the user interface side of things but it works.
Button C is where the calculation takes place – the current X and Y axis position (reference) is used to calculate ArcTan of the angle which is then used to set the Local System Rotate. The offset between the cross hair pointer position and the spindle position is factored in and the X and Y axis moved to bring the spindle to the datum position. Jog speed is reset to normal etc. and the status message ‘Complete’ is displayed.
As it turns out this method works very well and in operation is an equivalent to the system used in the aforementioned video. It can handle any rotation or position of the work (within + / - 90 degrees).
Although the accuracy I achieved is acceptable it could definitely be much improved by using a webcam for the hole location and Klaus’s video window (camera plugin). http://www.kd-dietz.com/klausph....on.html
It is not a quicker method than my existing system of using the two dowel pins but it may have advantages with odd shaped circuit boards and possibly alteration of existing boards so definitely warrants further investigation.
WELL - fitting a USB webcam to use with the on-screen video window could be considered akin to playing the lottery – you pay your money and take your chance. I had to smile when one member commented that ‘plug and play’ should be renamed ‘plug and pray’.
As the saying goes ‘third time lucky’. After two unsuccessful attempts, using different devices, the third ‘plug and play’ webcam works perfectly with my machine PC.
This has proved much easier and quicker than using the cross-hair pointer so I now have some more work to make this a permanent addition to my machine.
I have just discovered a problem with my particular little webcam – it appears that the guts are assembled to the cable then drawn into the housing and only secured at the cable exit end. When fitted to the machine, if the cable is moved (twisted) the internal image sensor can rotate slightly thus spoiling the accuracy of the positioning.
My solution was to remove (destroy) the front window, apply a couple of spots of adhesive to secure the image sensor PCB to the housing then make and fit a new window (it was doubtful if the existing window could be removed without damaging it). There is probably a better (easier) way to solve this problem but the image sensor PCB is now secure and all is well again.
I have now posted the full details of my current implementation (subject to change, in the light of experience ) here; http://hobbycncart.com/publ....-1-0-41
Well, it appears that I, too, have been a victim of Chinese Quality No-Control. My camera is tight re: movement of the cable, BUT, it's alignment with the center line of the housing is off by about an estimated ten degrees. Just a small fraction of Z height shifts the view (cross hairs) rapidly to the side of the target point. It will be impossible to establish any offset values to my LD with this camera since the offset is so height dependent. Possibly an adjustable mounting (mine is now similar to yours) would allow correction, but it's not worth it to me to try and make one. I might try to remove the lens to see if it can be fixed, but have more pressing things to do just now.
Guess I was lucky on this one but for my laser cross-hair pointer I had to re-machine the mounting surface of the bracket a number of times before it was in correct alignment. Could you perhaps use a shim (or two) to get it correct ??
Well, I'm not giving up. It is still a neat, small package camera and well suited for our needs. I will see about removing the housing and making a new custom one.
If you do end up taking it apart I would be most interested to see a picture of exactly what is inside the housing

The operator recently completed the first well, 103/16-29-063-6W6M well (the "103/16-29 Well"), with a 3000m horizontal leg in the Montney Formation. During the last 24 hours of a 210-hour production test, the 103/16-29 Well flowed at an average rate of 11.6 MMcf/d of natural gas and 990 bbls/d of condensate (2,922 boe/d). Although the early results from the 103/16-29 Well are encouraging they are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or ultimate recovery.
The operator is exercising its option to tie-in the 103/16-29 Well to third-party processing facilities. Questerre will hold a royalty interest in the 103/16-29 Well subject to standard payout provisions.
Michael Binnion, President and Chief Executive Officer of Questerre, commented, “These tests results are very promising. They suggest Kakwa North has the potential to deliver similar results as our production in the immediate area. We are looking forward to the results from the second well that is currently being tested.”
Questerre Energy Corporation is leveraging its expertise gained through early exposure to shale and other non-conventional reservoirs. The Company has base production and reserves in the tight oil Bakken/Torquay of southeast Saskatchewan. It is bringing on production from its lands in the heart of the high-liquids Montney shale fairway. And pursuing oil shale projects with the aim of commercially developing these massive resources.
Questerre is a believer that the future success of the oil and gas industry depends on a balance of economics, environment and society. We are committed to being transparent and are respectful that the public must be part of making the important choices for our energy future.
This news release contains certain statements which constitute forward-looking statements or information (“forward-looking statements”) including the Company’s view that the test results are very promising, that Kakwa North has the potential to deliver similar results to the Company’s adjacent producing acreage and the testing of the second well at Kakwa North. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of material factors, expectations or assumptions of Questerre which have been used to develop such statements and information but which may prove to be incorrect.
Although Questerre believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on them because Questerre can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Further, events or circumstances may cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted as a result of numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including, without limitation: whether the Company's exploration and development activities respecting its prospects will be successful or that material volumes of petroleum and natural gas reserves will be encountered, or if encountered can be produced on a commercial basis; the ultimate size and scope of any hydrocarbon bearing formations on its lands; that drilling operations on its lands will be successful such that further development activities in these areas are warranted; that Questerre will continue to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with past operations; results from drilling and development activities will be consistent with past operations; the general stability of the economic and political environment in which Questerre operates; drilling results; field production rates and decline rates; the general continuance of current industry conditions; the timing and cost of pipeline, storage and facility construction and expansion and the ability of Questerre to secure adequate product transportation; future commodity prices; currency, exchange and interest rates; regulatory framework regarding royalties, taxes and environmental matters in the jurisdictions in which Questerre operates; and the ability of Questerre to successfully market its oil and natural gas products; changes in commodity prices; changes in the demand for or supply of the Company's products; unanticipated operating results or production declines; changes in tax or environmental laws, changes in development plans of Questerre or by third party operators of Questerre's properties, increased debt levels or debt service requirements; inaccurate estimation of Questerre's oil and gas reserve and resource volumes; limited, unfavourable or a lack of access to capital markets; increased costs; a lack of adequate insurance coverage; the impact of competitors; and certain other risks detailed from time-to-time in Questerre's public disclosure documents. Additional information regarding some of these risks, expectations or assumptions and other factors may be found under in the Company's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other documents available on the Company’s profile at www.sedar.com. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Barrel of oil equivalent ("boe") amounts may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio has been calculated using a conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil and the conversion ratio of one barrel to six thousand cubic feet is based on an energy equivalent conversion method application at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent an economic value equivalent at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalent of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.

Around 250 years before current events, the New God Big Breeda gave birth to a daughter named Barda on the planet Apokolips. As was custom on the planet, the child was taken from her mother to be trained as a warrior in Darkseid's army. Sent to Granny Goodness' Home for Orphaned Youth, Barda was trained in combat and military tactics and as she grew, her skills and prowess in battle led to her being selected to become the leader of Darkseid's personal guard; the Female Furies.
Leading a distinguished career, when a rebel leader on Apokolips began secretly gathering children to train for a coup against Darkseid, Barda noticed when one of those children, Auralie; who was under her charge at the time, went missing and embarked to retrieve her; discovering the child with Scott Free; Darkseid's adopted son from New Genesis.
When the rebel group was discovered, the group's children and adults alike were brutally punished, with Barda and Scott standing as witnesses. Horrified at the situation, Scott decided that he must escape from Apokolips. Barda, who regretted what had happened to Auralie, decided to help him. With Barda's help he managed to make it safely to Earth, but she elected to remain behind on Apokolips.
Her dedication to Darkseid shaken and experiencing emotions she'd never felt before, Barda eventually decided to leave Apokolips as well and she traveled to Earth to find Scott Free, who had now become the renowned escape artist known as Mister Miracle.
Barda and Scott's feelings grew as they spent more time together, with Barda following Scott on tour and eventually moving to Bailey, New Hampshire. They were eventually married by the High Father and after the wedding the couple briefly left Earth to live on New Genesis, but later settled back on Earth for a number of years, assisting the then-current JLA team Justice League International. Unfortunately, they were frequently bombarded by strange visitors, circumstances and situations involving the superhero community, New Genesis and Apokolips and they moved to a loft in Greenwich Village, New York, where Barda took up a job as a professional female wrestler. With her stunning looks and fighting prowess, Barda soon sparked a wrestling fad known as "Bardamania" until she discovered that wrestling competitions were staged and she quit and formed a team of fellow wrestlers, forming a defense-training program for women called the New Female Furies.
Barda left Earth with Scott after their time with the Justice League and resided briefly on New Genesis. But they soon returned to Earth and took up residence aboard the Justice League Refuge. During this period, the couple separated briefly due to Scott's lack of consideration for her feelings. She went off to spar with Wonder Woman on Themyscira, before deciding to give Scott another chance and returning to New Genesis.
Later, Barda left New Genesis with Orion in order to join the Justice League of America as agents representing New Genesis for the JLA's battle with Mageddon, after which the two New Gods left the group again after the villain was defeated.
Scott and Barda later moved back to Earth again, this time to the suburbs of Connecticut, where they were living when Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman sought Barda's help in rescuing Supergirl from Apokolips. Barda, while still living as a homemaker and part-time warrior, has recently become a member of Oracle's Birds of Prey strike team and continues taking up adventures "as befitting of a warrior".
Barda's mother, Breeda, was one of Apokolips' greatest warriors who was coerced into providing her genes to create a new generation of warriors. Although she was not given the choice of who she could mate with, through considerable subterfuge, she arranged for a single sample to be fertilized by a man that she genuinely loved. The product of that union is Barda.
Barda enjoyed life on Earth and took genuine delight in being a housewife and homemaker. However, she was still inherently a warrior of the New Gods and naïve to many Earth customs. She often went about her household chores dressed in her battle armor, and usually managed to botch even simple meal preparation whenever she tried to cook. She also had a tendency to horde shopping coupons, managing to amass boxes full of them before being informed that the coupons usually have expiry dates and become useless after that date has passed.
Barda's signature weapon is the Mega-Rod, an Apokoliptian device that can corrupt the weak minded, the Mega-Rod fires extremely powerful concussive blasts as well as enabling the wielder to teleport and manipulate gravitational fields.
Barda was the inspiration for a young Apokoliptian warrior named "Little Barda" who came to Earth hoping to gain experience by becoming a member of the Teen Titans. However, she left the team soon after due to feeling that she was not getting the training she had expected to get from such an established group.
As a New God, Barda is actually colossal in physical size, with the natural size of a New God being multiple times the size of Earth, and uses the Boom Tube technology to re-scale herself to mortal proportions when traveling beyond New Genesis and Apokolips.

In Europe vast majority of system administrators and web services developers uses VPS and VDS services. This is a simple, cheap, and most important a convenient way to quickly deploy support for web projects, with full replacement of the functionality of a traditional dedicated server.
Conventional virtual server has one common operating system core and the customers do not have access to system files. This is due to the fact that in this way increases server stability, but greatly reduced the list of client options for configuring software and operating systems.
VPS server is better for experienced users who know what they are doing and what is the result in the end want to receive. Otherwise, the server may be stopped due to critical errors incompatibility with the software, become vulnerable.
Each virtual server runs on its own, dedicated copy of the virtual core that isolates it from other projects that are physically located on the same server machine. Roughly speaking, virtual dedicated servers are not physically tied to a specific physical server or hardware, and can be quickly moved and deployed on any other host.
The benefits compared to physical servers is obvious - the price of order is cheaper, there is no need to maintain, configure and support the work of the high-tech and expensive equipment. To get more details conserving what is VPS hosting and its types we ask you to read other our articles.

In the first part of ‘in the spirit of stress’ we looked at a possible link between an increase of a general stress level and developments mainly in the financial sector (see In the spirit of stress: Part 1).
Without turning to the medical or engineering literature to tell us, how they define stress, let us look at it from an everyday observation point of view.
As such, stress can be observed to show one or more of the following symptoms (feel free to add your own observations):
People bump into each other on the streets: they don’t pay attention to what is going on around them.
A person may be totally blocked; standing on a cross-road, not knowing whether to go left, right, straight ahead or back again.
Clearly, being absent-minded, does not in itself pose a huge problem. And usually, it doesn’t produce a feeling of fear, which is closely related to stress. However, when one stresses through the station or rushes to the shop, whilst at the same time trying to focus on writing or reading something on your smartphone or have a talk on your mobile, that clearly results in your nervous system receiving an overdose of information. I.e. Stress.
As stress clearly overloads the whole (nervous and sensory) system, it makes sense to do anything to alleviate this overload before the body or the psyche react in a complete shutdown. For instance:
Try and reduce outside sensory input as much as possible. Give your body a soothing rest after a hectic day at work. If possible, take a daily walk in nature. Leave your mobile at home!
Try and focus on the thoughts you cultivate. Cultivate friendly thoughts. This will soothe your system.
Try and align your thoughts with your speech. In other words: If we think one thing and voice something else, we are really telling a lie. Thus. Better to be still than tell even a friendly lie.
Try and cut down on alcohol, coffee, soft drinks. In fact, anything that is full of sugar, processed or in a can. When under stress, these items definitely are not of any help.
For more information on stress and how to manage stress keep an eye open for the upcoming e-book on the topic. I’ll have more information on the exact publishing date next week. OM.
From the earliest days of the organization, Rotarians were concerned with promoting high ethical standards in their professional lives. One of the world's most widely printed and quoted statements of business ethics is The Four-Way Test, which was created in 1932 by Rotarian Herbert J. Taylor (who later served as RI president) when he was asked to take charge of a company that was facing bankruptcy.
This 24-word test for employees to follow in their business and professional lives became the guide for sales, production, advertising, and all relations with dealers and customers, and the survival of the company is credited to this simple philosophy. Adopted by Rotary in 1943, The Four-Way Test has been translated into more than a hundred languages and published in thousands of ways. It asks the following four questions:

They are now on the run from the military organization, S.T.O.R.M., while still looking for Chase's father. However, a mysterious organization also has his eyes set on Chase and the group's Monsuno.

Everybody needs physical activity for good health. However, most children do not participate in any organized physical activity during non-school hours. See how inclusive after-school programs can help increase physical activity among children of all abilities.
Children and adolescents ages 6 years and older should perform at least one hour of physical activity each day. This amount of physical activity helps control weight, improves mental health, bone health and fitness, and reduces risk factors for chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Nevertheless, many children and adolescents are not getting this suggested amount of daily physical activity.
The lack of physical activity only increases for youth with a disability1. In fact, compared to youth without disability, youth with a disability have a 35 percent higher prevalence of overweight and obesity2 with an increased risk of secondary conditions associated with being overweight3.
After-school programs across the country have been working hard to provide opportunities for youth to get the recommended amount of physical activity. The most current data show that 10.2 million children take part in some after-school program and this number continues to rise4.
CDC’s funded partner, the National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD), is working with one such after-school program, Girls on the Run, to make the program more inclusive of young girls with disabilities.
Girls on the Run is a physical activity-based positive youth development program for young girls in grades 3 through 8. The program uses a fun, experience-based curriculum to teach life skills through dynamic, interactive lessons and running games. Running and physical activity are used to inspire and to motivate the girls, to encourage lifelong health and fitness, and to build confidence through accomplishment. At the end of each 10-week season, the girls, their coaches, and running buddies (family and community volunteers) complete a celebratory 5k running event that gives them a tangible sense of achievement and a framework for setting and achieving life goals.
Sadie is participating in the Girls on the Run curriculum inclusion pilot program with Girls on the Run Birmingham (Alabama) this spring. Sadie is in the 4th grade at E.P.I.C. Elementary School. She has a number of medical conditions that limit her ability to participate fully in mainstream programming, such as hemiplegia cerebral palsy, visual impairment and active epilepsy. Initially, Sadie’s parents had some concerns about their daughter participating in this mainstream program. In fact, this is the first mainstream program that Sadie, who is now 10 years old, has been able to participate in, as her parents have struggled to find activities and organizations that are inclusive. Sadie’s Girls on the Run coaches used the new curriculum development by Girls on the Run and NCHPAD; they consulted Sadie’s mom to make sure Sadie and the rest of the team have a truly positive, engaging, and inclusive experience. “We really had to focus on Sadie’s stamina as too much fatigue would increase her chance of seizure activity, but we also wanted her to be able to complete the 5k at the end of the season,” said Coach Kelly Bonner. “We continually walked the balance beam of what was too much or not enough.”
NCHPAD joined with Girls on the Run to create an inclusive curriculum that includes all girls. NCHPAD adapted the Girls on the Run curriculum using its tool, GRAIDs: Guidelines, Recommendations, and Adaptations Including Disability. This tool separates core program components into 5 areas that can be adapted for people with disabilities:
Sadie loves Girls on the Run! She talks about it every day and looks forward to the next session. We appreciate the opportunity for her to participate in a program that encourages friendships, self-advocacy, self-confidence, health, and fitness.
GRAIDs helps identify areas where adaptation is needed and provides recommendations for how best to adapt to make each area inclusive for people with disabilities. The result includes a set of evidence-informed recommendations or adaptations to put in the set curriculum or as an addendum to allow all kids regardless of ability to be able to take part in the program.
Fourteen of the 200 local councils across the U.S. implementing Girls on the Run are currently piloting the new inclusive curriculum. These 14 councils have the potential to reach over 16,000 girls in this spring season.
As the local councils implement the pilot program, Girls on the Run International is recognizing the need for additional changes, from the marketing to the practice space and 5k event locations. The new relationship with NCHPAD and the creation of the inclusive curriculum guide allows the councils to provide needed lesson adaptations for their girls and additional training for their coaches. Furthermore, it affords an opportunity for girls with disabilities to engage in physical activities with their peers.
As more organizations follow this example, youth of all abilities will find easier access to physical fitness and sports, which could potentially improve physical activity trends.
Interested in making your program inclusive of all? Contact NCHPAD to find out more about the GRAIDs framework and what you can do to help your organization Commit to Inclusion.
NCHPAD receives Disability and Health funding and support to improve the health, wellness, and quality of life of people with disabilities. NCHPAD seeks to help people with disabilities achieve health benefits through increased participation in many physical and social activities, including fitness and aquatic activities, recreational and sports programs, and adaptive equipment usage.

The question came up on one of the Facebook pages I frequent about a telephone solicitation for a “charity.”
The posted question was: “Two phone calls from cops for kids wanting money? Scam? They did have my name and address…”
Most of the following posts were about advice on how to deal with these types of calls or complaints about robo-callers. One of the posts said that the organization was legitimate and included a link to their website: http://www.copsforkidsinc.org/index.html
Cops for Kids, Inc. will NEVER telemarket with fundraising requests. All of our fundraising is done within Riverside County, California. If you are ever contacted via telephone from someone or some group posing as doing fundraising for our Cops for Kids, Inc. Please call Dave Fontneau, Executive Director for Cops for Kids, Inc. at 951.245.3389 immediately.
Clearly, they do not call people asking for donations and our group is not in Riverside, County, CA.
There is also a Cops for Kids (C4K) group sponsored by the Anaheim (CA) Police Department. They can be reached through the Anaheim City website and through their own website. i called the phone number on their website and asked if they ever solicited donations over the phone; can you guess the answer? Yeah, the answer was: NO.
There is also a Cops for Kids Charitable Foundation located in Kelowna, British Columbia , Canada, but I didn’t call them — and, I suppose there are numerous other such organizations scattered throughout the US.
Don’t answer the phone if the number is unknown to you. Even if you are home and in the mood to speak with someone, do not answer but let the call go to your answering machine or voice mail — listen in — if it’s legitimate, they’ll probably leave a message and you can pick up the phone or call them back. One of the problems with answering a robo/telemarketing call is that those people now are quite sure they have a “live” number — they’ll keep calling & they’ll include your number in the lists they sell other scam artists.
Get a call blocking device, NoMoRobo or a similar service if you can. They don’t stop all bad calls but many don’t get through.
Do not believe that a “charity” or other caller is legitimate just because they have your information — all of your information is out there and available. Don’t believe it? Google yourself. Anything you’ve posted on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. is available to everyone — and there are data-mining programs finding and collating this information every second of every day. Look up your own phone number on whitepages.com — you may find both your name and address listed. Value of your house, size, when it was built or sold — look it up on zillow.com. Want to know how much your neighbor pays in property taxes — look up his address in the county database. Everything is available out there — sometimes for a price from the bad guys — but it’s there and many of the bad guys have your information.
Never give your personal information to anyone who calls you. The bank doesn’t call you to check your birthday or your account and credit card numbers. The IRS doesn’t call you to ask for money or threaten to send you to jail. The Social Security System doesn’t call you to verify your account number and whether you’re eligible for its programs. Call your bank with a number you know is legit — better yet, go to your local branch — same goes for the IRS and SS. And one of the latest scams I’ve heard — NO, the county is not going to send a deputy sheriff to arrest you for not paying a fine for not going to jury duty — which you “ignored.”
No, your grandchild did not get arrested/have a serious accident/get kidnapped and you do not have to buy a gift card to pay his/her bail/emergency medical bills/ransom.
Yes, keep giving to charities but check them out first: CharityWatch, Charity Navigator, and BBB Wise Giving Alliance are the big three rating agencies. Give to the charity directly, not to an umbrella group — that’s just another layer of bureaucracy soaking up the money rather than helping those you want to help. Give to one, or a few charities, make your money count; don’t give nickels and dimes to a dozen groups.
Most of the people in this world are good; most of the people you will come into contact with are good; however, a few bad people with today’s computer technology can and do create a host of problems for those who are good.
Lastly, if you’d like to see my record of the possible scam calls I’ve received look here: http://joeaubuchon.net/suspected-spam-and-or-scam-phone-numbers/
And, my MS Word document of calls I’ve received over the last couple of years now stands at 151 pages in length.

Joe: This is the last video in the outrageous claims series. I want to talk about outrageous claims and why I do them and what it means to you. My goal is to give you a better understanding of why they’re not so outrageous and once you understand the trick behind the claim it’s no longer magic, it’s no longer outrageous, it’s now very accessible.
Joe: It makes it possible for you build your own business, to build your own system, to use the things I’m teaching in order to have the freedom to reduce the hours you work, increase your income, make enough money on one deal, perhaps, to live an entire year. Or, do one deal a month and just pop in for a couple hours and make a phone call now and then. Once you develop the skills to do this, once you set the systems in place to do this you can turn that into $100,000, $200,000, $500,000 where now you have the extra money, you’re going to want to buy properties with cash as well.
Joe: Stay away from lenders. They’re put you at the most risk and make all the profit. Give yourself time to succeed. No matter how outrageous the claims I make, the one thing that it always comes down to is can you be an entrepreneur? You have to have ability to speak and be persuasive. Being able to talk about what you’re doing and explain what you’re doing and show why it’s a benefit to people. It makes for a long term sustainable business because you’re actually serving people rather than trying to rip them off of the equity they have.
Joe: You want this to be sustainable and you want to have a good name in your community. Eventually people will get to know who you are and you want to keep that name solid. If you work honorably, if you try to solve peoples’ problems, if you try to get people where they need to go and help them understand what they need to do, then you’ll be happy because you’re helping other people. Jim Drell coined the phrase “the crying quotient,” or how many people, buyers and sellers, cry at closing.
Joe: We found over and over again when we’d go to a closing, we used to actually physically show up, that people would give us hugs and say, “I could never have bought a property without your help. Our credit wasn’t good. We didn’t have the income verification, thank you so much for helping my family get into a house.”
Joe: Sellers saying, “I tried so many different ways and I couldn’t get rid of my property and you helped me get rid of that property. Thank you so much for solving that problem.” Nothing feels better than hearing those words and knowing you’ve had an impact on other peoples’ lives.
Joe: When you have a business that is doing honorable, ethical work, it makes it fun. When you’re making a lot of money doing it, it makes it even more fun and you want to continue doing it for a long, long time.
Joe: I want to invite you to come work with me in my mentor program. You can find out more about it by going to zerodowninvesting.com or joecrump.com/partner and it explains how the mentor program works. It’s like going to college for a semester, and you get six months of my personal help through this process.
Joe: You’ll talk to me personally. I will give you materials and then we’re going to get on a conference call. We do that every other week. It’s a small group, typically ten to twenty people. We talk about the deals you’ve been working on, the roadblocks that you’re running into. We do role playing so I can teach you how to talk to people.

Most chiropractors regard the elimination of symptoms as the easiest part of a persons care. If all that the chiropractor does is to reduce the pain and stop there, the chances of the condition recurring are much greater. In order to prevent a rapid recurrence of symptoms, it is necessary to continue receiving care even though your symptoms are gone.
During the correction / restorative phase of your care, you will not have to receive adjustments as often as you did during the first phase of care and, depending on your particular circumstances, you may begin doing exercises and stretches either at the center or at home to help accelerate your healing.
Do not be discouraged if you have mild flare-ups in your symptoms on occasion. This is normal. Flare-ups are bound to occur during this phase because your body has not fully healed. Depending on the severity of your injury or condition and how long you have been suffering from it, this phase of your care may last anywhere from a few months to a couple of years.

One of the greatest things about having a garage for your extra items is being able to put things there that you wouldn’t ordinarily put in a garage. While some people just toss items asunder and leave things with blatant disregard for their true place of origin, there are some others who could never even have considered doing something so bold in a million years. For these people and for just about everyone else garage cabinets were invented. Putting something so friendly as a cabinet in an environment so surly as a garage knocks a lot of the wind out of a garage set up. Grandmas don’t need to be afraid to stick their jam or sauce inside of a garage cabinet, especially if the garage cabinet in question was one that has doilies that they put their any and was correctly sealed up from any outside interference by them.
If you’re looking for garage cabinet and you would like to find out more about putting some new cabinets in your garage then you should certainly consider or where cabinets are purchased. Oftentimes people think the cabinets are certainly something that only comes about when you do a new remodeling of say kitchen or bathroom; however this is not so. Cabinets can be purchased at any point either by themselves or in a group and you just need to look at some cabinetmakers catalogs or websites to find this fact out.
Once you have done significant research upon your garage cabinets and you know which type of garage cabinet you would like to put in your garage you need to find out about prices. You can often reach out to the people who sell these things either by going into a showroom, calling 800 number, or actually e-mailing them directly. Cabins for garage storage exists in any number of different combinations; you can find cheap garage cabinets for just storage of tools or you can get a very nice garage cabinets for storage of food, unused clothing, or other valuables that may need extra special attention.
If there are no garage cabinets to find that are up to your standards then you can maybe design your own garage cabinets if you are handy enough. This country in the modern world was found among people who build things with their hands and building a garage cabinet should not be out of the question for anybody who is of able-bodied. You can find plans to build garage cabinets on the Internet and download them for your own perusal. If you are online and you have found plans to build your garage cabinet than really all you need to do is get the supplies or order the pieces that go along with it. Sometimes garage cabinets are sold in pieces which makes them especially valuable to the person and may not be so handy you can even get Rubbermaid garage storage cabinets if you really can’t build. And there’s nothing wrong with that.

An efficiently operating economy is one of the key conditions for the successful development of any state. Historically, in many countries of the world many models of building up sovereign economic systems were implemented. Which of them were the most effective? What are the specific functions of the state economy that are necessary from the point of view of the successful social and political development of the country?
The economy, if we talk about the scale of the state, is an economic system within which various commodity-money relations are built with the participation of subjects in different legal status: citizens, legal entities, authorities, etc. Depending on the role of the state and the degree developed financial, managerial and legal institutions, the economy can be classified into three main types: traditional, market and command. The first is the most historically early.Gradually, it was transformed into a market economy, which, due to the profound modernization of key institutions in certain historical periods in some states, turned into a command economy. Now, however, most countries of the world are developing in the framework of a market model, which, however, in the framework of some national samples of development systems contains quite a few elements characteristic of a command economy.
Anyway, the key functions of the economic systems of all types are generally similar. Consider them, and also find out how they are expressed in each of the models.
First, the functions of the economy are associated with the distribution of national income, products, resources and other material values ​​that form the basis of the economic development of society and the state. In the traditional model, the key mechanism for performing this function is the customs that are accepted by the people. In the market - supply and demand. In the command - the mechanism of state distribution.
Secondly, the social functions of the economy are connected with providing the citizens of the state with the necessary resources to maintain an adequate standard of living.In the traditional model, they are not too noticeable - the basis of the extraction of income is made up by the personal farms of citizens - people provide for themselves. In the market system, the corresponding function is expressed in building labor relations between the employee and the employing company, as a result of which the former receives a salary, as well as in the provision of business opportunities for citizens from the government. In turn, in the command model, this function is again provided thanks to the work of the state.
Thirdly, the main functions of the economy include the aspect of ensuring national sovereignty. An independent country must first of all have an efficient state economy. In the traditional and market models, the key mechanism in which this function is implemented is foreign trade. The more competitive a state is in the aspect of export and import, the more stable it is. In turn, in the command model, economic sovereignty is provided mainly through the active use of internal reserves - natural wealth, people's labor.
These are functions of the economy that can be considered common to any model. At the same time, it will be interesting to study the specifics of each type of economic system in the aspect of functional diversity. Each of them is characterized by remarkable features. We study the specific functions of a market economy, and then - the command and traditional.
It is characterized by the following main features: the availability of space for free commodity and monetary exchange, competition, as well as developed institutions of private ownership of productive resources, real estate and other assets. What are the key functions of a market economy that distinguish it from other models of building national economic systems?
First, it is pricing. That is, the definition of indicators that directly affect the dynamics of the distribution of material goods in society. A particular product or service finds its buyer based on the market price, which is determined by the free mechanism of interaction between supply and demand.
Secondly, it is a function of ensuring progress in various fields - technology, law, society. The free market is competition, competitiveness.In business, the winner is the one that offers the best production technology. In turn, different markets built in individual countries of the world can compete with each other in terms of the quality of the legal system. The one in which the relevant institutions will be more efficient wins, which means that investors will go there, entrepreneurship and trade will be better developed there. A free market also implies a competition of societies. The winner is where social institutions are more developed, people are more enterprising, educated, educated, humane.
However, the winner at the level of an individual business, legal system, or society can completely lose to the next time to a more effective opponent. He must keep himself in good shape. But this may not be enough, and a subject with a more effective development model will take its place. So progress is achieved.
In the command model, as we have already defined above, the functions of the state are significant. In the economies of the countries of the world where such a system developed, if we talk about the historical context, these elements penetrated due to some shortcomings of the market model.Namely, the self-regulation mechanism characteristic of the free space of barter in some cases led to crises, including a very large-scale, which is considered to be the Great Depression in the United States. The free market did not always ensure the proper level of social protection of citizens. Thus, the state took over some of the functions of the economy. In general, they are the same as in the market model, but the principles of their implementation within the framework of a command economic system are sufficiently specific.
Thus, the pricing function was implemented through administrative methods that have become an alternative to the free mechanism of interaction of supply and demand. Competent government agencies figured out how to distribute this or that product more efficiently, and set a price, which, in turn, were required to install stores, also, as a rule, owned by the government.
The functions of the state in the command-type economy also penetrated in the aspect of ensuring progress. However, market competition has been replaced by competitiveness, tied to a certain social goal, as a rule, ideological. For example, in the USSR, construction of communism was considered as such.Every citizen had to constantly develop - in the aspect of knowledge, education, ethics - so as to make the greatest contribution to bringing the country closer to communism. In the aspect of law, in turn, improved regulation, reflecting the social security of citizens. In terms of technology, if we talk about the Soviet model, the government drew attention to the decisions that were seen most appropriate in the aspect of communist construction. For example, space, military.
The administrative methods developed in the practice of implementation in different countries of the command model also influenced the functions of the state in the market. The economies of many modern countries, ranked among the Western and considered to be fully developed, include some relevant elements. For example, it may be an indirect regulation of prices in the framework of national monetary policy. The functions of state regulation of the economy can also be traced in the aspect of setting customs duties, taxes, fees. In turn, part of the relevant authority may be delegated by the government to regional structures or municipalities.
Regarding the traditional model, in some aspects the corresponding functions of the economy are similar to those characteristic of a market system. Thus, for example, pricing in the model under consideration generally corresponds to the same function as in the market. With the help of supply and demand, it is regulated how these or other material resources will be distributed in society. In turn, such an element as competition in the traditional model is not very pronounced. People prefer to live in accordance with established customs, reluctantly introducing innovations into their life - both in terms of technology, and in terms of legal principles and public attitudes.
One way or another, most countries of the world, having historical development experience in the traditional model, preferred to develop by introducing some functions of the state in the market. The economies of modern developed countries combine the freedom of exchange of goods and some administrative methods of economic management. Let us consider in more detail the key aspects characteristic of the most common model of economic development of states today.
One of the most interesting aspects is the structure of an economy developing according to market principles. Modern experts identify several criteria for its structuring.
First, it is the economic role of the relevant elements. According to this criterion, in modern economies such key structural components as goods, labor and money are distinguished.
Secondly, it can be industry specialization. Thus, the structure of a market economy can be represented by industry, agriculture, or services in one or another proportion.
Thirdly, it can be a type of trading. Thus, the economy may consist of entrepreneurial activities comprising direct sales, auctions, government procurement, tenders, etc.
Having studied what the structure and functions of the economy represent, in particular, the most widespread market type today, we will study the aspect of the infrastructure of the economic system.
The economy of any modern country is based on infrastructure - the fundamental resources that allow the national economic system to perform its characteristic functions.As a rule, it is shaped by such elements as the legal system, political and social institutions, as well as models of the functioning of financial institutions - banks, commodity and currency exchanges, public organizations, tax and other public services.
For the modern national economy, the functions that infrastructure performs are extremely important. The elements that make up the phenomenon, some analysts attribute to the competitive advantages of a particular economic model. That is, the more developed the infrastructure in the country, the more effective it is from the point of view of building relations in the sphere of foreign trade, the more pronounced the economic sovereignty of the state.
Having studied the nature and main functions of a market economy, we can consider some examples of the organization of the corresponding economic system in different regions of the world.
So, modern economists distinguish the North American model of the economy. Among the key principles of its operation is the maximum disclosure of the potential of all subjects of relations in business: from hired specialists to large corporations.A person and a business must be effective, and their level of income will depend on it.
In the Scandinavian model of economic development, priority is given to social and status equality. Business should be done efficiently, but none of the parties to the communications should deliver discomfort to the partner through their actions. In turn, in Germany, as many analysts believe, the advantages of the North American and Scandinavian models are combined.
In some Asian countries, for example, in Singapore, state intervention in the economy is minimized. All conditions are created for easy start-up entrepreneurs, a soft tax system has been built. At the same time, interestingly, the social and political spheres in Asian states can be regulated very strictly by the authorities.
In the Japanese and Korean models, discipline and dedication are of great importance - both at the level of employees and in business. This is largely due to the fact that experts believe that, due to the historically observed shortage of natural resources, the economies of these Asian countries have the opportunity to developonly in conditions of tough mobilization of activities of subjects of market relations and with a very high efficiency of labor.

Excellent question. Honestly, it depends on what you need. I like to wear many hats. My strengths lie in analyzing content for telling the best story, utilizing the medium(s) it’s best suited for, and keeping the audience accessing it in mind.
I like to ask questions. I consider myself to be very curious with a strong desire to learn. Gathering requirements is something I take very seriously, in almost all aspects of my work. I think of outcomes. Results.
In a nutshell: If one “role” could capture my skills, it would be designer. I design great content through its structures, visuals, and meanings.
Deadlines are my best friend. I have experience overseeing high-priority projects at publishers and media companies. In past roles, I have collaborated with offshore developers and vendors, managing quality assurance rounds and confirming requirements. I am used to juggling multiple tasks and prioritizing accordingly.
I have most recently been exposed to product development this past year, within an agile environment exposed to Scrum methodologies. While my experience has revolved around books, my approaches and strategies to executing products can be transferred to virtually any industry. I have a keen understanding of the user from the design and content perspective, given my lengthy tenure in digital book development. I worked with editorial teams and drove design as a product owner for digital books.
I am incredibly aware of myself as a user of digital products. I’m a self-starter and have dabbled in user interface design with Sketch. I am learning how to identify and create simple navigation structures, and I am also discovering the ultimate needs for a user.
With the help of BoingBoing, I am taking online courses in mobile development and user experience, and practicing skills in personal projects.
My master’s work included web development, which delved into wireframing, risk analyses, information architecture, content strategy, and design. In these courses I created websites by hand through trial and error and online resources. (Thanks, Google!) I am extremely proficient in HTML and CSS and have worked with content management systems (e.g., WordPress). I am comfortable with markup and teaching markup to individuals who may need a hand in getting their content to the web.
Creating websites is a hobby of mine. This very site turned into an approximately weeklong passion project, which was mostly coded from scratch with the aid of some online resources and templates for reference.
I always tell people I’m a lifelong student. I grew up with the belief that education is the key to success. That said, coming from a family of educators, it seems that teaching is in my blood. When I can, I teach as an adjunct at Emerson College — my alma mater — and give presentations at local events and conferences. I have presented or participated in the following conferences internationally: Digital Book World, IDPF Digital Book (at Book Expo America), AWP (Association of Writers & Writing Programs), PePcon, the Future Publishing & Accessibility Conference, and ebookcraft. I have also completed webinars on technical concepts, such as digital workflows and ebook quality assurance.
I have also organized events that seek to educate the general public on various areas of publishing as well as coding. In September 2012, I spearheaded a day-long workshop with industry veterans that focused on the basics of HTML, CSS, mobile design, metadata, and ebook development. The event had nearly 60 students and was held free of charge.
I chair the education committee at Bookbuilders of Boston, an industry organization dedicated to networking publishing professionals in New England. We have held panels on independent bookstores, freelancing, and other relevant topics.
The bulk of my professional experience stems from developing ebooks. As a thought leader in this space, I am considered an expert in ebooks and their formats. My master’s project was an EPUB and Kindle file of a graphic novella I illustrated; I was responsible for all content, coding, and QA. Following that, in professional capacities, I have worked on hundreds of ebooks at and with various publishers at all levels of complexity.
Because I have worked on ebooks from concept to distribution, I know how to immediately discern whether content is meant for a digital platform. I am essentially a freelance consultant available to help you figure out how to make a great ebook — or any piece of content destined for the web.
Illustration has always been a hobby of mine. I am now exploring turning that hobby into a facet of my overall career. Professionally, I was responsible for pivotal character design on a budding animated series. For this show, I drew the initial concept art for 10+ characters.
Recently, I am exploring another casual hobby of mine — sketchnotes — at a professional level. At conferences, I tend to jot notes alongside caricatures and doodles of breakout sessions and keynotes. In March 2016, I will serve as the official sketchnote artist for ebookcraft and Tech Forum in Toronto.
Lastly, on a local level, I am open to any and all opportunities for sandwich board design and illustration in the Boston area.
My editing skills (copyediting, proofreading, and plain editing) has been endorsed, collectively, over 150 times on LinkedIn. I am a phenomenal resource for a second eye in reviewing content, teasing out meanings, removing ambiguities, and eliminating errors. I am a proud English major and hold a master’s degree in writing & publishing. I have experience as a writing tutor for both undergraduate and graduate students. And I am constantly silently editing web content. I can perform editing in Adobe Acrobat, XML, or just plain paper with a pen.
Here are a few samples of my work in product development, web development, design, and illustration:
Creating eBooks for publishers and authors has exposed me to the basics of product development and being a product owner — overseeing the creation of a product from beginning to end, from a mockup to a user. In my experience, this has always been books, either in print or digital formats. Later in my career I had a closer hand in driving the development of a particular book product through guidance and knowledge of industry best practices.
The following are examples of eBooks I have developed. There are others, but because they belong to publishers, I cannot disclose those samples here. Please let me know if you would like a reference to a few I have worked on.
I created all artwork featured in this book, as well as developed the overall layout and design. (Credit for the actual EPUB for sale in the Apple iBookstore is due to Laura Brady of Brady Type.

Lawrendra 1 Anton Lawrendra Dr. Burns AP U.S. History, Period 1 11 February 2008 1994 DBQ 1. To what extent was late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century United States expansionism a continuation of past United States expansionism and to what extent was it a departure? United States expansionism has undergone many changes throughout the years. We have expanded for land, for God, and for the economy. As the people of the United States progressed both socially and economically, the methods of expansionism evolved from non-interference to democratic control, all the while struggling to stay true to the ideals of the forefathers. United States expansionism in the late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century was both a continuation and departure of past United States expansionism with regards to overseas annexation, social and economic dominance, and religious power over immigrants. The growth of the navy gained bargaining power for the U.S. With our big stick, we had the means to venture into noncontiguous lands, such as the Philippines and even China. We began expanding to find markets for our ever-growing production. Once we had conquered the continental United States we saw that we had the ambition to take on the world, as well as a faith in God that expanded manifest destiny across bodies of water into previously unobtainable lands. Document C underlines the importance of naval power, as well as outlining the three necessary

If I read not amiss, this powerful race will move down upon Mexico, down uponCentral and South America, out upon the islands of the sea, over upon Africa and beyond, And can any one doubtthat the result of this competition of races will be the "survival of the fittest"?

Is she prepared to acquiesce in any foreignpower purchasing from Haiti a naval station on the Windward Passage, through which pass our steamer routes tothe Isthmus? Would she acquiesce to a foreign protectorate over the Sandwich Islands [Hawaii] that great centralstation of the Pacific?Whether they will or no, Americans must now look outward. The growing production of the country demands it.An increasing volume of public sentiment demands it. The position of the United States, between the two OldWorlds and the two great oceans, makes the same claim, which will soon be strengthened by the creation of thenew link joining the Atlantic and Pacific.

WOW, gorgeous views of France. The pastries look yummy. Lovely photos. Happy Thursday, enjoy your day!
Yes! I love to travel but I also love coming home, unpacking, reliving all the good memories and slipping back into routine.
Beautiful photos of a beautiful place. The food, the light, the buildings! So much to savour and remember.
I have been waiting for this post and it did not disappoint! I hope you have a fabulous time my friend and thank you for sharing all the pretty with us! xo
I spent part of my childhood in France, and I would love to return someday. Thank you for sharing your photos with us!
Wonderful photos Amalia; my goodness I could almost taste that French pastry in that one photo! Lol.
Always love seeing the places you visit through your eyes Amalia! I have to admit, the picture with the children and the young woman crouched behind the motorbike was a stunning photo, just the raw emotion you captured there! Loved seeing the beautiful bay, the gorgeous food, and the quaint views. Truly a delight for your heart I know! Enjoyed your pictures so very much :)
I have a special fondness for that photo as well. We were having our morning coffee when we saw a group of kindergarten children walking by. One of the teacher grabbed four of the boys and they hid behind the corner for a bit of fun. The others stopped, puzzled, and it was like watching a little movie unfold. And then a guy arrived and parked his motorcycle there and the scene was perfect.
Such beautiful and charming pictures, my friend. I wish I could jump into the fun and enjoy. Hugs to you!
Vast amount of information is available in structured forms like spreadsheets, database relations, and tables found in documents and on the Web. In today’s talk I will describe an approach that uses linked data to interpret such tables and associate their components with nodes in a reference linked data collection. Our proposed framework assigns a class (i.e. type) to table columns, links table cells to entities, and inferred relations between columns to properties. The resulting interpretation can be used for a variety of tasks such as annotating tables for the Semantic Web, confirm existing facts in the linked data collection, propose new facts to be added in the linked data cloud, answer queries over tables and data integration. This talk will focus on using the table interpretation for annotating web tables. We implemented a prototype which uses DBpedia as the linked data collection and Wikitology for background knowledge. We evaluated its performance using a collection of tables from Google Squared, Wikipedia and the Web. I will also address on issues that we will be working in the semester.
Documentary and Education site to the late John Gotti. John Gotti was allegedly the head of the Gambino mafia family in NYC for several decades. John Gotti was a popular figure throughout NYC and USA. John Gotti passed away in prison from cancer and his funeral was attended by thousands.
John Gotti photos can be found across the internet. John Gotti is still popular in todays age. His videos are popular and his internet searches are large. Gotti was a former head of the Gambino crime family according to several media reports. It’s important to mention that even though all this information is available online, it’s very hard to verify due to the secretive nature of these families.
Photos of all John Gotti’s major court appearances can be found online. The reason is he never was shy of media attention. He loved the spotlight according to various sources online.
This is an information and education based site. Our information is from recent media releases and videos. This is an amateur information site.
This John Gotti site is for education and documentary purposes. This is to inform readers about the popularity of Gotti and the events that occurred during his life.
Since submitting Assignment 6 – Landscape to my tutor I have decided to include a couple extra photographs at later dates. Because the assignment was sequential it made sense to add them to the existing photos as a continuing project – especially considering the developments pictured in the photographs were still taking place as well. There was another reason as well – I had plans to construct a flip book as a way of presenting the project. As each page of the flip book was turned or flipped, another date and photograph depicting the changes to the developments would appear to the viewer, giving a better sense of change over time. I had discussed this way of presenting the work with my tutor and was optimistic about the results. One area I was a bit worried about regarding the flip book’s practicality was that it would be too short in the number of pages – I’d taken a total of 16 photos which could be aligned in Photoshop sufficiently accurately. Therefore I felt taking more photographs for the project would strengthen the project and the flip book. The flip book would then comprise of 18 pages which I could add to at the back of the flip book.
I have just finished making the flip book and I am very happy with the results. The materials I used were a bulldog clip to hold the paper together (and make it easily flippable), as well as thick, matte A4 photo paper to which I printed onto A5 halves of the paper so that the flip book was A5 in size. This also enabled me to make the flip book more flippable. I printed the images on the bottom side of the portrait (now) A5 paper close to the edge and put the date on sequentially for the images beneath the images.
A feature of the flip book was for me the front page which included an overlaid image of all the photographs put together, starting with a 100% base layer and then 10% increases in opacity until all 18 images were overlaid. I had discussed this with my tutor also and overall I was pleased with the outcome as the image had a very hectic, full of change feel to it. This mirrored the roundabout in reality from my experiences because there was so much works going on as well as the pedestrians and motor vehicles making their way around the developments. This outcome of the overlaid images reminded me of a very long exposure; in particular the very long exposures produced by Michael Wesely. There was one photograph of the Musuem of Modern Art (Wesely, 2001-2003) which reminded me of the overlay image I had produced. In Peta Pixel’s article: Photographs Captured Over Years with an Open Camera Shutter – (Zhang, M. 2012) – found at: http://petapixel.com/2012/03/16/photographs-captured-over-years-with-an-open-camera-shutter/ (accessed on 26/10/2016), I noticed a quote stating Wesely: ‘has spent decades working on techniques for extremely long camera exposures — usually between two to three years’. I could compare the outcome of the overlaid images for the front cover of the flip book to Wesely visually as there was in my opinion a likeness in the kinetic sense of change in the final image. However, there was not a likeness in terms of the manual way Wesely had set up his analogue camera for an exposure that took place singularly in the scene. I had revisited the same spot many times so the composition was the same but it was not a true, continuous rendition of the scene. Although I hadn’t intentionally sought out specific times to photograph the developments in my images, the images had nevertheless been selected from parts of time in their collective ‘long exposure’. Whereas, Wesely had produced an unbiased long exposure for the duration of the photograph. It could be argued however that he had selected a moment in time to photograph the long exposure and of course compositionally it had been selected. My overlaid image too had been selected in time but the duration of the overlaid images’ ‘long exposure’ effect was biased compared to Wesely’s ‘true’ long exposure. Therefore the (selected) composition, (selected) moment of time period, for the (selected) moments of time within a moment, resulted in an image which was not very continuous technically. However, as stated, I felt visually the two resembled each other and both gave a sense of change in the scene they framed.
I have decided the best way of presenting Assignment 5 – Landscape in its final form would be a photo book. I have had this idea of producing a photo book in my head for quite long while and I felt Assignment 5 with its relatively large number of photographs (compared to previous assignments for Landscape) and strong concept behind the project had potential to present well as a photo book.
An accompaniment to the photo book would be the overlay on a map I’d traced to show visually the concept of my walking around the perimeter of a circle on a map of my local area and photographing from various spots along the way. I felt this overlay with red markers for the spots I’d photographed from and line indicating the perimeter of the circle over the black lines I’d traced from the map would make a good cover page for my photo book for Assignment 5 and my tutor’s comments reflected this. The fact this map appeared on my blog in the blog post: ‘My Walk Along the Perimeter of A Circle on a Map of My Local Area and the Spots Where I Photographed From (Daytime)’ also added consistency to the project in my eyes.
In terms of the rest of the photo book, I initially rushed into creating the other pages which contained the photographs, my rationale being that it was supposed to be a photo book and therefore just full of the relevant photographs for the project in order. When I received the photo book – I used a photo book publishing website called Blurb – I realised that perhaps it would be better to include information about each photograph including a title. This I realised would give context to each photograph and an insight into how I felt about the project which was after all a major reason for starting the project.
Therefore I got another version of the photo book printed after adding a title and context for each photograph. This revised version of the photo book – also printed at Blurb – was much more balanced and held the viewer’s attention for longer in my opinion. Also I personally was more pleased with the results compared to the previous version; I found out a bit more about myself in relation to the photographs because of writing the context for each photograph.
In light of my tutor’s comments regarding my submission for Assignment 5 – Landscape, I’ve realised there were several key areas I could improve on for the assignment. The first consisted of filtering my project down into a slightly less convoluted mishmash of elements so my intentions and points I were trying to make were more obvious. For me this meant removing the corresponding night landscape shots as upon reflection they didn’t contribute too much to the project. Instead I felt they confused what I was trying to convey to the viewer. What I was trying to convey was a message of diversity within the landscape from the people which typically inhabit my surrounding landscape, from the presence of the people themselves on the (already diverse) surrounding landscape. Then there was a slight impermanence factor, reflected by the people’s traces on the landscape indirectly from land use as a second source of information. However, by introducing a third element consisting of variation on the landscape between day and night, I was almost offering the viewer too much information. So, I decided to remove these night shots entirely from the assignment (none of them in my opinion worked better in comparison to their corresponding day shots in conveying this diversity). I did this fairly reluctantly at first because it had been quite arduous to go back to each location and shoot the corresponding nighttime landscape shot afterwards but on this occasion I saw less as more and thought it benefited the project. Therefore the main aspect I wanted to get across was the diversity of the landscape and it’s inhabitants in my local area and I felt this was far more evident from the more varied day shots (with the more prevalent inclusion of people), which were sufficient in my opinion to get this message of diversity across.
Another trait in my photographs my tutor picked up on was the seeming insistence to photograph using the same exact aspect ratio and orientation. While this 3:2, landscape format worked okay in general in my eyes, looking back at the images I could definitely see where cropping may be beneficial. Therefore I endeavoured to experiment with other formats where necessary to further inform the audience what was the focus of each photograph. Furthermore I could now see potential for linking certain photographs which shared similar compositional traits by cropping them in similar ways to accentuate these similarities. Namely Photographs 7 and 11 for Assignment 5 – Landscape offered the possibility of such a cropping treatment and I could foresee would work together well with Photograph 6 as examples of ‘looking to the side’ as explained in my blog post: ‘Inspiration for My Own Self-Directed Project (Assignment 5)’. Here I had been inspired by Alec Soth with Sleeping by the Mississippi (2004) to look to the side. As well as this, putting these images with similar cropping together as a diptych in my proposed final presentation method: a photo book I could foresee working well.
In response to another comment by my tutor, I would like to offer a little more information into how I felt the project went with regards to my self-discovery through the camera. I had stated this was one of the hoped-for outcomes for the conducting the project so close to home and yet hadn’t alluded too much to how I felt this had gone in my summary. It had brought back some memories of old routes I used to walk when I was younger and crucially made me look at my local area in new ways. The significance of this in relation to the course was because the area had changed so much yet was still recognisable made me realise I felt some kind of sentimentality to the place. From this attachment I started to see my local area in a new light – noticing things I wouldn’t normally have noticed in my local area, which could bode well for future projects.
With Photograph 2 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended I cropped in significantly in order to better get my point across to the viewer – all the people at the bus stop were on their smartphones.
For Photograph 4 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended I adopted a 5:4 aspect ratio as I felt it framed the shot better with the people in the frame seeming to be perceivably more eager to get out from work as well as out of the frame!
I chose a more ‘cinematic’ 16:9 aspect ratio to frame the man against the confines of the ‘Edgelands’ he was walking down. For me it gave the photograph an edgier feel.
I used a square 1:! ratio for Photograph 7 – Assignment 5 – Landscape and put it in a diptych as can be seen at the top of the post.
A 4:5 ratio was used here to crop in on the main action in the street – the street football, while still allowing for the viewer to gain an insight into what kind of area/street they were playing on.
I decided to keep Photograph 10 – Assignment 5 – Landscape the same framing because I thought all aspects of the photograph were quite important.
I used a square 1:! ratio for Photograph 11 – Assignment 5 – Landscape and put it in a diptych as can be seen at the top of the post.
Again, cropping in further on the most salient part of the frame for me made it clearer what I was trying to convey to the viewer in Photograph 12 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended.
Simply gently cropping to a 5:4 ratio allowed the photograph for me to appear a bit more balanced in Photograph 13 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended.
I had to think a bit harder for Photograph 14 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended about how to crop it to best keep the important elements and simplify the scene more. I found that by using a portrait 4:5 ratio I could accomplish this.
Although cropping in significantly to a 1:1 square ratio prevented the whole of the building being shown in the frame, I thought this was a bearable expense as I could still show the visible wear on the building and the person crossing the doorway was much more visible like this.
For Photograph 16 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended I felt I could only crop in slightly (to a 5:4 aspect ratio) while still maintaining the important elements and preserving the vibrancy evident in the frame.
Similarly to Photograph 16 – Assignment 5 – Landscape – Amended I only cropped in slightly to a 5:4 ratio because in my eyes most of the frame except for the edges on either side were important.
To best make it discernible to the viewer of the sequence of photographs how quickly and profoundly the changes were taking place at Lewisham roundabout, I adopted as spatially as similar a viewpoint each time as I could. To do this I used reference points so that I was standing at a similar position each time I visited the vantage point. Then I used the same or as similar as I could manage framing from the vantage point to the roundabout which was changing. I used a distant house and road markings as my reference points to make sure the framing was a similar as possible. However, this was not entirely straightforward as some of the reference points (the road markings) changed a bit as the roundabout was developed. I revisited the roundabout from the vantage point roughly once a fortnight on average to show the changes, which only were perceivable over greater periods of time, taking place. Of course by taking the photographs from as similar as possible a vantage point and with the reference points as similarly as possible lined up to each other, the resultant series of photographs did not match in composition identically. However, because they were pretty close in terms of the vantage point stood from and the reference points lined up from photograph to photograph quite well, I was able to utilise Photoshop’s auto-align feature with photographs I’d taken and imported into Photoshop as layers. The reason I used the auto-align feature of Photoshop on the photographs was so that the land features surrounding the roundabout (which hadn’t changed) lined up better, therefore making the changes themselves more perceivable to the viewer of the photographs.
3/5/2016 was for me the highlight date because visible change was occurring inside the photograph as well as having ramifications for future dates I photographed the roundabout
I found the change of the landscape feature of the roundabout was more obvious if you looked at different points of the frame when observing the change by flicking through the sequential photographs. This was because the roundabout was so big it filled the frame and different parts of the roundabout changed over time in different photographs.
My aim for this assignment was to show change taking place at Lewisham roundabout through a series of photographs, each one very similarly composed but with the land features gradually changing throughout the photographs. Lewisham roundabout is in my local area and so I was familiar with the roundabout, having lived nearby to it for a lot of my life. My target audience would be primarily people who were affected by the roundabout’s development. I knew the roundabout’s development to be quite a contentious issue because the whole flow of traffic had been altered, as can be seen in my series of photographs incidentally. This was in addition to the alteration of the public walkways around the perimeter of the vast roundabout. Both these alterations meant people travelling through Lewisham and in and around Lewisham had to cope with the changes. This included heavier traffic near to the roundabout and longer, less direct routes in and around the roundabout for pedestrians. The other, more positive side to this was that in my opinion the developments were necessary for Lewisham’s continued development. Either way, I chose to adopt a high, objective viewpoint from which to record the changes in order to remain as unbiased about the developments on the roundabout in my photographs as possible.
While it would have been possible to photograph Lewisham Roundabout without the inclusion of people and moving objects, I felt it was more accurate and overall better to include these within the frame. This was for the reason that it showed that life still did go on around the roundabout, albeit in a more restricted manner for the residents of Lewisham in the immediate area, while all these works were being carried out. The works being carried out were still largely visible behind the inclusion of people and moving vehicles in the frame either way so I didn’t feel this distracted too much from the obviousness of the change taking place. However, I was also of the opinion that a lot more character was added to each scene through the inclusion of these people/objects.
I chose to employ a high vantage point, inspired by the work of Simon Roberts in particular but also John Davies, in order to better show the change taking place over time. Specifically I looked at Simon Roberts’ Pierdom (2010-2013) series and John Davies’ Agecroft Colliery, Salford 1983 (1983) photograph. As well as showing the change taking place more clearly, I felt the high vantage point depicted the change more objectively. Had the viewpoint(s) been lower down amongst the activities the effect would have been much more involved and subjective according to the people in the frame and how they related to the changes. I wanted to approach the potentially contentious changes taking place to Lewisham roundabout in as ambivalent and unbiased a way as possible, to allow the viewer to make their minds up about the (vast and drastic) changes themselves. Choosing a high viewpoint seemed the obvious method for doing this.
My lasting concern with landscape photography has been that the landscape’s land features often remain largely unchanged and so the landscape photographer has to ‘make do’ with what they are finding in these settings. This is regardless sometimes of how ‘clever’ the photographer has been with composition and lighting. While the landscape changes according to weather and light constantly, the land features change incrementally and usually at a relatively slow pace compared to the weather and light.
The Bechers utilised a typographical approach a as way of altering our concept of the landscape without actually altering the land itself through photomontages of similar objects. ‘Through photography, we try to arrange these shapes and render them comparable. To do so, the objects must be isolated from their context and freed from all association.’ – ‘The Photographic Comportment of Bernd and Hilla Becher’, Tate Papers, no.1, Spring 2004 (Stimson B., 2004), found at: http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/01/photographic-comportment-of-bernd-and-hilla-becher#footnote11_iq6fd88 accessed on 21/7/2016. I saw this typographical approach as being a particularly successful method of drawing attention to the objects; often displayed in grids to accentuate their similarities as in: Fig. 1 (Becher and Becher, 1974).
However, what interested me particularly was that ‘The Bechers were fascinated by the speed at which technology evolves, leaving old innovations in the dust, often to be destroyed.’ – INSTANT EXPERT: BERND AND HILLA BECHER – (Hamilton E., 2011), found at: http://www.americanphotomag.com/instant-expert-bernd-and-hilla-becher accessed on 21/7/2016. I established that while the Becher’s grids of photographs offered no trace as to the monumental change taking place on the land features evident in them, the uniformity on display belied the seeming impassivity of the structure’s photographed.
Included in part was work by the Bechers in the New Topographics exhibition which took place in America in 1975. The photographers documented how man had altered the landscape on a collective level – the photographers doing this with a detached and unbiased-as-possible methodology. An example of this detached style can be seen in the work of Robert Adams/George Eastman in Fig. 2 (Adams and Eastman, 1974).
This altering of the land was on an indirect, collective level brought about by ‘the steady creep of suburban development in all its regulated uniformity’ – O’Hagan (2010) that was taking place in America in the 1970s. Although I was interested in the aesthetics the New Topographics photographers chose to employ to depict this change of land features, I was more interested in influencing the land features through direct, personal intervention.
I think I was largely successful at subverting the ‘problem’ of the landscape itself largely dictating how the final photograph appears to the viewer, when I came up with Photographs 8, 9 and 10 for Assignment 2 (Fig. 3), on my landscape course. Here I made myself ‘see-through’ as a kind of frame for the landscape by printing photographic representation of the landscape immediately behind me on a t-shirt I wore. As well as questioning the frame of a photograph, this otherwise brought up issues of permanence as some of the landscape features on the t-shirt photographic representation had of course since changed. This was compared to the ‘present’ landscape features shown behind me.
In a way, not dissimilar to my Photographs 8, 9 and 10 for Assignment 2, there exists the work of Richard Long, with his Earth Art. My t-shirt idea was not dissimilar because it was a form of Earth Art in its loosest sense. Long installs his own art, in the form of abstract sculptures and structures onto the usually natural landscape itself; thus changing how it appears before the photographs are taken. Whether the eventual photograph of the Earth Art is paramount to Long as Art is another matter. Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art (n.d.) – available at: http://www.ngca.co.uk/home/default.asp?id=189 suggests: ‘the walk undertaken is itself the artwork – as a kind of performance over time – and anything else only evidence or documentation.’ However, I would propose a type of interesting paradox is formed nevertheless, whenever Long (or another person) photographs his Earth Art. This is where, in my opinion, the Earth Art takes the role of Art within Art within the eventual photograph. This is because the photograph is naturally indexical to the environment it was made in and by simultaneously including something within the landscape (the Earth Art), Long thereby creates an indice of the indexical, each time he records it in a photograph. I suppose my Photographs 8, 9 and 10 for Assignment 2 worked as a portable version of these installations on the landscape.
The problem with directly altering the landscape, for me, has been integrating this usually obvious discrepancy in the landscape (the altered parts), as realistically part of their surrounding environment, without it appearing forced or pointless to the eventual viewer. This natural inclination to perceive the landscape ideologically simultaneously implies the landscape is similar to a photograph itself because it is decreeing the same treatment by the user as that of a traditional photograph. I would consider a ‘traditional photograph’ as one that is not trying to alter the land features. You could argue keeping the altered parts of the landscape appearing realistic defeats the point of altering the landscape in the first place. This would only apply however, if the photographer intended to apply meaning visually in the photograph. However, keeping the landscape realistic and yet altered, I suggest could make the indexical bond between land and photograph stronger. This would be while adding potential meaning to the landscape/photograph through visualisation of concepts. For example, by placing a group of buoys in an urban park, meaning could be implied about this juxtaposition but also it might seem rather contrived, while placing the same group of buoys on a beach in a certain manner, (a different, albeit less profound) meaning could be gathered by the viewer but without losing visual credibility. Perhaps getting the balance right between implied meaning and credibility is paramount in achieving a ’successful’ photograph via altered landscape. Here, visualisation of concepts would be key, for the reason that the concept would have to be strong, in order for the landscape and the meaning implied by the alterations to make visual sense.
The degree to which the landscape is altered also affects meaning, although not necessarily in correlation that the larger the earthwork, the more profound the meaning. The visual impact and how permanent an effect the alteration has upon the eventual landscape would be two factors to take into consideration, when comparing the work of Long and Smithson, for example. The typical scale of the alterations to the landscape and their permanence on the landscape between the two artists, I would consider major; however both instill powerful, if different meanings. Concerning ‘Spiral Jetty’ – Smithson (1970): ‘the fact that it is done at all is often what constitutes its significance’ – Chianese (January-February 2013) – available at: http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/spiral-jetty. An example photograph of ‘Spiral Jetty’ – Smithson (1970) is Fig. 4.
In contrast, because Long’s work is in such a state of transience, where the earthwork usually isn’t very durable, the question would seem to be: in which way does his work exist to the viewer, when according to Long: ‘It [his art] is simply about making a line of stone in a particular place at a particular time.’ – Long (2009), In. The Guardian – O’Hagan (2009) – available at: http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/may/10/art-richard-long. An example of Long’s Earth Art is Fig. 5 (Long, 1967).

There are admittedly, arguably subtler ways of altering the landscape from a human perspective. These include long exposures to direct the viewer’s attention to certain objects in the scene through composition and the composition itself. While these methods do indeed alter the landscape in a sense, they have been used profusely in landscape photography and I wanted to research looking at changing the landscape in a more direct and potentially innovative way or perhaps in combination with these techniques. With clouds moving overhead in a long exposure for example, the sky is always altered, while instilling some sort of order to the photograph.
The reason I have become a bit preoccupied with changing the landscape in a way more intrinsic than composition and lighting, I would say, is because this allows for finer meaning to be applied to the photograph before the photograph has been taken and potentially easier application of this meaning.
Of course, by ‘interfering’ with the natural landscape like this before the exposure, the photographer is starting a whole other topic of debate, concerning ethics of altering Nature. This can be applied to earthwork artists, utilising photographs as the way of documenting their work. Notably, Gussow (1972) remarked that: ‘earth-work artists … cut and gouge the land like Army engineers’, to which Smithson, a prominent earthwork artist, responded Gussow: ‘fails to recognise the possibility of a direct organic manipulation of the land devoid of violence and macho aggressiveness.’ – (Smithson, 1973). This implies that Smithson saw the implementation of Earth Art as potentially harmless to our perception of reality, because it could be part of Nature. However, in response to the vantage point that ‘photographs should depict reality’; illustrated by Barthes (1980) in Camera Lucida: ‘The necessarily real thing placed before the lens, without this there would be no photograph.’, I would argue that photographs are like an alternate reality anyway and at the very least, give an inaccurate rendering of reality. For instance, Szarkowski (1966) indicates: ‘the factuality of his pictures, no matter how convincing and unarguable, was a different thing than the reality itself’. By having a subject, which has altered reality within the photograph itself, I might in turn subvert these ethics of altering Nature, because of the inherent implications of reality surrounding photographs. An example of this is Fig. 6 (Rousse, 2003).
While the effects of directly intervening with the landscape and its ethics are likely contentious, this is rarely carried out in a disruptive manner. Meanwhile, photography popularly concentrates on the picturesque or even more mainstream: the beautiful. This, I would argue can also have (less obvious) ramifications for the environment, because this type of photography is so oversaturated, especially nowadays. Side-effects of this include inadvertent damage to the environment because of erosion – the ‘most worthy’ picturesque locations are revisited so many times nowadays – ‘[new ‘leisure’ time] was an industry whose very success in encouraging masses to visit these places, in turn, became precisely the activity that threatens to ruin the picturesque quality of those views.’ – Bate (2009). A couple of examples of detrimental impact to the environment because of tourism can be found at: http://www.fixthefells.co.uk/files/4013/5901/9528/path_erosion_factsheet.pdf (accessed 2/8/2016) and http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/why-tourists-ruin-the-places-they-love/. (accessed 2/8/2016). Conceptually too; the direct altering of the landscape beforehand conflicts modernist approaches to photography because of photography’s inherent indexicality. Altering the landscape and thereby directly interfering with order in the landscape may disrupt photography conventions. However, altering the landscape can potentially provide more meaningful discourse, whereas only photographing the beautiful can lead to less meaningful discourse.
A contentious debate has been whether photography is an Art form since soon after its invention. Historically; Greenberg in the 1960s asserted that ‘painting, was the salvation from a culture that was contaminated with, as he saw it, the lowly ‘kitsch’ values of the marketplace – including photography.’ – as suggested by Greenberg (1961) in Photography: The Key Concepts – Bate (2009). I would say this ‘not being able to change the landscape before the photograph has been taken at risk of being unrealistic’ is a central factor behind this feud. Paintings, for instance, can be altered and modified (which is often painstakingly carefully the case) to suit the artist’s desires/mood. This is a reason why painting has always been seen as an Art form. It seems to me photography has to contradict its very nature – that of a rendition of reality – in order to be considered as Art. This may be because photography came after painting in time (chronologically) and so photography is often associated with imitating painterly traditions in landscapes. Ironically for me, painting, while possessing the innate ability to be whatever the painter’s imagination wants it to look like – that is; no clear restraints on depicting reality – often does depict a rough semblance of reality anyway – ‘painters usually included in the Surrealist canon, who seldom imagined the canvas as other than figurative’ – Sontag (1977), Chapter 3. An example of this would be Salvadore Dali’s ‘The Persistence of Memory’ (1931): Fig. 7.
Here, although he dithered from reality substantially, the objects depicted were all recognisable. Perhaps the reason paintings often depict reality, even though they could feasibly depict whatever, is because the subconscious (at least the subconscious for the majority of viewers) needs for paintings (and indeed Art) to have some attachment to humanity apparent. This could be to familiarise the viewer or let them see into the artist’s eye or even (or as well as) to prevent the artwork from becoming ‘boring’ because there is no human element to relate to. I would say this is very true of photography as well; if not more pertinent.
It is possible to observe this from the viewpoint of the sublime. The sublime tends to play upon our notions of reality – ’the harmony of the sensus communis is structured, that is, around … a Sublime idea that can never occur in reality but which must be presupposed if reality is to cohere’ – Zizek (1989) in The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom) – Shaw (2005). I believe this is why its relationship with photography can be so powerful and yet fragile. If a photograph needs some semblance of reality, even if it is from the past to function as a photograph within the viewer’s mind, then the sublime being present in a photograph naturally twists this concept to breaking point. This can be observed in the following pdf found at: https://blantonmuseum.org/files/american_scenery/sublime_guide.pdf (accessed on 2/8/2016).
Therefore, one way of challenging the notion that the landscape features largely remain unchanged, could be to approach it from the perspective of photography having little boundaries on what is included in the frame, similar to paintings and the work of John Pfahl, with his twist on photographing the American West. Pfahl ‘intervened in the actual landscape … drawing attention to pictorial geometry, and thereby disrupting it.’ – Wells (2011). He cleverly admits one thing (the landscape changes so little usually that he can carry out these interventions) but simultaneously introduces another (the optical illusion (as direct consequence of his changing of the landscape) altering our perceptions of reality) – ‘Pfahl comments that through his work he realised that you could show one thing (optical illusion) in dealing with another (landscape pictorial).’ – Wells (2011). One element Pfahl presumably intentionally leaves out of his landscapes, is the inclusion of people within the photographs, although there are traces (his own traces) evident within the frame. I would suggest he left people themselves out intentionally in order to keep his concept simple: altering landscapes also alters reality. However, Pfahl could have conceivably used people instead of or as well as objects and in a more natural way to alter the landscape without altering reality.
People interact with the landscape and indeed photographs so it seems clear to me that they could be seen as part of the landscape and therefore are transient as intrinsic components of an altered landscape. Moving forwards with my own photography, I could see myself incorporating people into landscapes as a sort of non-permanent way of altering the landscape but one that is permanent within the photograph. Semiotically, this suggests an indexical mode of relationship between land and photograph as always but also an indexical mode between people included in the frame and the photograph itself. Therefore, the people exist temporally on the mostly impassive landscape, although paradoxically altering it for the duration of the photograph. This relationship, I would say runs parallel to the transient state of photographs themselves nowadays, where they are rarely material objects but instead constantly changing – ‘transient photography centres on virtual, changeable elements … not printed, but viewed on screens’ – Bull (2010). Therefore, photographs only appear in the landscape for the duration of the gallery exhibition and potentially mimic the transient state of people in photographs.

There were a few more subtle changes made to the photographs based on suggestions my tutor made regarding the discernibility of the tourists, in the night time shot (Photograph 4 – Assignment 3) as figures. ‘Perhaps a stronger element of crowd in the foreground they really are more like shadows from the people above.’ I agreed with my tutor here but luckily I had a couple more exposures where the people were more distinct and so I blended them in using layers and their respective masks until there was more activity visible in the lower half of the frame and in my opinion they appeared like figures passing by rather than ‘shadows from the people above’.
Then there was the issue my tutor picked up on: ‘The rickshaw image is the first one that has a little of the superimposed feel about it. This is the one that I would pick out as the most obvious user of a layering technique.’ for Photograph 7 – Assignment 3. I looked at this image for a while because I agreed with my tutor that the tourists around the rickshaw riders looked ‘superimposed’ through the use of layering, which was indeed the case! I came to the conclusion the reason it looked superimposed in part was because of the people’s legs, which I’d superimposed right at the bottom centre of the frame below the rickshaw riders. I still had the layers and layer masks for Photograph 7 – Assignment 3 saved in Photoshop so I painted back out those legs in the bottom centre of the frame which I felt made the photograph more realistic overall.
The most drastic change I decided to make to Assignment 3 – Landscape however, was the incorporation of split-toning into my workflow for the processing of the photographs. My tutor commented in my tutor report that while ‘the print quality is good they have a slightly split tone feel to them’ and while this was quite subtle in appearance for the viewer of the prints, it didn’t match the screen images I’d uploaded to my blog. My tutor also subsequently pointed this out in the tutor report: ‘I think the prints are so much better than the screen images. Its subjective but the onscreen ones are a lot cooler and more calculating. The prints have a much more human – analogue -non digital feel.’ Firstly I wanted the screen images to be as similar as possible to the prints, it was my opinion that consistency was quite an important factor for different mediums of presentation. I discovered my printer had only one black ink and actually used colour cartridges for the black and white printing. The source for this discovery was: ‘Because the Epson Stylus Photo 1500W doesn’t feature dedicated monochrome inks, it has to blend its colour inks to great shades of grey.’ – Hawkins, M. (2012) found at: http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/epson-stylus-photo-1500w-1079586/review/2 accessed on 16/8/2016. I would assume this is where the ‘slightly split tone feel to them’ came from. Also I decided I wanted to embrace this ‘split tone feel’ in both the screen images and the prints. By purposefully going for a split tone look I would be able to keep the prints more consistent with the screen images as well making the screen images appear slightly less digital to match the ‘much more human – analogue -non digital feel’ of the prints. In order to produce the split tone feel I used Adobe Lightroom’s ‘Split Toning’ feature in the Develop module. I experimented with different values for the hue of the highlights and shadows, the saturation of hue for the highlights and shadows and the balance of highlights and shadows split toning. I eventually arrived at the following values (consistent with each photograph for Assignment 3 – Landscape) through my own taste of the onscreen images and also printing a few times the different combinations of split toning until I was satisfied. The values I arrived at were: Hue and saturation of the highlights: 45 and 42 respectively. Hue and saturation of the shadows: 232 and 29 respectively. The balance between the highlights and shadows was +23 to the highlights. For me this produced a more ‘human’, less ‘digital’ feel to both the onscreen images and the prints.
Finally my tutor noted there was a lack of information on my blog regarding my inspiration for the ‘ghosts of the city’ as tourists for Assignment 3 – Landscape and the reason for this was I had inadvertently produced a few photographs where it appeared there were ‘Ghosts of the city’ evident in the frame. My most obvious example of this was in Example Photograph 1 where in the middle of the frame ghosts appeared to be residing in the city, caused by the long exposure of 5 seconds which was incidentally the exposure time necessary to expose at f/11, ISO 100 during the blue hour. The reason I chose to expose with these settings was because it allowed for minimal noise in the image and so resulting for my tastes in better image quality compared to if a higher ISO had been used. So really my inspiration for ‘Ghosts of the city’ was accidental! I had subsequently decided to incorporate this discovery of long exposures rendering people as ‘ghosts’ into my workflow in producing the photographs for Assignment 3 – Landscape.
Overall I feel I produced a good body work for Assignment 5 and had begun to find my own personal voice within the landscape practice which featured including human figures in the landscape settings, thereby adding meaning through observing the indexical relationship between them and the landscape. I was also able to explore issues of impermanence in the landscape which was brought about either by the presence of these temporal figures or their indirect human intervention on the land; leaving traces of their use visible on the landscape photograph. To establish these issues of impermanence I returned at night to photograph all the same scenes as the daytime counterparts with similar composition and framing which in my opinion made this trait more powerful. A lot of my project was built around the idea of a lack of permanence through human presence in the landscape around my area. Although the people were permanent for the duration of the photographs, they were largely transient outside of this and so the landscape as a consequence was transient as well, something I tried to reflect through the use of corresponding day and night shots. Not only did the human presence change but also often the physical use value on the landscape itself changed. I felt the night shots were the obvious way of portraying this change, which otherwise would have been lost on the viewer.
By researching other artists and styles of photography; most notably Stephen Shore’s work: Uncommon Places (1974-79) and then ‘Drift Photography’ – (Luessen, C., 2012), found at: http://arthopper.org/the-flaneur-psychogeography-and-drift-photography/ (accessed on 14/7/2016) respectively, I was able to draw upon some of their techniques which helped me to overcome some of the problems I’d been having with the project. The main problem included photographing the banality of suburban areas effectively. The way I overcame this included the use of colour in landscape photography and the signs of wear and physical use present in often overlooked elements of land features and how this can affect how we view the values of an area. In fact, I found this enabled me to photograph the less suburban (and so less banal to my eyes) parts of my local area more incisively in terms of human presence, either direct or indirect, inducing meaning on the photograph.
I found by looking at the landscape in a new way; through signs of physical use and impermanence rather than just what looked most picturesque, my visual observational skills improved a lot. I noticed the way the land was utilised by humans more and what effect this had on the landscape and then I had to use my awareness skills to draw attention to these factors through composition and the placement of people in the frame effectively to suggest use of their surrounding landscape. My techniques ranged from handheld to tripod use and I discovered shooting handheld allowed for much more spontaneity for including people in the frame in the daytime shots. With the nighttime photographs in contrast I reverted somewhat necessarily back to a more deliberate approach of tripod use.
I felt the presentation of the project was of a good quality with interactive maps on the website but I felt the overall creativity was lacking a bit. The approaches taken to arrive at the eventual photographs were appropriate in my mind with good sources of inspiration. However, there wasn’t too much variety within individual photographs compared to the creativity for the themes of the project. On the other hand this made the project consistent and more obvious to the viewer the themes in play. Lastly, I did indeed feel I discovered something more about myself through these landscape photographs and I would suggest my target audience of people living in the area might also.

No Visit To Johns Island would be complete without a stop at Rosebank Farms, a traditional roadside market famed for its fresh produce and fine flowers. Located on Bohicket Road, within "spittin- distance" of the glittering resort communities of Seabrook and Kiawah Islands, it is a land­mark that harks back to an earlier era, when the region, now engulfed by explosive upscale growth, was a rural community where agriculture reigned.
Presiding over Rosebank Farms is its founder and owner, Sidi Limehouse, a beefy, bearded man of 68 who traces his family-s Charleston heritage back to the 1700s.
Limehouse himself was born on Johns Island in 1938, at a time when the total population numbered some 4,000 souls. His family raised cattle and hogs and harvested potatoes from hundreds of acres of fertile Lowcountry soil. Hunting and fishing were year-round occupations-the deer season stretched from August through New Year-s Day-and everyone on the island knew one another.
" McGowan lamented that, "We-ve been trying to sell Kiawah Island for two or three years now for $50,000, and we haven-t gotten a single bite. "
That-s all changed now-not neces­sarily for the better, in Limehouse-s view-with the development of the area as a popular vacation destina­tion and site for elegant luxury homes. Nonetheless, he admits that he wouldn-t live anywhere else.
In fact, had fate taken a simple turn for the Clemson agricultural engineering graduate and former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, he might have become the emperor of his Johns Island domain.
The year was 1948, and Sidi recalls sitting around the kitchen table with his father, his brother, his great-uncle and family friend Russell McGowan, an attorney who represented the Vanderhorst family, which owned Kiawah Island.
McGowan lamented that, "We-ve been trying to sell Kiawah Island for two or three years now for $50,000, and we haven-t gotten a single bite."
Mr. Limehouse thought that sounded like a pretty good deal, and young Sidi agreed. But his father was talked out of the purchase because hardly anyone in the Lowcountry thought Charleston would amount to much. After the World War II economic boom fizzled out, the conventional wisdom was that the Holy City would never be more than a sleepy Southern community.
"You have to remember that in downtown Charleston, people used to paint only the front-the street side-of the columns on their houses," Sidi says. "The back part was never painted because passers-by couldn-t see it from the roadway."
At that time, Limehouse notes, Johns Island itself was so remote that it didn-t even have electricity. His family managed to rig a usable system through a friend who worked on elec­tric-powered submarines at the Navy Yard. He helped them obtain a dozen big, glass batteries that had been used on the subs. Each afternoon, they would run a generator hooked up to the batteries until the gasoline ran out, providing power "until maybe around 10 o-clock that night."
"All that was offered were party lines, and my father wanted no part of being on a party line," Sidi explains.
"You could buy a beach-front lot for $500, build a little shack on it, use it for 10 years and then knock it down, because it would have been stupid to build anything better," he adds.
The area was simply too remote. Air travel wasn-t yet commonplace and a national interstate highway system was still years away. Plus, Limehouse recalls, "Between the mosquitoes and the heat, it was just miserable in the summertime."
And that leads to Sidi Limehouse-s verdict concerning the one man who deserves both the credit and the blame for lighting the fuse on the population explosion that began on Johns Island in the 1960s and continues to this day.
His name was Willis Haviland Carrier, and he never lived in South Carolina. He did, however, invent modern air conditioning, "and that-s what brought all the Yankees here."

Freescape Camp Kitchen Knife The Freescape Camp Kitchen Knife is inspired by a Santoku chef’s knife.
A dual G-10/Stainless Steel handle gives the Mini Swagger grip and strength. Its unique machine styled blade earns its name.
I too use this as my everyday carry piece and it does everything I need it to. I've had it on in mud, water, snow, everything. Cleans up goods, sharpens even better and keeps an edge well. Black coating on the blade has resisted rust very well and hasn't chipped. Very, very sturdy construction and lock up. Love this knife.
I use the mini swagger as my everyday carry knife. It's a very good knife and has a very solid build. Takes a great edge and stays sharp. Not too big, not too small. Has a pocket clip that's solid. I would recommend to anyone.

Why wish my readers Happy New Year with a scowling picture of your humble blogger? This portrait was my good start to the year just ending. Randall Harris of Figureworks Gallery had invited me to submit a work for an exhibition of self portraits, the gallery’s first show of 2013. It was an opportunity to show alongside a wide variety of really good artists, some of them well-known.
In December 2012 I drew this portrait, with a camera set up to capture stages in the development of the picture. I pointed a video camera at myself and drew from the image on a monitor, to avoid the reversed face you get in a mirror and the frozen effect you can get from working from a photograph. The bluish colors you see under my eyebrows represent the cool glow of the computer monitor I could see on my face.
In the Figureworks exhibition, I showed the portrait as a multimedia piece, with the original 18″ x 24″ drawing hung alongside a digital screen playing an animation of the drawing as it built up, layer by layer. Here’s the video (email subscribers will need to click the link to see the video on Vimeo.
I really didn’t expect this work to sell. Who – besides maybe my mother – would want a giant picture of me? But a collector bought the piece (drawing and digital animation together), kicking off my 2013 with a red dot.
To all my readers, friends, and fans, best wishes for curiosity, creativity and joy in the coming year!
The Watcher is a life-size figurative sculpture that overlooks a quiet path in the woods at the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York. It’s been there for six or seven years, but coming upon it, you’d think it had been there for centuries. It seems to grow out of the land, manifesting the spirit of the place.
If this is a wood nymph, it is no pale, delicate fairy. The Watcher is rough and gnarled like an old tree, an embodiment of life force that survives the lashings of seasons by twisting and toughening and enduring.
Bellavia is the artist who created The Watcher. For many years she has been a strong presence in the creative community of the festivals at Brushwood. A few years ago she moved from Western New York to New Orleans, but still returns to Brushwood when she can. (Click on her name above to see other artwork by Bellavia.)
The Watcher is made is made of bronze, pine, burlap, organic matter, fiberglass resin, bone, and cast glass. Parts of it are cast from a live model, Liag, who is a friend of the artist. Liag told me “I have felt an attachment to The Watcher since I first saw Bella’s sketches in 2004. The process of me becoming part of the sculpture, my torso and arms and hand, was profound. I feel she is now part of me. I sense her presence within and around me all the time. She is alive.”
I asked Bellavia if she designed the work in advance or if it emerged from experimentation. She replied, “I had a rough vision of the piece when I started. It turned out a little like the sketches but so very different at the same time. The piece itself takes over at some point and brings itself to the front and I just become a conduit for it.”
She said the Watcher “was not made with brushwood in mind. I don’t work with places in mind for the work. I simply could not move her down south with me and I felt like I really wanted to give something back to the community at Brushwood.”
As a human who happens to be a woman I am all too aware that public opinion and disapproval is something that we are still essentially bound by. Our societal teachings about the many aspects of “self” are generally distorted and inaccurate. I am interested in presenting the viewer with a look into those distortions and offering glimpses of the possibilities in transforming that fear of disapproval or censure. My personal modes of perception towards the meaning and substance of life in all its complexities cause my work to be up close, personal and visceral. My artwork is exploration as a process of defining/redefining an image of the self and body. Oftentimes beautiful, dangerous and disturbing, a palpable presence arises from my work. There is always a hint of darkness underneath the beauty, completing the circle of light and dark. My work is daring, and shows courage, grace and beauty in being willing to challenge normal assumptions about sexuality and boundaries. I am very upfront about the assertion of ones sexuality and exploration of such. I am often my own subject, facing myself, my past and my demons. I endeavor to show the transformation process that starts in the soul towards a new definition of the self. This artistic process brings a freedom from the weight of prejudices, traditions, and custom and the healing from that lies not in distancing myself from it, not in attempting to heal it, but in embracing the experience as part of being alive.
Many people are drawn to spend time with The Watcher, and a sort of altar has grown around the base of the sculpture. I feel a power in the work, and I’ve occasionally tried to capture some of its spirit in photographs. This summer, I used The Watcher as a model for light painting. Light painting photographs are taken in the dark with a long exposure time, during which I move around the subject with flashlights or other hand-held lights, applying strokes of light to bring out aspects of the form or to suggest energy within.
The video below is made up of some of my light painting images of The Watcher, dissolving one into another so that light seems to move around and animate her earthy form. This is my personal exploration of the palpable presence of The Watcher.
Artists who work from direct observation have a special way of looking at their subjects, a darting glance that picks up impressions the way a janitor’s litter spike snags trash. Nearly every action that builds up the drawing or painting follows from one of those quick looks. You look and make a mark, look again to refine the mark, look again to find the spatial relation of this to that, look for angles, look for curves, look for shades and colors, look to compare, look to correct. You’re constantly comparing your sketch to your model, translating perceptions into marks, trying to see better and capture better all the time, and racing the clock. In a classroom full of artists of mixed levels of experience, you can pick out the ones that know what they’re doing by watching how they look: how efficient and focused is their glance, and how frequently they look between their paper and the model.
My friend and fellow figurative artist Karen Miles made a little film about this (email subscribers will need to follow this link to view the film on YouTube):
These artists are drawing at Minerva Durham’s Spring Studio in New York, a drawing studio that attracts the most dedicated practitioners of drawing from the live model. If you were to observe a drawing session at Spring Studio, you’d probably be struck first by the quiet intensity of the whole group of artists. There is no music, no talking, just the single-minded focus on seeing and drawing.
In quick poses my glances are looking for overall forms, trying to see the figure as an arrangement of curves in space.
In the crayon drawing above, I made a first rough pass in magenta, then refined my contours in a bolder blue. There was probably a glance for nearly every separate stroke in the drawing. The sketch below is done with a brush and black watercolor. The individual strokes are easier to distinguish here. I see the curve of the shoulder and that becomes a brush stroke, then glance at the breast and make that curve, then at the belly and make that curve, and so on. Each marking has a certain rhythm and motion that reflect a quick tracing of that particular contour in my perceptual system.
Quite apart from the act of drawing, the normal visual process works by assembling impressions picked up by quick movements of the eyes called saccades. The eyes only see clearly over a narrow angle; the overall sharp photographic image we think we see is constructed in the brain as the fragmentary impressions of the saccades are knitted together. (Here’s a more detailed blog post about how that works.)
Constant practice improves the speed by which we receive such perceptions. Each moment of seeing is translated into a movement of the hand. The resulting marks reflect the quality of these movements, and thereby trace a record of the act of vision, a series of impressions made as the artist experiences them.
Drawing is not simply a copying of contours, but a trail left in permanent marks as the mind examines a scene over a particular period of time. Seen this way, it is clear that drawing captures something that photography does not. A camera, like an NSA surveillance program, indiscriminately vacuums up every detail of light information in its range. A drawing artist is more like a murder-mystery detective, following all the trails, picking up clues, details, impressions, until a coherent picture emerges from the process. Photography is a mechanical scan, while drawing is an active, responsive exploration of a scene. The distinction is between intelligence gathering and intelligent gathering.
The drawing medium affects how I see. When I am holding a pencil, as in the sketch above, I see the scene in terms of lines. When I use a fan brush, as below, I see broader strokes of light and shadow revealing the form in space.
I look for curves, and I look for angles. The form is constructed of flowing, rhythmic curves. The spatial arrangement of those curves is defined by angular connections.
In drawing with a linear medium such as crayon or pencil, light, shade and color must all be translated into line. I imagine that I am drawing, not on flat paper, but directly on the body itself, so that every line follows the three-dimensional shape of the body. Notice the white serpentine line running from armpit to hip in the torso study below. It represents the center of a highlighted area, but its meandering reveals the subtle irregularities imparted to the surface of the skin by underlying layers of bone and muscle, as a raindrop snaking down a windshield shows the hidden undulations in seemingly smooth glass.
Every glance is a fragment of perceiving. Every glance becomes a stroke in the drawing. It is a living process to record the phenomenon of life.
When there is more time to develop a drawing, additional layers of perceptions build up as the artist looks at the subject again and again. Light, shade, color, reflection, absorption, space, energy, temperature, texture, gravity, vibration, growth and decay – all the phenomena of matter and of life can be found by looking and looking some more.
Color and light in the real world are complex and slippery. Capturing such things is not a matter of simply duplicating a surface hue and value. Everything is relative, so everything must be seen relative to other things in the scene. As the work develops, the glances are comparative. What areas are redder than their neighboring areas? What areas are greener?
A body exists in space, and the image in the drawing becomes more real as it develops a sense of space. Further glances look at the parts of the body as they intersect with elements of the background.
I keep glancing, looking at light that reflects into shadows and light that penetrates the translucent skin and emerges tinged and diffused, looking at creases that swallow light and bulges that create specular highlights and gradients.
To draw is to see seeing, that is, to experience in action all the processes that go into visual perception.
La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, one of the world’s great laboratories for cultivating new talent and exploring new directions in the performing arts, celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2011. Eric Marciano, an independent filmmaker for whom I have often worked as a videographer, produced some video pieces about the history and future of this great creative hothouse, and he asked me to draw portraits of a few of the key people interviewed or profiled in the clips, and to animate the process of creating the drawings. Eric’s company, American Montage, recently posted the resulting clips to its Vimeo page, so I can share them here with my blog readers. The video is embedded at the bottom of this post (but those who receive the blog by email subscription will have to follow the link to see it on the web).
These drawings could not be done from life, as I always prefer in portrait drawing, but had to be done from photographs, or, in most cases, freeze-frames from video interviews. They also had to be made to fit the wide 16 by 9 aspect ratio used for high-definition video, not the frame I would usually select for a portrait. This means much of the frame would be background, so I’d need to develop background designs for each face. I set up an easel with a camera on a tripod behind it, and as I worked on the drawings I stopped frequently to snap photographs of the work in progress. The photographs were used to make animations of the drawings as they come into being, layer by layer.
In “Faces of Figureworks“, the exhibition featuring self-portraits by fifty artists currently on view (through March 3, 2013) at Brooklyn’s Figureworks Gallery, I’m showing a new self-portrait drawing alongside a similar, but slower, animation of that drawing’s evolvement, displayed on a digital photo frame.
I remember being fascinated as a kid by Henri-Georges Clouzot’s 1956 film Le mystère Picasso, in which the famous artist painted on back-lit glass panels so the development and alteration of the works is recorded as it happens in time. It made me aware of drawing as a time-based artform. While we usually see drawings or paintings only in their finished form, their creation is a process of movement and change. Many of the directions I have explored in my own work, including painting as a performance, and many posts here on Drawing Life, have been my attempts to explore my own process, and to share that process with others.
In this post I’ll share the drawings I made for the La MaMa video, with stills of each drawing in its finished form, and brief introductions of the subjects, and at the bottom of the post I’ll share the animated clip.
So many famous writers, performers, directors, designers, and composers have been associated with La MaMa that a small selection of portraits like this is necessarily a somewhat arbitrary sampling, but one name is essential. La MaMa was the creation and lifelong project of Ellen Stewart, also known as Mama, whose portrait leads this post above. Stewart, a fashion designer, started La MaMa as a performance café in 1961, a supportive place for the burgeoning creative experimentation of 1960’s New York and soon a magnet for artists from all over the world who were drawn to its cross-cultural playground of theatrical magic.
Stage director Andrei Serban is known for innovative approaches to classic texts with enveloping theatrical pageantry.
Artist, singer and dancer John Kelly transforms his persona to explore the worlds and psyches of Egon Schiele, Joni Mitchell, and Caravaggio, among others.
Since the 1950’s, director Peter Brook has been making spectacular, visceral theater and film with an international cast of collaborators.
Composer, writer, and director Elizabeth Swados makes exciting music and theater, crossing every boundary of style and genre.
Visual artist and performer Christopher Tanner approaches everything he does with extravagant maximalism.
Mia Yoo, a former actress in La MaMa’s Great Jones Repertory Company, is Ellen Stewart’s successor, the Artistic Director of La MaMa ETC since Stewart’s death in early 2011.
And here’s the film, courtesy of Eric Marciano and American Montage, Inc. There is a glitch in the first clip, where Peter Brook’s background disappears and reappears at the end, but this should give you a good look at how my drawing process works. I believe the music is an excerpt from an Iggy Pop song. If you don’t see the video here, follow this link.

Character vector inputs have been removed. Instead, use syms to declare variables and replace inputs such as solve('2*x == 1','x') with solve(2*x == 1,x).
S = solve(eqn,var) solves the equation eqn for the variable var. If you do not specify var, the symvar function determines the variable to solve for. For example, solve(x + 1 == 2, x) solves the equation x + 1 = 2 for x.
Y = solve(eqns,vars,Name,Value) uses additional options specified by one or more Name,Value pair arguments.
Return the complete solution of an equation with parameters and conditions of the solution by specifying ReturnConditions as true.
Solve the equation sin(x) = 0. Provide two additional output variables for output arguments parameters and conditions.
Alternatively, find a solution for x by choosing a value of k. Check if the value chosen satisfies the condition on k using isAlways.
Solve this system of equations and assign the solutions to variables solv and solu by specifying the variables explicitly. The solver returns an array of solutions for each variable.
When solving for multiple variables, it can be more convenient to store the outputs in a structure array than in separate variables. The solve function returns a structure when you specify a single output argument and multiple outputs exist.
A solution is formed by the elements of the same index in S.x, S.y, and S.conditions. Any element of S.parameters can appear in any solution. For example, a solution is x = pi*k - asin(3^(1/2)/3), and y = 2*pi*k - 2*asin(3^(1/2)/3), with the parameter k under the condition in(k, 'integer'). This condition means k must be an integer for the solution to be valid. k does not exist in the MATLAB workspace and must be accessed with S.parameters.
For the first solution, find a valid value of k for 0 < x < pi by assuming the condition S.conditions(1) and using solve to solve these conditions for k. Substitute the value of k found into the solution for x.
Plot the left and the right sides of the equation. Observe that the equation also has a positive solution.
Solve the following inequalities. Set ReturnConditions to true to return any parameters in the solution and conditions on the solution.
Solve this equation. Instead of returning an infinite set of periodic solutions, the solver picks these three solutions that it considers to be most practical.
Try to solve this equation. By default, solve does not apply simplifications that are not always mathematically correct. As a result, solve cannot solve this equation symbolically.
Set IgnoreAnalyticConstraints to true to apply simplifications that might allow solve to find a result. For details, see Algorithms.
solve applies simplifications that allow it to find a solution. The simplifications applied do not always hold. Thus, the solutions in this mode might not be correct or complete, and need verification.
When you solve an equation or a system of equations for a variable under assumptions, the solver only returns solutions consistent with the assumptions. Solve this equation for x.
For further computations, clear the assumption that you set on the variable x by recreating it using syms.
When solving polynomials, solve might return solutions containing root. To numerically approximate these solutions, use vpa. Consider the following equation and solution.
When you solve a higher order polynomial equation, the solver might use root to return the results. Solve an equation of order 3.
Try to get an explicit solution for such equations by calling the solver with MaxDegree. The option specifies the maximum degree of polynomials for which the solver tries to return explicit solutions. The default value is 2. Increasing this value, you can get explicit solutions for higher order polynomials.
Equation to solve, specified as a symbolic expression or symbolic equation. The relation operator == defines symbolic equations . If eqn is a symbolic expression (without the right side), the solver assumes that the right side is 0, and solves the equation eqn == 0.
Variable for which you solve an equation, specified as a symbolic variable. By default, solve uses the variable determined by symvar.
System of equations, specified as symbolic expressions or symbolic equations. If any elements of eqns are symbolic expressions (without the right side), solve equates the element to 0.
The order in which you specify these variables defines the order in which the solver returns the solutions.
Flag for returning parameters in solution and conditions under which the solution is true, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ReturnConditions' and one of these values.
false Do not return parameterized solutions. Do not return the conditions under which the solution holds. The solve function replaces parameters with appropriate values.
true Apply purely algebraic simplifications to expressions and equations. Setting IgnoreAnalyticConstraints to true can give you simple solutions for the equations for which the direct use of the solver returns complicated results. In some cases, it also enables solve to solve equations and systems that cannot be solved otherwise. Setting IgnoreAnalyticConstraints to true can lead to wrong or incomplete results.
Flag for returning solutions inconsistent with the properties of variables, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'IgnoreProperties' and one of these values.
Maximum degree of polynomial equations for which solver uses explicit formulas, specified as a positive integer smaller than 5. The solver does not use explicit formulas that involve radicals when solving polynomial equations of a degree larger than the specified value.
Flag for returning one solution, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'PrincipalValue' and one of these values.
Flag for returning only real solutions, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'Real' and one of these values.
Solutions of an equation, returned as a symbolic array. The size of a symbolic array corresponds to the number of the solutions.
Solutions of a system of equations, returned as a structure. The number of fields in the structure correspond to the number of independent variables in a system. If ReturnConditions is set to true, the solve function returns two additional fields that contain the parameters in the solution, and the conditions under which the solution is true.
Solutions of a system of equations, returned as symbolic variables. The number of output variables or symbolic arrays must be equal to the number of independent variables in a system. If you explicitly specify independent variables vars, then the solver uses the same order to return the solutions. If you do not specify vars, the toolbox sorts independent variables alphabetically, and then assigns the solutions for these variables to the output variables.
Example: [solx, params, conditions] = solve(sin(x) == 0, 'ReturnConditions', true) returns the condition in(k, 'integer') in conditions. The solution in solx is valid only under this condition.
Parameters introduced by solve do not appear in the MATLAB workspace. They must be accessed using the output argument that contains them. Alternatively, to use the parameters in the MATLAB workspace use syms to initialize the parameter. For example, if the parameter is k, use syms k.
The output variables y1,...,yN do not specify the variables for which solve solves equations or systems. If y1,...,yN are the variables that appear in eqns, that does not guarantee that solve(eqns) will assign the solutions to y1,...,yN using the correct order. Thus, when you run [b,a] = solve(eqns), you might get the solutions for a assigned to b and vice versa.
To ensure the order of the returned solutions, specify the variables vars. For example, the call [b,a] = solve(eqns,b,a) assigns the solutions for a to a and the solutions for b to b.
log(a) + log(b) = log(a·b) for all values of a and b. In particular, the following equality is valid for all values of a, b, and c:
log(ab) = b·log(a) for all values of a and b. In particular, the following equality is valid for all values of a, b, and c:

When I started this photography thing in the crazy world of cycling, Cyclist Magazine was always something I aspired to work with. Their ability to showcase images of a high standard has always been something that has drawn me to their work and obviously, the calibre of photographers that work or have worked with the magazine was something I wanted to be part of - so they made the bucket list.
I got my first call up to go to the Giro with Team Sunweb and journalist James Writts. I have spent most of my photography path documenting Movistar, so I was really keen to experience the world of another team and see how they progress through Grand Tours. The fact they were hosting the leader's jersey, maglia rosa, was the icing on the cake.
Cyclist Magazine have just released their latest issue with a good selection of images and a great insight into the world of a Grand Tour winning team, from chef tricks through to leaving a rider at the hotel when setting off to the start - check out it here: www.cyclist.co.uk
Here are a few 'outtake' images from my time with the team - hope you like! Cyclist latest issue hosts the best of the bunch, so don't forget to grab your copy to view more work - stay tuned for future images ;)

Science fiction writer Zecharia Sitchin popularized the Sumerian civilization in his books, notably
NASA states that �Planet X� is an oxymoron when applied to a real object. The term has been used by
astronomers  over  the past century for a possible or suspected object. Once the object is found, it is given
a real name, as was done with Pluto and Eris, both of which were at some time referred to as Planet X.
Carl Sagan wrote that extraordinary claims demand extraordinary levels of evidence if they are to be believed.
      To astronomers, Nibiru is a myth, a planet that is nearby and is invisible is just plain silly.The great
      majority of the photos and videos on the Internet are of some feature near the Sun, (apparently
      supporting the claim that Nibiru has been hiding behind the Sun for the past several years.) .
There are speculations that the US government is trying to hide the truth about Nibiru for whatever reason.
It is a fact that with technology, it is difficult for any government to keep secrets from the public,  a system
that is known to backfire badly. In the case of Nibiru, if it were real, amateur and professional astronomers
around the world  can not keep a secret of this importance even if they are advised strongly not to.
There is a theory claiming that the earth's crust rotates 180 degrees around the core in a matter of

claiming a magnetic reversal is coming soon on 2012  which will trigger a reversal of rotational poles.
There  is on-going discussion about the alignment of Earth and Sun with the center of the Milky Way
in the constellation Sagittarius which occur every December with no incidents. Why should this alignment
Some claim that Earth is in the center of the Milky Way.  According to NASA scientist, in the Milky  Way
Galaxy, the Earth is far towards the edge of the spiral galaxy, some 30,000 light years from the  center.
The Earth circles the galactic center every 225-250 million years, always at approximately the same

Thanks bro. I can play that too and smash bros brawl or project M if you talk about fighting games, we can play when you wants, tell me the day or from here you could send me a text, well bro I fell the lag too , I am from domican republic too far of Italy, and one more things, you know to DEVO,? he entered on naruto at the same time like you.
Oh, bad... I'm too far from you to play DBZ BT3 without lags and also with Smash Bros is impossible to connect together. What about Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom? Otherwise we can play together with Naruto... and I don't know DEVO: I played with him but I don't know who he is.
Hi bro ty for played with me right now I don t have controlls only to naruto or MKw, not even i can t play brawl :(, u wants play mkw with some friend?
Hi DarkStar, thank you too! You're the best! For MKW usually I play it in worldwide races with other casual gamers...

All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.
All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.
In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.
In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.
Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

How absolutely stunning, my friend! I would love to visit, take in the views and eat all that delicious food :)
I enjoy all the beautiful photos of the harbour, fruits and vegetables and the delicious food photos too!
Terrific photos of a wonderful region of France. Thanks for taking us along through your photography.
Biggest sigh. I've not been to Provence and always wanted to go. Seeing your magnificent photos only makes me long to experience it in person.
I hope you do get to go, Jeanie, it is a special place. You only see the nice things as a visitor but even knowing that I left thinking that they really knew how to live there.
Dear Amalia, you have a great talent for photography (among other talents)! Those pictures of Provence are wonderful. Have a lovely Sunday!
Your photography is also a delight! And France is wonderful indeed. My daughter speaks of moving to that country. But I do hope she'll change her mind (she's almost 13 now) :-)

Libya has long been a destination country for many individuals seeking better socio-economic conditions. The geographic location of Libya makes it a transit country for migrants heading to Europe. More recently, security and socio-political crises have deeply impacted migration dynamics in Libya and the wider region. Building in particular on the strategic lines set out in the Joint Communication 'Managing flows, saving lives' and the Malta Declaration, the EUTF for Africa in Libya aims to foster and support a migration management and asylum system in Libya that is consistent with the main international standards and human rights. In this respect, and given the dire situation in which migrants and displaced populations are stranded in Libya, the EUTF for Africa pays particular attention to protection and assistance to migrants and their host communities in the country in order to increase their resilience. It also provides for, to the possible extent, the improvement of access to life saving protection services and assistance in detention centres and voluntary humanitarian repatriation for migrants in and outside detention centres. Finally, the EUTF for Africa supports the national authorities to foster their capacity to counter migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings and a more efficient integrated border management.

Icy what your all doing with these puns. There's snow way I can't lose with sun of these, weather or not you like them is a completely different matter.
Hail, everyone. I'm here to chill. Hopefully I'll be added to the punner froster, and not just given the cold shoulder.
So... Cold puns? That's cool. I think yours are rather ice. Oh, and weather ones? Those cold be arainged. I just hope we don't branch into warmth ones. Things might get heated then. Or the thread might freeze.
Nay, That's not puny! Stop horsing around with food jokes, you wont findus making them nor complaining about Tescos burgers costing a pony, partially because they are part of a stable diet!
He was a great warlord from Mongolia who, despite his clear dominance and prowess in battle, still had to suffer the questioning of his might:
However, there was a setback that neither he, nor any othe man in history, was capable of forseeing or overcoming: His wives.
All the time, during his many military campaigns and conquests, they tried to catch his ttention with sweet phrases the kinds of : "Come on, Atty boy, stop burning that house and come eat dinner." "Please, my barbaric honey bunny, stop torturing those guys and come to sleep, it's getting late!" "Oh, Mighty Conqueror King, why don't you conquer your bad habit of throwing your plate armor and crown on the floor, hmmm?" "Deary, either you stop splashing your clothes with blood, or you help me wash them!" The list goes on.
His soldiers and friends, as well as his enemies, teased him about this, and so he came to be known forever more as "Atila the Hon."

I swear there are HUNdreds of these jokes going around, anymore and Im Gunther kill someone... I really KHANt take it anymore.
Think it's time to branch out. It's hunlikely that we can stick to these exact puns, and I see Ellac of diverse puns. We'd probably be Bleda off not saddled with that restriction.
Not a pun but a poem for Karishad that I have popped on a poetry thread but, as his friends/challengers seem to be here...
Oh carp, sea-critter jokes. I was being koi earlier but something fishy is going on here, I was just too preoccupied with dropping the bass to actually notice it.

Shakespeare bought the supermegasized combo when he went to the cinema. Halfway through the film he finishes his ultraginormous drink and realises that he's desperate for the toilet. It's the middle of a key dramatic scene upon the outcome of which hinges the rest of the movie. So he really doesn't want to miss it but he's absolutely busting which leads to his dilemma. To pee or not to pee, that is the question.
Shakespeare is visiting the Alps during winter and he goes into a shop to rent some snow gear but he's not entirely sure which winter activity he wants to try first. So he asks himself: to ski or not to ski, that is the question.
Shakespeare is implicated in a crime and the cops are after him. He's not sure whether he should turn himself in or not, so he says to himself: to flee or not to flee, that is the question.
Shakespeare is really not sure how he went on his exams so when the results come he asks his friend to open them for him. He turns to his friend and says "Two C's or not two C's, that is the question."
Shakespeare sees a crime and while the police are taking his statement they ask if the perpetrator had any identifying marks. Shakespeare remembers a tattoo of a couple of insects but he's not entirely sure what it was. So he replies: "Two bees or not two bees, that is the question."
Shakespeare is directing the positioning of sets on his stage but he can't decide how he wants the forrest set out. Two trees or not two trees, that is the question.
Shakespeare is trying to decide whether to use liquid nitrogen or an antifungal cream to get rid of his warts. To freeze or not to freeze, that is the question.
Shakespeare is working for the police and he's just caught an illegal shipment of orange soda. Now he has to decide whether or not to let them continue to their destination and track them or just to take control of the shipment. To seize or not to seize, that is the question
