So the ruling body decided to act. The R & A voted to outlaw the anchored stroke in 2012, and the United States Golf Association quickly followed suit, with the professional golf tours falling in line not to long after that. A grace period of several years was enacted to allow players using the anchored stroke to wean themselves off their long putters. That transitional window is now closing.
There has never been any evidence that putting with an anchored stroke is more effective than a traditional stroke. If that was the case, you can bet that the golfers like Jordan Spieth and Bubba Watson, who are playing for millions of dollars in prize money – and their livelihood – would all be using long putters. Most recreational golfers have never bothered to add a long putter to their arsenal, except for those with physical ailments or a belief that the anchor helps cure putting woes.
When the ban is enforced – loss of hole in match play and two strokes in medal play – in 2016, thankfully the vast majority of us will never notice. Just like Y2K. Those players that did rely on this technique and need to give up their anchored strokes have had plenty of time to practice and make adjustments. The impending disappearance of the long putter come January is nothing most of us need to concern ourselves with.

A photographic odyssey accompanied by passages from Chandler's greatest works, reissued for the 50th anniversary of the film of Chandler's novel The Big Sleep.
Chandler's Los Angeles is a city of looming monoliths, endless alleyways, and outlying suburbs teeming with illegal activity, all linked by wide boulevards and miles of expressways. The City of Angels and its environs provided the endless physical and moral sprawl for Philip Marlowe's private investigations, and when things got rough, Marlowe like to go for a drive: Santa Monica Pier, Ventura Boulevard, San Bernadino Freeway, Beverly Hills ("the best-policed four square miles in California").Reissued for the 50th anniversary of the film version of Chandler's classic novel The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler's Los Angeles is a visionary journey across a landscape of darkened bungalows, decaying office buildings and sinister nightspots an atmospheric tribute to both the writer and his city.
"An intriguing literary tour...with striking photographs of the city, evoking dramatically the environment of private eye Philip Marlowe's relentless stalking of his prey." American Cinematographer
"There's as much atmosphere here as architecture: windblown eucalyptus trees in Laurel Canyon, poinsettas tapping against the side of a shinglehouse, a concrete stairway descending into who knows what urban danger... All those interested in Chandler, in local architecture, in L.A. history and in photography should find much of interest in this book." The Los Angeles Daily News

I am just back from a fabulous yoga retreat in God’s Own Country, Kerala – life is not over if one has not experienced the energy & lush landscape of this region and that is the subject for another very important conversation 🙂 The retreat was intense and light – a balance that is difficult to achieve & enjoy! The yoga and meditation ensured that each day had a rhythm of flexibility & surrender – so when we had 2 powerful sessions of personal inquiry, let us say, it was easy to explode, heal & soar.
Our amazing facilitator Hari led us through the understanding of 9 primary emotions, the Navarasas, that run common through all forms of Indian art & knowledge systems – paintings, dance, music, yoga, and Ayurveda. The premise of the session was that because we have various conditionings that prevent us from totally experiencing these primary emotions, we develop secondary patterns that are repressive or oppressive. Makes sense so far – yes?
As soon as he got to the end, I nearly took off from the floor. Do you see it too? Yes that’s right – there is no happiness in that list! For the remaining 50 minutes or so of the session, that is where I stayed. As a coach, if I could have a rupee for every time I hear the words: I just want to be happy – well at the least, I’d be able to hire someone to write this for me 🙂 You know what I mean…
Just look around – the pursuit of happiness is not only the viral trend of the ages, it is also a possibly trillion dollar industry! And it makes us most unhappy that we cannot be happy. So imagine a possibility that it is not primary, basic, part of our essential nature to be happy. What if happiness is actually a by-product and as such accidental? What if we shifted our focus from wanting to be happy first and foremost to being happy when we are happy?
Basically, what this means is that totally experiencing one of these primary emotions can (maybe) bring me a moment or moments of happiness. I met an old friend, we shared some old memories & fell into uncontrollable laughter….aah look, happiness! I stand at the edge of the ocean watching the sun disappear at the horizon turning the sky into a palette of reds, golds & then purples. Total awe….and then quiet happiness! And we can go on…
As I am writing this, I just let out a big sigh! When I shift the goal from happiness to something that comes naturally to me and something I can do easily, then I am in flow. There is no effort, there is nothing to remember or strive for, nothing that makes me feel like I am missing out or incomplete.
WOW that is wondrous! PS feeling happy I am 🙂 or as my beautiful friend Keerthi would say: happy is coming!
Silent Veil was founded in 2012 by Clemens Finkelstein to provide a platform for experimentation for all creative practitioners, allowing them to step aside from their already established positions, fostering potent exchange and collaborations between artists, architects, designers, choreographers, theoreticians etc.
Anti.Mnemosyne [curated by Clemens Finkelstein] is the first solo exhibition by young Swedish-born artist Martin Kozlowski in Berlin, Germany. The show consists of large paper works that Kozlowski uses to build up and excavate the hidden, invisible structures of musings, influences, love, relationships and all of its dramatics.
Anti.Mnemosyne is the first solo exhibition by young Swedish-born artist Martin Kozlowski in Berlin. The show consists of large paper works that Kozlowski uses to build up and excavate the hidden, invisible structures of musings, influences, love, relationships and all of its dramatics.
The exhibition title is derived from the titaness Mnemosyne [Greek: ‘memory’], who is mother to the nine muses and a prominent figure in ancient Greek mythology. Her name is used in the exhibition conjunctively with the prefix ‘anti’ to take up the myth of the two rivers Lethe and Mnemosyne as nodal point of connection to Kozlowski’s latest work on remembrance and the uncovering of traces of memory and inspiration. As similarly described in Plato’s Republic, Lethe is the river in Hades from which dead souls drank so they would erase their memories before reincarnation whereas its counterpart Mnemosyne – as liquid memory – was used ceremonially to achieve the exact opposite.
Concentrating on fresh pieces that are the manifestation of a recent change in trajectory for the artist, Anti.Mnemosyne tries to mediate Kozlowski’s experiences via revealing and re-substantiating what usually remains invisible to the ordinary bystander, concentrating on the emotional ties to loved ones, places, or the mnemonic musings that are derived from them, yet without reverting to lamentation, the artist carries out his approach with just a quantum of recognition and tribute to the elements that formed him as an individual.
Kozlowski’s more abstract and minimal explorations can be classified as a deeply introspective yet outwardly accessible view into the workings, connections and nodal concentrations of human interaction on a deeply emotional and personal, yet also on an incredibly inspiring level.
This particular alchemy of excavating the buried strands of memory through an abstract and minimal approach to patterns and structures of painting and drawing is what makes Kozlowski so interesting, allowing his audience to approach the viewing and interpretation of the works in relation to their own experiences.
The strands of paint that reverberate against each other demonstrate the flow of memory that becomes apparent through the crystallization of such connections. Kozlowski’s bridge between painting and calligraphy [writing graffiti] brings to mind Lou Zhenggang and her opinion that ‘calligraphy reveals one’s true self, and painting uncovers the aspirations spoken from their heart.’
His at first glance seemingly random placement of paint and lines morphs into complex systems of labyrinthine proportions that thematize an allegory of the mind, picking up on what Freud insists, ‘a trace of each inscription [that] remains in the surface below.’ The displaced elements of negative space gather into structural riddles and subgroups of the greater puzzle, the depth of Kozlowski’s works, which is subjected to a process of transformation that does not remain entirely at the hands of the artist; his structures that through the placement of wet acrylic form the paper surface that reacts to the inscribed material. The two-dimensional flat picture plane of the paper is not elevated by illusionistic properties but by the process and time it takes the paint to dry, transposing the lines and structures into a more bodily physicality, part of the pictorial story as told by Kozlowski. The journey that one undertakes when passing along the diverse works becomes a journey through the convolutions of Kozlowski’s memory, his desires, persons, places that left an imprint that is being excavated and made visible for the audience by unfolding and casting them on paper. They all become metonymic in a rare recognition of the endless proliferations of connections and remembrances in re-tracing what only remains in its residue, trying to preserve and enhance them through visualization.
As counterparts in the tradition of Lethe and Mnemosyne, Kozlowski’s Anti.Mnemosyne reveals itself as the place of modern memory sites, those metamorphoses of one place after another, from transparencies to opacities of emotional and inspirational fluids that act as an extension for the memories that otherwise decay fragmented as mnemonic ruins, the fragments "from which we try to reconstruct the lost totality."

13 is a ‘post-Platonic’ screening stage for established artists and BA / MA art students from Europe – USA – Asia. We are happy to be helping out and being part of this amazing new format that has been brought to life by SV’s own Martin Kozlowski (Goldsmiths, London UK), Louise Katrine Bonde-Hansen (Goldsmiths, London UK) and Sara Marie Sandfær (Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien, Vienna AT).
“Watch me before I evaporate” …lunar-like floats the white rectangle before the gazing eyes of the cinephiles. Flickering images change at times quickly, at other times are kept more constant in long shots that seem like stills of a green and ghostly forest – the only thing that seems to happen are doomy sounds of deep and high chiming church bells (‘Foreign Fado’ by Jacobus Capone (AUS)). This is just one of the myriad of video works that was screened and that has found its beautiful presentation in an old cinema in Central Stockholm. Once a voluptuous retreat of film screenings, the building situated in Stockholm’s Södermalm has now been turned into a church, and for the period of the festival, into a cinema again. A cross here and there, imagery of saints and benches that remind one of church-like penance have been mixed with soft and comfortable couches, giving the audience the opportunity to immerse themselves, delve deep into the video art works and stay alert to absorb the works throughout the six hour long programme, screened twice a day with intermittent breaks to fill up on the fresh popcorn served at the entrance to the cinema hall.
A play of chiaroscuro was met by technicolor wet dreams, the projection surface surrounded by metres and metres of black fabric, throwing long delicate folds that through their deepness did accentuate the flat glowing surface that was installed as central ‘altar’ of 13 Video Art Festival.
A broad selection of video art works, ranging from well known artists like the YBA’s own Georgina Starr (UK) or Lilibeth Cuenca Rasmussen (DK), whose ‘Afghan Hound’
performance was previously shown at the 2011 Venice Biennale, met upcoming, young and inspiring artists such as Sulaiman Majali (UK/JOR), Melancholy Maaret (USA/FIN), Jemima Stehli (UK), Jaakko Pallasvuo (FIN), Endam Nihan (USA), Leah Clements (UK) and Michael Angelo (DE/SE), to name just a few of the outstandingly good festival contributions. Artistic research projects were intermingled with semi-documentary fiction-tales of wannabe artists or artistic salvation. They met more experimental, colourful assemblages of hypnotic imagery and religious icons like in BADFOOD’s (UK) ‘Buddha’ or the cinematically beautiful, touchingly honest and forward thinking contribution by Danish Kasper Skovsbøl, whose Jeg tog i byen became one of my favourites of the festival at the speed of light: A Danish women’s choir performing a beautiful musical piece fit for the church surrounding it was shot in, yet portraying with their angelic voices not a hymn on god, but a hymn on HIV and the repercussions, public perceptions, which unraveled in an autobiographical confession, or so it would appear, in an explicit description of a casual sexual meeting between to strangers – all the while leaving the audience in the dark about the possible sex of the autobiographic subject, increasing tension about the transference between a possibly male protagonist unto the numerous women that made up the choir.
With a strong focus on Scandinavian art and artists, contributors’ origins were as diverse as Asia, the Middle East, UK, USA, Oceania and Central Europe.

EXCELLENCE in customer service ranks very highly on this "must do" list... and digital marketers ignore this fundamental rule at their own their peril.
Why is it that some digital marketers think that the basic rules of marketing only apply to the OFFline world?
Excellence in customer service has ALWAYS been one of the tenets of a successful business. It has always made the difference between an average business and an extraordinary business.
For example, examine the success of a major, international hamburger chain. Do they sell the best hamburgers in the world?
No, they don't. However, one thing they've got completely right - and this company spends huge amounts of money training its staff to get it right - is customer service.
This company treats the customer service aspect of its business with the respect it deserves...and this is one of the primary reasons its become an international chain.
So, how does this piece of information about an International Hamburger Restaurant chain relate to you and your web based business?
Very simply it's this. Webmasters need to pay very careful attention to the elements that create business success in an offline world, and recognize that in the digital world the critical aspects of offline business success have just compounded the game tenfold.
Tell the truth at ALL times. Unless you're an e-sociopath you'll forget your lies anyway. So, why bother?
Always have an automatic - "Thank you for your query. We will respond in person within 24-48 hours" - type message in place. This is VERY easy and inexpensive to set up.
If you treat this person well you have an opportunity to create a life-time customer who will actively promote you and your business.
T= TIMELINESS of a response from a Human Being. Whatever you've said you'll do in your automatic response, do it.
REMEMBER THIS - Your sole purpose in business (ONline or OFFline) is to solve people’s problems, excellently.
Solve their problems well and you'll have a vibrant, lucrative business. This is called excellence in customer service.

It?s unlucky that the acronym for Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) has such an unfortunate rhyme! Even more unlucky for WAP, it burst onto the mobile communication scene with lavish promises from the Mobile Operators (you know who you are) of ?The Internet on your Mobile? and ?Take the Internet with you?
The rise (and rise) of SMS is instructive. This has gone from nowhere to everywhere with practically no promotion from the networks. Type SMS into Google and you get 52 million hits! In China in 2003, 220 Billion SMS messages were sent. During 2003 in the UK alone, 30 Billion were sent, which equates to 500 for every man, woman and child in the entire country! What is going on here?
Well SMS is cheap, not cheap enough perhaps but, up until a couple of years ago, much cheaper than calling. So it was a viable alternative to making a mobile phone call, everyone could send and receive them, and it didn?t matter what handset you used or what network you were on (or even which country you were in).
Much the same is true of WAP. Most handsets sold this century in GSM markets are compatible. Costs, especially using GPRS, are very low, as long as the information is optimised for the handset. Actually, it costs less to read your email with GPRS than to send an SMS. How times change!
And people are using it, too. In the UK in December 2003, the number of WAP pages viewed was over 1 billion for the first time. The Mobile Data Association (MDA) forecasts 13 billion for 2004 as a whole, up from 9.2 billion in 2003 (against an original MDA forecast for 2003 of 8 billion).
All this is in the face of complete indifference, if not outright hostility, from the networks. The problem for them is that, as mentioned, WAP is cheap. You can get all the mobile email you need via WAP to your handset for around one tenth of the cost of a RIM Blackberry data subscription. And please don?t ask how much the running costs are of a laptop mobile data card! A while ago, one of my colleagues used more data in a month than the cost of the mobile data card itself. Since then the networks have introduced more reasonable price bands, but he now gets all the email he needs on his cellular phone via WAP for one hundredth the amount spent during those expensive 30 days. And he doesn?t need to carry a laptop around with him, wait for it boot, wait again for it to download the mail, and balance it on one hand whilst holding his coffee with the other and his mobile phone in a third!
One of our customers for our mobile email software reads his mail whilst shaving in the morning ? he can find out what has been happening overnight without having to get his computer out, dial in and log on. Another browses whilst tending to his cows, miles from mains electricity. Yet another admits he reads his mail in board meetings ? so far luckily no-one has noticed his mobile sitting on the desk in front of him.
And there is for WAP, most likely, no new device to buy, either. Nothing additional to weigh down your pockets or to find room for in your briefcase. And it isn?t just good for email. You can also look up train timetables, get news & sports results, find medical information, find a restaurant and see what?s on the TV tonight.
And you can do all this, with the one electronic device that most people have with them all of the time ? their mobile phone.
So ? no new expensive devices are required, no high monthly charges are incurred and there is no waiting. No wonder the Mobile Operators aren?t impressed!

Rose gold hair colour looks are very popular right now, and this is definitely because they’re one of the most flattering colour choices you could make. There are so many examples of this colour look that you could take inspiration from, from mixed blondes with strawberry red shades, to more bright pops of pink, and even more sophisticated and classy rose gold tones. With so many ways to wear it, and so many ways to customise it too, it begs the question – why aren’t you looking at these rose gold hair colour looks more closely yourself?
Don’t worry, if you’ve been on the hunt for looks to rock for a while, we’ve got a few that might jut save you some shopping around. Whether you’re looking for something bright and bold, or muted and discreet, there’s a look for everyone. We can’t wait to hear which ones you fell in love with too!
If you’re already blonde, rose gold hair colour looks are perfect for you, because you already have the perfect starting point to build up on. If you had a darker shade of hair – black, reds, and even dark browns, you will need to go through a lengthy lightening / bleaching prices before you can even begin to think about adding any kind of rose gold hue over the top. Most people aren’t aware of that, and can usually all out of the hair salon rather upset when their rose gold hair colour looks don’t turn out quite as they had planned.
Pink is a rather cool shade. Gold, on the other hand, is a rather warm shade. When you mix the two together, you have colours that suit almost every skin tone. Isn’t that the good news you were hoping for? (We knew it!) What does this mean for you? It means that you should be saving these rose gold hair colour looks to your phone so that you can show your hair stylist exactly what it is you’re looking for. The more pictures you have to show him or her, the better an idea they’ll have of what you do and don’t want, and the happier you are likely to be when you walk out of the salon.
The shades have been so wonderfully blended in this look, you have no idea where one starts and the other begins, and that’s a great sign of a brilliant balayage. Balayage is the term used for hand-painting hair, highlighting it in a natural way. If you think of all the places on your hair that the sun would hit, and therefore highlight, in the natural sunlight, that’s where you’d want to paint the hair. The lighter shades are more natural, regardless of what shade you’re adding.
We’ve seen lots of looks with long hair and this beautiful rose gold shade, but now we’ve decided that short needs to get it’s own little feel of the limelight. If you were looking for an excuse to cut your hair short, this rose gold slanted bob is definitely the one you were looking for. It’s simple and effortless, all rolled into one. A look as simple as this is easily recreated in the morning with a few hair products and a tousling with your fingers. It’ll just look more peachy and pastel-pinky as it fades too, making it even easier to rock.
If you’re unsure whether you want balayage or ombre rose gold hair colour looks, always opt for the balayage. The ombre can look rather harsh if this is your first time playing around with brighter and more unnatural pops of colour, and a balayage is often easier to grow out too. If you are going to opt for an ombre, go softer to start with. You can always build up more colour as time goes on. It’ll be much harder to take the colour away if you pile too much on.
We keep seeing quartz cakes all over Facebook and Instagram, so it was only a matter of time before the stunning look made its way onto hair too. There’s something very beautiful about this quartz and rose gold ombre, a beautiful blend between the two. You’ve got a pastel pink-purple at the roots, but still quite a muted shade. If you’re doing this at home, you could easily recreate the lighter, pastel tint by adding more conditioner to your dye. It’ll also give your hair a good nourishing while you’re there! That purple pup then blends into a wonderful rose gold, giving you a rich colour that anyone would be envious of.
If you’re looking for rose gold hair colour looks that really think outside of the box, we would love to suggest to you this rose gold and Autumn lavender balayage look. It’s easy, stylish, simple, and oh so pretty. We can’t think of a single reason why you wouldn’t want it. These lighter shades are often suggested for blondes to play around with, mostly because darker hair takes a long time, and a lot of lightening, before you can opt for lighter, brighter pops. This natural, Autumn brown shade looks great with rose gold and lavender, hand-painted balayage blends. It’s one of our favourites, what do you think?
Pink is a very fun colour, and definitely works if you’re young, fun and full of vitality. Of course, just because you’re not young doesn’t mean you can’t rock this hair shade too. It’s all about working out which shades better suit your skin tone, maturity, and the kind of look you want to achieve. These pretty pink shades really do make a statement – is it the kind of rose gold statement you’re trying to make?
This is a really cute look, one of the rose gold hair colour looks that we’re definitely adding to the lust-list. There’s something very cute and innocent about it, and definitely very feminine too. You have rose gold mind with peach to achieve these locks, all applied over a wonderful golden blonde glow. It’s fresh and pretty, and definitely one of the best we’ve seen. Wouldn’t you agree?
If you have blonde hair, feel free to let a little loose in your bathroom to try and recreate these rose gold hair colour looks. If you have darker hair, however, think again. The lightening and bleaching action is likely to leave your hair look spotty and patchy, and you’ll wish you’d gone to the hair salon in the first place.
How do you feel about grapefruit pink? Not quite bright, but not quite dull or dusky either, it’s a beautiful blend of in-between, especially when you throw these rose gold hair colour looks into the mix too. If you have blonde hair naturally, you have so many more options open to you when it comes to playing around with colour. We all know that dark locks take a lot of work to get bright, light, and just right, so you should definitely play around with it if you can. Here you can see a beautiful grapefruit pink shade applied over honey, golden-coloured locks, giving you a wonderful rose gold multi-shaded tint.
After you have been brave and gone for a look like this one, make sure you know how much maintenance is going to be required to keep it looking this good for as long as you need it to. These rose gold hair colour looks will fade quite quickly, and you will need to be prepared for the regular salon appointments afterwards. You’ll need to make sure you keep up to date with those touch-ups.
We’ve been looking closer at braided looks recently, mostly because they’re always in trend. People are getting creative now, bringing fishtail, waterfall, and lace braids into the mix, and we love how the fishtail has been used to show off all the shades within this look. What’s the point in going for these rose gold hair colour looks if you’re not willing to show them off? Whatever way you twist to braid it, you should definitely get creative. And then come back and show us what you did … obviously.
As well as making sure you have time and money set aside for regular hair salon appointments with rose gold hair colour looks such as these, you may also want to reconsider what kind of hair products you’re using. Your shampoo, for example, should be substituted, either for one specifically designed for rose gold hair, or at the very least, one that has been designed to treat and take care of coloured hair. If you use your regular hair shampoo and conditioner, you may find that they cause your hair to fade very quickly.
There’s just the hint of rose gold in this more bubblegum beauty, a slightly cooler take on the warmer rose gold trend. As far as rose gold hair colour ideas go, this one might just be one of our favourites. The rose gold shades have been towards the roots of this look, with the brighter, pastel / baby pink pops left to get brighter towards the bottom. A great look if you’re naturally blonde underneath it all, but it can be achieved with the right pre-lightening treatments if you have darker hair.
Shampooing and conditioning your hair every day isn’t a good idea as it is if you want to take care of your locks, but this is most definitely the case when you choose rose gold hair colour looks such as this one. Opt for dry shampoo where you can, and also make sure you’re leaving it at least two or three days between washes. If you wash your hair any quicker than this, your rose gold hair will fade in no time at all.
If you’re a big fan of metallic hair, this one’s a winner, a beautiful blend of rose gold and copper shades. The loose waves help to show off all dimensions of the colouring within the look. Those darker roots always make life a little easier. When you leave the roots this darker shade, you can go a few extra weeks between salon appointments. Doesn’t that make life sound great? Dark roots are a big thing right now. What better time to rock them than during the winter, especially with these beautiful rose gold hair colour looks.
Rose gold hair colour looks like this one are very pretty, but can sometimes require longer length hair. If you don’t have longer length hair already, don’t be afraid to fake it a little with some hair extensions. If you buy decent quality ones, you can dye them. This means that you can dye them to your regular hair shade, or this new rose gold one (if that’s the one you have chosen), and get longer lengths without waiting for your locks to grow. Smart, right?
At the same time as not washing your hair regularly, you should also turn down the temperature on those days you DO wash your locks. Hot water can cause the colour to run quicker, and the cooler water will shrink the hair follicles and prevent the colour from pouring out. We know a chilly shower doesn’t seem like a great idea first thing in the morning, but your hair will thank you for it.
Peaches and warm gold style rose gold hair colour looks are better all-round. This is most definitely the case if you’re not sure what shade will suit your skin tone, eye colour, etc. These warmer tones work well for both cool and warm undertones to the skin. Also: they won’t clash with cooler tones, as is the case with most other pink hair styles.
If you don’t want to go for an all-over look, a balayage rose gold blend is a great place to start. You’re not coating the hair all over, giving just a hue or a wash-over, rather than a solid block of colour. This is often easier on your hair, requiring less in the way of lightening and bleaching treatments. It is also much easier to maintain as it fades too, and often allows for darker regrowth.
And there you have them – 21 rose gold hair colour looks that we are definitely obsessed with right now. Which ones have rocked your boat? Are there any you’re tempted to try yourselves? Which picture will you be frog-marching into the hair salon to copy on your own locks? We can’t wait to find out, and we’d love for you to send us in your beautiful hair snaps. If we’ve inspired you, shout about it. We would love to feature you and your locks on CherryCherryBeauty.
Don’t forget to show these amazing hair creators some love while you’re here. We wouldn’t have anything to fawn over if it weren’t for them. There’s your daily dose of hair inspiration. What shall we take a closer look at next?

It’s coming close to that time of year again. The time where you need to start shopping for a new outfit, accessories, hair, makeup, and finally, short Valentines Day nails. That’s right, it’s almost the day of love again, and we’re getting ready nice and early. Y’know, because that’s what we like to do.
If you’re in the market for some short and sweet designs this year, we’ve found 21 that we think you’re going to love the look of. Don’t forget to let us know which ones were your favourite, and feel free to send us in your beautiful designs. We’d love to feature you.
Wow! Aren’t these nails incredible? These were love at first sight for us, and although they are time consuming, they’re not impossible to do at home. It’s just a case of learning how …
You’ll want to first start by adding a base coat. This will ensure that everything else sticks as it should, but it will also make it easier to get rid of that glitter later on, without the need to cause damage to your nails.
Add something to create that heart template. Whatever you use, make sure it’ll be easy to remove later on. Add your gold glitter using a dabbing motion with a sponge, and once it has dried, remove whatever you used for the heart shape. Once you remove it, you’ll have a negative space design that looks a little like this one. You can use a thin nail brush and some black polish to emphasise the heart. A top coat will make sure nothing moves once your masterpiece is complete.
It would be weird to feature Valentine’s Day nails and not have pink ones, right? Well, how do you feel about this pretty pink offering? X’s and O’s thrown in for good measure, of course.
You could use a nail wrap for the heart pattern, or you could even try nail stamping. We’ve tried that a few times and it’s actually not as difficult to do yourself as you’d think. It’s all a case of having a steady hand and knowing the technique.
Alternatively, cheat like we do from time to time, and use nail transfers. There are loads to pick from, and they take just seconds to apply.
Are you looking for Valentine’s Day nails that are cute subtle? These might just do the trick, with the right hint of barely-there love.
We don’t really know where the whole Valentine’s Day idea comes from, but it’s believed to originate from a man called Saint Valentinus, a minister who performed weddings for soldiers even though it was forbidden at the time. When he died, he was buried on February 14th, and that’s where the special day is said to originate from.
According to reports, over 36 million boxes of chocolates shaped like hearts are given to loved ones on Valentine’s Day every year. We wonder how many of those get thrown back …
According to studies, women spend around £60 on gifts for their men on the big day, but men are spending more than double that – £120-130, and in some cases more.
Maybe men don’t show enough love throughout the rest of the year and need to seriously overcompensate when Valentine’s Day comes around? Either way, with short Valentines Day nails like these, at least you’ll hands will look great when you’re unwrapping your goodies.
What do you think about these pastel pretties? Who said everything needed to be pink and red on Valentine’s Day? These are “traditionally” coloured, but they still have those love-heart balloons so technically, they still express enough love to make it to the list.
When it comes to getting your short Valentine’s Day nails right, it might be worth keeping any designs to a minimum to ensure your short nails don’t look even shorter with fussy and intricate designs. The one featured nail here is enough to make an impact, but it’s not too much that it completely takes over. When your outfit is adorable as hell, the last thing you’ll want people to focus on is your nails.
We really love these adorable short Valentines Day nails, and it’s that clever pink and white backdrop that we want to draw your attention to. It’s a great idea when you’re using nail transfers or decals, but you want a decent enough backdrop to the overlay to really make the look pop.
Start with a base coat, and then use two or three coats of a white nail polish. You’ll want to go for thinner layers, and more of them, over one thicker layer. The latter will take forever to try, and is more likely to smudge too. Once it’s dried, use a thin nail brush to wipe a baby pink polish over the nails, and then once that’s dried, add your decals and transfers. You could even add the odd touch of glitter and shimmer to the mix if you fancied some sparkle too.
Red nails are classic nails, especially when it comes to V-Day. When you want short Valentines Day nails that will make a big impact, these little red beauties are definitely a trend to follow.
Keep things a simple shape – nice and square / squoval at the ends, and then get rid of any of your previous manicure. You’re going to want a nice clean and smooth nail bed to get this look just red. If you don’t have a smooth base, that red will show up every crack, lump and bump, and we’re sure that’s not the look you’re going for!
These little pastel nails are so cute, we just can’t help ourselves. What do you think? Would you rock these for Valentines Day 2017?
Hearts are really easy to hand-paint onto your own nails, and the more practice you have the easier you will find it. It’s two blobs placed by side by side on the nail, and then using the help of a cocktail stick, you mould them together so they resemble the heart shape. Cover with top coat and allow to dry completely and you’re pretty much good to go. Short Valentines Day nails made simple!
You couldn’t talk about short Valentines Day nails without having some red delights, and we think these deep red nails are just perfect if you want a real sassy and elegant look.
To make them really stand out, add that feature nail. Anything looks much brighter and lighter when it’s added over the top of a white backdrop, so whatever you paint over the top of it will really pop. In this case, the red heart. As we said before, hearts are easier to freehand paint than you’d think, but you could always use a stencil to make sure it looks spot on … quicker.
You’ve probably already guessed that we love negative space nails. We talk about them enough. And feature them too, for that matter. We’d definitely recommend that you get your hands on some heart-shaped stencils if you’re no good at freehand. We’re not very good at it, and when we tried to recreate these ourselves, they just ended up looking a bit bad-polkda-dot.
With the red nails, start by applying that heart-shaped template on the base of your nails, just covering your skin a bit too. You can’t see the bottom of the heart. Once the hearts are firmly in shape, paint your red polish, wait for it to dry, and then peel the heart away. Cover with top coat and you’ll be left with something that looks a little like this.
These nails are super cute – the word love emblazoned across four of your nails, rather than focusing on decorating them individually. We really like the base shade that has been used here, almost a slightly shimmery nude colour, and it works really well with the simple red design over the top.
These are definitely simple and short Valentines Day nails, and ones we reckon we could recreate ourselves. What do you think? Could you? Would you?
For when you can’t make up your mind and go with just one pattern for your short Valentines Day nails, what about these multi-design nails, each of your talons painted differently?
The colours used here are really cute – grey, pink, and white. The combination of X’s and O’s with the love hearts and stripes work great too. Which design is your favourite? We really like the three-coloured stripes.
There’s not a love heart in sight but we think these short nails would still work for Valentines Day. Mostly because they’re pink … or wasn’t that obvious? They’re short, simple, and super easy to do at home, giving you a five-minute manicure to save both time and nail appointment money.
Work out which nails are going to be your decorated nails, and then paint them white. The rest of the nails can be painted baby pink, or whatever Valentine’s Day shade you have opted for. Once you’re done there, the white should be relatively dry, and you can go ahead and use tweezers (or a dotting tool) to place little holographic pieces. We liked the shape of these ones, but you could go for the shattered glass effect, love hearts, flowers, or whatever you liked really. Cover with top coat and you’re done. Easy peasy!
If you’re a white-tip kinda gal and you don’t really want to give that up, what about these short Valentines Day nails? They’re white-tipped, like you usually opt for, but with one simple love-themed addition – that beautiful red love heart.
There are different tones in the love heart, giving it a real three-dimensional feel, and you can achieve that by using your dotting tool and slightly different shades of red. The lighter shades would be used to highlight where the light would naturally reflect, and the darker shades would be used to create a shadow-effect, where the light wouldn’t hit.
Another day, another negative space delight, but these ones are perfect for short Valentines Day nails! The glitter ombre gradient is easy enough to achieve with the help of some fabulous glitter polish and a sponge. Don’t forget to use that dabbing motion, because the brush will just smear glitter pieces all over the place.
The heart doesn’t need to be perfect, so feel free to get creative without the use of transfers or stencils. Use your pink shade and a thin brush to get the basic heart outline, and then paint everything on the outside of it. You can use the thin brush dipped in nail polish remover to clear up any mistakes that you make. Finish it off with that thin brush again, but this time dipped into your glitter shade, and cover with your favourite top coat. Winning!
Do you own one of those little nail punch things that creates hearts and other shapes instead of circles? You can use something like to create shapes out of holographic pieces, or other nail covers and transfers. An excellent start to these adorable nails!
Simple pick your feature nail, use a base coat to make the nail tacky, and then apply whatever pieces you’ve decided to use. Once everything is in place, give it a few moments for the base coat to completely dry, and then cover with a glossy top coat. Much easier than it looks, right?
We’d use a stencil to get this beautiful Valentine’s Day look, especially if you want to make it look as great as this. Use your deep red shimmery polish to cover all the nails with the exception of your pinkie. That will be printed with the shimmery and sparkly gold shade instead.
You’re going to use the same gold shade over the stencil design to give you that heart-shaped look. You could also try hand-painting, or using little decals too. Alternatively you could cheat entirely and use nail wraps. We do that all the time, but don’t tell anyone!
They’re short and simple and won’t take too long to do – just three reasons why we love these love-themed talons. Plus, they’re red. Red and Valentine’s Day go together like … salt and pepper, cake and custard, tuna and mayo. (Notice how they’re all food-themed?)
Just leave the one nail unpainted when you’re doing your red cycle, and paint it white instead. When it’s dried, use a black nail pen to write the word love, and a red dotting tool or nail pen to create that little red love heart. We told you they were nice and simple.
These ones have the tiniest, barely-there pastel love heart on them, and that’s why we feel they needed to be in the running of the best short Valentines Day nails.
Leave your nails natural and nude, and using a stencil and a sponge, dab on that beautiful gradient heart. If you want to make a statement, but still keep your boss sweet, this might just be the way to do it!
Last but certainly not least, we come to these adorable short Valentines Day nails. They’re pink, there are love hearts, and there’s glitter too. Really, what more could you possibly want?
It’s the dusting of glitter that really brings this look to life, and it’s definitely something we’d advise if you want to add some sparkle to the occasion. All you need now is a beautiful sparkly rock to go on that finger to match your beautiful sparkly nails!

It features a couple dozen great tunes from the midcentury American songbook, and while there's not much at stake, it's a genial if inexpert...
I thought I'd be too busy trying to get ready for Christmas to blog, but then I remembered I don't cook, and I don't shop. I barely clean. I totally have time to blog!
Kid C: "When you die, and then when you come back, you'll be a little baby. So I'll be your dad. Right?"
me: "Um, no." (That's all I said, because I didn't even know how to begin to tell him all the things wrong with that sentence.)
3. So, it's December 21st. How are all y'all's Christmas Plans going? Or, if you don't believe, how is your:
I love the evening of the 21st. That's when we gather our family, and hunt throughout our house for random flashlights, and then when it gets dark, we hunt around for the batteries. And then mother (in her kerchief) yells at father (in his cap) that he should've gotten stupid batteries at the stupid store. And then we light candles, and little Timmy mutters under his breath, "One day I'll be a teenager, and then I'm outta here."
i just made a final run to walmart this AM at 7:30 (after vowing to sleep in until at least 8 AM every day of my kids holiday break).
i think i am w/kid C and will be coming back as a TEENAGER to my kids to haunt them for the rest of thier lives! MUHAHAHAHAHAH (really evil laugh) :O)
Wouldn't that be so cool if we really could come back as teenagers, and give our kids heart attacks? It's only fair, I think...
You know, Kid C may not be very far off with his beliefs. You never know. Look at Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I know that doesn't really support his theory, but it's Star Wars and can be used for all situations in life!
Happy Christmahanukwanzaakahs! That's my standard greeting for this time of year. Those who believe in Festivus can just go jump in an ice cold lake and sink to the bottom. ;)
When are we doing Pizza and New Moon??? It has been 9 days since my last viewing and I am having withdrawls!!!
Jenni- I totally remember the part in Star Wars where Darth Vader dies, and then comes back as Luke's baby.
Of course, it's KILLING me that I have ONE MORE DAY until The Dark Divine because ever since I read that first free chapter online, it's only tortured me to death. One more day. Let's hope I make it.
Are you asking where I went? I went to a little piece of hell called Barnwell South Carolina...I am back now so don't worry! Although, I have developed a bit of a backwoods accent.
L.T.- Did you know you can read the first four chapters of The Dark Divine on the Romantic Times website? Cut and paste this link:
my plans are: head south to warm weather, hang out with family, and eat tangerines for a week straight. i dream about that all year.
Rachel- You mean, you're gonna leave this beef stew we call air? Wimp! Sorry, I'm just jealous that you will actually see the sun. I'm guessing Arizona doesn't' even know what an inversion is.
Oh how it pains me to be the one to let you know that Hannukah is over already this year! It's the thought that counts, right teen mom Brodi? Or is that mom-as-teen Brodi? LoL!!
Sal- Hanukkah's over? Oh, man. How did that happen? Oh well. What I should've said is, "Hope you had a great Hanukkah. Past tense."
Thanks for the clarification. And if I ever had to relive my teenage years, that would be a separate sort of Hell. Off-topic, but just sayin'.
Una- Me too. That's why I write YA. I get to relive my teenage years the way I want, and forget about the embarrassment that they were.
If I could be a teenager again, and know what I know now, I'd do it again. I had a lot of fun as a teen, but also had a lot of drama. What am I talking about, I still have drama!
Hope you have a wonderful Christmas and find the batteries in time to light the way for Santa to find his way to your house.
I like your reasoning about the teenage years. But if there weren't any drama, we wouldn't really be teenagers, right?
As always, you are correct. My oldest just turned 13 and there have been more than a few "My life totally sucks!" moments already. Strap yourselves in, it's going to be a bumpy ride.
This is the best blog post I've read all week. Thanks for making me laugh so hard! Favorite moments: "i totally have time to blog!" "what's wrong with Kid C's sentence" and "stupid batteries." Yes. It is beautiful. Love it Brod!
At conferences and online, Tom and I have long been talking about a mystery deployment option coming soon from the GlassFish team. It would combine the agile command-line-friendly model of Mongrel with the power and simplicity of deploying to a Java application server. We have shown a few quick demos, but they have only been very simple and very limited. Plus there was no public release we could give people.
So what is this tasty little morsel? Well, it's a 2.9MB Ruby gem containing the GlassFish server and the Grizzly connector for JRuby on Rails. It installs a "glassfish_rails" script in JRuby's bin directory, and you're done.
That's all there is to it...you've got a production-ready server. Oh, did I mention you only have to run one instance? No more managing a dozen mongrel processes, ensuring they stay running, starting and stopping them all. One command, one process.
Of course this is a preview...we expect to see bug reports and find issues with it. For example, it currently deploys under a context rather than at the root of the server, so my app above would be available at http://localhost:8080/testapp instead of http://localhost:8080/. That's going to be fixed soon (and configurable) but for now you'll want to set the following in environment.rb:
And of course, you're going to be running JRuby, so you'll need to take that into consideration. JRuby's general Rails performance still needs more tweaking and work to surpass Mongrel + Ruby, but out of the box you already get stellar static-file performance with the GlassFish gem...something like 2500req/s for the testapp index page on my system. The remaining JRuby performance is continuing to improve as well...we'll get there soon.
So! Give it a try, report bugs on the GlassFish issue tracker, and let us know on the GlassFish mailing lists what you'd like to see improved.
I'll believe it when it runs our app without puking about ARGV not being defined. Oh, and when it can actually handle file uploads without falling over.
anonymous: Truly! Both issues are known and will be fixed soon. The first relates to how GlassFish is embedding JRuby, and the second...well it got fixed in GF V2, so hopefully we can track down what fixed it.
I appreciate another deployment option for JRoR apps. But I think the claim "The End Is Near For Mongrel" is an invitation to the usual kind of Java/Ruby flame wars. I'd rather try to avoid that
iak: I'd love for that to happen...the only real question is "what should that look like?" The Rails module in Grizzly could easily be expanded to support deploying arbitrary Ruby application types, but those application types would probably need some modification to meet it half-way. For example, The current module is Rails-specific because it manages the Rails instances, sessions, and so on directly. I could see that a generic deployment mechanism might allow you to deploy a specific Ruby file, and that could register services and manage resources. Hmm...we should talk more.
It's great if GF simplifies deployment. What about RAM? Mongrel costs about $20 to $30 a month for a small-audience Rails app on a 256 MB VPS. Additional apps are about $10 a month. How does GF compare? Simpler combined with lower cost would be really cool.
On another issue, it remains to be seen if Mongrel's days are numbered. A major part of my interest in Ruby and Rails is to get as far away from Java as possible. After what I've been through, I kind of don't even want to hear the word "Java" or J-anything. I don't think I'm alone in feeling that way.
I'm guessing JRuby and GF will have to not merely match but decisively exceed (Apache|Nginx|Lighty) and Mongrel to capture individual developers and small startups. I'm not sure about big organizations though. That could be a whole other story.
Your not alone and now it appears that Sun is getting real cozy Microsoft. I tried NetBeans (It's very good!) and actually was warming up to to using jRuby when it was dictated that a Java platform MUST be used. But Sun/MS or Novell/MS are things I personally will try to avoid.
Though grizzly is certainly a great server, esp. since it uses java nio inside =)... (kinda similar to python's twisted)
Why do you care if your Ruby program runs on the JVM? JVM is a very good virtual machine. I can understand that you may have had enough of the Java programming language, but the JVM is just a VM...
Great for folks using Rails. Will there be a similar option for the many people using Nitro or Ramaze or IOWA or Merb or Camping or Cerise for their Web applications?
Not everyone wants or needs the bulk of Rails, and having an agile JVM deployment alternative for the many other Ruby Web frameworks would rule.
Catchy title, but fortunately it doesn't mean an end for Mongrel if you don't want Java on your server (like me for example). C-Mongrel is doing fine, serving hundreds of thousands of reqs from my app servers everyday and is not going anywhere soon (and so is Java I suppose :-P. Anyway, it's good to have yet another deployment option.
Awesome with the simple deployment scenario! I have done some benchmarking and unfortunately the glassfish_rails + JRuby 1.0.1 seems really slow :-(
For a simple action that shows the title of a book model, I get 10-11 req/s using glassfish_rails and with a single Mongrel I get around 75 req/s? (measured using ab).
I'm with James Britt on this one. The end of Mongrel would mean the end of Merb, and that would be a bad thing indeed. Rather than all this futzing around with heavy Java app servers, why not create JMongrel? Or both, I guess.
I made some test and it seems that a JBoss installation is really faster and consumes less memory than a GlassFish deploy, when dealing with Rails apps.

Forget all the big national weather sites. Forget all the big TV show weather reports. Year after year, day after day, in comparing all weather report sources for the most accurate weather reporting - and for foliage reporting, we found that KY3 TV out of Springfield Missouri is way better than all the rest. Springfield is almost in the center of the Ozarks. The KY3 forecast was almost always what we met out in the field. Their forecasts were accurate within hours.
Go to http://www.ky3.com/weather and at the top of that page will be a 7 day forecast, radar maps, and a long list of other excellent weather features. Of particular interests are the video forecasts of chief meteorologist Ron Hearst, and also Brandon Beck. You can also download apps for smartphones at the KY3 web site. Once you are in the area watch these forecasts one way or another twice a day.
The weather patterns you want to see for grand foliage are cool sunny days, as in no warmer than 60 to 65 degrees, with no clouds or only short periods of cloud coverage. These cool sunny days need to be followed by even cooler nights having temperatures in the low 50's and mid to lower 40's. These temperature conditions need to be present for at least a week just prior to the dates given here for False and True peaks. And they need to persist during the peak color periods.
What has happened in about half of all our years of reporting is that we get near perfect foliage-producing weather conditions. Beautiful clear cool days followed by wonderful crisp fall nights. The colors turn fast and well. Then, as peak approaches, here comes a kill-joy warm front. And warm fronts always seem to come with lots of clouds. If a cloudy warm front lasts more than two days, damage is done. Foliage will not be as bright. The longer it lasts, the duller foliage gets.

“I strongly believe that the value of imported construction materials will continue to increase as the sector recovery continues.”
Ministry of Commerce figures obtained by the Post yesterday show 536,969 tonnes of materials, worth a combined US$467 million entered the Kingdom between January and September, compared to 331,324 tonnes worth $164 million.

Things that pop into my head, and I want to claim "I thought of it first". Oh, and probably some work stuff too!
Having got EdWeb working with EASE, I went back and tried it against our weblogin CoSign service, and that too works. My initial problems were probably the openldap issue that EASE had.
I’ve still not got a clear way to access a site as “admin” once EASE/Cosign is enabled, other than temporarily disabling the UoE LDAP and EASE modules, and reverting to the old way.
I’m looking at an “admin” site that uses basic auth, so I can sign in as “admin”, and though that has a slight success, it then fails with what looks like a failure to find “admin” in the LDAP and then extract an email address, and role information for him. I’m not sure if that should be considered a bug or not.
Also had a look at cron, has Kenny was having problems with the new scheduling on our test 1.10. A mail to UWS Tech suggests that using the wget and cron key is the way to do it, rather than using drush (which I’d been experimenting with).
The recent round of LCFG client testing using real LCFG profiles from both Informatics and the wider community has shown that the code is now in very good shape and we’re close to being able to deploy to a larger group of machines. One issue that this testing has uncovered is related to how the type of a resource is specified in a schema. A type in the LCFG world really just controls what regular expression is used to validate the resource value. Various type annotations can be used (e.g. %integer, %boolean or %string) to limit the permitted values, if there is no annotation it is assumed to be a tag list and this has clearly caught out a few component authors. For example:
Both of the last two examples (baz and quux) are tag lists, the first just does not have any associated sub-resources.
The compiler should not allow anything but valid tag names (which match /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/) in a tag list resource but due to some inadequacies it currently permits pretty much anything. The new core code is a lot stricter and thus the v4 client will refuse to accept a profile if it contains invalid tag lists. Bugs have been filed against a few components (bug#1016 and bug#1017). It’s very satisfying to see the new code helping us improve the quality of our configurations.
As part of porting the LCFG client to the new core libraries the qxprof and sxprof utilities have been updated. This has led to the development of a new high-level LCFG::Client::Resources Perl library which can be used to import, merge and export resources in all the various required forms. The intention is that eventually all code which uses the LCFG::Resources Perl library (in particular the LCFG::Component framework) will be updated to use this new library. The new library provides a very similar set of functionality and will appear familiar but I’ve taken the opportunity to improve some of the more awkward parts. Here’s a simple example taken from the perldoc:
The library can import resources from: Berkeley DB, status files, override files, shell environment and explicit resource specification strings. It can export resources as status files, in a form that can be evaluated in the shell environment and also in various terse and verbose forms (e.g. the output styles for qxprof).
The LCFG::Resources library provides access to resources via a reference to a hash which is structured something like:
The top level key is the component name, the second level is the resource name and the third level is the name of the resource attribute (e.g. VALUE or TYPE ).
The new LCFG::Client::Resources library takes a similar approach with the top level key being the component name but the value for that key is a reference to a LCFG::Profile::Component object. Resource objects can then be accessed by using the find_resource method which returns a reference to a LCFG::Resource object. For example:
Users of the qxprof and sxprof utilities should not notice any differences but hopefully the changes will be appreciated by those developing new code.
Following on from the basic tests for the new XML parser the next step is to check if the new core libs can be used to correctly store the profile state into a Berkeley DB file. This process is particularly interesting because it involves evaluating any context information and selecting the correct resource values based on the contexts. Effectively the XML profile represents all possible configuration states whereas only a single state is stored in the DB.
The aim was to compare the contents of the old and new DBs for each Informatics LCFG profile. Firstly I used rdxprof to generate DB files using the current libs:
This creates a DB file for each profile in the /disk/scratch/results/dbm directory. This is much faster than using rdxprof.
The final step was to compare each DB. This was done simply using the perl DB_File module to tie each DB to a hash and then comparing the keys and values. Pleasingly this has shown that the new code is generating identical DBs for all the Informatics profiles.
Now I need to hack this together into a test script which other sites can use to similarly verify the code on their sets of profiles.
The project to rework the core LCFG code is rattling along and has reached the point where some full scale testing is needed. The first step is to check whether the new XML parser can actually just parse all of our LCFG profiles. At this stage I’m not interested in whether it can do anything useful with the data once loaded, I just want to see how it handles a large number of different profiles.
Initially I hit upon bug#971 which is a genuine bug in the schema for the gridengine component. As noted previously, this was found because the new libraries are much stricter about what is considered to be valid data. With that bug resolved I can now parse all 1525 LCFG XML profiles for Informatics.
Over the last few years I have been working on (and off) creating a new set of “core” libraries for LCFG. This is now finally edging towards the point of completion with most of the remaining work being related to polishing, testing and documentation.
This project originated from the need to remove dependencies on obsolete Perl XML libraries. The other main aims were to create a new OO API for resources/components and packages which would provide new opportunities for code reuse between client, ngeneric and server.
Originally this was to be a rewrite just in Perl but the heavy resource usage of early prototypes showed it was necessary to move at least some of the functionality into C libraries. Since that point the chance to enhance portability was also identified and included in the aims for the project. As well as making it possible to target other platforms (other Linux or Unix, e.g. MacOSX), the enhanced portability should make it much simpler and quicker to port to new Redhat based platforms.
The intention is that the new core libraries will be totally platform-independent and portable, for example, no hardwired paths or assumptions that platform is Redhat/RPM (or even Linux) based. The new core is split two parts: C and Perl libraries with the aim that as much functionality as possible is in the C libraries to aid reuse from other languages (e.g. Python).
The aim is that these libraries should be able to co-exist alongside current libraries to ease the transition.
I have spent a lot of time on documenting the entire C API. The documentation is formatted into html and pdf using doxygen, I had not used this tool before but I am very pleased with the results and will definitely be using it more in the future. Although a slow task, documenting the functions has proved to be a very useful review process. It has helped me find many inconsistencies between functions with similar purposes and has led to numerous small improvements.
The client has been reworked to use new Core libraries. This is where the platform-specific knowledge of paths, package manager, etc, is held.
There is currently no support for reading header files or source profiles but this could be added later.
There is still work to be done on the top-level profile handling code and the code for finding the differences between resources, components and profiles needs reworking. Also the libraries for reading/writing XML files and Berkeley DB need documentation.
That is all the remaining work required on the “core” libraries. After that there will be some work to do on finishing the port of the client to the new libraries. I’ve had that working before but function APIs have changed, I don’t expect it to require a huge amount of work.
Coming back from holiday I was pleased to see that I have a v4 client instance which has now been running continuously for nearly 3 weeks without crashing. It hasn’t done a massive amount in that time but it has correctly applied some updates to both resources and packages.
In the time I’ve not been on holiday I’ve been working hard on documenting the code. For the C code I’ve chosen to use doxygen, it does a nice job of summarizing all the functions in each library and it makes it very simple to write the documentation using simple markup right next to the code for each function. I’ve also been working through some of the Perl modules and adding POD where necessary. It might soon be at the stage where others can pick it up and use it without needing to consult me for the details…
Comments Off on LCFG Client: Hasn’t died yet…	| Uncategorized	| Tagged: lcfg, lcfg-client	| Permalink
After much effort I finally have the first functional installation of the v4 LCFG client. This sees all the XML parsing and profile handling moved over to the new LCFG::Profile Perl modules which are wrappers around the new lcfg-core suite of libraries. There is still a bit of work required to properly handle LCFG contexts but otherwise it can handle everything we need. There are probably lots of small bugs to be resolved, there is also an almost total lack of documentation and the tests needs lot of attention but hey, at least it runs!
The LCFG client has a, slightly weird, feature called “secure mode“. This makes the client hold off applying any resource changes until they have been manually reviewed. The manual checking is done by examining the contents of a “hold file” which shows the differences in values for each modified resource in a simple text form. The file also contains a “signature” which is the MD5 digest (in hex) of the changes. A change set is applied manually by passing that signature to the client which then regenerates the hold file and compares that signature with the one supplied. This is not a heavily used feature of the client but it is something we want to support in the new LCFG profile framework. The new framework has built-in support for diffing the data structures which represent LCFG profiles, components and resources. This makes it relatively straightforward to add a feature which generates the secure-mode hold file when required, the only awkward part was finding some code to do the MD5 digest in a nice way.
Over the last few months the new libraries for handling LCFG profiles have been shaping up nicely. They are finally reaching a point where they match up with my original aims so I thought I’d give a taste of how it all works. Here’s an example of processing an LCFG XML profile into the Berkeley DB and rpmcfg files required by the client:
This is basically what the LCFG client does whenever it processes a new profile but is a lot nicer than the current rdxprof code!

Now that the wildfire smoke has cleared, the smell of hockey season has taken over at the Sherwood Park Arena. Main Camp wrapped up on Monday with the intrasquad game, known to some as the Top 40 game.
Team White (Whiteridge) took on Team Black (TnT High Pressure) in a game that started out hot with three goals coming on the first seven shots of the game between the two squads.
*Let me say that everything from here on out is strictly my own opinion and doesn’t necessarily reflect that of team management or coaching staff*
Despite lots of players trying to leave a lasting impression on management, nerves didn’t seem to be at the forefront. Passes were crisp, shots were hard, and chemistry was evident.
The game wrapped up 6-5 in favour of Team Black, though Team White made it interesting in the final minutes after Michael Benning slashed into the slot and buried a beautiful pass with 1:28 left in the game.
Rookies Carter Savoie and Zafir Rawji dazzled time and again for Team Black, finding each other on outlet passes, two-on-ones and just about any other facet of the game. They’re both going to be tremendous additions to the team, in my opinion.
“It’s probably one of the best black and white games we’ve had in a lot of years,” said General Manager Kyle Chase of Monday’s game.
“Lots of talent out there. We have huge upside on the back end right now as far as young talent coming in—we’re very fortunate. And even the forward group, for that matter, it’s been a very deep group of players as far as skill and ability go.”
With several players from last year’s team currently off at WHL camps, the door has been wide open this weekend for young players to make an impact. Savoie, Rawji, Benning and Tanner Fincaryk were all thrust into big minutes in the intrasquad matchup and absolutely sparkled. If these names land on the regular season roster, the Crusaders will likely have the best crop of rookies in the AJHL.
That being said, there’s a chance that forwards Arjun Atwal (Prince George), Erik Miller (Swift Current), Blake Sydlowski (Red Deer), Brendan Stafford (Lethbridge), rearguard Tyler Jette (Tri-City) and goaltender Matt Berlin (Kootenay) could return from WHL teams and bolster an already talented roster.
Next up for the Cru is a trip to Camrose for exhibition games against Drumheller, Camrose and Whitecourt—those run Wednesday through Friday. Roster movement will take place thereafter, meaning this will be the last chance for anyone on the roster bubble to cement a role.
The only home pre-season game goes down on Sunday, September 2 against the Olds Grizzlies at the Sherwood Park Arena.
Overall, though it’s early in the process, this team has the looks of a group that could make a deep playoff run. A solid group of young talent insulated by veteran stalwarts is a recipe for success at any level, and the Crusaders have just that.

There is a hunger in you, Clark. A fearlessness. You just buried it, like most people do. I’m not really telling you to jump off tall buildings, or swim with whales or anything (although I would secretly love to think you were), but to live boldly. Push yourself. Don’t settle. Wear those stripy legs with pride. And if you insist on settling down with some ridiculous bloke, make sure some of this is squirrelled away somewhere. Knowing you still have possibilities is a luxury. Knowing I might have given them to you has alleviated something for me. So this is it. You are scored on my heart, Clark. You were from the first day you walked in, with your ridiculous clothes and your bad jokes and your complete inability to ever hide a single thing you felt. You changed my life so much more than this money will ever change yours. Don’t think of me too often. I don’t want to think of you getting all maudlin. Just live well. Just live.

Katy Carroll emailed Michael Tecklenburg and Wendell Primus reminding them that Pelosi wore a DIA pin at a rally and promised to help get others on DIA. Asked how ADAPT could be of assistance and when we could expect cosponsorship papers to be filed. michael.tecklenburg@mail.house.gov
On August 30th, 2018, C4CI sent an email to Wendell Primus (Wendell.Primus@mail.house.gov) asking why is not a cosponsor of DIA and whether the representative would commit to being an initial co-sponsor of DIA if elected to the next Congress.
Talked with Member of Congress, Nancy Pelosi, after her press conference at Independence First in Milwaukee, WI. It was rushed. We are not sure how much information she was able to absorb. She mentioned that she was not familiar with the Disability Integration Act. She also mentioned that as the minority leader she is not able to co-sponsor bills. So we asked her to send a ???Dear Colleague??? letter to urge other democrats to sign on. Later we did some research and from what we can see there is nothing that states the minority leader cannot co-sponsor bills. We have sent a follow up email to Wendell.Primus@mail.house.gov (Senior Policy Advisor) and Kelsey.Smith@mail.house.gov (Director of Scheduling and Advance) asking her to co-sponsor and send the ???Dear Colleague??? letter. Kelsey was with Pelosi at Independence First in Milwaukee, WI.
ADAPT members met with staff on May 16th. Follow up with Wendell Primus by emailing Wendell.Primus@mail.house.gov
On August 30th, 2018, C4CI sent an email to Thomas Rice (Thomas.Rice@Mail.House.Gov) asking why is not a cosponsor of DIA and whether the representative would commit to being an initial co-sponsor of DIA if elected to the next Congress.

The Grand Napat is service apartment located at Chang Puek, Chiang Mai ideally in the heart of Chiangmai. The Grand Napat is an up-scaled serviced apartment committed to provide comfortable, convenience, and safety for business executives or leisure travelers wishing to stay in the city of Chiangmai. Our 60 luxuriously furnished studios and suites combine the comforts of home with the facilities and services of a superior hotel, making it an excellent destination either for short or long stay. The Grand Napat is surrounded by a peaceful atmosphere away from the hustle of the city and at the same time within walking distance from the JJ market, the famous shopping center in town.
Breakfast with very few options (and mostly quite salty) and not much vegetable dishes, just one or none during our 5 days stay. (if not counting salad) Coffee taste like instant. Rooms are nice and big with balcony, front counter staffs are friendly and helpful. Location, it is off popular attractions (still within 15 min. drive from old city, about 30 baht per person by Songthaew (red car)), coming back to hotel is fine, easy to grab a red car from most tourist locations. Going out, may have to wait a while for a red car to come pass by. Has some food stands nearby, and 7-11, coin-wash around the corner. Tesco within 10 minutes walk. A good choice if you like spacious rooms with limited budget, and do not mind that you may not grab a red car/tu-tu at the time required. (if your time/schedule is tight, or running short).
Really good value for money serviced appartment and really clean. Great swimming pool. Staff very nice and helpful too. Quiet location but near tuk tuk road.
Room is spacious, location not convinent to go to the old city. Housekeeping needs improvement. There was lots of dust especially at the window and curtains and unfortunately the bed was put just against the wall and dust all fell from the window.
Such a nice Hotel. Super friendly and recommend stuff. little bit outside of Chiang Mai centre, but Taxi or Tuk Tuk to tha pae gate is very cheap (20-40 baht per person) Very big breakfast. Different egs, changing specials (at our stay waffles). Only missing some cheese and honey or nutella would be nice :) Free shuttleservice, roomservice Fitnessroom... it is reallynice! We come again, for sure ! Thank you!
Very clean, safe and modern serviced apartment with exellent breakfast. Good value for money. Allthought the location is little bit far from the city att university area. Good parking space and free transportation to city every night was nice extra.
breakfast spread too little. nothing for vegetarians. although they did make sandwiches for us. its a value for money place, little away from the main town.....
really clean and comfultable hotel, nice breakfast and nice pool, i really want to say here is amazing hotel in Chiang Mai, location is not bad, 10minitus moto to the Thapae Gate.
Large 1 bedroom apartment, very comfortable. We have been to Chiang Mai a number of times before and stayed near the night markets, and in the old town, so was nice to have a change of location. We found it was still very easy to get into the centre either walking (about 30-40 mins) or the red van taxi s that are only 20baht a person (must better than TukTuks that are aimed at tourists and cost an awful lot more) They provide free minibus to and from the airport, and also a once nightly bus to the Nightmarkets. Only complaint we have is the lovely looking pool was too cold the coldest pool we have been in in Thailand so didnt make for a relaxing swim. Also the local JJ markets appeared to not be operating fully, but there were lots of bars and coffee places nearby that were frequented by students and locals which was nice rather than being too touristy. If you explore the local soi s there are plenty of traditional street eating places. The Tesco locus is 5 mins walk away and has a great nightmarket in its carpark with yummy foodstalls and clothes. The Tescos was also excellent for supplies for our 2 year old, and had an indoor playcentre.
The room is very nice and big. The only thing I would like to suggest the hotel is provide more free shuttle service to the city. Because the hotel location far from the city and the hotel only provide 1 trip at 6.30pm to go to the night plaza. And in the hotel area is hard to get the song thiew which only cost you 20 to 30 bath. Hence if you want to go the city center you must use tuk tuk, the cost of is 100 Bath per single trip.
The goal of the procedure is to place medication into the epidural space of the spine. The injection consists of a combination of a local anesthetic (Lidocaine or Marcaine) and an anti-inflammatory medication ( Depomedrol or Celestone)The anti-inflammatory medications works by decreasing inflammation around the nerve root, and usually takes 3-5 days but may require longer to provide relief. The medicine then spreads throughout the epidural space encompassing many other levels of the spine. The entire procedure usually takes less than fifteen minutes.
The most important and greatest success achieved with the use of epidural steroid injections (ESI) is the rapid relief of symptoms that allows patients to experience enough relief to become active again. With this help patients regain the ability to resume their normal daily activities.
There are several techniques to place the medication into the epidural space. The type of pain and the anatomy of the spine will determine how the epidural space can be safely accessed.
• Interlaminar Injection: With this approach the needle enters in the mid-line of your back. The medication is then injected and spreads to both sides of the spine.
• Transforaminal Injection: With this approach the needle is inserted to the side of the spine with the target site of where the nerve root exits the bony portion of the spine (neural foramen). Thsi approach is useful for a discrete nerve root pain or if the midline approach is not feasible for reasons such as teh existence of scar tissue after surgery.
• Caudal Injection: With this approach the needle enters the epidural space by your tailbone. Thsi technique allows a loarger volunes of teh meddication to be delivered.

Several years ago, I was researching natural skincare traditions and came across what people referred to as “Aleppo soap”—an olive oil based castile soap blended with laurel oil, which is abundant in Syria.

I’ve been doing a lot of reading lately on operational excellence and how to achieve it within an organization. I’m a firm believer that safety is not an à la carte component of an organization, but rather a standard component of truly exceptional companies.
In my research, I came across the story of W. Edwards Deming. The story caught my attention because like Deming, I’m a graduate of the University of Wyoming (Go Pokes!).
Deming is a relatively unknown figure in world history, but some believe he’s the reason for Japanese dominance in the automotive industry. Deming believed in using statistical data to quantify the manufacturing process. He studied product quality, efficiency and how well companies were managed. His examination led him to the conclusion that many manufacturing processes were flawed and that only upper management’s active engagement could fix them.
Deming’s ideas were simple but considered revolutionary at the time. He did not think that a company’s workers were to blame for product failures, but rather that management was responsible. If a product was made poorly, it was because the people in charge designed a flawed delivery system.
Deming was particularly critical of the way US corporations instituted quality control methods in the manufacturing process. He felt that inspecting products for defects after they have been manufactured, made no sense. Rather, why not design the manufacturing process to ensure quality products are created, even before the process begins?
This story is illustrated in Simon Sinek’s popular book “Start With Why”. Sinek tells the story of American auto executives taking a tour of a Japanese auto plant’s assembly line. After watching the final sequence of a car being put together, the Americans noticed that there was no inspection of the vehicle doors. When someone asked why no one checked to be sure the doors fit perfectly, the tour guide responded, “We make sure the doors fit during design”.
Similarly, with safety management, if you don’t get the desired outcome (zero incidents), it is likely because of a flaw in the design of the process being used. If failures exist within a process, they can lead to accidents and injuries. A worker may be at fault for setting the failure into motion by violating a rule for instance, but ultimately, the process allowed for the failure.
To create real safety in an organization, to be able to predict incidents before they happen, an organization must first understand how their processes can result in failures. Collectively, we need to stop managing outcomes (injury rates) and learn to focus on the process.

A double-slit optical system was used to test the possible role of consciousness in the collapse of the quantum wavefunction. The ratio of the interference pattern’s double-slit to single-slit spectral power was predicted to decrease when attention was focused towards the double-slit as compared to away. Each test session consisted of 40 counterbalanced attention-towards and attention-away epochs, where each epoch lasted between 15 and 30 seconds. Data contributed by 137 people in six experiments, involving a total of 250 test sessions, indicated that on average the spectral ratio decreased as predicted (z = -4.36, p = 6 x 10-6). Another 250 control sessions conducted without observers present tested hardware, software, and analytical procedures for potential artifacts; none were identified (z = 0.43, p = 0.67).
Variables including temperature, vibration, and signal drift were also tested, and no spurious influences were identified. By contrast, factors associated with consciousness, such as meditation experience, electrocortical markers of focused attention, and psychological factors including openness and absorption significantly correlated in predicted ways with perturbations in the double-slit interference pattern. The results appear to be consistent with a consciousness-related interpretation of the quantum measurement problem.
Really? Of all the people to sell out to, you picked Murdoch, evil overlord of the most hated soul-crushing, fact-mangling corporation?

One cannot complain that Jackson Pollock is an understudied visual artist of mid-twentieth-century American abstraction. Some of the leading art historians working in the modern and contemporary period have scrutinized and contextualized and theorized this artist’s practice, including Michael Fried, Rosalind Krauss, T. J. Clark, and Michael Leja, to name but a few. One might have felt hard pressed to imagine a need for more scholarly attention, especially when not occasioned by the... Full Review
The first illustration included in Tirza True Latimer’s most recent book is the oft-reproduced cover to the exhibition catalogue Cubism and Abstract Art formulated by Alfred H. Barr Jr. Latimer makes the point that the manner in which Barr’s timeline has been taken up since its inception has decontexualized it and forced the diagram into a realm of certainty its supposed simplicity could not sustain.

Phoebe Wolfskill’s Archibald Motley Jr. and Racial Reinvention: The Old Negro in New Negro Art offers a compelling account of the artistic difficulties inherent in the task of creating innovative models of racialized representation within a culture saturated with racist stereotypes. She approaches this topic through the work of one of the New Negro era’s most celebrated yet highly elusive artists, Archibald Motley Jr. As a Creole Catholic whose family moved from New Orleans to...

Since its acquisition by the Freer Gallery of Art in 2009, the tea leaf storage jar known as “Chigusa” (Thousand Grasses) has generated much discussion and scholarship, including two exhibitions (Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, 2014, and Princeton University Art Museum, 2014­­–15), a symposium, two workshops, and two books. The present volume results from the symposium and workshops. While the earlier book, Chigusa and the Art of Tea (2014), also edited by Louise Allison... Full Review
Presented in Paris in 1739, Jacques de Vaucanson’s fabricated duck, one of the most renowned examples of an automaton, could not only flap its wings and move its beak but also eat and excrete. Later discovered to have been pre-stuffed with fake waste, it indulged the Enlightenment desire for engineered imitations that modeled the inner workings of living forms. Voltaire declared that the shitting bird was the only reminder of the glory of France. The history of automata in the early... Full Review

There should be some irony in the fact that in much of the English-speaking world this past year’s run of major art museum exhibitions commemorating the centenary of the 1917 Russian Revolution exceeded that honoring the quincentennial of the 1517 Protestant Reformation. Why the god that failed rather than the one that won? That the revolution tended toward iconogenesis and the reformation toward iconoclasm is not insignificant, neither is the fact, as the Russian exhibitions have been... Full Review
Italy, a relatively recently unified country, is often described as a patchwork of idiosyncratic regions. Even to this day, the food, customs, dialects, architecture, and terrain shift dramatically between neighboring villages, cities, and regions, Italians themselves proclaiming “campanilismo,” a competitive pride in their birthplace. By focusing on one particular region, Linda Safran gains a valuable insight into how one such distinctive identity emerged and developed in the Middle... Full Review

Hello everyone. Thank you very much for attending the Tenchi Kane No Kami Grand Ceremony of our Konko Church of Chicago. I trust that you are all enjoying the best of health and good spirits this wonderful morning. It is a great pleasure to stand before you & see so many friendly faces. My heart is filled with gratitude in welcoming all of you to today's ceremony.
Rev. Takao Kishii, head-minister of KC Toronto came all the way from Toronto to officiate and deliver his sermon for this ceremony. Thank you very much, Kishii Sensei!
I just would like to tell you one thing today. This Kami, Tenchi Kane No Kami eagerly wishes us human beings to practice faith and receive divine blessings. It is truly urgent that this Kami seeks for those who develop true faith. That is because it greatly depends on how deeply we change or renew ourselves to change the world better.
Though it is my interpretation of one of Konko Daijin's teachings, he said, "If people have their belief in, 'On this very day pray with a single heart. Divine blessings are within your peaceful and joyful heart,' Kami's glory will appear and the world peace will be attained." Therefore the most serious matter in life is to deepen peace and joy in our heart through everything that happens in our daily life.
All of us just listened to the brilliant sermon of Kishii Sensei. Let us put any part of his sermon into practice and deepen our heart everyday to change ourselves and the world. Let us deepen our peaceful and joyful hearts together to serve Kami and people in the world.
For over 70 years shark nets in NSW and QLD, Australia have been catching sharks, dolphins, whales, rays, turtles, dugongs and fish and as a result many die. This happens 24 hours a day while the nets are in operation – this is the largest fishing effort ever made on any species.
We encourage you to sign the petition, below, to indicate your support for the removal of shark nets throughout KwaZulu-Natal. By signing this petition you are agreeing that the practice of shark culling through the use of shark nets is archaic and a new approach that eliminates wildlife casualties must be implemented.

Well I am here in Seoul. Hopefully you will have seen the photos I have posted. If you haven't, you can check them out on Flickr or Facebook. The trip up itself was great. The flight to Shanghai on Air New Zealand was amazing. I could certainly do Business Class again. Shanghai airport was quite mind blowing. So huge, and interesting. We were unsure how the whole transit thing would go, but it was great. The transit concept, caused a bit of frowning, a call for "the man with the stamp" a stamp, then me being taken to a booth where a woman looked at my passport again, tapped some keys, and I was good to go. Interestingly, Chris, my travelling companion did not have the booth bit. Anyway, once we were past that, our bags were easy find and then it was through customs, which was a simple wave through and we were in China proper.
The whole transit was easy, we simply walked between the two terminals and got our boarding passes and we were good to go. A magnificent bit of cultural experience, when the staff all arrived at the Korean Air counters. They got themselves sorted, some music played and they all stood to attention. A recorded message played, of which the last bit was in English and announced the counters were open.... Fabulous!!! You don't get that at Air New Zealand.
Korean Air is lovely, The Premier class has great seats, lovely food and exceptional service. And of course, the most elegant and beautiful women working on the plane. The plane was very good too. I sat beside the most interesting guy called Ed. Ed is from Columbus, Ohio. He is an architect and has spent the last 15 years doing work in China helping with major projects. They are currently working on a University in Western China, which will be built in 5 years and take 20,000 students. It was one of those weird situations where we had a ridiculous amount in common and could happily chat for 1 1/2 hours having only just met.
By the time we got to the hotel in Seoul it was around 4.00pm and so there was not much time before the dinner at 6.00pm. So, I just showered and then went for a walk in the local neighbourhood. The Grand Hyatt Seoul is on the side of a hill and there is a fantastic little street which runs down from it. I wandered right down to the end and back up again just taking in the sights and smells. Some of the smells were less pleasant than others, but the whole experience really is just amazing. Tiny shops, crammed to the gunnels with stock. A locksmith sitting in his shop, which was only just large enough to fit him inside. No lighting, just sitting there smoking away. This is interspersed with two embassies, an art gallery built into a old two car garage, and various restaurants.
Dinner last night with the INELI crew was great. We had a lot of fun just catching up and generally not quite believing we were in Seoul, South Korea. The food was very Korean and challenging for some, including myself at times. I have now eaten Abalone for the first time. It actually was not too bad, pretty much with not much taste of its own and kind of like a mushroom. Also, the various pickles were not all to my taste. However, the Beef Soup was to die for, and the fish was pretty damn nice too.
After dinner a few of us chatting for a while and learnt one lesson. The currency is odd here and you end up paying thousands for stuff. However, when you convert it back it is not that bad usually. I say usually, because last night I paid $34 NZ for a shot glass of Glenmorangie 18yr..... $34!!!!!!! Needless to say, I won't be drinking at the hotel again...
So after one day in Seoul, I can say I like the place a lot. It's my first time in Asia and while admittedly Seoul is a pretty affluent part of Asia, it still has the essential flavour I was expecting. The city itself is neat, and very beautiful and everything seems quite efficient! I can see I am going to enjoy my week.

The housecleaning diet was imposed after Christmas and maybe some improvement was occurring, but oh that sour dough and homemade bagels from the Farmers Market, the mug of hot cocoa on a snowy day, maybe with a dash of Chambord, the local cheese and pizza, pasta… It was difficult and sliding occurred, joints complained along with an increase of another symptom.
As the joints hurt, my mind wanders to my baby brother, 6 1/2 years my junior. As a kid, he used to run into a room, launch into the air and skid across the carpet or floor on his knees. Bet they pain him now. Then as an adult, he had a slip on ice that resulted in neck surgery. As we age, the old injuries, separated shoulder skiing, broken wrist roller blading with daughter return to haunt now with discomfort and stiffness.
The gluten must go. The dairy is easier with alternative milk products for coffee (the current favorite is unsweetened Toasted Coconut/Almond milk), but oh the cheese, sob. Hot cocoa can be made Mexican style with water, but it still has the sugar, not as much as commercial or even homemeade mixes, if you use real Mexican chocolate disks and grate them yourself, but still probably too much. I have eliminated other sugar such as jam, honey, and sweets once the Christmas chocolate was gone.
Perhaps the elimination process would be easier if only a category is eliminated at a time. Peanuts were easy, just use Almond butter, eat whole almonds instead. Peanuts are a huge trigger. Wheat is next, a real tough one, but something must be done and it seems to be a major trigger as well. Ibuprofen daily isn’t the solution. Some of the damage is done and can’t be undone, but perhaps further damage can be slowed and some of the discomfort reduced. Mountaingdad will never go for this type of cure, so I go it alone. Lunch out is going to be a bear.
The snow is gone. Now we wait for this weekend and the next round of winter liquid or solid as the case may be.
You are spot-on when you say aging is not for sissies, Fran. I’ve had horrible upper shoulder/back pain for days now that even a deep muscle massage only temporarily relieved. Going to try a chiropractor next. Don’t want to go to a doctor unless absolutely necessary.
You too Martha. Hubby is dealing with back pain, leg and foot numbness and has been since November. PT, orthopedic visits, injections, no help. He is going to a chiropractor next.

Heathrow travellers, now is your chance to be part of the story: bestselling author and journalist Tony Parsons has been appointed by London’s premier airport as its writer-in-residence, with a brief to write a book capturing the many stories and emotions of the airport’s transient population. From Wednesday 3rd August and for one week, the acclaimed author –best known for his Book of the Year novel Man and Boy- will live amongst passengers, who will provide the inspiration for his new book’s characters.
Departures: Seven Stories from Heathrow will be Parsons’ thirteenth book and his first collection of short stories. He hopes to resurrect the genre of airport fiction made famous by Airport, the 1968 bestselling novel written by Arthur Hailey.
During his residency, the author will roam the terminals to unearth the stories of the people that pass through its doors, with the events inspiring the plotline and the passengers its characters. The book will then go on sale through HarperCollins from October 2011.
The Heathrow writer-in-residence initiative was first launched in 2009 after the airport appointed philosopher and author Alain de Botton to tell the behind-the-scenes story of a week at Heathrow.
Parts of the book, titled A Week at the Airport: A Heathrow Diary, were written from a desk in Terminal 5 where passengers were invited to share their stories.

New Contracts disclosed yesterday as Signed by Dewey Police and Town Manager Unveiled Sept 13, 2018, the Day Before Town Council Meeting Indicate Continued Dewey Participation in Military Surplus Program without Town Council review
As an independent accountability group we wish to bring to the attention a serious matter done by various political people in town without regards to the best interests of Dewey Beach residents, and conflicting with promises of transparency made by the Mayor and a one other members of Town Council.
Without prior notice or public input, documents appeared on The Town of Dewey Beach website which show signatures of the Police Chief and The Town Manager (but no others) documents dated August 30, 2018. The documents appeared Thursday afternoon Sept 13, (linked here) less than 36 hours in advance of the town council meeting of September 14.
Fact #1: There was total secrecy, without formal public input or disclosure prior to, during signature, or even two weeks after the new documents were signed on August 30, 2018. Withholding them until the day before the town meeting (and today being the day before the election), indicates a unacceptable level of non-disclosure and non-transparency. The Documents linked above were clearly NOT approved by the Town Commissioners, or even known to some of them. It is a serious matter that some Town officials signed these documents without Town Council or any public input. Since they would not send the links to you,we did, here.
Fact #2: The Dewey Town Commissioners still have not given formal authorization for Dewey to participate in the 1033 Military Surplus program. Since the Applebaum Letter HERE is known by the Mayor and the town Attorney to be false, based on Applebaum’s letter to them and other reasons, then there still needs to be approval for Dewey’s participation in the program.
Fact #3: the TGM “performance review” was inadequate in that it excluded all but 13 items out of the 2633 items received by the DBPD. We have proven that HERE, and further we have documented the values place on the equipment were wrong, based on actual sales of actual the equipment sold, the value of the equipment is more than double the amount the 20% across the Board value in fact it was 59.59%. To move forth now where 99% of the items listed by the Federal Govt as being received by the DBPD, is highly premature and indicates impropriety.
Fact #4: If there is need for equipment over $5,000 from the LESO program. The commissioners should have to approve it based on town Policy as defined in its recent review of procedures.
Fact #5: If there was fraud involved in obtaining the property and if the Federal or State 1033 program administrators demand Dewey return the funds, it will put the town in a serious situation.
What can you do? Reply to us at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. and we will snd factual updates, without political support messages, or commercials, no requests for funding, no political claims, just facts and links to actual documents to help us all make Dewey property values increase due to quality of life reflecting integrity.
P.S. Meanwhile here is an article that appeared in the Cape Gazette todayindicating how the issue is not settled yet, so the effort to bully citizens with this military surplus program to stop debate and block public access to the information, is not a healthy for Dewey’s future. Disclosure is the only means in a free society for citizens to made knowledge-based decisions, and in Dewey too!
DCA is an independent group of residents, which does not endorse or support any political figure for office, nor are any of its leaders candidates for any elective office, and serve in an unpaid, unreimbursed non official role for the organization. Recently 130 residents signed the Petition to Town Council urging full disclosure of the money and vehicles. We also have published a study on the recent TGM “review” of the Military Surplus program.
These days in all parts of the world, the act of terror can happen at any time and place. An terrorist act is one directed at people, has deadly consequences, and creates horror within the society. A terrorist’s deadliest tools are guns and explosives, bombs or materials killing massive numbers of people in crowded places such as airports, party places, sports games, subways or other crowded places. Its impact is expanding and being maximized towards a climactic moment. It is more severe in cases of a suicide bombings and shootings because of the large fatalities involved.
Terrorism aims to kill innocent people randomly and give an indirect warning message to their target parties so their existence can be recognized.
This is different from the previous cases, which was pointed directly to the political facilities such as embassy buildings or military base.
Acts of terror are also performed by a small group or individual followers to a certain organization like a guerrilla unit. So it is more difficult for police or military to focus on a visible target to prevent terrorist attacks.
The police SWAT team or military team need a lightweight portable X-ray detection device to be able to easily carry for moving target in outdoor spots or outside of a regular conveyeor scanner system, and in a limited space like a patrol car where a big X ray scanner is not able to be fit in.
The airport check-in area or waiting room before a conveyor scanner system is still the hottest spot that terror could happen due to it being crowded. If the police SWAT team or security team walking patrol and find a person with a suspicious bag or an attended package, they do not want to open it but should check what it is inside.
There are many other security companies providing of VIP protection service, facility security & inspection for a government or private individual. The security service is not only limited to detecting an explosive material but also to find bugs hidden inside wall switches or squeezed inside tables. They do not want to touch or destroy it in order to inspect it.
Government facilities are still the most vulnerable target for terror attacks because of their large impact. If one day the staff receives a small, heavy, suspicious-looking box, they will not want to open it.
Many military bases are set up in dispatched local territories or in country borders. There is a lot of traffic passing thru the gate in the military compound or cross the border. Usually an MP is standing out at a check-point. A disguised private supplier is carrying in a suspicious bag or looks bigger around a shirt. An MP should look inside the bag without opening it or search the body without touching him.
For all those situations, iRay A6 was designed for all-in-one, combined with X ray, detector and image display on the machine. iRay A6 has also strong features for mobile site, lightweight (3.6kg only for machine) packing, fast installation, battery power, easy carrying handheld type so that the security teams can get into inspection site easily and make an intelligent decision instantly. iRay A6 has been tested in the most difficult, dangerous and complex military conditions for providing the most suitable information to the customers.

This gorgeous new necklace from Debra Schwartz was created as a sample for John Bead. Debra was kind enough to share her supply list. We do not have a step by step but at least you can see all the items Debra used in her piece.
Last year, our company launched “The Search for The Next Great Bead.” We wanted to manufacture a product that was designed by someone who loved beads.
Her sizing was much bigger than a regular seed bead and to show us how her bead would work she submitted “larger than life” foam core versions so we could actually play with them like a puzzle.
She also submitted some truly wonderful sketches showing the bead in use. As you can see, her design idea has been realized.
We believe that new beaders will enjoy working with this bead because they will be able to complete a project quickly. Skilled beaders will find new ways to incorporate this bead with smaller beads for fantastic new patterns.

When you admire a designer that has passed away you can’t help but wonder about their life and art. I would have loved and been honoured to meet Kazuko Oshima. Would she have taught classes? Would she still work at Barney’s? Would she have embraced Instagram? Did she have plans to write a book? These are questions I will never get answered because she died in 2007, before the social media boom, which would have probably given us all access to her creativity and life.
Beloved designer Kazuko Oshima was not the first person to wrap stones and crystals but she was legendary for the simple style she created. She had a worldwide audience at Barney’s New York where she could be found designing pieces on the spot calibrated to the needs of the client. Owning a piece of her hand-wrapped jewelry was special because she was exclusive to one store and did not have her designs manufactured.
In Ms. Oshima’s most characteristic designs, crystals and semiprecious stones are wrapped in webs of gold wire and seem to float above the body as they encircle a wrist or neck. Ms. Oshima believed passionately that the materials that she worked with possessed great healing powers, something she often discussed in interviews. – Margalit Fox October. 4, 2007
I was very lucky to receive a piece of her jewelry and it is a prized possession. From the moment I received it, I was mesmerized. Afraid to lose it, I open and close the box it came in often, making sure it is still safe. Kazuko enclosed a handwritten description of the stones she used to make my pendant. Even that tiny card feels magical.
Kazuko holds court at Barneys, dressed, usually, in all white. She’s the unofficial soul of the Barneys staff, each of whom has a piece of Kazuko calibrated to his or her karmic needs.

Working at John Bead Corp has given me the opportunity to explore the attributes of many gemstones and incorporating them into jewelry is a joy. It felt like the right time to put a spotlight on a designer who inspired me. I also wanted to credit her for the this style of wrapping. It makes her jewelry stand out for its simplicity.
I have written a step-by-step so you can create a simple wire-wrapped pendant. I have also demonstrated this technique dozens of times in the last two months and have learned that this simple and effective wire wrap makes people happy.
This is the beautiful Kazuko. If you create anything with this step-by-step, please remember to call your projects “Kazuko Inspired” so you can help me to honour her memory.
Cut about 12 -14 inches of wire and add your stone leaving about three inches of a tail. Wrap the longer wire around the stone and back towards the tail.
Position the long wire up the opposite side of the first wire and tuck the longer wire under the first like the picture shows.
Then run some wire up another side of the stone and create a loop at the top of the bead around the tail.
You can create loops and add a crystal at the bottom of the wrapped stone at this point. Then, you will need to get the longer wire back to the top of the bead.
Add a chain and write a short note explaining why you selected this particular stone and you have a wonderful and meaningful gift!

In addition to detailed treatments of the quantum mechanical “essentials”, for instance, scattering theory, time dependent phenomena, and the density matrix, such topics as the theory of quantum mechanical measurement and the Bell inequality are also discussed. A separate chapter is devoted to super-symmetric quantum mechanics, an area which to date has been accessible only in the research literature.
Since I left the cubicle life, i have been meeting a lot of brilliant and smart people online and offline. hearing about their ideas and plans to take over the world with their products and things they are building and planning to build. one of the best things it taught me was never to judge any one by how they look or by what they say or by what they wear or any other criteria. I know it’s very easy to say that but very difficult to practice. When you start practicing something for a long duration it becomes a habit.
It helps to get the best things from every person without any preconceived notions about them and thus helps a lot when you talk to them since what we think about a person dictates how we behave around them.

(Philadelphia, PA) — Malelani Cafe Mt. Airy, the hottest and most energetic cafe in the Mt. Airy section of Philadelphia, will be presenting Unarmed Black Male, a solo exhibition featuring the Stuckism/Pop-Art work of Larry West. The exhibition will run May 3 – June 6, with an opening reception on Sunday, May 3 from 2pm to 4:30pm. The opening and exhibition are free and open to the public.
With the recent wave of news about unarmed black males, Larry West, a local illustrator and designer, had this to say about the show:
“As a fellow unarmed black male, I wanted to show the world that we don’t have to just be statistics. We can be amazing artists, designers, and productive members of society. Granted, the current news doesn’t show that, so I figured it was about time to show the other side. Do Black Lives Matter only when the person is dead, or are we going to support them when they’re alive?”
Larry West’s style has focused on skewing contemporary society, and Unarmed Black Male is the latest example of this. The show features over 20 pieces that range from his take on recent protests, religious movements, to pop-culture. His clients have included Megadeth, the Ron Paul Presidential Election Campaign, Wednesday 13, Dancing Ferret Converts, and the Admiral Theater. Always controversial and never safe, Larry’s sought-after and award-winning work has been featured in Rolling Stone and the book The Art Of Metal.
Malelani Cafe in Mt. Airy is located at 6734 Germantown Ave in Philadelphia, PA and can be reached at 267-766-2396. Larry West is a Philadelphia artist who was born and raised in the Mt. Airy section and has never left.

In 1 Corinthians 4:1-3 Paul declares that Christians are to be good stewards of the "mysteries of God." Note the plural use of the word. As we examine the word of God we find that there are several "mysteries" mentioned in the New Testament. We have categorized these into the seven as listed below. A mystery as revealed in the New Testament was a truth veiled in the Old Testament. As we look at these mysteries we will find that the Apostle Paul was chosen to reveal six of them to the Church. The other one is revealed by John in the Revelation.
A steward is an overseer, a keeper, a dispenser, and a minister of something entrusted to that person. It might be something material like a ranch, or it may be something spiritual like a truth. Note that we are to be "faithful" stewards.
1 Timothy 3:16 - "...God manifest in the flesh" This may be the most difficult to comprehend. This is the mystery of the "Incarnate Word." John 1:1-3, Hebrews 1:8, John 8:58
Ephesians 3:4-8 This is the truth that God was going to come down and dwell in the Gentiles. The Jew had a very difficult time with this. Colossians 1:26-27
Ephesians 5:32 - "...Christ and the church." The relationship and truth of the "church." Colossians 1:18
Romans 11:25 - "...blindness in part has happened to Israel." Since Israel rejected Jesus the Gospel has gone out unto the whole world. Romans 3:2
2 Thessalonians 2:7 - "...the mystery of iniquity..." There will be a man of sin which we call the "Anti-Christ." He will be a counterfeiter, a fake Christ, a false Messiah.
Revelation 17:5, 18 - "...MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT..." This is the unveiling of the one who would become the harlot church. A great religious whore.
I had to make a delivery to a customer today located across from Piedmont Park in Atlanta. (By the way, if you need a new bike or some skates drop by Skate Escape, and they’ll help you out.)
I always try to schedule trips like this around lunch, so being a good planner I turned left onto Piedmont and traveled a few miles until I came to Fat Matt’s Rib Shack.
I had a half rack with a side of beans. I only ordered the beans because I felt guilty just ordering a plate of meat. Fat Matt’s is a great place because it is consistent. They don’t confuse you with a complicated menu, make you feel inadequate for not having a perfectly groomed beard, or waste your time forcing you to choose from 8 different BBQ sauces. Their ribs are always good, the sauce is good enough, and the two slices of white bread is never stale. The food is consistently good, and I’m always consistently satisfied. I hope they never change.
There’s something to be said about consistency whether it be in the menu or the quality. Fat Matt’s is an Atlanta icon and treasure. Consistency rules the BBQ landscape.

In ADF, you can easily add method validators on Entity level. However, sometimes this is not enough. If your validation logic is complex (for instance: if you need all other rows to validate against, for some kind of special uniqueness constraint), this is not enough.
You can throw a general exception from the setter of your attribute in the view object, but that is not enough, because this will look different (no 'red' field, and a different style of exception on the screen).
Here is yet another angular boilerplate opinionated in how I work with Angular. I made it for myself but if you find that my opinions are good for you, feel free to use it and collaborate with issues or pull requests.
js: There is where you put your javascript code. It comes with a app.js file with the main app module created.
We split our application per features, so if we have an application to manage users, we can decide that a page to manage those users is a feature and also the settings page is another feature. Also we need some authentication services and stuff like that. That is not a feature of our app, but something common to the entire app. How can we organize that?
Looking at the image, we can see that apps folder where we put all our features. We create a subdirectory with the feature name and then inside a javascript file to code that feature and also a .tpl.html file for its template. the .tpl.html is my convention, you can change that in the gulpfile.js.
For common stuff, we created a common folder where we can put all our services and directives. Notice how I put the foo directive template inside the same folder.
The workflow won’t force you to use this structure, the only forced convention here is to put your templates under /js and not under /templates or something like that. Also the extension being *.tpl.html is needed (again, easy to change in the gulpfile.js). Leaving that aside, you’re free to code your app in the way you like.
The only convention here is to name your tests like: *_spec.js. Leaving that aside, you can structure it the way you like.
As a test runner we are using test'em, jasmine 2 as the framework of choice and Chrome to run the tests. You can change jasmine and Chrome in testem.json.
Our angular app will run on the port 5000 and by default all the requests to the backend are going to use a proxy to the port 8080. How does that work?
Imagine you have a Rails backend (the workflow is backend agnostic) running on port 8080 and it serves some users information at /api/users. Since the Rails app runs on port 8080 and our Angular app runs on the port 5000 we would need to do something like:
Without any need of CORS. Thanks to our proxy, our Angular app will think that the backend is running in the same domain and port so if we deploy both application together (like putting our angular app into Rails' /public directory) we don’t need to change anything in our code.
There you change our app port and also the port where our backend is running. Also notice that the requests that goes through the proxy are the ones that starts with /api.
That will generate a tmp folder with all our javascript files concatenated in one central place. That free us of having to create a <script> tag for every javascript we create. Also, our templates are going to be cached in $templateCache and also appended to the main app.js file.
Also that will compile our scss, move our images and index.html, run the webserver and watch for file changes.
For now, all the vendors you need are pulled manually to /vendor. I am not a big fan of bower but I will consider it if there is any request.

A camisole is the thin t-shirt that various ladies utilize, either on their own when in an incredibly laid-back setup, or under garments in far more formal configurations (like the office). Camisole tops are so noticeable since they're incredibly comfy. They do not comply with your skin, they make it possible for enough air activity, in addition to they're just so fashionable. For several females, a camisole bra is a far phenomenal as well as much more comfy choice compared with a regular bra. Camisoles could additionally serve a role in the room, both as typical nightwear and also as a compliment to an attractive garments. Learn everything that you have to understand about the useful camisole top in this brief message.
Camisole tops are so comfy since they're slim in addition to because of that they're made from just the most effective, most comfy product. Probably one of one of the most popular sort of camisole, the silk camisole, finest represents this. Yet, if silk isn't actually your chosen, you might situate a great deal of various other kinds offered. For instance, a cotton camisole or a satin camisole can be equally as comfy as a silk one. There are in addition shoelace variations available also. Although, a lace camisole is commonly not exceptionally functional and suggested totally for the space.
Although they project in daily life, in this post we're mosting likely to be focusing far more on the appealing aspects of the garment. A lot more especially, let's concentrate on just how you can use the garment when in the space.
One of the terrific features of the garment is that it does not need to be paired with anything to have a basic sexiness concerning it. An easy black camisole is typically sufficient to drive some males mad with lust if they have really never ever before seen it in the past. As well as for those that it does not drive mad, they could still value the simple sexiness of the outfit and also it here ensures in order to help boost up things a little bit in the bed room.
If you prefer an included layer of sexiness along with comfort, why not attempt a various version like a camisole attire? This looks like a regular cami, yet rather than simply being a top, it reduces to just over the knees. It remains in reality a terrific nighttime garment normally because of the fact that it's so comfy. That it occurs to be very hot on top of it, is truly just a perk.
Naturally, if you actually want to turn the sexiness roughly 11, after that you're mosting likely to mean to pair your cami with a few other garments points. A shoe lace camisole or a black camisole looks definitely fantastic when combined with a matching set of panties as well as some working with stockings. You can be also wilder in addition to go with a distinct cami, you might find ones with leopard prints on them or that have distinct patterns on them. The individuality of these formats is exactly what makes them so sexy when compared to a regular camisole top.

(Kochi, Nov 21, 2017, DG): The Kerala High Court on Tuesday relaxed the bail conditions of actor Dileep and allowed him to travel abroad.
Dileep has sought a relaxation of his bail conditions to visit Dubai. The court has granted 4 days for the actor to go abroad.

(Thiruvananthapuram, Nov 18, 2017): In a significant push to expand IT incubation space and encourage startup ventures, the Kerala government has approved support for private entities and tie-ups with national and global agencies for setting up incubators and accelerators in the state.
The Pinarayi Vijayan-led government has also decided to revise norms in the state IT policy to align with the national Startup India campaign, providing greater incentives to startups in Kerala.
State IT Secretary M Sivasankar issued orders in this regard this week following a proposal from the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) on schemes to develop an additional 500,000 sq ft of incubation space outside of the existing incubators in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode.
KSUM recommended the participation of private sector to help realise the goal of the 2014 Kerala Technology Startup Policy of creating one million sq ft of IT incubation space, a statement said here.
It will be a major step towards achieving the target outlined in the IT policy 2017 of creating 10 million sq ft of office space to provide direct and indirect employment to 2.5 lakh people, it said.
"We have set ambitious goals for our IT sector and this is an important step in realising them.. Private sector participation will strengthen both our startup infrastructure and ecosystem.. the government is willing to incentivise such partnerships," Sivasankar said.
As per the order, the state government will support private entities with proven experience in startup mentoring to set up incubators or accelerators in the state, with capital, operational and promotional assistance, as per norms.
It may also tie-up with national and international agencies for mentoring and incubation support, it said.
"We have been assigned to extend support to the agencies in accordance with the IT policy," said KSUM CEO Saji Gopinath.
The incubators would receive operational and internet support for a period of five years, and all incubatees would be eligible for our promotional schemes such as startup boxes, grants, seed funds, cloud credits and so on, he said.

We code everyday. We produce code fast, following the rhythm of the rock and roll guitar playing in the background and every time we focus on writing code fast, we miss some important things that makes us lose time in the future.
The next time you create a new file in your Python project, think about its name very carefully. Every Python file is a module. We import modules all the time. If I create a file named after an already existent module — and worst, already imported module, I am going to spend at least ten minutes trying to figure out what the heck is wrong with my code. Just because I chose a bad file name. Some of them are obvious and we should definitely avoid.
This is also a problem when you import everything from a module. You don’t know what you are importing. Maybe the module you are importing has the same function as one you already defined. You have to dig into the module’s code to find out.
PS: Stuff like this happens in real life, it happened once to colleagues of mine at work and it happened with me today. With that same example I shared in this post. Because I was sleepy and numpy.py seemed like a good filename to play with numpy. The only reason why I was able to find out what was happening fast was because I had seen it happening before.
My, the week's gone? It was interesting... but I forget why. One of the biggest things for me personally this week was of course the highest-traffic blog review of my first book thus far. Meanwhile, I know a lot of people are making their way through the Proverbs book, but it's definitely a slower read. So I'm waiting to see more full reviews in addition to Freddie's.
Oh, on that topic: I just learned that Kress extended the 50% sale on the Proverbs book through October. So perhaps you want to take advantage of the 2-for-1 (as Rachael Starke put it) for Christmas?

As to Cain, surely you've heard about his "9-9-9" plan by now. I like two things about it: (1) Paul Ryan loves it , and (2) the Washington Post hates it.
On the subject of Frank Turk — well, we're on that subject now — remember he's got swag that offers graphic comment on the Elephant Room kerfuffle. Plus he's got his own site called The New Calvinist Gadfly where he and some friends — some other friends — doctrinally rock out.
Just sad. For us aware of its history, the name Fuller Theological Seminary is a name of tragic shame. Once a star of evangelical academic respectability, its jettisoning of Biblical inerrancy for the chimera of respectability signaled an inevitable doctrinal slide which continues apace today. Harold Lindsell warned, was mocked and derided, was absolutely right.
Now we have Richard J. Mouw, who is current President of Fuller Theological Seminary, telling each and everyone that Christian Science is a cult, Jehovah's Witnesses is a cult — but Mormonism is not a cult. Read the tortured pretzel logic he forces to serve his perfidy. (Thx Joel griffith)
Now turning from Fooler Seminary's Voices of Bedlam to Kevin DeYoung, that brother provides a good summary of Mormonism's aberrant doctrines, titled Mormonism 101.
I have major concerns with Cain's 9-9-9 plan, Dan. Maybe you or one of your more smarter readers can banish my worries. Here they are:
3) That means most revenue must by raised by Federal sales tax of 9%. Sales tax is a terribly disproportionate tax on those of lower incomes. That is, $9 more per $100 spent is a larger percentage chunk of their income. And this, it appears, is where most of the revenue generated by this plan would have to come from.
Even if I could stomach that, which I cannot, there is the problem that I do not see how this would generate enough tax revenue to fund the military, much less the entire government.
OK, as an educator (former) I had a problem with the states test initially, although upon taking it twice I realized something critical.
My objection is that the test is non-specific to the material being tested. What I mean is that getting a correct answer requires more than knowing the locations of the states on the map - there is an element of sheer luck involved. The order in which the states come up is randomized - meaning that you could get Kansas first. Now even if you know where Kansas is, the likelihood of your placing it directly in its proper location with no other states around it is pretty low. If you start with a coastal state, it's much easier - you simply look for the coastline that matches. In other words, the test allows cheating ("I don't have any idea where Maryland is and couldn't find it on an unlabeled map, but this shape fits here.") while penalizing bad luck ("Yeah, I could find Nebraska on a map in two seconds, but do I put it here or move it half a centimeter to the left?").
HOWEVER, the second time I took the test I realized something: the results include both the average distance of your mistakes (in miles) and your time - which mitigates both problems. For instance, the second time I took the test I scored 48 out of 50, or 96%. However, my average error was 13 miles. If I were grading that, I would give the student a 100%; he obviously knows where the states are. An average error of 100 miles would tell another story. Further, if a maximum time were put on the test (this would take some investigating to find out what is fair at various levels), and if there were penalties for overtime, students who are just trying to fit together a meaningless jigsaw puzzle according to shape would be penalized.
I'm not sure I follow you. Each $100 spent by someone earning less income is certainly a higher percentage of their income than each $100 spent by someone earning more income.
However, someone earning more income is spending more $100's than the person earning less income unless the higher earner is doing something which the average American does little of, namely save money. Thus, they are paying more increments of $9.
It could be the best thing to happen to poor people in years. There would be an incentive for them to make wise choices when grocery shopping. (And yes, I'm assuming most of them do not currently do that. I've seen them shop.)
The poor should be paying taxes and a fixed percentage is the fairest way to do that. Everyone is treated the same. If someone makes/spends more, they are taxed more. At the same rate!
As for funding the entire government, hopefully the government will be significantly shrinking and only engaging in those things authorized by the Constitution.
My problem with Cain, and all of the other candidates, is that they support keeping the United States as a country. I would prefer it be abolished but I suppose that's another topic.
For you keeping score at home: if that were a Tweet, the hash-tag would be #HandOnTheDoorknobRemarks
The 16th (?) Amendment would have to be repealed and the new tax rates would have to be part of a new amendment.
The amendment should stipulate that any politician trying to raise those rates outside of the amendment process would be guilty of a capital offense and summarily executed.
90%. Some of those stupid states in the middle of nowhere got me because the margin of error was so small. But still, I feel good, given my "foreign devil" status.

Oh, Tom, you know Canadians need to make the most of it when they find something to crow about. Have mercy, for pity's sake.
I got 73% but being from the heartland I have no idea how those teeny-tiny states on the east coast align. I wonder sometimes why they don't just consolidate them and make some nice big "normal"-sized states.
First try: 94%, average error, 12 miles. So I'd get an "A" from Mr. Chantry? Probably helps that we recently drove through eleven of the states ;D It's all those pesky little states back east that give me trouble.
Oh, the boys are going to LOVE the Lego Explorer and the new guns, especially with deer season opening tomorrow, to much excitement.
The grammar of the "Slow Children At Play" signs has always bothered me, but the juxtaposition with the hunting sign... too funny!
This federal sales tax will not only cover 'luxury' items, but basic necessities. Lower-income folks have to eat the same amount as upper-income folks. Therefore, the sales tax unjustly taxes them a higher percentage in these areas. Unless Cain makes allowances for necessities, I would never advocate for his tax system. Period. I may not anyway, but that is certainly a deal breaker.
I wonder sometimes why they don't just consolidate them and make some nice big "normal"-sized states.
No such plans, but there has long been a theory that the West Shore of Maryland, along with the tiny chip of Virginia that lies north of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge should be cut off their respective states and added to Delaware, which could then be renamed "Delmarva." Not saying its going to happen or anything.
That's a long way to go back, Tom. Can you find the tape? Do you still have a VCR that can play the tape?
92% with an 8 mile error. Graduate of public schooling which taught me nothing about geography. There's only so much you can blame on something that did or didn't happen 30 years ago.
Sure, as a percentage of total income, the amount a lower income individual spends on "necessities" such as food will be higher than for someone with a higher income.
The thing is, people with higher incomes buy a lot more than "necessities" so the average tax rate for both groups will be approximately the same.

If you want all Americans treated the same, how can you be for a tax system that charges the poor more for milk than it does the wealthy? You said that this system does precisely that, and the only way for that tax gap to be made up is for the wealthy to buy luxury items. That is not an equitable system, brother.
I do not mind a flat tax on income or on corporations. I think those are good idea. I just think a tax system that depends largely on sales tax is a terrible system. Raise the percent on the income tax and corporate tax if you have to, but let's not have a federal sales tax.
I followed you on the Delmarva comment. But then they probably have never been in a Wawa either. Some East Coast things should just stay here.
As for sales taxes, nearly everyone in the U.S. pays more, as a percentage of income, for milk than does Bill Gates. Do we use his salary for comparisons? What is low income? The low income earners in America are not that bad off. Most of them have cable, microwaves, cars, etc...
Stan said, "My problem with Cain, and all of the other candidates, is that they support keeping the United States as a country. I would prefer it be abolished but I suppose that's another topic."
Romney/Cain? Really? I support Cain, but I will NEVER vote for Romney, even if Cain is his running mate (I hope he refuses if its offered). Romney is just Obama-lite and would be the worst thing we could do to this country aside from re-electing Obama.

Our mastery of English is pathetic, let alone our knowledge of other languages. I'm determined that my son will know more than 1, even if I have to teach it with a California-born valley-girl accent.
i lived in a country with only 6 states and 2 territories, and I already know I'll never be as smart as Tom Chantry, so I'm not even trying it. :)
My problem with the NotBama approach to voting is the NotBush approach is partly what got us Obama in the first place.
But it's not a big enough problem for me not to vote that way. Given that it's likely the only way I can. I haven't voted for a single candidate ever, at least one who's won.
96%, 4-mile error, and public schooled in Canada, baby! (In a high school where we called our ex-hippy teachers by their first names, no less!) Whoo-hoo! (Dances a victory lap around the room.)
All this adds up to not classifying Mormons on as truly Christian, but being sure they are genuine followers of Christ. Whatever that means.
Apparently I was mistaken about what is the standard of orthodoxy. Here I was thinking it was sound doctrine, when apparently it is going to Ivy league schools and founding your own school. It's a good thing none of those other Ivy League PhDs out there have taken advantage of their status to redefine orthodoxy.
Well, for liberals and the people that were voting their pockets, yeah, they thought anyone would be better than another Republican. That's always a wrong move to make when that a person is a liberal.
With another four years of Obama, unless he converts, we get another 4 years of liberal judges appointed to the courts (and that will leave a far worse impact than just another 4 years in office) and probably another 4 years of terrible legislation.
Let's pick the worse possible scenario of the dream candidate of "Not-Barack-Obama.", Romney. I hope it's not him, but it's looking more like him. Like Dan has said before, something to the effect of, a 1% chance of having maybe more conservative jurists on the federal courts and not having damaging legislation is better than a 0% chance which is what we get when we get Obama.
It's frustrating, but I'm only one vote and Obama has already appointed two Supreme Court Justices, and we are one justice away from Obamacare being ruled constitutional, one vote away the 2nd amendment being done away with, and some other times.
The No Obama situation is not a good situation, but 1% chance of something better is better than 0% of something is better. I think that's how some of us are looking at this.
I know people who, as a matter of conscience, wouldn't vote for McCain because of Doug Phillips' arguments against Sarah Palin being on the ticket. While I think some of his arguments were valid, the effect was that by not voting, their non-vote was a vote for Obama, an avowed pro-death Leftist.
Which vote did more harm to the country? Do these "conscientious objectors" have any responsibility for the president we got and the policies he is shackling our country with or do they get a pass because they stayed home? While their consciences may be clear, there are still consequences for their actions (or inaction) and unfortunately, we all have to live with them.
I dislike Romney as much as anyone. Probably more. The Mormon aspect really, really concerns me. Someone called into Todd Friel's show this week asked what would happen if Romney were named prophet of the Mormon church while president. That's just a chilling thought.
Nevertheless, those are all hypotheticals. With Obama, we know what we're getting and we know it's awful, ruinous and horrific for the country and it's deadly for the unborn. I would vote for Romney in a heartbeat over Obama.
How could they be? Seriously, how could anyone, especially a Christian who, either voted for Obama, (jaw-dropping!) or didn’t cancel one of the votes for him by voting for McCain, have a clear conscience?
They knew before the 08’ election that Obama had spent twenty years listening to Rev. Wright, was buddies with Bill Ayers, had taught “Rules For Radicals” and was more pro-abortion than Barbara Boxer and they found McCain too objectionable to vote for?!? And now some of these same people are going to chance four more years of more liberal judges, more debt, more job loss, more (fill-in-the-blank liberal/socialist/universalist nonsense) by NOT voting for Romney, should he become the nominee?!? Are you kidding me?
Our family has actually had a number of discussions as to which cat would be the better/worse Obama replacement, but the consensus is that any one of them would be a better president.
1. Paula FOW with her 2:42 comment on 10/14!! Now I feel tons better for putting Iowa more westerly than it should be. And who knew that RI was so much further north?? (That's 84%, 45 miles off, in 555 secs. I think I can do better on a states' capitals test.)
2. As for voting for the next President, I'm still hoping that Cain would be picked as the candidate. I mean, if it's going to be Romney or the status quo, I'll plug my nose and vote for Romney, but having watched "The Godmakers" films just recently, I have some serious reservations. (Used to think like Rachael, but over time y'all convinced me not to let my desiring for perfection overtake the choosing of good [or the lesser evil].)
3. And that "No Hope, No Cash, No Jobs" conclusion/plea is hilarious! Hahahaha!!! (But in this day and age, cured is less desirable than uncured. Pun fully intended.) ;)
Now it's 90%, 25 miles, and 392 sec. Blasted TN and HI! (Got TN as my second state, and accidentally let go of my left mouse button as I was dragging the HI islands to their proper place. Arghhhh....)
I don't see Cain's plan as being viable. I would never support a national sales tax without removing the income tax. Otherwise, in fifty years we'll have 40-40-40.
As to sales tax, I'd prefer a flat tax as far as fairness is concerned. Although, I have to say, there is a certain fairness in a poor person paying the same tax on a gallon of milk as a rich person. Eventually, the rich person will pay 9% on his entire income as will the poor person. A sales tax would also result in less government intrustion into an individual's life because taxes would be collected from businesses (this would also mean less data collection). A sales tax would also ensure that those who make illegal income would also pay taxes.
By the way: we in Canada have had a national sales tax for some time (called a Goods and Services Tax), as well as provincial sales taxes (PSTs) on top of that.
Incidentally, the national GST was brought in as a "deficit-fighting measure" back in the 90's when Canada faced a similar fiscal crisis to what the US is facing now. Strangely, it stuck around long after the deficit was gone and we were running fiscal surpluses... Just like income tax in Canada was brought in during the First World War as a "temporary wartime measure," I guess...
In light of some of the concerns posted earlier, an observation from Canadian experience. The way that various levels of government deal with the impact of those taxes on low-income families is twofold:
The drawback, of course, from the perspective of Cain's plan is that introducing a tax credit for low income families begins the process of complicating the tax code.
In my experience working with a large community services agency, the GST credit constituted a significant portion of the income of many of the families we helped.
Concur, Sir Aaron, Cain's 9-9-9 is dead on arrival, first because, the plan would never get passed Congress. 50% of Americans pay no federal income tax, there's no way you get enough Congressman to get that 50% to start paying taxes.
And like you said, a VAT is just another tax. Maybe if they repealed the 16th amendment, I consider it, but not until then.
I'll leave it to somebody else to correct me if I'm wrong, but I assumed that part of the framework of a flat tax system would be to eliminate most deductions.
Finally got a chance to do that test. All those mornings playing on the school playground map with my kids is doing me some good: 92% with 11 mile avg. error, but humbled that my husband still beat me by two percentage points!
I don't have the stamina to discuss politics at the moment, but whichever Nobama candidate I vote for, I'm wishing it was for a shorter than four year term, so hopefully the esteemed governor from NJ can get his running shoes on.

The Farscape repeat was an interesting enough episode. A middle part of a three part story from the second season. There's good humor in the series, and it works pretty well. Right now this series gets a lot of my time, and it's all still new to me.
Buffy was very funny, but I'm somewhat disturbed to see the geeks becoming bad guys. Wasn't Buffy the series where the geeks were the good guys? [Xander and Willow seem to be less geeky by the season as well.] Though their dialog was hysterical. And I'm going to so miss Giles.
And I think Smallville continues to show a lot of promise. I don't want them to rush into the Lex-as-bad-guy role, and I like how they've got that set up. I think the modifications in general are solid. They'll have some problems in having him discover powers every week - that's not going to last -- but otherwise, this continues to be on my schedule of shows to watch. It's also interesting to compare to Buffy, since Buffy is no longer about high school life, where Smallville is perhaps trying to recreate some of that feel of Buffy of five years ago.
I've only watched one episode of Gilmore Girls, which seemed a quality show I'm not really part of the target audience on, but this is a funny article about the challenges of it being up against Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
(I record Buffy while I watch that night's Farscape repeat, and if it was on another night I'd probably watch That 70's Show....)
And it's better than taking anti-biotics unnecessarily, which is a bad, bad, bad idea. Though it's like the Unibomber as far as risk...it's bad if you're a target, but they've been pretty specific targets so far, and most of us aren't working for a high-ranking Senator or a major media outlet. So it's bad, but panicking is counterproductive...
One of the teachers at my old elementary school was the Minnesota Teacher of the Year. (Of course, she wasn't teaching when I was there, in fact, I imagine many of the teachers that were at Gatewood when I was there are retired or moved on at this point...)
One of the cool things on the norm site now is that it now includes a "norm's diary" section in the archives, which is sort of a side-line commentary on the strip from Norm's perspective. And since Big Plot Things are happening right now, it's really interesting and cool...
I just have the massive fear that the strip will jump the shark at this point, but I really hope not. It's such a great strip...
And I imagine it must be doing well for FX as well. (I spent a couple hours today catching up on episodes that I'd recorded but hadn't seen since they were originally aired.)
Ethan Watters could be writing about me -- I definitely feel "tribal" in some sense; fandom, after all, is a tribe (well, several of them, actually), and my group of friends from high school is also a tribe. (Though that group has not been as strong as it once was, with friends leaving town and such.)
All very interesting. And I think those of us active on the internet might be more aware of this than others -- I've seen personal reports from people one and two-degrees away from myself, so even if I've never met them, it's got a bit more impact than if I wasn't connected.
A little note -- the open meeting for brainstorming about CONvergence 2002 programming will be at the Radisson South, on November 10th, starting at 2:00. It's intended to generate ideas, so is open to anyone who has some for next year's convention. (It'll get on the CONvergence website sooner or later, I hope, but I thought I'd mention it here...)
As a joke, after last night's Buffy, I wondered what would happen if you looked for the Urn of Osiris on Ebay.
I wrote a Farscape Review for the MISFITS site -- I've really become a fan of it over the last couple of weeks since the Sci-Fi channel started it up from the beginning. I look forward to the episodes I haven't seen of it as much as I do new episodes of Buffy or Angel, which is the highest possible praise!
Other good Farscape sites include Farscape World, The Snurcher's Guide, and The Tourist's Guide to the Uncharted Territories.
While I think it's important to fight back, and I'm proud of my country, I'm not a big believer in a "love it or leave it" mentality of hyper-patriotism. This is a time for a rational, responsible response....
I'm many things, most of them geek. Professionally, I'm a Salesforce.com Developer and Adminstrator for a Financial Services company in Minneapolis. Obviously, I don't speak for them. I've been involved with Science Fiction and Fantasy fandom since high school. I have spent years volunteering on CONvergence, Minnesota's largest fan-volunteer run SF Convention in a variety of roles, including head of programming and on the board of directors. I also chaired the Minneapolis JOFCon, was on the bid committee for Helsinki in 2017 Worldcon, and was WSFS DH for Worldcon 75 in Helsinki, Finland.

Himself is going through one of his odd job phases, and this is one of those tasks that he's been meaning to get around to for years.
Many years ago when Backwoods Miniatures brought out a kit for the Darjeeling C class pacific Himself bought one on a whim - he's always said it was one of their easiest kits to make.
With clever design the motor was mounted in the tender but drove the driving wheels through a shaft and universal joint to a worm gear above the gearbox in the firebox area.
This meant the boiler could be a solid white metal casting, so there was plenty of weight for traction.
All of which, in hindsight, makes you wonder why he thought it was necessary to fill the firebox area with lead, but he did, and over the years the lead expanded until it caused a rather spectacular throat plate failure with a large chasm opening up between the firebox and the boiler.
With the lesson learnt he has stripped it all down and refitted the firebox wrapper and now it's ready to be reassembled.

This morning I arrive and conversation is all about what a certain avatar has left behind on the Public Area 1 of the Starting Island, resulting in a "Too many spawned entities in area" error message:
This is the same person who was raining these same objects down on newbie avatars in the Welcome Centre, which I referred to in an earlier blogpost about this matter.
It's time that a combination of technical rules and social rules be enforced to stop, or at least curtail, these sorts of things from happening in the future. Perhaps we need to shorten the 5 hour auto-return of created objects. Perhaps we need to impose some sort of ban system based on internal usrerid or IP address. Perhaps we need to give moderators special powers to combat this spam. All I know is, we need to have some serious discussion about what to do. If we having this problem with only a dozen or so avatars on Starting Island at a time, what is going to happen when there are 50?

Last week during family skate night, my daughter asked me for two quarters to play some Skee-Ball. I loved playing that game as a kid. But imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and witnessed her active interference with the rules of the game! (… Truly, you can’t script this stuff…)
In construction contracts, “active interference” is a recognized exception to the enforcement of what is known as a “no damages for delay” clause. This type of provision seeks to preclude any increased costs associated with delays on the project. For example, a traditional clause may read as follows:
“No claims for increased costs, charges, expenses or damages of any kind shall be made by the Contractor against the Owner for any delays or hindrances from any cause whatsoever; provided that the Owner, in the Owner’s discretion, may compensate the Contractor for any said delays by extending the time for completion of the Work as specified in the Contract.”
“Should the Contractor sustain any damage through any act or omission of any other contractor having a contract with the Owner or through any act or omission of any Subcontractor of said other contractor, the Contractor shall have no claim against the Owner for said damage.”
In the a regularly cited case, United States Steel Corp. v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Company, 668 F.2d 435 (8th Cir. 1982), the court recognized that “no damages for delay” clauses are valid, but that there are numerous exception to the rule. In that case, the Owner issued a notice to proceed to the bridge superstructure contractor with knowledge that substructure work would not be completed on schedule. As a result, superstructure contractor was delayed for 170 days while waiting for access to work site. The contract contained a “no damages for delay” clause specifically making reference to delays caused by substructure contractor.
In the end, the court recognized that “no damages for delay” provisions are generally enforceable except as to delays: (1) not contemplated by the parties under the provision; (2) amounting to an abandonment of the contract; (3) caused by the owner’s bad faith; or (4) amounting to active interference. Since the Owner issued the notice to proceed with knowledge of the substructure delays, the Court concluded that the Owner was guilty of active interference. Accordingly, the superstructure contractor was entitled to recover on its delay damage claim.
Lesson Learned. The real lesson is to make sure to review your contract for these types of provisions and try to negotiate the terms. For example, the AIA A201 expressly provides that the owner and contractor may seek damages from each other in the event of a delay caused by the other party. There will be certain notice and substantiation requirements, but it is common to allow a party to seek damages for delay. If an owner is unwilling to remove a no-damages-for-delay clause in your contract, then you should try to limit its application to certain delays such as delays caused by others, leaving the owner liable for its own delays.

I tweeted this video two days ago. I tagged it on delicious a day ago. Short of driving to your house and forcing you to watch these 100 seconds of abstract geometric bliss, this is all I can do:
If you do end up driving to my house, at least bring some food! But alas, I watched it, so I’m sure you’ll have other houses to visit that are a higher priority :-)
Yeah, come visit me. It’s not working from here. Maybe if you’re here to work some magic, it will. (I don’t twitter much or do delicious, btw.)
It’s beautiful all around, but I’m amazed at how fast some of the 2d-transitions zip by yet manage to remain clear and intelligible. Faster than the shaky-cam fight scenes that have ruined action movies for me, but I felt like I could track every little square and triangle.
“Music is the pleasure the human soul experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting.”
Now let’s create a lesson plan for how we can relate this to the real world and have our students create their own.
re: lesson plan. If there’s one that makes good use of the instructional time / learning ratio, sure. Actually doing a 64K demo requires a lot of math prowess, but that’s the sort of thing that would take an entire semester to teach just that one thing.
I watched it when you tweeted it. I thought “eh”. I just watched it again. I must be missing something…
@Andrew, the creator quoted the project as “thousands of keyframes,” which I find sort of incomprehensible. It’s 100 seconds long. That’s at least ten keyframes per second. At least ten times a second the geometry of the entire piece changes.
Like you said, that could get disorienting fast, but such as the skill of the artist that it all feels of a piece.
I could watch these all day. Nice one. Check out QuartzComposer on the Mac if you haven’t already (free). Seems like QC has a lot of potential for math education in a non-programmy kind of way.
Fresh spring weather and sunshine have us all in the skating mood and thinking about the many upcoming contests we want to attend. Not only that, but we also have to decide which events we want to sponsor! For that reason, we have devised the “Main Event” Event Sponsorship Contest. Read through this post for all the details!
The MuirSkate.com crew is looking to support three (3) “local” events across the U.S. in the early summer months. All three of these events will receive goodies and prizes to give away at their events, but one event in particular will receive an extra special something. This “Main Event” is where the real fun happens. For this event, two MuirSkaters (Duke and Seth) will be hand delivering the goodies and prizes along with the help of some other special guests. They’ll also be there to help out with the event proceedings and serve as judges, if necessary. (Sure, they could ride, too! But that would be up to the riders and the event committee.)
As it turns out, there are a lot of rad contests going on all across the country! And many of them are coming to us for sponsorship. It’s tough to choose between them, so we’re asking for some assistance from you guys and gals in the longboarding community! We will be taking applications for events and we will post our top 10 favorite events to facebook.com/muirskate for a community vote. The three events with the most people “attending” will receive sponsorship. The MuirSkate.com team will then deliberate and discuss the top 3 events over an extravagant dinner feast in order to decide which event will be the “Main Event”! (No, you won’t have to change the name of your event if you win.)
We’re looking to spread the stoke and maybe even collaborate and assist in the development of an event, but certainly not take it over. While we look over the applications, we want to see what you dudes and dudettes are brainstorming for your event. If there’s something we can do to help out, cool! If not, that’s cool, too. Maybe you guys just want some products to give away... Maybe you really want “celebrity judges” to boost the stoke... Maybe there’s some big logs in the middle of your favorite road that you need Duke to move using only his left hand while Seth rescues cats from the nearby trees and powerlines after crafting those same logs into a 15 foot ladder... Maybe you just need a bit of help developing the course so it maximizes the gnar factor... Whatever it is, we’re going to figure out what we can do to help!
Because we’re booking flights and so on, we have to have a good head-start on the event date to ensure that we can get our crew to the event. The “Main Event” (and the second and third place events) can take place ANY DATE ON OR AFTER the weekend of June 18th up until September 31st.
To be sure your entry is eligible for the “Main Event” contest, you must complete the following steps:
From the red carpet to the runways, new hair trends are happening everywhere! Say goodbye to tight curls, and Jersey Shore inspired looks. Fall hair trends are all about attention to detail and feminine beauty. Check out some of my favorites! (with tutorials to come!)
Absolutely Bangin' The thing bangs are back in full force! If you've got a heart shaped face, like Carrie Underwood then bangs are super flattering! Even pop sensation Carly Rae Jepsen shows the bangs with a vixen appeal, and New Girl Zooey Deschanel keeps it soft and vintage.
Bump it Up (but keep it classy!) This runway look for fall 2012 shows a great use of headbands and hair ties! The volume is the perfect mixture of sass and sophistication!
Crowning Around The crown braid has been seen all over the runway! Have you checked out our brilliant tutorial on how to style your version with a Kitsch twist!
On the down-low Keep volume minimal when hair is down, this gives a much more effortless chic appeal. One of the best ways to get this look is to take air-dried hair and either pull back into a loose bun or a side braid and leave overnight. Since your hair is dried it won't be too defined but by pulling it tight at the roots, you will take away the top volume. Middle parts are also huge for fall, so keep that in mind as well!
Perfect Pony Buh-bye messy ponies! It's all about the slick, refined look now. Make sure that you keep yourself from looking too serious by using a great Kitsch hair tie. A metallic hair tie would be too perfect!
Twists! Simple, sophisticated and just a little sexy. Twists are replacing braids in certain looks, I love this half up/half down trend!
So many trends to suit so many different girls! One of the best things about the trends is that they are SO versatile!

The 130 brush from Mac is one of my most used brushes!!! It's a short duo fibre brush and almost like a mini version of the 187. In my opinion it's best suited for applying cream products including blush, bronzer, concealer and foundation.
The 130 is the perfect size for your cheekbones and temples. It always pick up the right amount of product and hardly ever sheds.
My problem with the Chanel bronzer is that it is NOT travel friendly, it's HUGE and would take up so much space. To fix this problem I decanted (scraped) some of the product into a small travel pot that I got as part of a set from Boots which fits the 130 beautifully.
Do you own the 130 brush? If so, what do you use it for? And, do you have any travel tips when handling make up?
I bought the 130 brush to use with Bronze Universel after your recommendation- at first I wasn't wowed with the effects on my skin but now I love it! Your travel tip is invaluable, though I couldn't bring myself to ruin the Chanel bronzer with a big hole in the middle of the pot- oh noooo! That's my baby!!! haha
oh def need this brush for that bronzer!!! i have been having the most difficult time finding a brush for that wonderful Chanel bronzer! thanks for the tips!
I don't have the 130 but I believe I have a similar travelling brush from Sigma,great post& tip thank u x
Shockingly I don't own any brushes! This post makes me want to go and get the 130 though! Love the travel tips too x
I use the 130 every day for my foundation! it's perfect since it really buffs the foundation in and makes it seamless, and it really gets into all the crevices of your face since the brush head is small. love it! i also use it for bronzer, when I choose to put some on :)
I had 130 but sold it as I found it too small for applying blush or bronzer. But I am glad it works for you, girls :)
Surprisingly, I've never purchased a high end brush but I've been looking for something to apply my foundation better. The MAC 187 looks like a good pick. :)
i'd be REALLY grateful to see your technique in applying it (circular motions, buffing, etc) i'm staring at my soleil tan is still just sitting on my vanity staring at me cuz i'm so scared to use it (how?) though i know i'll love it when i do!
Actually the 188 is the smaller version of the 187, the 130 is a different style of brush as the head is flatter and it's a different shape x
I love the 130 too! I use it mainly for foundation but I am thinking of getting another for cream blushers.
I never got the Tan de Soleil hype but I've seen a few posts recently mentioning it again and I reeeeeally want it. I've got the 130 and originally used it for foundation but now I tend to use it for highlighting but it doesn't get used too much :( x
i have this brush and love it for applying bobbi brown skin foundation (and nars sheer glow). I feel that it really helps control how heavy your makeup is applied and looks all lovely and airbrushed :)
Now anyone who knows me, knows I’m a self- confessed toy addict. And one of the great things about having children is that you get to buy lots of beautiful and fun toys for them (but lets be honest, kind of for us too) and then you get the joy of playing with them with the kids. I may or may not also have the occasional play with some of their toys when they go to bed too… ) * ahem* now I know it’s not just me who does that
So this month I’m reviewing a really fab toy from the gorgeous ethical toy company Bajo. I’ve written an article about this fabulous company and their amazing toys in the past, view here.
My newest find from Bajo are the Mendelson stacking figures, which we bought from our friends over at Babipur.
Me and the boys played with the Mendelsons for ages when they arrived. Both Jacob and Nic built really quite impressive structures with the them (whilst arguing over how many they each got, *rolls eyes). I was really quite impressed with the amount of structures you can build, I was even more impressed at the fab things my boys were building with them too; they really are wonderful for encouraging creativity, problem solving and concentration.
Not just that but the Mendelsons are great for encouraging imaginative play and fine tuning those motor skills and hand-eye coordination; as it takes a lot of concentration and care to stack tall or intricate structures.
That’s what I really love about this game, not only is it really fun but it also encourages skill building, and self discipline. The concentration I saw on my Jacob’s face when he was building his tower of people was fascinating to see- his attention span is usually pretty short, but he really put his full attention into his creation; and it’s wonderful that he has a toy that encourages that level of thought and practise
I’ve had lots of fun playing with this toy too. When my dad came to stay last month we got the Mendelsons out, and while the boys played with them my dad and I joined in. We were enjoying ourselves so much that it seemed to turn into some kind of tournament between me and my dad with who could build the most impressive/big/complicated structure; with jeers and cheering accompanying each new creation. In the end the boys got fed up of me and my dad bogarting the game and left us to play on our own. Oh the shame xD
I also heard from somewhere that the Mendelsons make an excellent drinking game. I can imagine that- I haven’t tried it yet but I shall
Ive noticed too, that the more you play with the Mendelsons the better and more confident you get at building structures. I’ve made several for the Babipur #MendelsonsChallenge on Instagram, and I was quite chuffed with some of the things I made and was able to create 🙂 Its great fun to incorporate other toys in with the Mendelsons too, to increase the challenge or to make beautiful mandalas.
More importantly though, is how Nic and Jacob’s skills have improved with them . Nic especially; though the little tornado has a short fuse and gets just a tad wound up when his tower falls over, he’s actually getting really good at his balancing and fine motor skills . And the look of pride on his little face when he finishes his creations is just too adorable
The little figures are shaped so that they can interlock very easily from many different angles and positions. There are so many different variations of structures you can make with them, which is what makes them so very addictive to play with. They’re also quite chunky, and cut from solid wood meaning they have a nice weight and width to them, enabling easy stacking and balancing. Working out how to get the weight distribution right is all it takes, and once you get the hang of it it’s so much fun challenging yourself to see what else you can make.
These toys don’t just have to be used to build stuff with, the possibilities are endless with them, which is what makes them such beautiful and versatile toys. They can be used as part of make believe games, can be used as counters for maths, for pattern making and so on. These toys are wonderful, and will help develop children’s dexterity and hand to eye co-ordination.
Some toys really are a challenge to write a whole article on- with some things it can be hard even getting 500 words out, but writing about this lovely game has been a walk in the park. I can’t recommend these enough, they’re a popular favourite in our house and are always being dragged out of the basket for various games.
The Mendelson balancing game costs £28.96 at Babipur, and trust me- you’ll get your money’s worth very quickly!

Data is known to be the driver for business and its transformation. Data needs proper maintenance, preservation, enhancement and interpretation before it can become an asset and be used to make strategic decisions. In today’s world of multi-channel marketing, ensuring your customer data is clean and up to date is a top priority. Good data significantly improves the performance of everything, from campaign results, conversion and retention, to customer service.
"Customer names and addresses improve the performance of everything in marketing – so long as the data is correct." - David Reed Marketing Week
Managing data means taking care of it so that it works for your business. With robust and comprehensive data management solutions, information collected and added is no longer subject to accidental disorganisation allowing the business to become highly strategic and increase conversion and retention.
Marketing Databases and Customer Relationship Marketing (CRM) have been around for a long time but the latest generation of marketing database and CRM systems enable you to communicate with your audience, via any channel, at the right time, with a relevant message or call for action.
Consumer Cloud Services has over 20 years of experience in the design, build and migration of data for CRM systems.We have built marketing databases with intelligence, way beyond just recency, frequency and spend. Data that perfectly fits with the CRM system of choice provides insight to purchase behaviour, acting on most recent data and product information. For each client, we provide a dedicated account management team available 12 hours per working day ensuring your data is updated on time with new feeds and campaign information.
Every marketing campaign needs data that performs. The process of cleaning or hygiene involves making sure name and address data is accurate and up to date. This is the foundation to create a marketing database which in turn facilitates successful CRM.
Consumer Cloud Services has an entire department dedicated to the development and management of marketing databases, staffed by skilled practitioners with vast knowledge of consumer data processing. With Data Hygiene, names and addresses are processed and enhanced prior to further processing in order to maximise discounts on postal mailings. Names are checked for standard abbreviation for titles, correct suffixes, forename variants, with salacious and ‘nonsense’ names identified and removed. We use Royal Mail’s Postal Address File (PAF) for checking and correcting addresses. The more you know about your customers, the more accurate your marketing database and the better your CRM and engagement results.Our bespoke and off the shelf data solutions provide you with high levels of accuracy and cost efficiencies.
We deduplicate to reduce annoyance of recipients who might otherwise receive the same communication. Deduplication also helps marketers target campaigns more effectively, enhancing the marketer’s image with customers and prospects. It helps improve the quality of the marketing database and direct marketing via the CRM system become more cost effective by preventing duplicated mailing.
Consumer Cloud Services has 3 levels of deduplication – Individual, Family/Surname and Delivery/Household. With our Individual level deduplication, we use title, initials/forenames, surname and address. For Family level, we deduplicate using surname and address. With the Delivery/Household level dedupe, only the address details are used.
We use extensive matchkeys and matching (series of match algorithms). These identify duplicate records whilst at the same time minimise overkill. Whether you want to remove duplicates from your database or combine separate files, we will provide you with the highest data quality so you can market more efficiently.
Keeping customer data clean is a challenge and keeping it up to date is crucial for every marketing effort.
Good data cleansing and data suppression is important in order to help achieve effective marketing campaigns. Data suppression is removing obsolete or unwanted names from your marketing database, leaving you to focus on those customers and prospects that are most likely to respond to your offers.
Compliance is a major issue for marketers, Consumer Cloud Services uses industry suppression files that identify and remove deceased and prevent distress being caused to family members who have lost a relative . Removing goneaways minimises wastage and helps preserve reputation. We can also provide TPS screening, which is a must for any tele marketing acquisition campaigns.
Relevance is one of the points to focus on when sending promotional messages to your customers. The data you gather and add to your marketing database provides you tools for analysis, profiling and segmentation that will enhance CRM and give you the needed marketing insight, creating relevant and timely messages.
AXA are one of the World's leading financial services companies operating in 56 countries. Formed in 1817, they are best known for their pensions and investment products with a customer base of many millions in the UK alone.
AXA UK wanted to reduce the 'leakage' of bond holder customers and increase rate of bond renewals but were unsure how to effectively do this.
A marketing strategy was needed with an SCV of bond holders as its core which would be used to drive campaigns.
Data required to build the bond holder SCV was housed at various departments throughout AXA, on different systems with no link between them.
A data matching system developed which firstly identified same individuals and same households then consolidated pertinent items into a SCV.
Analysis, segmentation and propensity models developed to help identify which bond holders were most likely to not renew.
Results from all campaigns fed back into the SCV to help further refine the propensity models and improve targeting.
After two years of running the campaigns bond leakage numbers decreased substantially, compared to rates previously experienced.
Bond holders SCV was used for analysis relating to other investment products providing actionable information for targeted communications.
Viking is the World's leading river cruise company selling river cruises on their own extensive fleet of ships operating in Europe, Russia and China.

Ticketing data was held at the head office in US, some 'fragmented' marketing data was held at the UK office.
Viking firstly had to understand more about its UK customers before embarking on any acquisition campaigns.
The assimilation of ticketing data, marketing data and enquirer information formed basis of the UK customer and enquirer SCV.
The addition of core lifestyle and demographic information allowed our analytical partner to undertake intuitive customer analysis.
Actionable information which helped Viking undertake a programme of above the line campaigns targeting likely prospects.
The marketing communication strategy developed in UK is now being replicated in other European countries.

Updates of the database to be reduced from 6 working days, incumbent supplier was taking, to a much quicker t/a.
An easy to use online tool to interrogate the database that could incorporate drive times, analysis and profiling functionality.
A more cost effective solution, for ongoing maintenance, but most especially for any bespoke requests.

Policy Expert are a home insurance company launched in the UK just a few years ago. In an increasingly crowded sector they provide very competitive premiums and high quality customer care.
Policy Expert needed to rapidly grow its customer base via a marketing strategy that would have postal DM as its core.
The solution had to quickly achieve cost of acquisition targets for the marketing strategy to be continued.
A comprehensive search of cold data deemed most suitable for the campaigns and a series of tests to assess suitability and ROI.
Building a prospect pool database that consolidated all data sources then made available for subsequent analysis.
Modeled data used on test campaigns, with results fed back to help refine selections for acquisition mailings.
As enquirer and customer data was generated this was also fed into the prospect pool to help improve the analytical models.

To provide a flexible, accurate and reliable data processing solution for all DM acquisition campaigns.
Data from more than 100 suppliers received within a short space of time, but all needed to be checked within 24 hours.
The processing required was far from a straight forward dedupe with several stages and review points needed.
Different levels of reporting required, topline summary down to a comprehensive audit of every individual list.
CCS' account management team of six personnel and our twelve data production personnel briefed on each project.
Fully white labeled reports designed to provide all required information, topline summary, intermediary and individual list.
Individual list audits highlighted poor quality data providing relevant information to seek credits from list owners.

On the banks of the scenic Danube, Vienna marries Western European sophistication with Eastern European culture and charm. Remnants of pre-Roman history in the Danube River Valley make Vienna an intriguing center of human settlement apart from its European neighbors. This city was the political center of the Austrian Empire and is home to ornate palaces and museums. Celtic and Viking history adorn the extensive museum collections while any conversation with a local will reveal a rather complex, if not completely convoluted, lineage.
A romantic imperial city, Vienna bears the hallmarks of a capital steeped in history, beautifully contrasted by its modern infrastructure. Vienna is home to several palaces built for the Hapsburg family. The Imperial Palace is located in the inner city and it was from here that the Hapsburgs ruled for seven centuries. It was constructed in the early 13th century. The Gothic chapel on the site is still open on Sundays for services. The Vienna Boy’s Choir sings here.
The Gothic and Romanesque Cathedral of St. Stephens is located near the Imperial Palace. Construction on this ornate cathedral was started in the thirteenth century and completed in the fifteenth century. The steeple of St. Stephens can be seen from all over the city. Climb the 343 steps of the nearly claustrophobic spiral staircase to the watchman’s lookout in the South Tower or head underground from the North Tower to the catacombs beneath the cathedral where 14 members of the Habsburg family are buried alongside the mausoleum of the bishops.
Schonbrunn Palace was built as a summer residence for Empress Sisi. The grounds include a park, the oldest zoo in the world and a large labyrinth that are open for tour as well as an ornate, Baroque style palace. Go next door to the famous Spanish Riding School where the coveted Lipizzan Stallions are bred, trained and shown in elaborate performances during the winter. There is so much to see at this palace that you should plan an entire day here.
The Belvedere Palace, designed by Von Hildebrandt, is also built in the Baroque style. This palace was the heart of the former Hapsburg empire. The Austrian Gallery Belvedere, built for Prince Eugene of Savoy as a summer home, is located here. It is now open for tours and contains art work and historical information, including a delightful Klimt collection. In addition to viewing the artwork, you can tour the palace and spectacular gardens.
The Imperial Burial Vault is located below the Capuchin Church and is open for tours. This was the burial place for members of the Hapsburg family. The vault contains 146 aristocrats, 12 emperors and 19 empresses.
The inner city is also home to monuments and parks that are popular tourist attractions. Old, ornate churches can be found here as well as other building such as Parliament, the University and Opera house.
Kuntshall Wien is a museum with a collection of modern and contemporary art. The artists are both Austrian and International artists. This museum is run by the city of Vienna.
The Sigmund Freud Museum is dedicated to the Father of Modern Psychology. It is run by the Sigmund Freud Society and traces the doctor’s life and work.
A city of music, Vienna was home to some of history’s greatest composers. Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Strauss were all proud to call Vienna their home. Vienna’s musical heritage has been preserved to the present day. The Vienna Boys Choir is ever popular and the Wiener Philharmoniker remains a world class orchestra.
Summer, winter, spring and fall are all celebrated with unwavering zeal through a seemingly endless string of festivals. During the Film Festival am Rathausplatz, which is held during July and August, remarkable movies are projected onto the grand wall of the Rathausplatz (city hall) nightly, along with operatic performances from the world’s best. Men and women gather here after work to enjoy cocktails and the extensive array of international cuisines and stay well into the night to dance, watch films and stroll through the adjacent park.
A theatre break is always a rewarding experience; witness the latest film and dance productions or just sit back and soak up the best of classical opera. A vast array of concerts and exhibitions are held throughout the year.
Right through history, Vienna has embraced the world of art and proudly boasts many of its own world famous artists. Through the centuries, kings and queens of Austria were passionate art collectors, rendering Austria – and Vienna in particular – a treasure trove of fine art.
Many of these masterpieces can be seen at the Museum of Fine Arts; a magnificent building exhibiting works from across the world. Indeed, art and literature feature predominately during Vienna’s history. Underground railway stations designed by Otto Wagner are listed properties; coffee house literature is digested by both young and old.
Besides their love of the arts, the Viennese love to shop. Markets are scattered throughout Vienna but most popular is the Naschmarkt flea market. Dating back to the 16th century, everything from children’s shoes to apples can be purchased. If you can endure the crowds, bargains are aplenty.
Indulge in the fun and games at the Prater, Vienna’s biggest funfair. If the noise and crowds become too much, escape to the open fields or take a stroll through the adjacent forest and chill out with the wildlife.
For spectacular views of the city head for the Danube Tower, known locally as the Concrete Needle. The tower is over 350 meters high; with your head in the clouds, Vienna never looked so good.
Round off your Vienna experience by indulging in their proud coffee culture. Find a coffeehouse and order from the endless menu of roasts. Also, you may find it difficult to avoid the tourist-targeted Mozart Balls (chocolates made for the man himself), but resist temptation and venture into a true Viennese chocolaterie like the famous Demels. Also, the Sacher Torte is unmissable.
Steeped in art, history, music and culture, a trip to this breathtaking City of Dreams is an enriching experience.
Fashion design is a career choice desired by many. The glamour, creativity, and earning potential, along with names such as Tommy Hilfiger, Prada, Mark James, and Yves Saint Laurent, convey visions of glamorous clothes, red carpet events, celebrities, fame, and big bucks. However, the reality could not be farther from the truth. Those who choose careers in fashion design have beginning salaries below $30,000 a year; however, hard work, resolve, creativity, and the ability to stand out, can result in earning millions during the course of a career.
People associate fashion design with high profile designers who lend their name to the clothes we wear. Those who enjoy the world of fashion, but require job and income stability, have more secure opportunities available. Employment abounds in mass marketing and manufacturing. These garments are designed for retail and discount chains. As middle class demands increase for fashionable, yet affordable, clothing, these designers and manufacturers continue to grow in popularity. Beginning salaries in mass marketing average $30,000 a year; however, creating designs that are unique and functional, leads to potential income of $78, 000 or more per year.
Designer salaries are often dictated by employment. As mentioned above, designers who work for manufacturers can expect to make between $56,000 and $73,000 a year.
Design firms, franchises, universities, and design houses offer middle road salaries; somewhere between, $45,000 and $51,000 annual income.
Designers who choose the path of self-employment begin with a salary of $35,000 a year, but it is often these designers who have the greatest earning potential. While rare, these designers often create have their own label and design houses; their name brand label will command millions.
Employment location influences the salary of fashion designers. Unlike other industries, fashion design is focused in major U.S. cities. The greatest earning potential is found in cities such as San Francisco ($69,000 a year), Dallas ($67,000 a year), Los Angeles ($57,000 a year), Seattle ($56,000 a year) Miami ($45,000) and Chicago ($43,000 a year). Interestingly, although considered the design capital of the world, New York has third place honors with salaries averaging $63,000 annually. New York is inundated with new designers each year. Salaries are kept low, especially for those new to the industry, to test their mettle, and commitment to the industry.
Other factors that determine salary are education and experience. Designers, who have graduated from esteemed universities and design schools, garner higher salaries. Creativity, talent, and reputation allow a designer to stand out amongst competitors, and further increases income potential. Designers who respect their clients and employees have higher incomes and do not forget a client base of well known celebrities and headliners will boost a designer to the top of the salary scale.
As with any career choice, many factors including education, drive, creativity, location, and just plain hard work, will ultimately determine lifetime income for a fashion designer. For those willing to take risks, and search for prime opportunities, life time income is only limited by creativity and imagination.

Ship project history: The first representatives so-called "Intermediate destroyers" which concept has developed by Admiralty in 1938. They should hold intermediate position between large fleet destroyers (since "Tribal" class) and fast escorts of "Hunt" class. At the expense of some simplification of a construction and armament their building was supposed to be conducted quickly enough (in comparison with large destroyers), that would allow to change outdated "V" and "Modified W" classes destroyers in the shortest terms. As starting point for designing "J" class destroyer has been chosen, hull and machinery which borrowed practically without changes (have only slightly moderated dimensions). It was originally planed to use both single and twin 120mm mounts but at a phase of a basic design the latter had refused. In an ultimate kind "intermediate" destroyer at displacement 1500t had armament consisted of four single 120mm mounts, multi-barrelled pompom, two quadruple 12.7mm MGs and two quadruple TT, i.e. she differed from "Н" class by only pompom and larger DC stowage (up to 30).
The order for building of 8 ships of "O" class has been given out in day of the entering of UK to war 3/9/1939, within "Emergency war program" (therefore the ships of this type called as "1st emergency flotilla"), the order for precisely same 8 ships ("Р" class or "2nd emergency flotilla") has followed exactly a month later.
War experience has raised the question about strengthening of AA armament, and in the summer of 1940 in the specification one of TTs has changed by 102mm AA gun. In the end of a year an idea appeared to rearm the ships by twin 102mm mounts but since the latter did not suffice, the choice has fallen on all same single 102mm mounts, and in February, 1941 the decision followed to rearm 8 ships (6 of "Р" class and 2 of "O" class, for uniformity last two have interchanged their names on beginning from "P" from 120mm to 102mm AA guns (four on standard places and one more instead of one TT). Moderated loads with new guns allowed to strengthen anti-submarine armament.
In March, 1941 it has been decided to arrange 4 ships of "O" class as minelayers. As well as in a case with "Р" class, their artillery had been changed from 120mm to 102mm, but their number have shrunk to 4, second TT returned on its place, and rails for 60 mines were mounted on stern deck aft from second funnel. Removing of one of 102mm gun and one TT for loads reduction was provided if maximal mine stowage was carried.
Naval service: Porcupine 9/12/1942 was badly damaged by torpedo from German submarine U602, never repaired, hull was cut on two parts in a point of torpedo hit and till the end of war served as two hulks "Pork" and "Pine". Partridge 18/12/1942 was sunk by a torpedo from German submarine U565 at Oran. Panther 9/10/1943 was sunk by German Ju 87 bomber in East Mediterranean. Pakenham 16/4/1943 in Central Mediterranean was damaged by gunfire of Italian torpedo boats Cigno and Cassiopea and scuttled by own crew. Pathfinder was badly damaged 11/2/1945 by Japanese aircraft and after temporary repair was laid up into reserve. Obdurate was badly damaged in early 1944 by an acoustic torpedo and repaired more than year.

They set off down M Street. Another thing Nick liked: the way E devoured her hot dog. The women he knew were always on diets, but this one had a healthy appetite. He felt good around her.
Finishing, she turned to him, smiled and handed him a napkin. "You have a little mustard moustache, just like my brother used to get."
He watched as she licked her lips and mouth area to clean off, completely unselfconscious. She was erotic, yet innocent at the same time, her complexion fresh, almost dewy from the garden. Sugar and spice...and everything nice. He looked away.
"Boy, that was good! Haven't had one in ages. Mike is more of a gourmet," she said, tossing some trash in a bin. "Where did you say you know him from?"
"Oh." Nick cleared his throat, studying his Coke can. "It was a different kind of war." That, he knew. "Hard to figure out."
"My Pop always told me we have a duty to serve our country, even sometimes when we don't understand why."
"Yeah. We have a duty to serve. Even sometimes when we don't understand why." He repeated her words slowly, feeling like a real shit the way he was playing out his line, waiting to reel her in. "Those Nam vets never got the credit they deserved—no parades to welcome them home."
"Down south they did. Least in Louisburg, our county seat. Mama was proud that day. He was a hero to her...for a while." As he gazed off, she added, "That's okay, I don't mind. She told me before she left, tried to explain." E frowned. "But now that I'm here—in the big world—I understand how our old one seemed kinda small."
E made a wistful shrug. "Can't blame her. Pop wouldn't let her call. Maybe someday." She forced a brief smile. "You're a good guy, Nick. Down to earth."
They continued on in silence. After a while, they reached the southern edge of Rock Creek Park, which accompanied the creek as it wound through the city. Soft light filtered through the oaks and maples. Everything a pale shimmering green. A gentle breeze picked up.
"Yeah." Nick stared straight ahead, feeling slightly ill—and it wasn't the chili dog. "I didn't run into you by accident."
Feeling her warm look, Nick turned to her gravely. "It's not what you think, E. Believe me, I wish to God it were." She was so simple, so trusting. Why did he have to take that away from her? Why hadn't she just picked some other guy? "I'll give it to you straight. I work for the government—and my job is to make sure our flag keeps flying long after I'm gone."
"That flag means something to me—as I know it does to you. You said your father was a hero, how proud you are of him. Now is your chance to serve your country."
"How could you understand, a nice patriotic girl like you? The truth is, E—you're living with a spy."
The least he could do was give it to her straight. "We've learned from a high-level Moscow source that a SeaTech employee is passing top-secret data about the USDS—our new Undersea Sonar Defense System. He doesn't know the spy's name, just that he's a naturalized American. There is only one such employee at SeaTech—Mike Wilson."
Nick just stood there, admiring her spirit—her loyalty—then looked off at some kids kicking a soccer ball in an open patch of green.
"National security? I thought the Cold War's over—Gorbachev and all..." Her voice trailed off in bewilderment.
"So they say. But if any of the old boys are hanging on? Put it this way. You can be sure their fingers are very near that atomic pistol. And it's still pointed at us—over land and sea." His face hardened. "The world changes, all right. Technology, too—and suddenly we were vulnerable. We've been upgrading our underwater security, thought we were on the right track—until Wilson penetrated our systems."
E glared, hands on her hips. "You're wrong!" Then she dropped her arms and the angry light became cloudy. "So what if he is naturalized? Mike's just like anyone else. Doesn't even have an accent." She shook her head. "I have to go now."
"Would you like to see my ID?" Nick asked quietly, still watching the kids. And the black and white ball spinning through the air...looking suddenly very goddamn gray.
"No, I believe you are who you say you are—Mr. Daley. I just don't believe what you say." She stared at the children, her shoulders drooping. "I suppose I should thank you for the hot dog."
Nick reached to touch her, then backed off. His conscience was troubled and he felt uneasy. He had no right. But he did. It was his job. Just doing his duty—and it sucked. "Listen, E. Evelyn. I really wish it had been a coincidence and a casual hot dog, but we're desperate for hard evidence. I need your help! Your country needs your help."
Nick pressed his advantage. "You have no reason at all to trust me, but I feel your instincts are good." He paused. "All I ask is that you keep your ears and eyes open, and if anything—any little thing—strikes you as being unusual in any way...Please, give me a call." He was a pro and had recruited many agents, so he'd saved his best for last. "Your father would want you to help." He handed her his business card.
A ghost of a smile touched her lips as she opened her fist and seemed to be studying the crumpled card. But her eyes showed how distressed she was at this first real moral dilemma in her life. "I am mad. But throwing away your card is not going to change that. Mr. Nicholas Daley." A pensive look crossed her face. E sighed. "I guess there's no such thing as a free lunch."
Small and vulnerable, E stared at it, the golden aura gone. She met his eyes with the faintest of nods. But she sure didn't have to shake hands with him.

“I’ve been asked many times during this farewell season, ‘Is ending the show bittersweet?’ Well, I say all sweet. No bitter. And here is why: Many of us have been together for 25 years. We have hooted and hollered together, had our aha! moments, we ugly-cried together and we did our gratitude journals. So I thank you all for your support and your trust in me. I thank you for sharing this yellow brick road of blessings. I thank you for tuning in every day along with your mothers and your sisters and your daughters, your partners, gay and otherwise, your friends and all the husbands who got coaxed into watching Oprah. And I thank you for being as much of a sweet inspiration for me as I’ve tried to be for you. I won’t say goodbye. I’ll just say…until we meet again. To God be the glory.” (Oprah Winfrey)

The holidays are hard enough already. Facing the changing weather is challenging. Pushing through the crowds in the stores is a struggle. Balancing the wants of others against your own needs adds to your level of stress.
Although this time of year is meant to be a joyful celebration, the pressure and anxiety have a tendency to overwhelm the positives and make the whole time of year a negative, arduous journey.
Now you have another problem to contend with, but this is not only a seasonal issue. It is a situation that is long lasting and life changing — cancer.
Unfortunately, your cancer does not take a break during the holiday season. It does not alleviate mid-November and resume on the first of the year.
This unrelenting condition will make good situations bad and bad situations worse if you allow it. Rather than succumbing to the weight of cancer during the holidays, choose to combat the stress.
By practicing prevention and addressing your needs, you can make the holidays with cancer better than those of the past.
Cancer is primarily a physical health condition. Because of this, you need to do everything in your power to ensure your physical health is as good as it can be.
If your physical health is suffering, the stress and responsibilities of the holidays will compound. Everything will feel worse. To combat this, consider the following:
Follow your doctor’s recommendations. If you trust your doctor and treatment team, it will be essential to follow their recommendations to create the best situation for your physical health.
Eat well. Cancer and the treatment that follows commonly lead to many issues with appetite. Plus, your energy will be lower, which makes the prospect of standing in front of the stove preparing a meal much less appealing. Without healthy foods, you cannot function at your best. During the holidays, there will be ample opportunities to indulge in comfort foods, but do so in moderation.
Exercise. Just like with eating well, the lack of energy associated with cancer treatment will make exercise an afterthought. Work to change this trend for better results. Exercise will improve your physical health greatly, but it will lower stress and boost your mental health along the way.
Sleep well. Speaking of physical health measures that improve your mental health, try to renew your focus on restful sleep. Do not accept poor sleep as an effect of cancer. Along with diet and exercise, sleep is a very useful tool to lower stress, aid in your recovery, and improve your decision-making skills. These benefits are needed during the holidays more than any other time.
Caring for your physical health will set the stage for you to manage holiday stress, but the real work will be done with your mental health. Yes, cancer is physical, but the implications extend well into your mental health status.
Self-talk is the ongoing conversation you have with yourself throughout the day. Self-talk plays a massive role in influencing your feelings.
Often, self-talk can be overly negative and irrational, which could change your views of the holidays. You can never be sure of the holiday outcomes, and thinking poorly about the gatherings may lead to self-fulfilling prophecies where your views influence your perceptions.
To overcome this, focus on the positive interactions that could come with the visit. Arriving with a sense of hope will improve your chances of better outcomes.
Holidays are times of great traditions and routines. You may feel a large amount of pressure to maintain the activities in the past even though you are not physically able to this year.
Conversely, you may feel like you can no longer do anything with your diagnosis and cancel all of your plans. Modifying your expectations means that you arrive at conclusions that match your abilities with doing too much or too little.
If you expect too much of yourself, you could be let down and feel like a failure. If you expect too little, you could miss out on some healthy interactions.
You already know the holidays add to your stress, and you know cancer adds to your stress. Because of the double intensity, you need to find double the stress relief.
Much of this can come from forms of relaxation. Engaging in specific relaxation techniques like deep breathing, guided imagery, autogenics, and progressive muscle relaxation will manage your stress quickly and efficiently.
Other options like yoga and forms of meditation will be very helpful as well. Sitting on the couch, swiping through social media, and consuming alcohol and other drugs are passive experiences and do not create much relaxation. They may even make stress worse.
Once your expectations are established, communicate your plans to the important people in your life. Remember, they have been developing their own expectations of you and the holidays along the way.
Chances are good that their expectations do not match yours, so communicating your stance will be crucial. Practice negotiation skills to balance your needs with their wants.
The best communication will continue on an ongoing basis before, during, and after the holiday season to ensure that your message is received. Focus your communication on being:
A great deal of stress develops when your presentation does not match your feelings. Acting like you are carefree when you actually have high levels of worry, anxiety, and fear is disingenuous, breeds stress, and damages relationships.
Letting people know and understand your situation will allow them to assist to the best of their abilities. If you worry about being tearful or outwardly irritable, let the other people know what they can expect and what they can do to help.
Two stressors make any situation more challenging, but it does not have to be impossible. Approach the holidays with cancer by targeting your physical health and mental health to find ways to succeed in the stress. You do not have to be superhuman; you only have to be yourself.
The expression blower is made use of to define numerous kinds of superchargers. The Roots-type blower is very easy and also extensively used.
Consisting of a supercharger is a great ways to recognize forced air induction. For M62's, you're want to eliminate the entire supercharger from the car. The Vortech V-3 supercharger also includes helical equipments to develop the overall gear noise silent, yet still provides you the ability to hear the pleasant gripe sound which all of us enjoy regarding superchargers. To put this in layman's terms, the turbocharger could have an RPM speed which can be almost 30 times faster compared to a typical vehicle engine. Turbochargers on the other hand have smoke altering tools to reduce the carbon emission of discharges.
Both will develop large sums of power. Anne means to add power is to construct a bigger engine. Another suggests to add power is to gain a normal-sized engine much more efficient.

In the past years digital media has gained more importance for museums and exhibitions. Next to classical online communication like websites and newsletters new fields like content management systems, digital management of collections, digitalisation projects, target-group-specific development of applications to e-commerce and e-publishing have developed. The digitalisation affects communication concepts, IT structures, human resources and sales channels within the own institution, but is also reflected by new patterns of behaviour of the audience. Since long digitalisation arrived in show rooms and museum departments and challenges the own “digital mindset”, the individual readiness and ability to embark digital media methods. This new digital field increasingly asks for a professional and profound attitude and “grammar of action” and an experienced eye to the “digital audience”: Ideas about spaces for action and interaction, target groups, social communities and habits of reception of the audience. The multitude and complexity as well as the fast pace of these digital developments ask for new professions, operation cycles, human resources and budgets. And for a grounded and holistic strategy for the process of development, conception, monitoring and management accounting.
If someone searches for a implemented “digital strategy” in cultural institutions one travels around the globe to a handful of big or smaller institutions, who engage exemplary within the field. Tate (London) is the most distinctive player and started working on a respective strategy as early as 2010. Each version of this strategy can be found online on Tate’s webpage and are documented in the different stages of development: „Digital media are an important channel for inspiring, challenging and engaging with local, national and international audiences“.
The Smithsonian Institute (USA) also shapes a whole landscape of digital perspectives of development. Between 2009 and 2014 they accompanied the whole process of finding an adequate strategy with an own wiki: „For the Smithsonian to remain a vital institution at this important time in our history, we need to fully engage younger generations with our collections and our knowledge. We need to use new digital technologies to their fullest potential so that we can fulfill the Smithsonian’s 19th-century mission—‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge’— in a thoroughly 21st-century way for the benefit of all Americans and people around the globe.”
As early as 2007 the Victoria museum in Melbourne (AUS) framed a published “digital strategy” online: „A dynamic online presence that integrates and coordinates knowledge sharing, discoverability and access”. Also worth reading is the digital strategy of the Warhol museum in Pittsburgh (USA), published on the public file hosting service GIT-Hub, which is designed as a “living document”. This approach shows the essential conceptual respective journalistic dynamic of such a strategy: „The digital strategy is designed to be a living, organic document that can evolve as technology rapidly evolves the world around us“.

Description: The 64th Map of the Week brings us to the land of Slovania, a corner of the fallen Æsir Empire that is not ruled by forces of evil but that is not necessarily good aligned either. Slovania was settled by a high shamann from Windland in the south who was named Aleksandra. Her witch faith was dominant in the formative years but since has lost much of its influence.
Today, Slovania is a weak kingdom with four strong counties and a march. The king has his seat in Newhouse. The four counts and the margrave combined have considerably more power than the king alone. However, they work against one another rather than together. Their lands are the Royal, River, Grainland and Southland Counties and the Border March.
Slovania is a relatively corrupt land between the borders of good and evil. However, evil agents serving the dark draugs in the ruins of the Æsir Empire to the north are beginning to establish secret bases in parts of the kingdom.

"Justice is not imprisonment, monetary penalty or the act of revenge. True Justice is the knowledge, understanding and transmission of Truth."
There were several more deaths on London Road during the 1930s and the crossroads became a notorious black spot. The villagers were promised a by-pass but it was delayed by the war years and did not become a reality until 1955.
In the time that CaptainJohn Harrison had ownership of the Fountain it became known as a Hotel rather than an Inn., although the signs advertising it called it the 'Inn that is Different'.
This picture shows Withdene sporting its neon sign. This was the house where Don Foxley was born. His father Percy rented the property to The Fountain for many years.
The terminology "The Inn that is Different" lasted for many years and Roger Smith even recalls one of the signs along Watling Street had a deliberate spelling mistake at one time to read 'The Inn that was Differant'.
It was during these years that the rich and famous used to patronise the Fountain , often arriving by aeroplane. If they circled the Inn three times a chauffeur would go and meet them from the small airfield at Shenley Brook End .(Don Foxley and Frank Daniels make reference to this in their interviews).
1947 Don Foxley remembers being in a convoy of tanks that passed along London Road. He waved to the shopkeeper of the Co-op who was standing on his front step wearing his long white apron.
1955 London Road by-pass completed when the fly over was finally constructed at the crossroads. The construction of this was a prototype for the bridges over the M1.(Frank Daniels)
1959 The M1 Britain's first length of motorway links N. Bucks. To London and the Midlands.This seriously affected the trade at the Talbot refreshment rooms. Coaches opted to use the faster and more direct route down the M1.
1961 Memorial Cottages handed over to the Rural District Council. Renovations to include hot water system and internal WC.
1965 Mrs. Betty Fletcher became post lady for Loughton and a small part of Shenley Church End. She eventually retired in 1986 after 21 years.
1973 Mr. Jackson's appeal against property rates for his house on London Road.(Wolverton Express 2/3/73).
1985 Regulars give up their battle to stop the 14th century Fountain pub and restaurant in Loughton from being converted to a Harvester steakhouse at a cost of £250,000.(Milton Keynes Gazette 13/9/85).
1996 The old Co-op shop on London road, now Jardines the Chemist and the local Post Office move to Shenley Church End new local centre at Benbow Court. The shop is left derelict.

It has seriously been a whole month since I have last posted. Where have I been? Huh. I have two things to write about today. First I just got back from a weekend in Jackson Hole Wyoming with my man. Two important thingies in that sentence. One, I spent a weekend in Jackson Hole with glorious Teton mountains, green pines everywhere, and wildlife to spare. Two, I was with my man. (sigh)
The first day we were there I decided to go for a run on the Elk National Reserve. Didn't actually see any Elk, but got to run for miles and miles with almost nothing around me except mountains. The cool part is that I ended up running farther than I have ever gone before. I don't know why. I just kept going. Kept drinking water. Kept running. Got back and realized that I had gone farther than 3 miles, farther than 4...maybe even 5! Now here is the coolest part. We ended up tracking the miles in my car, and I didn't go 5. I actually went.....(drum roll)....7.6! Now, granted I walked some of that, but HOLY COW that is almost 8 miles! Which is like a million really. If I can run a million then certainly I can run a half marathon in October. :D
The second thingy that I wanted to write about was my experience today at the laundry mat. I was there folding sheets, listening to Dr. Phil when this commercial came on for some depression medication. (commercials for medications is a weird concept anyway....) But this one in particular struck me as odd. After it talked about how depression hurts, and that whatever-its-strange-name-was could help it went on for seriously 5 minutes about all of the negative side effects. Everything from dry mouth to bleeding, to increased suicidal thoughts, to liver damage...to good lord! And the very next sentence? "Ask your doctor about whatever-the-hell-they-called-it today!" What? Seriously? There has got to be a better way.
Is that depression medicine supposed to cause or cure depression!?!? BTW, GOOD JOB! You are the runner extraodinaire! I'm in awe of your ability and determination! YOU GO GIRL!!!!
I recently signed up to a class with Studio Calico called "Love Your Lettering". It's a class to improve your hand lettering and let me tell you, I am so glad that I did. The class takes you through the basics of hand lettering and how to play around with different fonts and sizes.
The part I loved the most was learning about cursive writing. I should add here that I've always loved my handwriting and I always get a lot of compliments on it. Not blowing my own horn here I promise up if there's a card to be written or a whiteboard to be filled it's always me who ends up being volunteered.
That being said there was a lot for me to learn about forming the letters and where to add the heavier "down" strokes. I would write a lot of my handwriting in cursive but some letters like the "b" and the "s" and the "r" took some work to get down!
Here's a birthday card that I played with. I really like the Kraft card and keeping the decoration simple. I think I'd like to make a batch of these for Christmas presents and give everyone a whole pack of different ones so they always have cards on hand for different occasions.
I used a good old Sharpie for the art journal pages and I then went out and bought ink and a good brush for the Birthday card. I like the convenience of the Sharpie for sure but I loved the flow of the ink and brush, I think I'll be using that quite a bit.

A digital strategy defines and controls all structures, activities, projects, resources, competences and valences as well as cost and benefits, which a museum introduces in the digital media and combines it in a ideal cooperation (“grammar of action”).
This approach is to be understood as fundamental, long-term and sustainable. The digital strategy is a task crossing various fields and should be developed holistically meaning including all departments in a cultural institution also if affected in different manner.
Digital strategies should ideally be implemented cross-media, meaning it should be designed to cross different social networks and platforms: digital strategies cover the “classic” web with the production and editing of content (‘strategy of content’), allocative functions of marketing online like SEO (“Search Engine Optimization”) and SEA (“Search Engine Advertising”) and channels of communication in social media and in email marketing.
Also projects for digitalisation, databases, cooperation in using content, projects in the field of electronic publishing, e-commerce, e-ticketing, Open Access and development of applications (apps) should be included in digital strategies.
The digital strategy also defines the internal “mindset” of a museum and thereby essential parameters and structures for implementation for all digital, technological (and probably also legal) questions. A digital strategy formulates all these positions towards the own institution and the public. It defines the interaction with the local IT (topics like wi-fi) and aspects of the immediate technological infrastructure on site.
Digital strategy also focuses on “customer journey” and “customer experience”, meaning the touch and interaction point of the visitor in the interplay of real and digital spaces. In interaction with the different departments of a institution concepts, structures and narratives, connecting work of collection, exhibition and mediation with immersive and participative approaches should be developed as a digital strategy. Ideally this strategy is agile, eager to experiment with new ideas and reacts quickly on actual topics in technology and society.
In September 2015 the Landesstelle für die nichtstaatlichen Museen in Bayern brought a new project into being which analyses and advises Bavarian museums in their online performance in the course of the next five year.
Criteria of a holistic online strategy will be researched within the local, national and international field: preconditions, targets, platforms and tools, benefit dimension, efforts and criteria for success. Main focuses are classical websites and accompanying tools like newsletters, blogs and social media. In collaboration with selected museums in Bavaria a holistic online strategy will be developed, which can be implemented autonomous. This concept can bring orientation and instruction for other museums. The results of the pilot experiment will be presented at the 20th day of Bavarian museums (20. Bayerischer Museumstag) in July 2019. Interim results will be presented at different conferences about which I will also report in this blog.
A few months ago I introduced the hashtag #DigSMus and will tag posts (and hopefully not only I but other will follow – thanks so far to Peter Soemers) which contribute information and inspiration to the topic.
The Zone Tortona is a aera in Milan comprises between the Naviglio grande and via Solari. This aera has been reconverted and developped during the years, transforming the farming then industrial zone into new residential complexes and cultural spaces.Shortly, the industrial activity has become one the most representative and typical element of the area. In a few decades, some of the most important companies of the Made of Italy: Bisleri, Ansaldo, Riva Calzoni, Richard Ginori, Osram, Loro Parisini. At the end of the 70&#039;s, following the evolution of the production system, the manufactures were disused and abandonned; leaving great pavillions and courtyards emply.In 15 years, Zona Tortona has become a real cultural area with numerous design, fashion and photography studios (Casablanca), rechearch centre, fondations, laboratories, showrooms and media comapnies (web, publishing and tv).During the Milan design week, (from the 12thto the 17th of April 2011), the area will be animated with installation, events and meeting points installed in many manufactures and lotfs, usually abanbonned during the year.This year, the brand Zona Tortona that first lauched the Fuori Salone, should have celebrated its 10th anniversary along with the 50th birthday of the salone.However, the event&#039;s management is under scrutiny as the delegate administrator is accused of illegal traffic. The historical logo has been modified and many lofts have not be used. The exposed objects have already been seen as if the designers this year looked for security. As if the innovation could in some way, extend the crisis that despite a slow recovery has been really hard.Exerpt:The Zone Tortona is a aera in Milan comprises between the Naviglio grande and via Solari.

In this article I want to compare traditional long, slow cardio with interval training for fat loss. From a fat loss standpoint, the more calories you burn, the better. Let’s see how good long, slow cardio and interval training are at burning calories.
Long, slow cardio burns more calories during training, but interval training burns more calories overall (during and after training), because it makes you burn calories between training sessions since your body must recover from the intense bout. It’s “hard” on your body. Winner: interval training.
Long, slow cardio won’t help you gain muscle mass. On the other hand, interval training makes you gain muscle mass, because to sprint or bike like crazy you need to push on the pedal really hard. This builds muscle (think of a sprinter). Since the more muscle you have, the higher is your resting metabolic rate, interval training makes you burn more calories all day, every day. Winner: interval training.
Another benefit of interval training is that it takes much less time (about 30 minutes per session). Winner: interval training.
On the other hand, interval training is too hard for beginners. If you’re a beginner, stick to slow jogging first for two weeks, and then experiment with increasing the pace for 5 minutes and walking for the next 5 minutes. Once that becomes easy, shorten the work interval and increase its speed. Winner: long, slow cardio.
Overall, if you’re fit, interval training is best. But since it’s very hard on the body, no one (even elite runners) does it more than twice per week. So, to lose fat quickly, your best bet is a combination of interval training (1-2 times per week) and long, slow cardio (2-3 times per week). Plus it brings variety to your training, which is good. Winner: both.
To sum up, if you want to maximize fat loss, I suggest you do interval training alone on the days you do it, and that you do some weight lifting and then long, slow cardio on the other days you train.
This being said, the specifics of interval training can get tricky. Hopefully I can share with you the method I prefer later. Athletes and smart trainers use interval training: you also should.

Many people in Pacific Paseo Huntington Park California decide to employ an accident legal representative after they’ve been associated with a car crash that results in accident and monetary losses.
Technically, you can submit an accident claim against an insurer on your own. Some individuals select this path when they have actually suffered only mild injuries and have the time to investigate the legal claims process themselves. Also, skipping a lawyer will save you some loan in legal costs.
Nevertheless, an accident attorney– particularly a personal injury attorney– can assist you take on big car insurance provider and their group of legal representatives. Your lawyer already understands the injury laws and procedural rules and can efficiently deal with all the legwork for you. He or she will function as your supporter throughout the whole case.
Because an insurance company’s lawyers have the knowledge to decrease settlement and even deny the claim completely, employing an accident attorney is the very best choice for people who:
Generally speaking, a long-lasting injury is one that lasts for around a year or longer, while a long-term injury is one that disables you for life. These kinds of injuries seriously affect your ability to remain and end up being employed– not to mention the quality of your life.
Proving long-term and completely disabling injuries can be tricky organisation, and your personal injury lawyer probably will consult with each medical professional you have actually seen. She or he even might ask for the presence of your medical professionals during any legal proceedings.
When an insurance provider challenges its insurance policy holder’s liability for the auto accident, the company is basically saying that the policyholder is not at fault (or is at least claiming you do not have enough evidence of fault) and, therefore, the insurance company is not responsible for spending for your damages.
An accident lawyer in Pacific Paseo Huntington Park CA will help you supply this proof and reveal that the other party was indeed at fault.
Refusal to pay (which can but does not always originate from a contested liability) or refusal to pay a fair quantity is when an insurer outright won’t make a reasonable settlement deal– or any offer at all.
Because of possible scenarios such as statutes of constraints (which can differ by state), it is necessary to employ a personal injury attorney and get the claims procedure going as quickly as possible; nevertheless, you do not want to employ the very first lawyer for whom you see a billboard on the highway.
Just as there are various physicians who focus on several areas of medication, there is a vast array of legal representatives from which to choose.
You can begin gauging your convenience level from the beginning (for example, how do you feel about the attorney’s success rate with car accident cases?) and continue beyond the time you employ him or her.
Often, examining your convenience level can prevent you from hiring an accident attorney who isn’t well matched for your case; other times, it might encourage you it’s time to change course with a brand-new attorney.
Just keep in mind, you suffered injury near Pacific Paseo Huntington Park and financial loss due to an auto accident you believe another person caused. Utilize these ideas– and trust your gut– as you search for the right accident attorney.

Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Make the crust: In a food processor, blend together the graham cracker crumbs, almonds and sugar until the almonds are ground fine. Pour in the melted butter and caramel while processing, until mixture is combined. Press the mixture onto the bottom, and half way up the side of a 10 inch springform pan.
Make the filling: In a metal bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, melt the white chocolate, stirring until smooth. Remove from heat and set aside. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs and the egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the flour and the vanilla and blend in the melted white chocolate slowly, beating until the filling is well combined. Pour filling into crust.
Bake in the middle of preheated oven for 1 hour. Then turn off the heat, and crack the oven door an inch, letting the cheesecake cool in the oven to room temperature. Cover loosely and refrigerate overnight before removing from pan.
Make the topping: In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar and cornstarch. Stir in water and blueberries. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Press through a fine sieve. Stir in lemon juice, allow to cool, and store in a glass jar.

IHMC Public Cmaps is running, but the indexer is not completing its task. Therefore searching for resources may fail, and Cmaps are not showing up in the results for searches at http://www.cmappers.net
I am using cmap 5.05 on Mac OS 10.7.4. In the past I have been able to link propositions between cmaps, and have examples of this in my My Cmaps folder. Currently I am not able to link propositions across cmaps. When I left click on the arrow on a proposition in one window, it simply will not leave that window to connect to the other cmap.
I deinstalled the old version of cmap and installed 5.05. I have no other programs open other than web browser and mail (ie, no Microsoft stuff). The cross-cmap links on my old cmaps are still active, but I can't add new ones. I also tried using just a single display but that didn't make a difference.
Any insights? I am left clicking on the arrow above the proposition and attempting to drag it to the other window. I've tried it with and without the arrows activated on the other window. But as I said, I can't leave the current window--it just creates a new linked proposition in the same cmap.
After you click on the arrow above the concept, hit the "Command" key on the keyboard, the link to the other Cmap should work. This should work on OS X.
Thank you! I was just having the same problem on OSX, and having no luck searching for a solution outside this forum. I do wish they would note this in the main support document--seems pretty fundamental.
We've been able to reproduce it, but at times it works and at times it doesn't. We are looking into it.
I am addicted to overnight oats and the sheer amount of different variants you can do with them! They were a staple when I was losing weight a few years ago for my breakfast before I went running and now I take them to work with me when I am on early shift. They take minimal preparation and then you just put them in the fridge overnight – what is even better is you can make them up in advance for a few days worth of breakfasts!
You will need a container whether it is a mason style jar like I use or a tall tupperware container that will be large enough to hold your overnight oats in.
That is the basic recipe for the oats the rest really is down to your personal preference. You can add apple pieces and cinnamon for an apple pie flavour, or chocolate chips and cherries for a black forest taste. But the two I use frequently are a mocha and cookie dough. I use nuts and seeds in mine but they aren’t necessary at all.
Mix all the dry ingredients together with the syrup then add the coffee and milk and mix well. Pop an airtight lid on and leave in the fridge.
Like above mix all the dry ingredients and the syrup together and add in the milk, mix well pop on a lid and into the fridge it goes.
Sometimes it may need thinning out with a little more milk but that is personal preference. I hope you enjoy making your own versions of overnight oats and don’t forget to tell me what you do so I can try it!

A bride’s perfume isn’t something that should be taken lightly. A carefully chosen fragrance is certain to help remember the special day. But choosing the perfect perfume can be challenging. One of the more effective ways to choose a perfume is to make sure it complements the theme of the wedding. For instance, if you are planning on a tropical beach wedding, a floral or fruity scent is certain to appeal. A fragrance search should help find the perfect scent that gives a lasting impression on the special day.
Matching the season – Make sure to match the season to the chosen perfume. A spring or summer bride is certain to appreciate the floral and citrus scents. These work better in the warm months. For a fall or winter wedding, a preferred scent is likely to include the woodsy and spicy fragrances.
Try samples – If looking at a new fragrance that has never been worn before, it certainly helps to invest in the small sample bottles. Department stores and online fragrance bars offer a great opportunity to try the unique and rare perfumes for one or two days. This lets a bride get a full appreciation of the perfume before buying a full size bottle.
Know the options – Besides traditional perfume, a bride has a variety of other options for creating the desired smell for the wedding day. If a softer effect is preferred, this is achievable with scented hair perfume or body lotion. Many of the top brands include a range of fresh hair mists.
Apply it right – For the long-lasting fragrance make sure to apply the perfume to the pulse points. This can include the inner wrist, behind the knees, behind the ear lobes and crook of the elbow. Also, avoid rubbing the perfume when it is being applied to the pulse points since this can weaken or crush the scent.
Increase the staying power – Increase the longevity of the fragrance by spraying a fine mist to the veil, the lining of the dress, and on the underwear. Also, take a compact size perfume bottle for touch up if required.
All in all, by investing the time and effort into searching for the right wedding day fragrance, it should be possible to create the lasting impression that leaves a happy and romantic feeling that is remembered for the long-term.

Google has launched a new effort to warn its users that they could be the victims of cyberattacks from hostile governments.
Account-holders working in international relations, development and other sensitive areas have received messages from the search giant informing them of recent efforts to spy on their online history.
The move comes after the company started detecting 'tens of thousands' of new hacking attacks originating in the Middle East.
Google is a tempting target for hackers, as it is not focussed solely on search but also offers its users services such as email, mapping and Chrome, one of the most popular web browsers.
This week, according to the New York Times, users thought to have been targeted saw a message attached to their accounts saying, 'Warning: We believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your account or computer.'
This is not the first time that Google has detected hostile online activity apparently coming from or supported by national governments.
The firm first issued warnings about cybersecurity to a few users in June this year - but an investigation since then has revealed many more security breaches than previously thought.
A member of Google's security team, Mike Wiacek, told the Times that 'tens of thousands of new users' would receive warnings that their accounts had been compromised.
Those who took to Twitter to report receiving the warnings include national-security journalists and employees of international think-tanks.
Target: The firm is tempting for hackers as it holds information on search, email, mapping and much more
Mr Wiacek added that the Middle East had been a particularly common source of state-sponsored hacking attacks, with online spies active in 'a slew of different countries'.
While he refused to specify which governments were suspected to be behind the cyber-espionage, countries such as Bahrain, Iran and Turkmenistan have recently been accused of spying on dissidents through the internet.
And Iran in particular has been active in using online warfare to supplement its conventional capabilities, according to security experts.
However, many of the most spectacular instances of computer-based hostility have come from the U.S. and its allies such as Israel.
Most spectacularly, a virus known as Stuxnet which temporarily shut down Iran's nuclear programme is believed to have resulted from a collaboration between the CIA and Israeli intelligence.
As well as the complex task of crippling whole computer systems, state-sponsored hackers can attempt to gather information about other regimes or on political dissidents from their own country.
Google has previously clashed with governments attempting to exert control over their citizens' use of the web.
The firm launched a Chinese version of its search engine with certain sites excluded from the results, but later pulled out of the country for fear of violating its own free-speech principles.

Glitch Picking...well, at least that's what I call it. A while back, I was working on my inside picking (picking in between two adjacent strings). Once I got to a speed that kicked my arse, my pick began to double-pick the strings. Knowing this was an accident, I would try to refrain from doing it. However, I also realized that it sounded pretty cool. I then decided to go with it, and try to make this glitch productive. This is the first riff I've written using this (style?) of picking. Note the up and down strokes. When playing fast, it should only look like two strokes at a time. Have fun.
Listen to the song I've written from this form of picking on the front page of my website at www.shaneguitar.com.

This invention relates to an edge-of-dock type dock leveler which is operable as a runoff guard for a loading dock platform and, more particularly, to an apparatus for locking an edge-of-dock type leveler in an upright rearward position toprevent accidental runoff of vehicles in use on the loading dock platform.
Forklift trucks and the like are frequently utilized on loading dock platforms to facilitate the loading and unloading of cargo carriers. Typically, however, forklift trucks cannot directly access the storage compartment of a carrier due to gapsand height variations between the platform and the carrier bed. To facilitate such access, a variety of methods have been developed; the most widely accepted of which is the dock leveler. Dock levelers are ramp-type apparatus generally designed tobridge the gap between the loading dock platform and a carrier bed, and to compensate for any existing height variations.
Typically, a dock leveler will have a center plate which pivots relative the loading dock platform and a lip plate which pivots relative a forward edge of the center plate. When the dock leveler is in use and fully extended, the lip plate restsdirectly on the bed of the carrier. As such, forklift trucks and the like can move freely between the loading dock platform and the carrier bed. When not in use, however, the dock leveler is typically stored with the center plate generally lying flushwith the loading dock platform, and the lip plate hanging downwardly from the forward edge of the center plate. In this manner, the edge of the loading dock platform remains unobstructed, thereby creating the potential for a serious safety hazard.
Forklift trucks and the like can accidentally be driven off the unobstructed edge of a loading dock platform when the conventional dock leveler is in its standard storage position. This risk of accidental runoff is even greater due to theawkwardness in controlling forklift trucks, particularly those overladen with cargo. Likewise, loading dock platforms are frequently crowded with cargo and other obstacles, which further contributes to the difficulty in maneuvering around a loading dockand increases the potential for accidental runoff. Since loading dock platforms are typically elevated at least three feet from the ground, the consequence of accidental runoff can be disastrous both to equipment and personnel.
Recently, a few dock leveler designs have been developed to include various forms of automatic barriers to address the problem of accidental runoff. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,598 and 5,040,298 disclose two different pit-mounted type dock levelershaving automatic vehicle barriers. Although the dock levelers of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,598 and 5,040,298 provide barriers against accidental runoff, several drawbacks in these designs are still quite evident. Most notably, pit-mounted type docklevelers tend to be expensive, both in construction and installation. This is particularly true when a pit-mounted type dock leveler is to be retrofitted into an existing loading dock platform.
Another common drawback of the dock levelers of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,920,598 and 5,040,298 is the complexity of their designs. For example, the dock leveler of U.S. Pat. No. 4,920,598 requires that a hydraulically actuated assembly be mountedto the front of the dock leveler to permit both sliding and pivotal movement of the lip plate. This design complexity adds not only to the cost of construction, but also to the difficulty in both operation and maintenance. Due to the constant demandsof loading and unloading carriers, loading dock personnel typically do not have the time to properly operate or maintain these complex dock levelers. However, attempts to short cut proper operating procedures often lead to injury of either the personnelor the equipment. This, of course, results in the added cost of medical care and replacement parts, as well as the loss in revenue during the "down time" of the loading dock.
An edge-of-dock type dock leveler has been marketed in the past to prevent a forklift truck from running off the loading dock platform at times when the dock leveler is in the stored position. This edge-of-dock leveler includes a lip platepivotal about the outer edge of a center plate. To form a runoff barrier, the pivot axis for the lip plate is spaced from the rear edge of the lip plate. In this manner, when the dock leveler is moved into its standard stored position, i.e., with thecenter plate lying flush with the platform and the lip plate extending downward, the rear edge of the lip plate projects vertically above the center plate to prevent the accidental runoff of vehicles from the loading dock platform.
While the runoff barrier feature of this dock leveler has generally proven to be both effective and inexpensive, there remain two situations wherein the runoff barrier may prove to be a burden. The first occurs when actual use of the dockleveler is not required, such that the dock leveler is maintained in its standard stored position and a carrier is backed into a position adjacent the platform. In this instance, the upwardly projecting barrier may impede traffic between the platformand the carrier bed. The second circumstance occurs when the dock leveler is utilized, but the carrier is at such an elevation that the lip plate is not fully extended. Depending upon the angular difference between the center plate and the lip plate,vehicular movement into and out of the storage compartment of the carrier may again be obstructed.
Finally, a growing concern is the susceptibility of loading dock personnel to back strain and other injuries resulting from the operation of dock levelers. If not properly designed, the awkward positioning of an operating lever and theconventional pull-push motion required to extend a manual dock leveler could have harmful effects on an operator. Since the incorporation of hydraulic extenders would add tremendously to the cost of dock levelers, it is desirable to develop aninexpensive manually operated dock leveler which induces minimal back strain on the operator.
Accordingly, a primary object of this invention is to provide a dock leveler which may operate as a runoff guard for a loading dock platform.
An additional object of this invention is to provide a combination dock leveler and runoff guard which is both inexpensive to make and simple to operate.
Another object of the invention is to provide a combination dock leveler and runoff guard which may be operated without inducing back strain on the operator.
A further object of this invention is to provide a kit for retrofitting a conventional edge-of-dock type dock leveler for operation as a runoff guard.
To achieve the foregoing objects in accordance with the purposes of the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, the dock leveler of the present invention comprises a base plate adapted to be mounted on a loading dock. A center plateis provided having a first edge pivotally connected to the base plate for pivotal movement of the center plate in forward and rearward directions between a forward position and an upright rearward position. Likewise, the dock leveler includes a lipplate pivotally connected to a second edge of the center plate for pivotal movement of the lip plate between a retracted position and an extended position. Locking means is provided for securing the center plate in the upright rearward position toselectively preclude pivotal movement of the center plate.
Preferably, the locking means is adapted to automatically secure pivotal movement of the center plate when the center plate is moved into the upright rearward position. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the locking meansincludes a locking bar having a first end hingedly connected to the bottom surface of the center plate and an opposite second end adapted to move into abutting engagement with a stop member mounted on the base plate when the center plate is moved intothe upright rearward position. The preferred embodiment of the locking means further includes an extension member affixed proximate to and axially-extending beyond the second end of the locking bar to prevent the second end of the locking bar frommoving past the stop member, as well as means for releasing the locking means.
Also provided in a preferred embodiment of the present invention are center plate pivoting means for pivotally moving the center plate in the forward and rearward directions; actuating means for selectively operating the center plate pivotingmeans; and lip plate extension means for pivoting the lip plate toward the extended position as the center plate is pivoted in the forward direction from the upright rearward position. Preferably, the releasing means is adapted to automatically releasethe locking means when the center plate pivoting means is operated to pivot the center plate in the forward direction from the upright rearward position.
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the center plate pivoting means includes a mechanical linkage extending between the base plate and the bottom surface of the center plate, and the actuating means includes a manually-operablelever arm operatively connected to the mechanical linkage. The releasing means of the preferred embodiment includes a first paddle pivotally mounted on the bottom surface of the center plate and engageably-aligned with the mechanical linkage, a secondpaddle pivotally mounted on the bottom surface of the center plate and engageably-aligned with the locking bar, a connecting rod extending between the first and second paddles to enable coordinated movement therebetween, and means for biasing the secondpaddle away from the locking bar at times when the first paddle is not in engagement with the mechanical linkage.

Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings torefer to the same or like parts.
In accordance with the present invention, the dock leveler is operable as a runoff guard for a loading dock platform. During standard operation, the dock leveler may be positioned to bridge the gap and compensate for height variations betweenthe loading dock platform and an adjacent carrier bed. When a carrier is not located next to the loading dock, however, the dock leveler may be positioned to guard against the accidental runoff of vehicles from the edge of the loading dock platform. Tofacilitate both functions, the dock leveler is adapted to be mounted on the edge of a loading dock platform.
Accordingly, the dock leveler of the present invention includes a base plate adapted to be mounted on the loading dock. As embodied herein, and with initial reference to FIG. 2, the dock leveler of the present invention, generally designated byreference character 10, is mounted on the exposed vertical face 102 of the loading dock 100 utilizing the base plate 12. 0f course, it is likewise feasible that the dock leveler may be adapted to be mounted to the horizontal surface of the loading dockplatform 104 itself, proximate the outer edge, if so desired.
In the preferred embodiment of the dock leveler 10, the base plate 12 is secured to the loading dock 100 by a dock edge channel iron 110 and anchor 112. Typically, the loading dock 100 is of concrete construction, with the dock edge channel iron110 and anchor 112 embedded therein. However, it is also possible to make base plate 12 integral with the dock edge channel iron 110 by using the face of the dock edge channel iron 110 as the base plate 12. Bumper blocks (not shown) are positioned oneither side of the base plate 12 to prevent trucks from backing into the loading dock 100.
The dock leveler made in accordance with the present invention includes a center plate having a bottom surface and opposite first and second edges. The first edge of the center plate is pivotally connected to the base plate for pivotal movementof the center plate in forward and rearward directions between a forward position and an upright rearward position. As embodied herein, FIG. 2 shows the center plate 20 in its forward position, with the center plate 20 being substantially horizontal andlying flush with the loading dock platform 104. FIG. 3(a) shows the upright rearward position, with the center plate 20 in a substantially vertical position relative the loading dock platform 104. Typically, center plate 20 is approximately 25.degree. past perpendicular to the plane of loading dock platform 104.
In a preferred embodiment, the pivotal connection between the base plate 12 and the first edge 24 of the center plate 20 is provided by a conventional pin-type hinge 28. Preferably, the center plate 20 has substantially planar top and bottomsurfaces, and is either rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, with the second edge 26 being parallel to the first edge 24. To support the center plate 20 in its substantially-horizontally forward position, at least one support gusset 14 is mounted on andextends from the base plate 12. It is preferred, however, that support gussets 14 be positioned at either side of the center plate 20 to provide a more stable structure.
Further in accordance with the present invention, the dock leveler includes a lip plate having opposite first and second edges. The first edge of the lip plate is pivotally connected to the second edge of the center plate for pivotal movement ofthe lip plate between a retracted position and an extended position. More specifically, and as embodied herein, the lip plate 30 of the present invention is pivotal about the second edge 26 of the center plate 20 between a retracted position, as seen inFIG. 3(a), with the lip plate 30 generally forming an acute angle with the center plate 20 when the dock leveler 10 is in its upright rearward position; an intermediate position, as seen in FIG. 2, with the lip plate 30 generally forming a right-anglewith the center plate 20 when the dock leveler 10 is in its standard stored position; and an extended position, as seen in FIG. 5, with the lip plate 30 generally coplanar with and forming an extension of the center plate 20 when the dock leveler 10 isin its bridging position.
As with the center plate 20, it is preferred that the pivotal connection between the center plate 20 and the lip plate 30 be provided by a conventional pin-type hinge 38; and that the lip plate 30 have a substantially planar, rectangularconstruction. While any of a variety of rigid, durable materials may be used for construction, it is preferable to form the center plate 20 and lip plate 30 from steel or a similar metal material.
Unlike the pivotal connection for the center plate 20, however, the hinge pin of the preferred pivotal connection for the lip plate 30 of the present invention extends outwardly beyond the side of the hinge 38. Preferably, the hinge pinextension 39 has an outer diameter of approximately 1 and 1/4 inches and extends outwardly from the hinge by approximately 2 inches. Such hinge pin extensions are common in conventional edge-of-dock type dock levelers. The hinge pin extension is oftenutilized as a structure onto which an operator can latch a hook for pivoting a conventional dock leveler in the rearward direction. Alternatively, a rivet of similar dimensions may simply be welded to the bottom surface of the center plate, proximatethe second edge of the center plate, to provide such a structure.
Preferably, a support bar 36 is attached to the underside of the lip plate 30, as best seen in FIG. 3(a), to ensure the lip plate 30 does not retract toward the center plate 20 beyond a predetermined acute angle. In this manner, the support bar36 engages the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 when center plate 20 is pivoted into the upright rearward position. By maintaining a predetermined angle between the lip plate 30 and the center plate 20, the second edge 36 of the lip plate 30 iselevated to reach carrier beds which are higher than the loading dock 100 so as to greatly enhance the service range of the dock leveler 10.
In accordance with the present invention, the dock leveler also includes locking means for securing the center plate in the upright rearward position to selectively preclude pivotal movement of the center plate. The locking means enables thedock leveler to operate as a runoff guard when the dock leveler is not being utilized to obtain access to an adjacent carrier. By providing durable locking means to securely maintain the center plate in its upright rearward position, the sturdyconstruction of the center plate acts as a barrier to prevent vehicles from accidentally being driven beyond the edge of the loading dock. It should be noted that in accordance with the present invention, any of a wide variety of locking means may beincorporated to secure the center plate in the upright rearward position. However, the locking means selected should be capable of withstanding direct impact upon the center plate, such as by a forklift truck. This ensures that the dock leveler willnot inadvertently pivot forward due to a slight bump, thus rendering the runoff guard ineffective.
As embodied herein, the locking means of the present invention is adapted to automatically secure pivotal movement of the center plate when the center plate is moved into the upright rearward position. That is, no additional or secondary actionis required to activate the runoff guard once the center plate is brought into its upright rearward position. This eliminates the possibility of any operator error in securing the locking means.
A preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown in the accompanying drawings by means of illustration and not limitation, includes a stop member 50 attached to the base plate 12. The stop member 50 of the preferred embodiment includesat least one gusset plate 52 extending from the base plate 12, and a stop plate 54 affixed to and extending from the at least one gusset plate 52.
The locking means 40 of the preferred embodiment includes a locking bar 42 having a first end 44 hingedly connected to the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 and an opposite second end 46 adapted to move into abutting engagement with thestop member 50 when the center plate 20 is moved into the upright rearward position to brace the center plate 20 against subsequent pivotal movement in the forward direction.
More specifically, the first end 44 of the locking bar 42 is connected to the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 by a hinge block 47, and the second end 46 of the locking bar 42 is adapted to swing freely as the center plate 20 is pivotedbetween its forward position and its upright rearward position. This is best demonstrated by FIGS. 2 and 4(a). As the center plate 20 is pivoted in the rearward direction, i.e. toward the left in the representation of FIGS. 2-5, the second end 46 ofthe locking bar 42 swings toward the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20. The stop member 50 is located such that, when the upright rearward position is reached, the second end 46 of the locking bar 42 is positioned adjacent to and in abuttingengagement with the stop member 50. As is evident in FIG. 4(a), any forces exerted on the center plate 20 in the forward direction, i.e. accidental impacting by a vehicle, are counteracted by the bracing effect of the locking bar 42.
In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the locking bar 42 includes an extension member 48 affixed proximate to and axially-extending beyond its second end 46. As best seen in FIG. 4(a), the extension member 48 ensures the secondend 46 of the locking bar 42 is properly positioned in abutting engagement with the stop member 50 when the center plate 20 is pivoted into the upright rearward position. This is accomplished by effectively preventing the second end 46 of the lockingbar 42 from moving past the stop member 50. The drawings present the extension member 48 as a separate element, such as a rod, welded to the locking bar 42. Of course, the extension member 48 may likewise be formed as an integral extension of thelocking bar 42, if so desired.
As seen in FIG. 4(a), the stop plate 54 has a forward edge 56 against which the extension member 48 contacts to prevent the locking bar 42 from moving past the stop member 50 and an upper surface 58 against which the second end 46 of the lockingbar 42 abuttingly engages. While the drawings present the stop plate 54 as being vertically-aligned, it is noted that the stop plate 54 may be angled so as to be axially aligned with the locking bar 42 for more flush contact therebetween.
Of course it should be understood that the locking bar assembly above is but one possible embodiment of automatic locking means. For example, and purely for illustrative purpose, a post with a latching mechanism proximate its upper end may bemounted on the base plate adjacent the center plate. As such, the latching mechanism may be adapted to securely engage the hinge pin extension when the center plate is pivoted into the upright rearward position. Alternatively, an air-operated pistonpin may be mounted on the bottom surface of the center plate, and adapted to engage an aperture formed in an adjacent post.
The dock leveler embodied herein further includes means for selectively releasing the locking means. Of course, the releasing means selected will be dependent upon the type of locking means utilized. For example, with the locking bar of thepreferred embodiment, the preferred releasing means is connected to the center plate and adapted to selectively move the second end of the locking bar out of abutting engagement with the stop member to permit subsequent pivotal movement of the centerplate in the forward direction, as will be described in detail below. Likewise, the releasing means selected will be dependent upon the extent of operator interaction desired. If maximum security is desired, the releasing means may be independentlyoperated to ensure that no movement of the center plate is possible without the operator first consciously releasing the locking means. Alternatively, and as will be discussed below, the releasing means may be adapted to automatically release thelocking means when normal dock leveler positioning procedures are performed.
As embodied herein, the dock leveler of the present invention includes center plate pivoting means connected to the base plate for pivotally moving the center plate in the forward or rearward directions, and actuating means for selectivelyoperating the center plate pivoting means. A variety of center plate pivoting means are available and adapted for use with dock levelers. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the center plate pivoting means of the type originallypresented in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/645,609 filed Jan. 25, 1991 is utilized.
A more detailed disclosure of the center plate pivoting means is set forth in the specification of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/645,609, as incorporated herein. Generally, however, the preferred center plate pivoting means includes amechanical linkage extending between the base plate and the bottom surface of the center plate. The mechanical linkage has a first end hingedly connected to the base plate, and a second end is selectively disengageable from the bottom surface of thecenter plate when the mechanical linkage is operated to pivot the center plate in the forward direction, as discussed below.
The actuating means 80 embodied herein includes a manually-operable lever arm 84 operatively connected to the mechanical linkage 72. In the preferred embodiment, as best seen in Figs.. 3(a) and 3(b), a lever tube 82 is connected proximate thesecond end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72, and the manually-operable lever arm 84 is removably disposed in the lever tube 82. Preferably, the lever arm 84 is configured to be in a substantially vertical orientation when the center plate 20 is in theforward position, as seen in FIG. 2. This allows the operator to grasp and pull the lever arm 84 rearward without undue back strain and without having to lean over the edge of the loading dock 100. Likewise, when the center plate 20 is in the uprightrearward position, the lever arm 84 is adapted to extend approximately 18-24 inches above the ground. This minimizes the amount of bending required by an operator to grasp the lever arm 84 and move the dock leveler 10 in the forward direction.
As demonstrated by FIGS. 2 and 3(a), the first end 74 is connected to the base plate 12 by a pivot block 77. The second end 76 is adapted to selectively engage and travel along the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 when the center platepivoting means 70 is operated to move the center plate 20 in the rearward direction. In this manner, the normal force exerted by the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 against the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 pivots the center plate20 in the rearward direction. Preferably, the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 includes a roller 78 adapted to roll against the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 to reduce drag as the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 movesalong the bottom surface 22 of center plate 20. When the lever arm 84 is pushed in the forward direction for pivotal movement of the center plate 20 in the forward direction, the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 disengages from the bottomsurface 22 of the center plate 20. As seen in FIG. 3(b), the lever arm 84 then engages the hinge pin extension 39 to urge the center plate 20 in the forward direction. FIGS. 2 and 5 show that the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 is alsodisengaged from bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 when center plate 20 is at rest in the forward position.
The preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a counterbalance spring mechanism 16, as shown in FIG. 1, to reduce the effort required to position the dock leveler 10. The counterbalance spring mechanism 16 is adapted to exert anupward force on the center plate 20 and lip plate 30. The counterbalance spring mechanism 16 of the preferred embodiment is a dual extension spring mechanism, which is well known in the art. Accordingly, the details of counterbalance spring mechanismneed not be further described.
As previously mentioned and embodied herein, the releasing means of the present invention is adapted to automatically release the locking means when the center plate pivoting means is operated to pivot the center plate in the forward directionfrom the upright rearward position. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the releasing means 60 is operatively disposed between the locking means 40 and the center plate pivoting means 70. For simplicity of design, the releasing means60 is preferably adapted to move the second end 46 of the locking bar 42 out of abutting engagement with the stop member 50 as the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 disengages from the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20. To provide thisoperative relationship, a variety of releasing mechanisms may be incorporated, such as linkage arms or cables. In fact, computer-synchronized hydraulic pistons could even be utilized, cost permitting, to operate the center plate pivoting means andreleasing means.
The preferred embodiment of the releasing means 60, however, comprises a pair of interconnected paddles, as seen in FIG. 1 . A first paddle 62 is pivotally mounted on the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 and engageably-aligned with thesecond end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72, as best viewed in FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b). A second paddle 64 is pivotally mounted on the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 and engageably-aligned with the locking bar 42, as best viewed in FIGS. 4(a) and4(b). Extending between the first and second paddles, 62 and 64, respectively, is a connecting rod 66 to enable coordinated movement of the two paddles. With the center plate 20 locked in its upright rearward position by the bracing effect of thelocking bar 42, as seen in FIG. 4(a), the first paddle 62 extends outwardly from the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20, and the second paddle 64 lies substantially parallel to the bottom surface 22.
To release the locking means 40, and permit subsequent forward movement of the center plate 20, the lever arm 84 is moved in the forward direction to operate the center plate pivoting means 70. As a result of the forward movement of the leverarm 84, and as best seen in FIGS. 3(a) and 3(b), the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 disengages from the bottom surface 22 and engages the first paddle 62. Further forward movement of the lever arm 84 causes the second end 76 of themechanical linkage 72 to pivot the first paddle 62 in the clockwise direction, as viewed in FIG. 3(a). Due to the coordinated movement enabled by the connecting bar 66, the second paddle 64 simultaneously pivots away from the bottom surface 22 andengages the locking bar 42, as seen in FIG. 4(b). In this manner, the second paddle 64 urges the second end 46 of the locking bar 42 out of abutting engagement with the stop member 50 to permit pivotal movement of the center plate 20 in the forwarddirection when the lever arm 84 engages the hinge pin extension 39.
After the locking means 40 is released, it is desirable to reset the releasing means 60 for future use. The preferred embodiment of the releasing means 60 includes means for biasing the second paddle 64 away from the locking bar 42 when thefirst paddle 62 is not in engagement with the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72. Preferably, the biasing means is a spring 68 extending between the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 and an extension 67 of the connecting rod 66, as seenin FIG. 1.
Adapting the releasing means 60 to automatically release the locking means 40 simplifies operation of the dock leveler 10, while still providing the benefit of a runoff guard when the dock leveler 10 is not being utilized to obtain access to anadjacent carrier. To prevent the inadvertent operation of the releasing means 60 or the center plate pivoting means 70 when the dock leveler 10 is not in use, the lever arm 84 of the preferred embodiment is removably connected to the mechanical linkage72 by the lever tube 82 discussed above. As such, and with the dock leveler 10 locked in its upright rearward position, the lever arm 84 may be removed and stored in a convenient location for future use.
The dock leveler embodied herein preferably includes lip plate extension means mounted on the lip plate for pivoting the lip plate toward the extended position as the center plate is pivoted in the forward direction from the upright rearwardposition. While a variety of lip plate extension means are available, the preferred embodiment of the lip plate extension means is of the type originally presented in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/645,609.
The lip plate extension means 90 of the preferred embodiment includes an extension bar 92 and a stop member 94. It should be noted that these elements are only shown in FIG. 1, for clarity, since a more detailed disclosure of the lip plateextension means 90 is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/645,609. Generally, however, the extension bar 92 has a first end pivotably connected to lip plate 30 and a freely swinging second end. The extension bar 92 is adapted to engagethe stop member 94 when the center plate 20 is in the upright rearward position, and to pivot the lip plate 30 toward the extended position when the center plate 20 is pivoted forward from the upright rearward position. Preferably, the stop member 94 isangled, such that the extension bar 92 disengages from the stop member 94 in a searing action when the center plate 20 reaches a predetermined pivotal position.
The overall operation of the apparatus of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. FIG. 2 illustrates the dock leveler 10 in a standard stored position with the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72disengaged from center plate 20. To move the dock leveler 10 into its upright rearward position, an operator inserts the lever arm 84 into the lever tube 82 and pulls the lever arm 84 in a rearward direction. The rearward movement of the lever arm 84causes the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 to engage the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 proximate the second edge 26. As the rearward movement of the lever arm 84 is continued, the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 ridesdown the center plate 20 toward the first edge 24 and the center plate 20 pivots into its upright rearward position, as shown in FIG. 3(a). It is noted that the lip plate 30 simultaneously pivots rearwardly into its predetermined retracted position.
Similarly, the second end 46 of the locking bar 42 swings toward the bottom surface 22 of the center plate 20 as the center plate 20 is pivoted in the rearward direction. As the center plate 20 reaches the upright rearward position, the secondend 46 of the locking bar 42 swings into abutting engagement with the stop member 50 and the extension member 48 contacts the forward edge 56 of the stop member 50 to prevent overswinging of the locking bar 42. At this point, the center plate 20 iseffectively braced against pivotal movement in the forward direction, such that the dock leveler 10 may operate as a runoff guard. If desired, the manually-operable lever arm 84 may then be removed from the lever tube 82 to ensure the locking means 40is not inadvertently released.
If, however, it is desired to move the dock leveler 10 from the upright rearward position shown in FIG. 3(a) to either the bridging position of FIG. 5 or standard stored position of FIG. 2, the operator simply pushes forward on the lever arm 84. The forward movement of the lever arm 84 initially causes the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 to disengage from center plate 20 and engage the first paddle 62. Continued forward movement of the lever arm 84 pivots the first paddle 62 of thereleasing means 60, which simultaneously pivots the second paddle 64 into engagement with the locking bar 42, as seen in FIG. 4(b). The locking bar 42 subsequently swings out of abutting engagement with the stop member 50, and the lever arm 84 engagesthe outward extension of the hinge pin to pivot the center plate 20 in the forward direction. Once the second end 76 of the mechanical linkage 72 disengages from the first paddle 72, the biasing means 68 returns the two paddles to their initialpositions. The lip plate extension means 90 extends the lip plate 30 as the center plate 20 pivots in the forward direction such that the lip plate 30 may either engage an adjacent carrier bed, as seen in FIG. 5, or return to its intermediate, standardstored position, as seen in FIG. 2.
It should be understood that a kit may likewise be provided for retrofitting a conventional dock leveler having a center plate and a lip plate to enable the conventional dock leveler to operate as a runoff guard. In accordance with the presentinvention, the kit includes the locking means and releasing means described in detail above. As embodied herein, the kit may further include the preferred center plate pivoting means and lip plate extension means, if desired. The kit of the presentinvention simply need be attached to a dock leveler having a center plate and a lip plate to provide the benefits of a runoff guard which may be operated without inducing back strain on the operator.
It is envisioned that a runoff guard may be configured to preclude access to the edge of the loading dock platform, or even the dock leveler itself. Such a runoff guard configuration would not be dependent upon the operation of the dock leveler. Examples of embodiments of this alternative runoff guard may include, but are not limited to, a retractable chain or cable adapted to be extended a predetermined distance above the exposed edge of the loading dock platform, or a gate-like assembly whichmay be raised or lowered to selectively permit or obstruct access to the exposed edge.
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the dock leveler operating apparatus and kit of present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. Thus,it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of the invention which come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.

One of the most common questions I get asked when I go out on a job is “Do you make a living from this?” The ‘this’ in question is photography, and the answer, of course, is yes. Thankfully.
But it hasn’t been easy, and if you’re just starting out in the world freelance photography then you might be finding it tough, too.
If I’d decided to stay in my home town – hell, even my own country – then starting my own business would’ve been much easier in comparison. I would have had a strong network of friends and former colleagues, I would have had a strong credit rating to fall back on for loans and financing of equipment, and I would have been able to communicate in my own language and therefore understand the needs of my clients. But instead I went travelling, spent all my cash, and eventually settled down in Denmark.
I’d be lying if I said I’d not made a single mistake or error of judgement. There’ve been days and nights where I’ve just thought, fuck it, I’ll just move home and get a ‘proper’ job. For instance, one job I did ended up costing me money, because the cost to park outside the venue was more money than I made all night. I came home feeling like shit, especially because my partner was pregnant and my in-laws were visiting for the weekend. I had to borrow money to pay the rent and the work didn’t seem to be improving.
Then one day I reached out to a friend. Dom Romney and I studied together in Sheffield and he had gone on to have a fantastic career as a motorsport photographer. He takes pictures for Top Gear magazine, Formula 1, and dozens of automobile firms around the world. His advice got me on the path to forging my own successful career and business has been booming ever since.
So instead of sitting on this fine advice I thought it was about time I shared some of the most important bits with you.
Without these I don’t know where I’d be today. Quite simply the best FREE advice for photographers out there and available from photoshelter.com For over two years now I’ve been downloading as many of these babies as possible: Pricing your Work; Email Marketing for Photographers; Social Media for Photographers, and so on and so on. Their guides are in PDF format and easy on the eye, so you don’t get bored to death whilst reading them. They’re created and updated regularly, so you can be sure that the info is as up to date as possible. After 18 months I decided it was time to give them some cash and they now host my main website, photographybymatthewjames.com. Which leads me nicely on to my next point…
This one really is a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised how many people get it wrong. Whatever your age, competence, or opinion about the worldwide web, this is the place people go to do their research. Therefore this is the place where you have to shine and sell yourself to your potential clients.
There are a multitude of options out there to design a site yourself (cheaper but can be time consuming and difficult to get the site working fast and smooth), or hire a pro or someone fresh out of college. All you really need to do is choose the content and be able to make changes whenever necessary. You don’t want the web designer on holiday in Borneo when you really need to upload a new portfolio. Choose only the best pictures to display there (quality not quantity) and have a short but sweet Biography page that promotes you as a person, but also talks about what you can offer your clients. Don’t overload it with crap and make sure every link works and every picture loads quickly. A slow site will lose you customers in a heartbeat.
Make sure your contact page is clear, easy to find, and in full working order. Funnily enough, I once saw the results of a survey which stated that Editorial clients don’t want to see an Enquiry Form on your Contact page. When I finally added one I started receiving more enquiries for jobs, even though my telephone, email, and social media details were all there. So include everything.
Finally, make sure it’s looking good and working perfectly before you officially launch it. Ask friends and family to take a look using different internet browsers and ask them to note down any broken links, missing images, or slow pages. You can make any necessary adjustments before you spring it on the world, and regularly check back on it and update it as your career progresses. A stale website is a dull place to be.
This can be very difficult to decide, because you might be good at one thing, but realise there’s a market for something else. I trained and worked as an editorial photographer, but once I went freelance I discovered it was hard to find regular and well-paid work in this field. So I took any job I could find, like weddings, parties, events etc. In the beginning this works fine, but make sure you can still find the time to photograph the things you want to be recognised and hired for in the long term. Keep adding these images to your portfolio and website, and keep marketing them whenever and wherever. If you carry on doing every job that comes your way you’ll never stand out from the crowd, and you’ll be just another Jack of All Trades, Master of None.
Gradually I realised that my passions were Portraits, Sport and Corporate Photography, and these now make up the bulk of my jobs. I still get emails asking me to cover events, parties and weddings – and I’m more than happy to do them – I just don’t really promote the fact that I do. People can see from your work that you’re a good photographer and they’ll decide whether to contact you or not.
Go out and meet people. Definitely get a few hundred business cards made up, but don’t hand them out willy-nilly. Most people will throw them away without ever looking at them; instead choose that one person who sounds genuinely interested in what you do and sounds like they might require your services (or know someone who does) in the near future. Ask for theirs, too, so you can send them a gentle reminder again a few days later.
Social Networking is also hugely important. This is a chapter for another day, but experiment with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other channels. Your customers might not be using all of them, but there are advantages and disadvantages to each and every one, and even I’m still finding this out.
Rosh Sillars is a great guy to turn to if you’re looking for more networking and marketing info. His website and podcasts are always full of interesting and useful content, and I make sure to tune in as I cycle in to the office. A 20 minute fix of Rosh gets my mind pondering the endless possibilities of Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and it feels nice to have someone in your corner.
Definitely a tough area to figure out and most of us still are. Many photographers and marketing experts have pretty much the same opinion, though: don’t undervalue your work.
The best place to start is by looking at your competitors – what are they charging and why. Let’s take a look at two types of wedding photography as an example, using two real case studies. Photographer A – let’s call him Martin, because that’s his real name – charges a staggering $2000 for just one picture! He has people queuing at his stall during wedding fairs (people with plenty of cash), and he’s happy to walk around bragging about his awards, prices and number of clients. He also dresses very very simply and actually reminds me of a farmer. Lots of other wedding photographers look up to him and, to be honest, he knows it.
But the difference is, his work is fantastic and totally original. In his own words, he creates a work of art. A picture that could easily hang on an Art Gallery wall and sell for thousands (dollars, that is) so naturally he charges that price to his clients. It’s likely that these same clients also hire a second photographer to cover the rest of the day and get all the normal shots of the service and cake cutting etc.
But Martin can sell them something that nobody else can and therefore he’s unique. He’s free to charge whatever he thinks he can get.
Photographer B on the other hand will document the whole wedding, from start to finish, on her own, carrying a load of equipment around and trying to capture everything that happens. Afterwards there’ll be at least a thousand images to go through and edit before handing over the final batch a few weeks later. The price is the same.
So which one are you? Which one do you want to be? Maybe you’re neither of these people and you do things entirely differently. Either way, the one thing you aren’t is Walmart or Amazon. You can’t offer a bulk service where you send out a dozen photographers to a dozen weddings each Saturday – your time and expertise is the value here and should be charged accordingly. If you decide to always charge less than everybody else then you’ll always be known as that guy. Clients will recommend you to their friends as a cheap photographer, and you’ll be working every hour under the sun just to make ends meet. Clients who don’t value your work and prices don’t value you.
If you want to make it as a professional (and full time) photographer then you need to set your prices accordingly so you don’t go out of business. So below I’ve described a basic formula that will help you arrive at your price.
This is your first port of call. To calculate this you need to add up all your expected costs for the entire year. It can be a bit daunting at first, especially if you have no idea (just like I did). You should definitely include the following:
Internet, phone bill, insurance, office rent (or you can even include a percentage of your house rent if you work from home)
Now you need to decide how many hours / days you want to work per year. By work I actually mean days of physically taking pictures. I usually say 100 days, based on a five-day week. This works out at two days per week (1.9 to be precise), which leaves me with three days to edit, write a blog, tackle emails, pay bills, create invoices, update my website, network (face-to-face and Social Media) and all the other things I need to do to keep the business running smoothly. You can’t shoot five days a week and expect to find time for everything else that needs doing, including relaxing!
So now all you need to do is take the CODB figure and divide it by 100 to arrive at your absolute minimum call-out fee. But remember, this fee only covers your expenses for the business and not your own wages and profits.
To arrive at this figure is much simpler. You can either add up all your living costs – mortgage / rent, food, loan, fuel bills etc – or you can choose an annual salary that you’ve easily survived on in the past. Remember – don’t start too big when just starting out. Chances are you were on a trainee wage when you started out at a previous job and it went up over time. Apply the same methods here.
Finally, if you want you can add a profit percentage that you’d like to achieve. No harm in this, but don’t be too greedy in the beginning. 25 per cent is a realistic and achievable figure.
This final amount tells you what the minimum charge per job should be if you want to survive and continue next year. It’s not a lot, really, though some people might not want to pay it. You have two options here: A) Decline the job B) Negotiate a price based on their budget, but make sure you remove parts of your service to accomodate it. For example, spend less time on the job, or deliver fewer images etc. Even though you might not have made enough money on this job, you’ll probably make it back somewhere else to balance it out. Just don’t go crazy when reducing the price. Your prices are set for a very good reason.
Man, there’s a lot of stuff we’ve just covered there. I’m hoping that you find most of it useful, even if you knew some of it already.
You’re always more than welcome to contact me and ask me any questions regarding getting in to freelance photography. Or alternatively, sign up to my newsletter and receive updates every few months so you don’t miss out on future blog posts.
I should sign off by saying a huge thank you to Dom Romney, the Photoshelter team, Wonderful Machine, and marketing guru Rosh Sillars. You can follow any of these people / companies in all the usual places and get more detailed tips and advice from those who know it best.

After a long day, there is nothing quite like slipping into your white cotton pajamas and relaxing for the evening. They might have one of the several monogram variations (one to three letters) or they could be plain. Either way, these pajamas are completely yours, and they represent complete comfort.
“Everyday wellness is about taking care of yourself and feeling good, everyday — and every night,” By Beth Ricanati, M.D. writes in The Huffington Post. “It doesn’t just mean eating right and exercising. It also means finding small, simple ways to take care of ourselves and feel good about ourselves. And here’s one of the simplest ways out there: Upgrade your pajamas.”
To start, they are comfortable. There is a reason you turn to your Victorian style nightgown for luxurious sleep. It keeps your body at the right temperature and feels soft on your skin. Leaning back on your boudoir pillow, you can feel at ease while you read, write, or doze off. And when you wake up in the morning, you won’t want to take your pajamas off.
Quality pajamas make you feel luxurious. Your bedroom is your palace. You decorate it how you want and spend your most restorative hours there. There is a reason it’s called “beauty sleep.” You deserve to feel lovely and luxurious while you lounge in your pajamas.
These pieces of clothing also last for a long time. Once you find a white cotton nightgown that you love, you won’t need to give it up or replace it any time soon. By investing in a pair of pajamas rather than settling for a generic brand, you are gifting yourself years of comfortable and luxurious sleep. When you can look and feel your best everyday for years, you can make bedtime the best part of your day.
Whether you are an early riser or night owl, you deserve a Victorian style nightgown or white nightie to spend time wearing. This fabric and style will make you feel beautiful and comfortable, taking your self care routine to the next level.
If your best friend in the entire world is getting married soon, you should start thinking about what you’re going to get her for a present (or two). Keep in mind, however, that you don’t have to only get her one thing or even two! You can always come back to any of these ideas and give her a “just because” gift another time. But for now, these gift ideas should be perfect for any wedding present.
Ladies nightgowns — Everyone should have a few ladies nightgowns in their closet and if your friend doesn’t at this point, they will definitely appreciate the gift. Getting your friend some nice white cotton pajamas will be an excellent gift, and you might even find a few pairs for yourself!
Freshly cleaned sheets — Roughly three-quarters of people admit that they are much more comfortable at night on sheets with a fresh scent. Don’t let your best friend sleep on dirty bed sheets anymore, either get them cleaned yourself or just buy new ones altogether.
Boudoir pillows — You don’t just have to get a single boudoir pillow as your only gift, but buying your best friend pillows and boudoir pillow cases will make for a wonderful wedding present.
Embroidered hand towels — To add to your perfect best friend wedding care package, consider tossing in some high quality embroidered hand towels.
Tickets to a popular play — Buying your friend items is fine, but getting her something that she and her partner can actually experience is a great idea. Take a look at upcoming shows in your area and find one that’s perfect for the happy couple.
Nice picture frames — There will clearly be hundreds of excellent photos over the next few weeks, so getting high quality picture frames is a perfect gift idea.
Engraved wine glasses — You can never go wrong with wine glasses for any occasion. Get some nice engraved wine glasses for your best friend and hopefully she’ll pour you some, too.

Cotton sleepwear will help you achieve a better night’s sleep, which is key to your health and wellness. According to research, you get a better night’s sleep on cotton sheets and in cotton sleepwear than in fabric that is made from synthetic fibers. This is because cotton naturally allows your skin to breathe and doesn’t trap heat under the covers. Everyone deserves and needs 8 hours of sleep a night, so why not make every night’s sleep as restful as you can get it in the fabric that has stood up to the test of time:
Lightweight, comfortable cotton pajamas will make you look and feel lovely. Pair them with some high thread count cotton sheets, and you will never want to leave your bed. Remember that it isn’t just your skin telling you that you should be sleeping in cotton, but there are science-backed reasons that sing the praises of this fabric.
Whether your daughter prefers a more simple style or an elegant dress with ruffles or lace, be sure that she will be comfortable all day long in these extra soft cotton dresses.
Healthy Skin: A study by the Sleeping Council found that cotton allows your skin to breathe and doesn’t trap sweat. It is also less likely to scratch and irritate the skin.
Clean Fabrics: Cotton does not trap oils and odors like other fabrics, so you can feel fresh and clean while sleeping in your favorite pajamas. And when you do wash them, they are easy to care for.
Trusted Durability: The material of cotton is strong, as the fibers bind together well. This is especially true for fabrics with higher thread count, so always opt for quality.
No Cling: You won’t have to worry about waking up surrounded by static cling. You can slip out of bed as easily as you slipped into it.
When you slip on your white cotton nightgown or white nightshirt at night, you know that it is time for a restful evening and luxurious rest. By choosing sleepwear made from high quality cotton, you can truly enjoy all the above cotton benefits. It is also important to consider the fit of your pajamas, as you want them to hang loosely without falling off. By keeping these factors in mind, you can select the best cotton sleepwear for your needs.
There is a reason that white cotton nighties were a favorite for Victorian pajamas and are still used today. Resting in your white cotton nightgown will help you feel fresh and rejuvenated, transforming your nightly ritual into something more beautiful. Once you buy a pair of cotton pajamas for yourself, you might just find yourself buying them for everyone else.
Enjoy the perks of our cotton, and shop now for you, a friend, grandmother or mom. They will enjoy them for years and years to come.

From frilly silk blouses to retro 70’s chic, vintage dressing can give you a chance to dress up or down with a style all your own. There is a trick though, to making it look like high fashion and dressing with intent rather than just wearing old clothes that don’t sync with today’s trends. Make sure you know how to combine true vintage, with modern clothing to give yourself a look that is uniquely you!
It’s all in how far you go. If you’re going for a 50s look, give your outfit a 50s flair. Don’t do shoes, bag, blouse, skirt AND hair. Choose one or two pieces that hit the chosen decade, and mix them up with something from today. As Glamour recommends, keep the other pieces simple, for example a simple black blouse, and slacks paired with a funky 50s coat and bag give a boost of vintage without looking like you’re playing dress up.
From changing buttons, to adding a modern belt or layering, making just a tiny change can take a vintage look from drab to, you guessed it, fab! If you find an amazing dress but the length isn’t right, or it features shoulder pads that make you look like a well-known linebacker, take them to a local tailor for an update. Shorter hems, necklines with a modern edge, or even a shorter sleeve can give new life to a retro look. But it does result in an inexpensive item from the thrift store suddenly costing significantly more, so make sure it’s something you’ll want to wear more than once.
Some people have an issue with shopping through second hand clothing stores, or dealing with the mothball smell of clothing from grandmother’s attic. But you can still go vintage with sweet details like embroidery, lace, and quality pure fabrics like cotton and linen. Pair a pretty short sleeved pajama top (like the one featured in this picture from Jacaranda Living) with a mini jeans skirt, or a favorite pair of jeans and a belt and you’ll have a touch of delicate vintage. As Diana Jone of becomegorgeous.com points out, many modern clothes feature lace, ribbons, bows, and ruffles that will give you an air of vintage and add a fun feminine look to your wardrobe.
Some people feel vintage is something you need to save for a special occasion. A wedding, an afternoon tea, or a holiday seems like the perfect opportunity to highlight a special look. But sneaking a bit of vintage into everyday can be a great way to stand out, while also fitting in. Consider a lacy pajama top under a sweater or jacket for the office.

Not everyone is a gifted crafter. Not everyone can bake, or has the time to make embroidered gifts. Sure, we love to receive homemade fudge, or a beautiful knitted sweater or afghan, but these days most people have a tough time finding the time to wrap gifts, let alone make unique items for family and friends.
But if you’re a crafter, and there are definitely a lot of you out there, Jacaranda Living has some great embroidered gift items or blank items to be embroidered that will fit right in with your desire to give something special to those you love. Think it’s too late? Not really.
Embroidered or hand painted items can be beautiful as gifts. Time may be running out to give a completed item by Christmas or Hannukah, but you can order the item and provide your recipient with a picture of the finished product. Then let them know you’ll be working hard during the winter to create their gift.
Whether you’re embroidering a cosmetic bag for a friend, or a tissue box for a co-worker, or a pair of slippers for a favorite aunt, Jacaranda Living has a variety of blank pieces ready to embroider that will work perfectly.
Not sure where to find the unique patterns that will make your gift the one they treasure? Consider Mary Corbet’s Needle ‘n Thread blog. She’s got great ideas for a variety of designs and even shows you how to use coloring books for inspiration. With so many coloring books out there for adults, you may even be able to ask the person you’re making something for to share their favorite design and you can turn it into an embroidered piece!
If you like painting, why not try fabric painting to create a one-of-a-kind gift for someone special? Look for videos on YouTube that show how to paint flowers, and other designs on bed sheets, scarves, and tablecloths. Jacaranda Living has quality cotton napkins, robes, and pillow cases that would work well for this type of project.
Just search for “one stroke painting” on YouTube to find a wide variety of projects from easy to complex.
Not the type to sit and embroider or paint? Don’t worry, Jacaranda Living can still be your path to giving a unique, embroidered gift to treasure for years to come. From baby gifts to bed linens to ladies’ nightgowns and dresses for the little girls in your life, we’ve got a range of embroidered and monogrammed items made of high quality cotton
Consider a pretty set for the littlest member of your family, perhaps booties, a hat, a bib and a onesie all embroidered with little sheep.
Who doesn’t love a cool cotton boudoir pillow and you can have it embroidered with a wide selection of designs including this pretty Nantucket basket of flowers.
Or put together a picnic basket of goodies featuring these fun lobster embroidered cocktail napkins that would be a hit with anyone who likes to plan an outing with just a bit more flair than the usual.
Embroidered linens and handmade gifts show you’ve thought about the person you’re giving to. Whether the gift is something you’ve created, or something you’ve had created just for them. If you’re shopping for gifts and want something personal, consider Jacaranda Living. We’ve got gifts that show people how much you care.

Does your family have Christmas Traditions already in place? For many, the holidays are a time to start new Christmas traditions that will be enjoyed and treasured by your family as it grows! A few of our favorite traditions include:
If your family attends church on Christmas Eve, the reindeer can stop by the house to leave Christmas pajamas, slippers and robes for the whole family. Include a little note from the reindeer with a few tips
thank them for taking care of their assigned elf (if your family enjoys the christmas traditions of Elf on a Shelf)
While superhero and princess inspired pjs are great for the little ones, consider our comfortable Kelsey Pajamas for the ladies of the household. Finish the outfit with our sweet scuffy slippers embroidered for the season with wreaths, snowflakes, and even a Christmas Tree! We’ve got 10 Holiday designs to give our slippers a true Christmas Eve touch.
sweet embroidery designs that feature favorite Christmas Carols, another of many Christmas Traditions
And speaking of cookies for Santa, why not make Christmas cookies a tradition? Whether yours are a family tradition, like Pizzelle, pfeffernusse, or pepperkakor, making the perfect Christmas cookie takes time and can become a fun competition each year with other family and friends. Who has the best cookie? Sites like allrecipe.com and bettycrocker.com have 100’s of recipes to choose from if your family doesn’t already have a favorite. Ours would be this recipe for Soetkoekies (sweet cookies) from South Africa which can be found on food.com.
Yield: 80-90 cookies. The dough should be rolled out really thinly — about 1/6th of an inch — to get a crispy cookie.
1/2 cup sweet sherry or 1/2 cup muscatel or 1/2 cup madeira wine or 1/2 cup port wine, but you may need up to 3/4 cup of the sweet wine
Whisk the eggs, add just 1/2 cup sweet wine to the eggs, then stir into the dry mixture until well-blended. Add more wine sparingly if too dry. Mix until it forms a fairly stiff dough. The dough should be easy to handle.
Remove dough from bowl, kneading until smooth, then, on a floured surface, roll out to a thin sheet (1/6th of an inch). This will need to be done in batches.
Using your favorite holiday cookie cutters, cut cookies and place carefully on the greased sheets. Bake in batches in the preheated oven.
Use the center rack in the oven, as cookies burn easily on the bottom, especially if you use dark sheets.
Check cookies after 5 minutes being careful not to let them burn. Cooking time can vary depending on oven and size of cookie but is usually about 7 minutes.
There are so many recipes for holiday cookies, and so many different ways to make them your own. Make the search for this year’s recipe part of your holiday fun! Have young chefs in the household? Consider Kiddie and Ladies Aprons from Jacaranda as a pre-holiday gift to help everyone get in the mood.
Many households celebrate both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and it can get pretty hectic preparing two celebrations with food, dishes, planning, and cleaning up! Why not make Christmas Eve the time to get takeout. Whether you go Chinese, Mexican, hearty soups and fresh baked bread, or try something entirely new, researching menus, and deciding what you’ll share this year can become an annual ritual in the weeks leading up to the big day.
Whatever you do for the holidays, make sure to enjoy the time together with family and friends. Life is stressful and at busy times, when to-do lists seem endless, it can be easy to forget the reason for the holiday, and get overwhelmed with making certain everything is perfect. Give yourself a chance to sit, relax, and savor those you love. It’ll give you a chance to breathe, and to create memories that will sweeten over the years.
At Jacaranda Living we’d love to help create your Christmas Traditions and make your holidays a time to remember. Get your order in now while there is still plenty of time to embroider and ship your gifts wherever you’ll be celebrating this year!

Whether you’re celebrating an empty nest, an autumn wedding, or just extending a homecoming celebration because you want to, girls’ getaway weekends are the perfect way to kick back, relax, and let your inner circle know how much you appreciate them. A special gift to commemorate your weekend getaway; a matching nighshirt or scuffies for poolside, or even a cute cosmetic bag can be a reminder of a fun weekend away, and let your friends know how much they mean to you.
Abby Draper of The Huffington Post’s Blog reminds us, “every woman needs a good ‘girls weekend’ every so often.” The one thing all the above ideas have in common is a shared history or experience among the guests. If you’re the weekend planner, don’t sweat. It doesn’t need to be a “destination weekend” and can even just be a slumber party in your own neighborhood, as long as everyone is getting away from home, work, and a break from the norm.

New research from the science of positive psychology has found a number of practical exercises you can do to boost your happiness and decrease your depression.
A new study has found that during the difficult changes of later life -- moving into residential care and losing a certain level of independence -- an acceptance of what can't be changed is a major predictor of life satisfaction.
Researchers at Deakin University in Australia found that when it comes to life satisfaction in one's later years, the ability to accept what cannot be changed is equally important to the feeling of being able to exert control over one's life.
Without realising it, many of our thought habits get in the way of our happiness and cause us to get stuck into negative patterns of thinkin

Visit top attractions of Ho Chi Minh City on this half-day private sightseeing tour of Vietnam’s largest city. Choose a different itinerary depending on your selection (morning or afternoon tour). With a professional guide you’ll discover historical sites, cultural centers, museums and markets of Chinatown (Cholon) or the French Quarter. Travel by private car and get oriented to the city formerly known as Saigon! Round-trip hotel transport and a Vietnamese meal are included.
The tour itself was great, but the guide we had spoke English with such a strong Veitnamese accent we weren't able to understand much of what he tried to tell us.
This review is the subjective opinion of the person who shared it and not necessarily of Bucketlist City
Your friendly and knowledgeable guide and driver will meet you at your hotel in Ho Chi Minh City and take you by private vehicle to see the highlights of former Saigon. Depending on which sightseeing tour you select (see descriptions below), you’ll be introduced to a mix of French colonial architecture and Chinese influences as you visit temples, markets, museums and other landmarks.
Enjoy a complimentary lunch or dinner of delicious Vietnamese cuisine, with your choice of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) or banh xeo (Vietnamese pancake). After your half-day tour, your guide will deliver you back to your hotel.
Option 1: Morning Tour (Chinatown: Binh Tay Market, Thien Hau Temple and War Remnants Museum)After hotel pickup, your private guide will take you to District 5 to immerse you in the bustling life of Chinatown. Experience the vibrant rhythm of one of Ho Chi Minh City’s busiest and most colorful areas — Binh Tay Market. At this major hub for local merchants, watch Vietnamese farmers barter for goods.
Next is Thien Hau Temple, built in the early 19th century. The temple is dedicated to Thien Hau, the goddess of seafarers, for her protection during Chinese migration to Vietnam. Visit the pagoda’s shrines and shops in the center of Chinatown, where the Hoa (Chinese minority) reside.
The last stop on your private tour is the War Remnants Museum, which relates to the American phase of the Vietnam War. See displays of old military equipment and other related objects as well as larger exhibits including an F5A fighter and a UH1-Huey helicopter.
Option 2: Afternoon Tour (French Quarter: Reunification Palace, Saigon Notre-Dame Basilica, Central Post Office and Ben Thanh Market)After hotel pickup, your private tour begins at the century-old Reunification Palace, which witnessed the growth of Ho Chi Minh City during peacetime and throughout the Vietnam War until its end in 1975.
Continue to the nearby French colonial area, including a stop at the impressive Saigon Notre-Dame Basilica, a famous cathedral located in Paris Square. Discover the magnificent neo-Romanesque architecture as you take in the tranquil atmosphere inside.
At the opposite Central Post Office, one of the oldest buildings in Ho Chi Minh City, learn about this significant landmark — the busiest post office in Vietnam. Admire the neoclassical-style of the post office interior as your guide points out the painted maps of former Saigon, once the capital of South Vietnam.
Take a look at the embroidery workshop of XQ Vietnam Company before a visit to Ben Thanh Market, a lively market in District 1, where your guide can help you barter for goods.

All Nick Norton wants is to stay on the straight and narrow…and never get caught stealing again. Then he lays eyes on her: Stella Peretti—100 percent sexy and absolutely irresistible. Especially when he sees her smooth moves lifting a two-karat diamond. Nick realizes he’s found the sparkling woman of his dreams—one so perfect for him it’s almost criminal.
The Shimmy Shimmy Bangs are master jewel thieves who are planning the heist of the century. And Shimmy leader, Stella, isn’t about to let anyone—even if he is a hunky, tatted-up studmuffin—get in her way. But when two of her girls are put out of commission, Stella realizes that Nick isn’t just a red-hot distraction. He might be the answer to her pilfering prayers.
Now, Nick and Stella are putting everything on the line for one last job. But when two thieves have this much chemistry, it’s only a matter of time before somebody’s heart gets stolen.
Two hours later, I was standing in a department store in Palm Desert, wearing gray dress pants, a pair of Italian loafers that squeaked when I walked, a light blue button-up shirt, and . . .
When she’d picked them out, I’d said, “Oh, fuck no,” but as she stood in front of me outside the men’s dressing room, buttoning them into the slacks and making helpless groans and moans, I knew I didn’t have the strength to tell her no for real. At this rate, I’d be buying dipped fruit and suspenders for the rest of my life, and honestly . . .
I was psyched about it. When I turned to check myself out in the mirror, I realized the suspenders didn’t look so bad. Not at all. They looked sharp. Old-fashioned in the right way, like out of Peaky Blinders. But I was an ex-con who weighed 275 pounds and drove a motorcycle. I couldn’t be wearing suspenders, for Chrissake.
“It’s a big ask, Stella,” I said, eyeing her as she riffled through a rack of dress shirts. Over her shoulder was a dog carrier bag she’d brought with her, pink-and-white with black paw prints. Priscilla had nodded off and was slowly sliding down into the bag, her lip stuck on the top edge.
Stella froze with one finger perched on a hanger hook as she chewed an enormous chunk of apple, moving it around in her mouth so that it expanded the inside of her cheek. “I know,” she said, with her palm covering her overstuffed mouth. “But just look at you.”
As she said it, a woman approached, pushing a stock cart. When she glanced in my direction, she promptly drove the cart right into a mannequin, and its arm popped off. That, in turn, knocked over a second mannequin, which knocked over a third. Everything the lady did just made it all so much worse. I stepped in to stop the domino-mannequin effect, while Stella stood next to the shirts with a big told you so smile on her face. The woman clutched an arm and a foot, and stared at me, as I tried to reposition a mannequin in a fuzzy track suit on its stand.
“Oh sir, that ensemble is very nice!” she cooed, with big Bambi eyes. Her gaze went from my tattoos to the suspenders, to the pants, and back again.
Stella circled back around a table covered with dress shirts, and I saw that in her hand she was holding a fedora—like a stylish hipster sort of thing. Not my jam at all.
“Oh no you don’t,” I growled, teasing her, trying to snatch it out of her hands. But she pressed her body up against mine, and instinctively I pulled her into me. She took advantage of me being a fucking sucker for her body, and put the hat on my head. Her eyes lit up, and she leaned back in my arms. Then she said to the salesgirl. “What do you think?”
The salesgirl didn’t even speak. Just dropped a plastic mannequin arm and smiled. Stella made a long, adorable, “Mmmhmmmm!” as she slipped from my grasp, and headed off toward cocktail dresses.
Once I’d changed, and made was sure the woman wasn’t going to knock over another row of mannequins, I followed along behind Stella, weaving and dodging between racks and displays. Stella held up a stunning little black dress, classy and with a slit up a side that was mouthwatering even on the hanger. But then, behind her, there it was. The dress. Little black dresses were fine, but we were going out on the town for our first real date, and that dress was the one. A showstopper. So I shook my head at the black one in her hand, and Stella rumpled up her eyebrows. She put the dress back on the rack, plunged her hand into her purse, and emerged holding the apple on its stick. She took a bite, and stuck it back in its bag, and turned her attention to a strapless red number that would’ve looked great on her, no doubt. But still, it wasn’t the dress.
I tickled her side to get her attention, and when she turned to me, I pointed behind her, at a two-story atrium. The mannequin was set up on a round platform, with a spotlight on it, next to a piano that wasn’t being played. The dress was nothing but rhinestones, with thin jeweled straps coming up from a plunging neckline.
Stella hooted and approached the dress while laughing and shaking her head. “I can’t possibly wear this,” she said, and ran her fingertips over the jeweled front. “I’m not sure anybody can wear this.”
I took the first dress off the nearby rack and held it up. The tag said XS/S. Seemed about right. I held it out, imagining her in it. The very idea made me start to get hard. I let it dangle from my finger and waited for her to take it.
She grabbed the size tag of the dress I was holding. A huge laugh shot out of her mouth, echoing around the marble foyer. “Oh you,” she said, shaking her head, and then grabbed the dressed marked M/L. She took the dog bag off her shoulder, and I transferred it to mine. Priscilla was out cold, snoring softly. I gave her tummy a little scratch as Stella headed off to the ladies’ fitting rooms.
While she was gone, I picked out a gorgeous light-pink teddy for her, and a pair of black panties that had a red ribbon up the back, corset-style. I was thinking through what it’d be like to pull that ribbon off with my teeth while she had them on when my phone buzzed in my pocket.
I can’t stop thinking and talking about this clever story! Read my review of Shimmy Bang Sparkle here:
Shimmy Bang Sparkle is wicked sexy fun from cover to cover, with enough tension to keep you riveted, enough heat to set your Kindle on fire, a heavy dose of heart, and a lot of humor. I read it on a road trip and missed most of the scenery because I couldn’t put it down. I also sprinted past my data limit and kept on going.
SBS has a unique storyline–a comedic, romantic, sometimes emotional contemporary Robin Hood tale with a gutsy female as the lead. There are hilarious, relatable, well-developed primary and secondary characters, and if that isn’t enough, there’s also an adorable dog. It’s a non-stop adventure, in alternating POV, with masterful banter and hilarious internal monologues.
Nick and Stella are a perfect match: sexy, passionate, and smart. From the moment they meet, their chemistry is off the charts. Fans of “insta-love” may object, but Nick falls fast and hard for Stella, for some very good reasons: he respects her, admires her, and understands her. He is willing to risk his freedom to give Stella the life she deserves, and Stella is willing to do the same.
The stakes are also high for Stella, who’s left to pull off the heist without her usual partners-in-crime, the Shimmy Shimmy Bangs. But Nick is a perfect companion for busy days of plotting and planning, and for hot, hot desert nights full of passion and romance.
I don’t want to spoil any surprises – and there are plenty of them in this wonderful read – so all I will say is if you want a perfect, funny, fast-paced, and suspenseful summer romantic read, look no further. Five sexy stars.

Dennis Port, MA, December 12, 2016 – The Cape Cod Community Media Center is pleased to announce the launch of new, local, community based news programming with the addition of longtime Cape Cod reporter and broadcaster Sarah Colvin as News Director.
News programming at the Community Media Center will focus on the issues of importance to Cape Cod, including but not limited to municipal happenings, the economy, housing, the environment, and quality of life. “We know our community well and will strive to tell its stories in the best way possible, all in an effort to better inform our citizens and to promote civic engagement and involvement,” says Colvin.
“We are extremely happy to have Ms. Colvin join our Media Center team,” says Terry Duenas, Executive Director of the Cape Cod Community Media Center. “Sarah’s experience, integrity, and understanding of the critical importance of local, community based journalism will enrich our programming.”
Community media centers across the nation are stepping up to create community-based local news programming, to fill an important slot not covered by mainstream, corporate media.
“Community media is the answer to real, connected, important news coverage,” said John Nichols, national affairs correspondent for The Nation, during his keynote address at the August 2016 Alliance for Community Media National Conference held in Boston. Nichols urged community access centers nationwide to take charge and to create local, community-based news programming. “Local community access media has the power to tell the stories unlike any other organization,” Nichols said.

A amazing twist on the classic melon ball salad, it's sure to be a hit at your next summer cookout. Melons were among the earliest plants to be domesticated in both the Old and New Worlds. Early European settlers in the New World are recorded as growing honeydew and casaba melons as early as the 1600s. BTW, this post has left-sidebar enabled, as you can set sidebars on different side in each post's settings!
If you use olive oil for any recipe that’s cooked over 450°F, the oil will denature and you will get cancer. This post is irresponsible. You should only use grapeseed oil you’ve pressed yourself in a very cold room.
I followed this to the letter, except I substituted walnuts and tofu for the skirt steak, ditched the cheese entirely, and replaced the starch with a turnip salad. Turned out great. My seven-year-old boys have never seen a dessert and I’ve convinced them that walnut-and-turnip salad is “cake.” Thanks for the recipe!
I don’t have any of these ingredients at home. Could you rewrite this based on the food I do have in my house? I’m not going to tell you what food I have. You have to guess.
Wonderfully refreshing summer salad….even great in the middle of january while we’re dreaming of the warm weather.

I’m a lifestyle photographer based in Denver, Colorado. I photograph people in their natural environment being who they are and doing what they do; a runner running the city streets, a ski boot company CEO in the mountains, a couple in love, or a couple and their friends and family celebrating the couple’s love for and commitment to each other.
Trained as a photojournalist, my eye searches for several things when I’m shooting. Principally however, what I look for in my images is true emotion; nothing compares to the truth of two people who are genuinely in love. I do my best to convey the honesty and truth of your relationship by capturing moments in time where your love is visible, natural, and beautiful; moments and emotions that will bring joy over the years when you revisit them looking through your wedding photos. A wedding photographer’s challenge is not to simply record the event, but to record the emotions felt on that very special and emotional day.
Travel is one my absolute favorite things in the world, right alongside photography. So when I get the opportunity to travel for weddings I’m always ecstatic. Kallie and Ryan are locals here in Colorado and were planning their wedding where Kallie had spent most of her childhood, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. When they started looking […]
Autumn and Josh had a really fantastic wedding. Period. From start to finish, all the details were well thought-out and worked perfectly together. The ceremony and reception were at the Westin – Downtown Denver, which is not only gorgeous but a close walk to some great photo locations as you can see below. Both Dana and Ashely […]
There’s so much to be said about this wedding I’m not sure where to start. Whether it’s with Sarah and Steve’s ability to endure? Their amazing family and friends who rallied around them? Their amazing attitudes leading up to, during, and following what could have been, and actually was, a disaster wedding? or maybe just the […]
As far as classic Denver wedding venues go, the Oxford Hotel is among the best, and Herb and Elizabeth’s wedding was no disappointment. These two are such a cool couple – high energy and high style with their sheik yellow and grey wedding colors, worldly belt buckles, and adorably obedient-ish dogs. These guys ran me […]
Some really unfortunate events happened this week in Colorado – tons of cities are under water right now.

Any Sic Bo strategy might prove to be tricky. Is luck the only element involved or are skills needed in this game too? Read more to find out.
Low-risk and steady gamblers should always use bets with the smallest edge. Best edges in Sic Bo (2.78%) found in Small, Big and Combination bets. This strategy is perfect for beginners or for anyone who wishes to minimize their losses while getting the hang of the game.
The small and big bets are the most proximate to the Evens chances, making them ideal for the gambling system. The 1-3-2-4 system should be used, and the Paroli and 1-3-2-6 systems can also be considered. Using this strategy, players should place bets on either small or big for a fixed number of rolls. Judge if the results are alternate or consecutive, and then bet accordingly.
The combination bet is the betting of any two specific numbers which has a very low house edge (2.77%) but it is often overlooked. The odds against winning is 6 to 1 (meaning players can expect to win once in every 7 bets) and the payout is also 6 to 1. To play, set aside 15 betting units and place the combination bets and try to win two to three times. If this is done before the 15th bet is up, stop playing and leave with your winnings.
Its been one of those weird years for me. When, during the entire time you’re bitching and moaning about nothing happening, where you don’t think ANYTHING is really getting done, and you feel like you’re spinning your wheels the entire time.
Then, when you need to sit down and put something together as a sort of retrospect, you look back and go… WOAH! I did more than I thought! Its been a pretty good year!
I launched my Black Label line this year, and even though I didn’t do as much as I wished for now, I have a lot more in my back pocket planned for the future. I also entered a contest to try and create a new logo for the City of Philadelphia that I’m incredibly proud of! I got an awesome Ace of Spades design that, in turn, finally helped me form an idea for a playing card deck!
I did gig posters (on my own, mind you!) for Anvil and Arch Enemy, Between the Buried and Me, Devin Townsend, Kreator, Hole, Fear Factory, and Otep! WOAH! I just realized I did eight of these this year! I also almost got to meet Otep, but I met a lot of great people because of these posters, and had a ton of fun doing them!
I also put on an awesome art show in September, “Monsters in my Head“, at Digital Ferret in September! It was a lot of fun, and a LOT of work, to pull it off! I still plan on getting a book together of all the piece that were in the show, as well as a few that weren’t!
Also, I did my first album cover for the awesome pop-punk band from Colorado, Left Foot Green! Their album “Fun With Vengeance” should be out soon, and it sounds AWESOME!
As we go into December, I’m quite pleased with where things seem to be headed for me as an artist. I’ve got some new ideas and projects in the works, and the concepts in the past may soon blossom into great things!
For now, check out my new calendar, “The Artwork of Larry West”. For the first time ever, I sat down and actually created a full poster of my work! Head on over to my shop on ArtsProjekt run by Zazzle and check it out.

The Sphere Microcomputer marketed in 1975 was reported to have sold only about 1300 units making it a hard to acquire microcomputer for collectors. The Sphere did not gain adequate market share and had a short life as a commercial product. Sphere computers were designed by Michael Donald Wise and had some advanced features. The computer was sold in various configurations from a set of boards to a plug and play package that contained all the electronics, CRT and keyboard and looking modern for 1975. This computer was before the Apple 1 in 1976 and if it would have functioned as advertised it most likely would have been a popular computer.
One feature that Michael designed into the computer was the ability to reboot the computer by holding down 2 keys at the same time. This was the first for this kind of hard reboot . Now were have the (Ctrl-Alt- Delete) function & it is same idea of gaining control of your computer.
The Sphere computers in our collection use the 6800 microprocessor & have a keyboard, numeric pad and display all in one nice cabinet. The Sphere company folks had great aspirations for a whole family of computers from single board to a advanced system with built in floppy drives. It seems the whole process of design, production and delivery of a reliable computer on time did not happen. This main reason the company sold so few computers and went out of business in a short time. The Sphere company went the way many of the early microcomputer start up companies. They just did not have the funding, talent, marketing and a reliable product to attract customers. More then 600 small operations designed a computer and tried to make it big - most lasted a year or two. Some lasted many years however only the Apple company is still in business from the 70's as a computer company.
The computers were packed with great care and arrived with a complete set of manuals/documentation. I am delighted to have these Sphere computers and all the documentation that was furnished

Jeff Arrienda works for a number-crunching, paper-chasing 9-to-5 job. He’d rather play point for Barangay Ginebra or the Golden State Warriors, but lacked a growth spurt as an adolescent. Despite being glued to his room playing NBA 2K, he still manages to regularly shoot hoops with real people, mastering the art of no-call chops, shoves, and clotheslines every now and then. If you need to find him, check your regular barangay liga, he’s the guy at the end of the bench eating pizza.
Two-time NBA champ and back-to-back Finals MVP Kevin Durant spent a Sunday talking about his Nike journey, designing the KD11 with Leo Chang, and going for a 3-peat with new Warrior DeMarcus Cousins.

Armstrong County Commissioners signed a proclamation supporting October 2011 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Ms. JoEllen Bowman, Executive Director of HAVIN in Armstrong County attended the meeting to accept the proclamation.
In the past year in Armstrong County, HAVIN provided more than 694 domestic violence victims and their significant others with counseling services. Armstrong County’s HAVIN also provided shelter for more than 115 individuals totaling 3,268 days.
Ms. Bowman expressed her appreciation to the Board of Commissioners and members of the community for their continued support of HAVIN and the programs that they offer. She stated that this year the focus for the month will be child abuse and the connection between children raised in a home with abuse and the continued abuse they administer / endure in adult relationships. HAVIN hopes that by focusing on victims at a young age they can turn the dynamics around. October 24, 2011 will be Community Awareness Day; Ms. Bowman will be the coordinator this year and announced that the week will be filled with activities throughout the community.
She invited everyone to attend a fundraising event to be held October 22, 2011 from 11:00 am to 2:00 pm at Kittanning Township Fire Hall. The event is presented by EQT and will feature Pirates World Series Champions, Steve Blass 1971 and Grant Jackson 1979, along with Randy Grossman, a Steelers Superbowl Champ from 1974, 1975, 1978 and 1979. The fundraiser benefits HAVIN, Armstrong County Community Action Agency and Armstrong County Habitat for Humanity. Each group retains 100% of the proceeds from each ticket they sell. To request tickets that will benefit HAVIN or for more information please call their office at 724-543-1180.
Ms. Bowman also announced that HAVIN is selling chances to win 8 tickets, a parking pass and $250 cash to the Steelers vs. St. Louis Rams on December 24th at 1:00 pm. Tickets are $10.00 and the winner is based on the PA lottery evening number of November 28th.
The Armstrong County Board of Commissioners proclaimed October 2011 as Dignity & Respect Month in Armstrong County. The campaign was started by the Center for Inclusion at UPMC in November of 2008 and introduced to UPMC employees in an effort to promote inclusion through behavioral and organizational change.
The campaign has grown to include residents across the region, partnering with community leaders on efforts centered on multicultural awareness, workforce development and healthy communities. A calendar of thirty tips of Dignity & Respect is available with highlights on how participants can incorporate acts of dignity and respect in everyday life.
If you are interested in taking the pledge, viewing the thirty tips or learning more information, please log onto www.dignityandrespect.org or text RESPECT to 94253. Over 60,000 people have taken the pledge. What began as a work initiative to promote a culture of inclusion, dignity, and respect at UPMC, today is a movement promoting inclusion in the workplace, unison within the community and anti-bullying in schools.
On September 22nd, 2011 at the Public Meeting the Armstrong County Commissioners signed a proclamation adopting September 18 through 24, 2011 as Employ the Older Workers Week. The Board of Commissioners recognized the workforce contributions of older workers, and encouraged employers and workers of all ages to recognize the many ways in which older employees contribute to a successful working environment.
Ms. Debbie Reesman an Older Worker Employment Specialist with the Armstrong County Area Agency on Aging spoke at the meeting. She praised the older workers for the wealth of knowledge and experience they bring to their jobs. Ms. Reesman stated that the workers will be honored at a reception in October that will be attended by elected officials and employers.

At the September 1st Public Meeting of the Armstrong County Commissioners a proclamation was signed asking everyone to stop and remember the heroes and victims of September 11th. The Proclamation read as follows:
WHEREAS, In honor of the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, we ask you to STOP AND REMEMBER; and
WHEREAS, At 1:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on September 11th, 2011, all Americans are asked to cease all regular activity for one minute; and
WHEREAS, as bells and sirens ring out, take a moment to honor the victims of the worst terrorist attack on United States soil; and
WHEREAS, governments and businesses, houses of worship and railways, fire and police departments and others are called on to ring bells and sound sirens as we observe this Moment of Remembrance; and
WHEREAS, at the same time across the country 1:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, noon, Central Daylight Time, 11:00 a.m. Mountain Daylight Time and 10:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time – we call on you to reflect on the lives lost and those affected by the tragedies of 9/11; and
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT PROCLAIMED that the members of the Armstrong County Board of Commissioners encourage the citizens of this county join their fellow Americans to recognize and remember the tragedy of September 11, 2011 and the lives that were lost or altered by the terroristic acts that day.
The Commissioners have asked everyone to participate in honoring those we have lost on that tragic day 10 years ago.
Armstrong County Commissioners signed a proclamation supporting September fourth to the 11th, 2011 as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Awareness Week. The goal of the joint efforts by Armstrong – Indiana Mental Health / Mental Retardation and Armstrong – Indiana Drug & Alcohol Commission, Inc. is to raise awareness among its residents, especially women of childbearing age, regarding FASD education, prevention and intervention and to improve awareness.
International FASD Day was first observed on September 9, 1999, so that the ninth day o the ninth month would always be a reminder that during the nine months of pregnancy a woman should abstain from alcohol. Local restaurants will be displaying informative table tents and there will be a table staffed by members of ARC Manor at the Armstrong County Memorial Hospital on September 9th from 9am to 2pm.
Commissioner Rich Fink, Commissioner Patty Kirkpatrick, Deputy Director of ARC Manor, Carrie Bence and Commissioner Jim Scahill
– County leaders from across the commonwealth of Pennsylvania gathered in Somerset County at the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania (CCAP) 125th Annual Conference today adopted 30 resolutions, adding or changing articles in the Pennsylvania County Platform (Platform), the official list of CCAP policy positions that guides the Association’s work in the public policy arena.
Resolutions approved for inclusion in the Platform included such diverse topics as: pipelines and the enforcement of laws and operations; human services funding issues including county government’s first right of refusal when human services are privatized; the call for the commonwealth to undertake a review of human services funding formulas and the impact of those on counties; support for re-entry programs for prisons and juvenile detention facilities; allowing counties or their designee to assess fees for solid waste or recycling; and other resolutions.
“County commissioners and their counterparts in home rule counties have been coming together for 125 years to discuss the issues they share in common and what is most important to those served by county government,” said Mark Hamilton, CCAP president and Tioga County commissioner.
“The issues may change and shift over the years, but the importance of this Annual Conference and the role that it plays in helping counties come together to discuss the ever growing complexities of serving local families and our constituents, has not. The resolutions adopted today reflect county government’s position on policies that can greatly impact our ability to be effective advocates for our constituency.”
Hamilton further noted that the Association’s Platform would guide CCAP in the year ahead and beyond. He noted it would have a considerable role in the policy positions the Association takes on legislative matters and the policy positions it will advocate the General Assembly take on pending legislation affecting counties and Pennsylvania families.
“The Platform we adopted today is used by counties to lobby the state legislature about local community issues and the residents that are impacted by them,” he said. Counties are a primary service provider on behalf of the state, administering human services, judicial services, corrections, elections, emergency management and 911, planning, economic development and job training, record keeping and other programs.
In addition to policymaking, county officials elected leaders of the Association for 2012: elected president was Jo Ellen Litz, Lebanon County commissioner; Christian Leinbach, Berks county commissioner, first vice president; Pam Snyder, Greene County, second vice-president; and treasurer, Joseph Kantz, Snyder County commissioner. Their one-year term will begin in January 2012.
CCAP is the voice of county government, a statewide, nonprofit, nonpartisan Association representing all of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. CCAP membership includes the county commissioners, council members, county executives, administrators, chief clerks and solicitors.
CCAP strengthens the counties’ abilities to govern their own affairs and to improve the well-being and quality of life for every Pennsylvania resident. It advocates for favorable state and federal legislation, programs and policies on behalf of counties.

The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC) invites Pennsylvanians to contribute their photographs of historic places to illustrate and promote the 2012–2017 Preservation Plan for Pennsylvania.
Through the “This is MY HISTORY” photo campaign, citizens can submit photographs of places that are significant to them and their community. Photo submissions can include archaeological excavations, historic or rural landscapes, downtown streetscapes, residential neighborhoods, and adaptive re-use of historic buildings and structures.
But success stories are not the whole picture, as contributors may also send photos of historic resources that have been lost to neglect or are slated for demolition.
Participants can email photos along with the name of the site and any comments they wish to share to This e-mail address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it . Photos will be reviewed and shared at http://www.flickr.com/photos/patrailsofhistory/collections/72157627179319880/ . Photos can be submitted anytime through Dec. 31, 2011, however, only submissions received by Oct. 31 will be considered for inclusion in the commonwealth’s official preservation plan.
Every five years, PHMC’s Bureau for Historic Preservation is required by the National Park Service to develop a comprehensive preservation plan that:
Takes into consideration issues affecting the broad spectrum of historic and cultural resources within the state;
Encourages the consideration of historic preservation concerns within broader planning environments at federal, state and local levels.
PHMC has been holding public meetings throughout the state to gain public input in the process. The preservation plan will be released early in 2012.
More information about the preservation planning process and the photo campaign is available at www.phmc.state.pa.us. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission is the official history agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

America’s seniors are valued members of society and it is our collective responsibility to ensure they live safely and with dignity. Combating abuse of older people will help improve the quality of life for all seniors across this country and will allow seniors to continue to live as independently as possible and contribute to the life and vibrancy of America.
Ms. Lori Leard of Area Agency on Aging stated that there are services in place to investigate and assist elders who are suffering abuse. She stressed that the services are available but are ineffective if the abuse is not reported. Reports are accepted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by calling 1-800-732-6618 or you may dial 911.
The Armstrong County Commissioners adopted a proclamation at the June 2, 2011 Public Meeting recognizing June 15, 2011 as Elder Abuse Awareness Day. They encourage everyone to commit to building safe communities for our elderly residents.

Armstrong County will play a part in the upcoming third annual Wounded Warrior Project, “PA Hero Walk”. Since 2009 the Kiski Valley Veterans and Patriots Association (KVVPA) has organized an event known as the “PA Hero Walk” to thank all of our veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, with special tribute to honor those who were wounded. The first national spokesperson for the Wounded Warrior Project, Sergeant Jeremy Feldbusch of Blairsville, Westmoreland County was blinded for life on the Haditha Dam April 3, 2003 in Iraq.
The event will begin on June 12th at the Art Museum in Philadelphia and will follow the trail blazed by General John Forbes in 1758 known today as Route 30, The Lincoln Highway, concluding in Lower Burrell at VFW Post 92 on June 25th with a celebration.
The Wounded Warrior Project began in 2004 in Roanoke, Virginian by John Melia who organized a group to put together packs for returning wounded war fighters. The project has grown in a national organization that provides programs, benefits, counseling, hospital backpacks, transitional care packs, adaptive sports, internships, support groups, soldier rides and other support.
Commissioner Fink and Commissioner Kirkpatrick present Commissioner Scahill with the proclamation recognizing the Wounded Warrior Project and PA Heroes Walk.
Armstrong County Commissioners were proud to adopt a proclamation honoring the efforts of the organizers and participants. Commissioner Scahill will once again be assisting along the route with meals and safety concerns. Anyone interested in learning more about the Wounded Warrior Project and the “PA Hero Walk” can log onto www.pa.herowalk.org. Donation information can also be found on the website.

Swaroop has been obsessing about the life and times of Dada Saheb Phalke for many years now and is currently scripting \'Chandi ka Ghaave\', a biopic on the father of Indian cinema.
A nasally inclined class of school boys get high on biology as discordant psychedelic blares, jarring sensibilities but also creating new ones.
When the torrent ripped version of 'Om Dar Badar' (1988) started doing the rounds of the ‘butterfly generation’ in the summer of 2010, most art-cinema buffs were blown away by the sheer awesomeoness of director Kamal Swaroop’s vision and ability to layer frames with such surreality. It went on to win best film at the Filmfare Critics Award the next year.
Swaroop says the entire process was exhausting with the script taking three years to develop. Additionally, while filming, the camera broke down and almost half the film had to be reshot.
With a non-linear narrative, Om Dar Badar’s art-house feel comes layered with multiple levels of rebellious satire—of traditions, communication and perspective. Heavily laced with Dadaist influences, Om Dar Badar overturned basic film definition. But back in 1988, a generation still gyrating to Rishi Kapoor may not have been willing to experiment with their heads.
This product of the Film and Television Institute of India’s batch of 1974 said he signed up for the course because he wanted a solid stab at fame. But fame proved elusive for this avant-garde filmmaker when Om tanked at the box office and he never made another movie after. For the next 30 years, Swaroop invested his quirky perspective in networks like Channel V, Star Plus and Cinevista, shunning the features completely.
But the movie hung around, almost like a forbidden drug, influencing a slew of filmmakers like Anurag Kashyap. In other interviews, Kashyap has mentioned the effect Om Dar Badar had on him, paying tribute with a song riff used in Gulaal.
Now Swaroop jokes that he’s gotten envious of Kashyap, and is rolling up his sleeves for another crack at the clapboard. Swaroop has been obsessing about the life and times of Dada Saheb Phalke for many years now and is currently scripting Chandi ka Ghaave, a biopic on the father of Indian cinema. Swaroop is aiming at a 2013 release and says his much-awaited second film will star new faces.
“With arrival of digital film-making, and decentralisation of production, films are no more dependent on the prohibitive fees of a processing lab,” he says, “and more filmmakers will rise to represent various unique cultural and personal historical representations. It is almost a biological need... in this game, money really does not matter. It is a need of the time. A war!”
As avant-garde cinema carves itself a spot in an aggressively commercial industry, it seems like Swaroop’s battle cry is going to echo in many a weird head.

Former state Sen. Ralph Shortey was federally indicted Wednesday, five months after police found him in a hotel room with a 17-year-old boy. Shortey, 35, turned himself into federal authorities early Wednesday morning.
The indictment filed in U.S. District Court (District of Oklahoma) remained under seal until Wednesday afternoon, making for a significantly more discreet surrender than he’d made in the past. News9 has learned that the federal charges are child pornography and sex trafficking.
In March, Shortey was arraigned on state charges for engaging in child prostitution, transporting a minor for prostitution and engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church.
“We haven&apos;t had a chance to review all of the documents,” said Ed Blau, the prominent OKC defense attorney Shortey retained in March, ”so, at this time, a comment would not be appropriate.”
The FBI confirmed earlier this year that it was assisting the Moore Police Department when agents served a search warrant at Shortey’s home in March.
The items collected during that search is the most probable explanation for the indictment, though, not even Shortey’s defense attorney knew of its contents ahead of the arraignment.
“It is my understanding there is an indictment under seal and until the judge orders it unsealed then it would be inappropriate for me to speculate or comment on its content,” said Blau.
Shortey, R-Oklahoma City, resigned from the senate six days after he was accused in the state’s child prostitution case. The resignation was effective immediately.
Shortey was released Wednesday under several conditions. He is required to wear an ankle monitor, not allowed to speak with victims or witnesses, and must avoid contact with children other than his own.He is also subject to computer monitoring and restricted from viewing pornography.

PARKERSBURG – WVU Medicine Camden Clark Medical Center, in collaboration with Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, is encouraging its employees and area residents to develop the healthy habit of walking with the annual “Walk 100 Miles in 100 Days” program.
A kickoff event will be held Monday at 11:30 a.m. in front of the Parkersburg Municipal Building, weather permitting.
Officials from WVU Medicine Camden Clark, Highmark West Virginia and the City of Parkersburg will invite participants to join them for a brief walk around downtown Parkersburg to officially kick off the walking challenge. All community members and downtown businesses are invited to attend.
“As the area’s leader in high quality, comprehensive health care, WVU Medicine Camden Clark is proud to partner with Highmark West Virginia and the City of Parkersburg to get our employees, as well as our community, up and moving,” said Louis A. Haer Jr., director, WVU Medicine Camden Clark Health and Wellness Center. “Walking is a great way to improve your overall health and wellness, it’s free and anyone can do it. We encourage everyone to enjoy the benefits of walking every day now that spring is finally here.”
The 15-week program, which runs from April 16 through July 24, encourages participants to walk at least one mile a day or more for 100 days as a form of physical activity. Participants can track and record all miles completed, and there is no cap on number of miles walked during the challenge.
“We are excited to partner with WVU Medicine Camden Clark Medical Center and the City of Parkersburg to show people that adopting a healthy habit like walking can have many positive effects on their overall quality of life,” said Jim Fawcett, president, Highmark West Virginia. “We hope this walking challenge will provide encouragement to our employees and to the community to get up, get moving and get healthy.”
Three walking routes – in quarter-, half- and one-mile increments – have been mapped out in downtown Parkersburg to make it easier for participants to track their mileage. A walking map with these route options for walkers can be found near the Parkersburg Municipal Building, as well as on the Downtown PKB website.
Community members or local businesses interested in participating in the walking challenge can find additional details at http://wvumedicine.org/thewellnesscenter. The deadline to register is Friday.
In addition to the “Walk 100 Miles in 100 Days” program, WVU Medicine Camden Clark and Highmark West Virginia have also partnered on other health and wellness initiatives, including the SoleMates Walking Club and the Wellness Wednesday Lunch and Learn series. SoleMates is a walking program held at Grand Central Mall that encourages people to choose a healthy lifestyle through walking. Wellness Wednesday is a series that focuses on health, wellness and lifestyle lunchtime conversations.
MARIETTA — Even though Muskingum Township Trustee Ken Shilling has received 18 suggestions from the public about ...
There was four samples of both and they came already reflowed on Virence VR16S1 DTP MCPCBs. Each board had two emitters wired in parallel. The other pair will continue its journey to Koef3 for further testing. Also check out Djozz’s output test here.
The emitters are specified for up to 150mA (3000K) and 100mA (5000K) continuous current, but according to Djozz they seem to handle larger currents fine.
CRI and color testing was done at Nichia’s recommended current of 65mA (per emitter). For the tint vs. current test I ran my samples up to 200mA.
There’s practically no tint shift at all. Not with varying current or measurement angle. The tint is also excellent landing on or near the BBL.
The point of the Optisolis is color accuracy, which is excellent. I measured CRI(Ra) at 97 (3000K) and 99 (5000K) and R9 at 94 (3000K) and 93 (5000K). CRI also doesn’t change with current. The 3000K version seems to over saturate colors according to its TM-30-15 Rg value of 104. The 5000K one is more faithful at Rg 99.
The two different samples are very consistent. There’s very little difference in the spectrum between them.
Very nice color and tint, and extremely good CRI which are equal or even better than the Ledengin Gallery-white 3000 K (stated CRI 98) emitters! Well done Nichia!
Thanks for your testing, I'm very excited to see this LEDs and it's color for myself! Extreme testing would follow if I got some of these.
Excellent review. This LED is really something else. And some great measurement and testing hardware as well
Your results matched the results Nichia sent me earlier. 200mA continuous use seems fine. It’s been almost two months they’re inside my light bulb with almost 24 hours daily use.
Thanks for your testing, I’m very excited to see this LEDs and it’s color for myself! Extreme testing would follow if I got some of these.
from datasheet : This product uses a unique red phosphor that has a slow response time; when compared with the blue die and green phosphor in the product, the red will fluoresce with a delayed pulse of about 5msec and have an afterglow for about 5msec after the blue die
The tint and CRI on these is amazing. The 5000 K is truly a daylight simulator with practically perfect color rendering. You can also see that the peak on the 5000 K and 6500 K emitters is significantly lower at the purple wavelength. The dip above it is also much shallower than the typical cyan dip in a LED spectrum.
Here’s a 4000 K with the low peak at a typical higher wavelength and a clear dip above it which reduces the color rendering indices just a bit. But in turn their Rg value is above 100 which means they oversaturate some color a bit, which might be preferable to some.
I also tested the output on the 3000 K and 5000 K variants up to 400 mA. Somewhat surprisingly the 3000 K is more efficient on lower currents but as the current is increased the 5000 K flies past. Forward voltage is higher on the 5000 K one as expected. I found it also amusing that I happened to get a perfect average 3000 K emitter, since its output was bang on 24.1 lumens at 65 mA just like Nichia specifies.
The tint was only tested with bare emitters. There’s barely any tint shift as can be seen from the OP, but Clemence tells me that these don’t work very well in clear optics as a quad at least but a frosted one is fine. It’s could also be quite difficult to find a suitable reflector. My go to Pineapple OP one did exhibit clear shifts in the hotspot. However, a beaded TIR optic looked excellent.
Thank you so much Maukka for such invaluable data. Too bad the 5000k doesnt have perfect duv or slightly negative duv. The hint of green kills it for me.
I guess I’m not the only one skipping the 2700K, 3500K, 4000K, and 6500K spectrum tests. I waited and kept waiting for the other tests. Until Maukka sent me an email and told me it was there already….
As Clemence posted on his sales thread, the L757 (2700-4000 K) can’t be installed in parallel with the W757 (5000-6500 K) series because the forward voltage difference is too high. Here’s a comparison:
Yup, I know how it feels inputting those numbers. I did exactly the same 100mA increments too……manually. Does your Rigol comes with PC UI? Or did you build an add-on DAC hardware? Really like those sweep automation.
The Rigol has some software from the manufacturer but it’s utter crap. This Excel file is just using some modified VISA VBA examples from Keysight IIRC which interfaces with the PSU over ethernet. The same thing is much easier to do in Python, which I use when doing the output measurements in the sphere, since it’s simple to integrate the spectrometer executables. Everything just gets written in a CSV file like this:
Where Y is the lux reading from the meter. This has to be converted to lumens of course, but that happens automatically when I paste the data into Excel.
Thanks for the info! Now I know testing multiple LEDs is not that hard for you. More incoming Nichias for you then….
I have done everything manually in my led-testing years so I’m glad for you too that you automated it
My new spectrum-toy (a Mavolux Base) needs a minimum of 10 lux on the (7mm diameter) sensor to produce a spectrum, you may get that if you tape the firefly on top of the sensor . I do not know about maukka’s setup?
“I used to think that top environmental problems were biodiversity loss, ecosystem collapse and climate change. I thought that thirty years of good science could address these problems. I was wrong. The top environmental problems are selfishness, greed and apathy, and to deal with these we need a cultural and spiritual transformation. And we scientists don’t know how to do that.” (Gus Speth)
A hotel manager asked me if I can find a suitable LED to mimic firefly in the hotel garden. He wants it to be as realistic as possible. Weird request but very interesting! Finding/programming a driver with random natural blinking is another challenge.
We can place several fireflies in a small light bulb diffuser in front of the sensor. But I don’t know how Maukka would get those creatures in Finland.
Wow Djozz, very informative document you got there! Big thanks. I’ll try to find the suitable LEDs for it. Different species different spectral distributions too. 500nm – 700nm seems to be the range. But the peaks are species dependant. Now I’m thinking to lure fireflies…..
It looks like a phosfor converted green has about correct width of the emission peak but has the wrong peak wavelength (520nm for the new E21A converted green). The Rebel PC-lime however has its peak at 545nm which comes close to some of the firefly species tested in the 1964 article.
This should be enough to satisfy human eyes. Nobody would see the difference. Where did you get that PC Lime Djozz?
Not sure where best get the Rebel lime at the moment, I got them years ago from a portugese aquarium seller that has disappeared since. I see Ledsupply, Luxeonstar and Digikey, so all american sources. There is a Luxeon Z with the same colour as well at Digikey.
Btw, I have quite a stash (30 or so, would have to count them) of 20mm Rebel Sinkpads doing nothing, got them free from vestureofblood a few years ago. I could send them if they are suitable for your project (those Rebel lime leds put out up to 1000 lumen if needed )
I see that RS-online has the Luxeon Z lime (Luxeon Z has a simple two-pad footprint, like the E21A) for more than $5 a piece, a pretty expensive led but I could order there and send them.
Thanks for the offer Djozz but let’s wait, until I get those Green E17A first. If they’re good enough then I don’t need the PC lime. Besides E17A form factor is better suited than the bigger lumileds. I think green E17A inside a yellow plastic cap (or yellow heat shrink tube) would look very close to the green-yellow firefly light to the eyes. I just noticed that my Armytek’s green switch LED looks somewhat PC lime behind it’s yellow silicone button.
The Luxeon Z is tiny, hardly larger than its 1×1mm die. And what I remember from European fireflies the 530nm greens do not match that colour.
Anyway, I just checked one of your test that I never seen before. OMD, this thing is just too small. But yes, the colour spectrum is very close to firefly.
Maybe you could catch the fireflies with Optisolis. Fired up the 5000 K quad at 4×100 mA without optics and it only took a minute after a fly started investigating it. Landed right on an emitter and made it its home until I turned it off…
Ages ago I took a 555 timer and fudged about a 5-10sec period and fractional-second “on”-time, and used a 3V yellow Christmas light bulb as a firefly lure. Kindasorta worked. A bunch would flit around the yard but nobody would get too close to investigate.
Kidding Djozz. I know about the natural fuel it carries. It’s just your firefly is much greener than ours. Here’s it’s closer to green-yellow.
It could be your timing was spot on to their sex signal. There’s a very good documentary movie about it by the legendary Sir David Attenborough: “Lights On Earth”. Watch it for free in YouTube. Firefly also one tricky creature which can fool other male to get the female by sending false beacon.

25 CHRISTCHURCH MAIL, APRIL 18, 2013 New take on classic tale Canterbury Children's Theatre's popular holiday Cushion Theatre is back, this time with a modern take on the classic Aesop tale of the hare and the tortoise. In Slow Runnings, A Tortoise And Hare Story, Hare is a vain, self-obsessed sports superstar, with her own line of sportswear (whose slogans include "there's no prize for personal best"), while Tortoise just thinks everyone should be given their moment in the spotlight. Writer/director Matt Powell makes no effort to hide his allegiances. "I've never been any good at sports, so I guess I love to root for the underdog," he says. Canterbury Children's Theatre have been producing original theatre for children for 61 years and have put on more than130 shows. Recent productions have included Cinderella, Billy Goats Gruff, and Tim The Greedy Tui, all written for the society by local playwrights. Slow Runnings: A Tortoise And Hare Story runs from April 20 to May 5, at the Malthouse Theatre in Colombo St, with shows at 11am and 1pm on Saturdays and Sundays, and a 1pm show on ANZAC Day. Tickets are $7 each and are available by calling 0800 BOOKINGS.

The court puts a new spin on family favourite Beauty and the Beast By Gregory Cooper Directed by Melanie Camp 24 April -- 4 May 2013 All Tickets $9 www.courttheatre.org.nz This school holiday, The Court Theatre presents a classic fairytale... with some unexpected twists. Featuring performers from The Court's summer musical Grease, Beauty and the Beast is full of magic, mystery, adventure and fun. Preserving the integrity and core themes of this much-loved fairytale, playwright Gregory Cooper still manages to bring a sense of freshness and imagination to the script. In a past interview with The Lumiere Reader, Gregory offered some advice for those wishing to produce children's theatre; "Don't patronize the children. They are incredibly perceptive and savvy and can smell condescension a mile away. Just tell a good story with characters they will care about. Fart and snot gags are always useful as well." In her journey to see beyond the Beast's appearance and discover his true heart, our heroine Beauty is faced with a magic mirror, a big scary storm, a collection of silly sisters and a marmite-loving Sea Captain. "It's silliness with a purpose" says Director, Melanie Camp, who directed the sell-out season of The Gingerbread Man during the 2012 school holidays. "The great thing about children's theatre is that we can challenge children to think about the consequences of their choices, learn between right and wrong, and even help them face their fears -- all of this in a vibrant, interactive and fabulously silly theatrical experience." Beauty and the Beast will feature new music by Luke Di Somma and will also incorporate the use of stage revolves and special lighting effects that are sure to enchant children and adults alike.

"While a beef-based diet with added sodium nitrate resulted in mania-like behavior compared to rats consuming beef-based diet without sodium nitrate, these changes did not appear to be as severe as those resulting from consumption of nitrate-processed cured meat itself, suggesting that another factor in nitrate-processed cured meat could interact with, or worsen, the effects of dietary nitrate alone", the team stated.
Reference Nitrated meat products are associated with mania in humans and altered behavior and brain gene expression in rats.
Genetic and other risk factors have been linked to manic episodes that characterise bipolar disorder.
The study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, found nitrates changed the gut bacteria of rats, which may be linked to mental health problems.
He is the Professor of Neurovirology in Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
"I think that for people with mania, and perhaps other disorders as well, there might be environmental triggers that you can control", he said.
When it came to interest rates, Nixon told his advisers "we'll take inflation if necessary, but we can't take unemployment". In another heavy day of corporate results, declines in eBay and Travelers weighed on indexes following their reports.
The previous data, collected from patients with a psychiatric disorder and individuals with no psychiatric disorder history, showed that the group hospitalized with a psychiatric disorder ate 3.5 times higher amounts of cured meat before hospitalization for mania, as opposed to the group that did not have a psychiatric disorder.
They usually contain nitrates, a group of chemicals used as a preservative to cure meats like jerky, meat sticks and hot dogs, and nitrates have also been linked to inflammation and unhealthy outcomes, including cancer and brain disorders.
For the first study, the researchers didn't even intend to look at cured meats, said study co-author Faith Dickerson, director of the Stanley Research Program at Sheppard Pratt Health System. "It wasn't just that people with mania have an abnormal diet", said lead author Robert Yolken, Professor at the Johns Hopkins University in the US. When he fed rats either normal chow or chow supplemented with a piece of commercial beef jerky, the animals eating the jerky began to sleep irregularly and become hyperactive within two weeks.
So the researchers tried testing rats, feeding them beef jerky loaded with nitrates every other day. The results were repeated when regular rat food was dosed with nitrates equivalent to that a human would consume in a hot dog or beef jerky stick.
When the group analyzed the gut bacteria of the different groups of rats, they found that animals with nitrate in their diet had different patterns of bacteria living in their intestines than the other rats. "Our results suggest that nitrated cured meat could be one environmental player in mediating mania". It was partly funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.

Zinc is a fine metal that has stood the test of time. It has a clean, contemporary look, but as you can see on this castle from the Classical period, (shown here sporting interlocking shingles by Fine Metal Roof Tech) it has been used effectively for centuries in traditional building.
Zinc also affords a few color options. Each finish or color will weather and patina over time to a soft pewter color. Zinc colors and finishes can be combined as shown in this photo for a wide variety of personalized looks.
Natural - shiny and smooth when it comes out of the mill. When installed on an exterior, natural zinc will weather and form a beautifully textured gray
Pre-weathered - Elegant. This finish is achieved by a factory process that mimics the matte patina that zinc naturally develops over time. It comes in Quartz and velvety looking Charcoal black which is protected by an organic coating that prevents damage during transport and installation. Over the decades, the black aspect will lighten to a very dark gray.
The colored zincs. very subtle hues of green, red and blue. are created by adding mineral pigments to a durable protective coating.
For roofing applications, zinc can last well over 50 years. For wall cladding applications zinc can last over a century. Zinc requires no scheduled maintenance.

It is important to understand the history of a phenomenon in order to manipulate it. At first glance, Social Media comes across as novelty. But a careful evaluation helps the user to trace back the origins of Social Media.
There are ongoing debates on whether Email could be considered a part of social media. The predominant reasons why Email is not considered a social media are because (i) Email is a distribution mechanism whereas Social Media is a collective mechanism and (ii) Mass communication is different from Mass collaboration.4 But Email certainly qualifies if we go by the simple definition that ‘social media is conversations that happen online’.
Though the debate goes on, we cannot ignore the fact that the introduction of Email marked the beginning to the much more collaborative social media years later.
Computer engineer, Ray Tomlinson invented internet based email in late 1971. Ray Tomlinson worked as a computer engineer for Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), the company hired by the United States Defense Department to build the first Internet in 1968.
Ray Tomlinson along with a team was developing a time-sharing system called TENEX that ran on Digital PDP-10 computers. They were supporting a larger group working on natural language. Earlier, Ray Tomlinson had worked on the Network Control Protocol (NCP) for TENEX and network programs such as an experimental file transfer program called CPYNET.
Ray Tomlinson was making improvements to the local inter-user mail program called SNDMSG. Single-computer electronic mail had existed since at least the early 1960's and SNDMSG was an example of that. SNDMSG allowed a user to compose, address, and send a message to other users' mailboxes. The mail box was a file that could be appended but not overwritten. Ray Tomlinson tied his previous experience with CPYNET, a file transfer program with SNDMSG, a file that could be appended and came up with the idea of email, sending direct messages to remote mail boxes in addition to appending messages to local mail boxes.
SNDMSG that the ARPANET programmers and researchers were using on the network computers (Digital PDP-10s) allowed them to leave messages for each other. SNDMSG was a "local" electronic message program. A person could only leave messages on the computer for other persons using that same computer. Tomlinson used the file transfer protocol from CYPNET to adapt the SNDMSG program so it could send electronic messages to any other computer on the ARPANET. The first message was sent between two machines that were literally side by side. The only physical connection they had (aside from the floor they sat on) was through the ARPANET. The first use of network email announced its own existence.
These first messages were sent in late 1971. The next release of TENEX went out in early 1972 and included the version of SNDMSG with network mail capabilities. The CPYNET protocol was soon replaced with a real file transfer protocol having specific mail handling features. Later, a number of more general mail protocols were developed. 5
Usenet is a worldwide distributed Internet discussion system. It developed from the general purpose UUCP architecture of the same name.
Duke University graduate students Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis initiated this in 1980. They improvised the Email concept to share categorized messages. Users could read and post messages to one or more categories. These groups were known as newsgroups.
Usenet was founded based on a necessity. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis tried to replace the existing BBB style announcement system which became obsolete with a recent software upgrade in their university.
Usenet worked on constantly changing collection of servers that store and forward messages to one another in so-called news feeds. This is different from a BBS or web forum hosted from a central server and dedicated administrator. Individual users may read messages from and post messages to a local server operated by their own Internet service provider, university, or employer. Steve Bellowin assisted in writing the scripts and their ‘net news program linked Duke and University of North Carolina. This software was then made available to the general public as ‘A News’.6
LISTSERV scaled up the usage of email communication and proved as an effective way to reach out to a large number of people in an instant.
Prior to LISTSERV, email lists were managed manually. People would have to write to the administrator who manages the list and ask to be added or removed. This process only got more time-consuming as discussion lists grew in popularity.
Eric Thomson, an engineering student tried to automate the process of managing email lists. Eric Thomson’s email list management program, known as LISTSERV became a huge success.
The emailing mechanism was expanded with the introduction of LISTSERV. LISTSERV was the first electronic mailing list software application, in which the sender can send one email and it will reach a group of people. After the launch of LISTSERV in 1986, several other list management tools have been developed, such as Lyris ListManager in 1997, Sympa in 1997, GNU Mailman in 1998.7
LISTSERV was freeware from 1986 through 1993. It is now a commercial product developed by L-Soft, a company founded by LISTSERV author Eric Thomas in 1994.
Email, Usenet and Listserv helped in sharing messages, individually, categorized and also to a group through a list. This still could not replicate the ease of meeting a person face to face. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) introduced in 1988 improved the experience. IRC is a form of chatting. Originally designed for group chatting in discussion forums, this also allowed one-to-one communication via private message as well as chat and data transfers.
As of May 2009, the top 100 IRC networks served more than half a million users at a time, with hundreds of thousands of channels (the vast majority of which stand mostly vacant), operating on roughly 1,500 servers worldwide.8 (Jones, 2002-12-10)
IRC was created by Jarkko Oikarinen in August 1988 to replace a program called MUT (MultiUser Talk) on a BBS called OuluBox in Finland. Oikarinen was inspired by chat system known as Bitnet Relay. Jarkko Oikarinen was working in the Department of Information Processing Science in University of Oulu as an administrator for the Sun Server and started working on a communications program during his free time. He wanted to include USENET News kind of systems to the regular real time discussions in their BBS system OuluBox and succeeded.9
IRC was used to report on the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt throughout a media blackout. It was previously used in a similar fashion during the Gulf War. Logs of these and other events are kept in the ibiblio archive.10
IRC client software is available for nearly every computer operating system that supports TCP/IP networking.
After the success of IRC, many personal websites, discussion groups and chat groups also became popular. At the beginning of the 90s, internet access was not completely accessible to the public. This situation changed when Private internet service providers (ISPs) began to start operations in the United States around 1994 or 1995. This gave millions of home users the chance to experience it. The other reason for the initial euphoria was the fact that the content was absolutely free other than the data usage paid to the internet companies. Early internet users were extremely outspoken and opinionated by today’s standards. People were thrilled at the possibility of sharing their opinions and often went overboard in their expressions. The first online social media etiquette standards were proposed, and called netiquette, as a control mechanism. Internet forums grew in popularity by the late 90’s and began replacing Usenet and BBSes as the primary platform for topical discussions.
Randy Conrads created Classmates.com in 1995 by. Nielsen Online ranked Classmates as number three in unique monthly visitors (U.S. home, work) among social networking sites in 2008. The objective of this social media website is to assist members in finding friends and acquaintances from throughout their lives, from kindergarten, primary school, high school, college, work and the United States military. Classmates.com has over 50 million members.
The modern blog evolved from the online diary. Justin Hall, who began personal blogging in 1994 is generally recognized as one of the earliest bloggers.11 The other popular blogs are Dave Winer's Scripting News and Wearable Wireless Webcam. Wearable Wireless Webcam was unique in terms of how it combined text, video, and pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text was referred to as sousveillance. Such entries were considered as legal evidence as well.
Early blogs were simply updates in common Web sites. However, the evolution of tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular web hosting services. Blogs are recognized as a separate medium in itself.
Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.
After a slow start, blogging rapidly gained in popularity. Blog usage spread during 1999 and the years following, being further popularized by the near-simultaneous arrival of the first hosted blog tools:
* Bruce Ableson launched Open Diary in October 1998. Open Diary was the first in allowing the readers to add comments to the blog entries. 12
* Andrew Smales created Pitas.com in July 1999 as an easier alternative to maintaining a "news page" on a Web site, followed by Diaryland in September 1999, focusing more on a personal diary community.
* Evan Williams and Meg Hourihan (Pyra Labs) launched blogger.com in August 1999 (purchased by Google in February 2003)
The term Web 2.0 is commonly associated with web applications that facilitate interactive information sharing, interoperability, user-centered design, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. A Web 2.0 site gives its users the free choice to interact or collaborate with each other in a social media dialogue as creators (prosumer) of user-generated content in a virtual community, in contrast to websites where users (consumer) are limited to the passive viewing of content that was created for them. Examples of Web 2.0 include social-networking sites, blogs, wikis, video-sharing sites, hosted services, web applications, mashups and folksonomies.
The term is closely associated with Tim O'Reilly because of the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference in 2004. Although the term suggests a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to an update to any technical specifications, but rather to cumulative changes in the ways software developers and end-users use the Web. Whether Web 2.0 is qualitatively different from prior web technologies has been challenged by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, who called the term a "piece of jargon", precisely because he intended the Web in his vision as "a collaborative medium, a place where we [could] all meet and read and write". He called it the 'Read/Write Web'.
Amit Agrawal describes web3.0 as the Semantic Web and personalization. Conrad Wolfram has a computer based approach to web 3.0 that web3.0 is about the computer generating new information instead of humans. Today, the problem is not lack of information but too much information. The challenge is making sense of this information and categorizing it appropriately. Web3.0 is more about the tools and techniques to make this information consumption efficient and effective.
Manoj Sharma, an organization strategist, in the keynote "A Brave New World Of Web 3.0" proposes that Web 3.0 will be a "Totally Integrated World" - cradle-to-grave experience of being always plugged onto the net. Andrew Keen, author of The Cult of the Amateur, considers the Semantic Web an "unrealisable abstraction". He points out Bertelsman's deal with the German Wikipedia to produce an edited print version of that encyclopedia. CNN Money's Jessi Hempel speculates Web 3.0 to emerge from new and innovative Web 2.0 services with a profitable business model.
John Smart, author of the Metaverse Roadmap echoes Sharma's perspective that web3.0 will bring out a completely integrated world, defining Web 3.0 as the first-generation Metaverse (convergence of the virtual and physical world), a web development layer that includes TV-quality open video, 3D simulations, augmented reality, human-constructed semantic standards, and pervasive broadband, wireless, and sensors. Web 3.0's early geosocial (Foursquare, etc.) and augmented reality (Layar, etc.) webs are an extension of Web 2.0's participatory technologies and social networks (Facebook, etc.) into 3D space. Of all its metaverse-like developments, Smart suggests Web 3.0's most defining characteristic will be the mass diffusion of NTSC-or-better quality open video to TVs, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices, a time when "the internet swallows the television.”Smart considers Web 4.0 to be the Semantic Web and in particular, the rise of statistical, machine-constructed semantic tags and algorithms, driven by broad collective use of conversational interfaces, perhaps circa 2020.
David Siegel's perspective in Pull: The Power of the Semantic Web, 2009 proposes that the growth of human-constructed semantic standards and data will be a slow, industry-specific incremental process for years to come, perhaps unlikely to tip into broad social utility until after 2020.
Social Media History points out how the entire phenomenon relied on power of the crowd. The technological Innovation had more to do with how a certain technology was combined with something else to bring in the power of social groups than a break through Innovation. Email was only an incremental Innovation of an existing program that let people leave messages on their personal computer. When that was combined with the file transfer program through ARPANET, the scope of reaching people expanded and ultimately resulted in a disruptive innovation.
True to its history, Social Media impact also relies on how well digital technologies are matched with the goal of the company and the need of the target audience.

Looking out for Human Rights Defenders: PBI Interview with Michel Forst, new Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR)
Bar Human Rights Committee submits amicus brief to Colombian Supreme Court on David Ravelo appeal case
Every year, PBI’s field projects and country groups recruit, train and send 80 protective accompaniment volunteers into the field. The PBI volunteers come from all over the world and act as the ‘eyes and ears’ of the global community. Their presence, physically and symbolically, sends the message that the international community will not accept human rights violations or abuses. It is through this strategy of accompaniment and observation, that PBI literally saves lives.
PBI Australia ocasionally holds talks about PBI's work and the experience of being a volunteer in the field to introduce people to PBI, its principles and protective accompaniment strategy. It also acts as a starting point for volunteers interested in applying to Projects, as well as providing support to returned volunteers. Please follow our Facebook page to be notified of any public talks or get in touch via email.
PBI field volunteers are walking symbols of international support for human rights. Their presence sends the message that the international community will not accept human rights violations or abuses. Field volunteers are backed up by an international network of PBI members, politicians and representatives from the legal sector. Follow our Facebook page to stay up to date on Alerts that the projects send out, and what you can do to help.

Today is the one-year anniversary of the landmark stimulus bill which most economists agree has staved off a second Great Depression. The evidence that the stimulus has worked is overwhelming – the New York Times has an in-depth article looking at its actual impact on jobs, and an indispensable graphic showing a timeline of key economic indicators before and after its passage. There’s another beautiful chart based on job loss data from Dec 2007 to Jan 2010 which also makes the impact of the stimulus crystal clear. The recognition of the stimulus’ success isn’t just data-driven – Republican lawmakers who have publicly denounced it for political gain have been quietly and hypocritically scrambling for stimulus money for their districts – as documented by the Wall Street Journal and by the Washington Times.

General Discussion: There's a big difference between hunting for coins, and finding rings, vs. hunting for rings and finding coins... - Page 2 - Friendly Metal Detecting Forums
General Discussion: There's a big difference between hunting for coins, and finding rings, vs. hunting for rings and finding coins...
Clad keeps a guy alive, profitable and very sharp to the everchanging travel patterns of Humans. Hunting rings in and of themselves is a time/profit wasting effort, seeings how most are junk now a days, but the location you find them in does tell a story, that should be noticed and processed...
I agree that clad keeps us profitable. As I noted, I don't pass up coins. BUT... I make approximately 3x to 4x in ring sales every year, compared to the clad I find. Last year, I pulled over $1000 in clad, and over $3000 in ring sales (mostly gold, but I do sell quite a few silver and tungsten ones at $5-$10 a pop). If I focused solely on clad, I'll bet I could have made another $200-$300 in coins... but..> I would have traded that $300 for $3000 in gold. And before someone jumps in with, "Yeah, but that was ONE year!"... I've done that three years running. 3x-4x every year. This year I'm right at 2.8x, but suspect some more gold is just around the corner.
I've heard that gold is illusive, but frankly, EVERY place I've taken my metal detector to on a business trip, has resulted in some gold, when i can put more than 10-20 hours in. I have a hard time believing that if people are out looking for it, that they're not going to find it, unless they simply aren't willing to put in the work digging those signals. And YES... it's location location location...
But as a case-in-point, I have seen posts by you, where you've hit football fields that obviously were loaded with quarters, and you'll pull out $20-$40 in quarters in a day's session. Personally, if I was hitting a field like that, the last thing I'd be skipping is the ring signals, because I'd be CONVINCED there were gold rings waiting to be found under that clad. Yeah, you pulled out $40 in coins... But what'd you miss? that's the part that kills me. How many class rings, women's gold rings, or coach's gold rings did you miss out on? Maybe none... Maybe 4. never know until you've dug it. But the odds are nearly 100% that you miss them if you're only digging quarters.
I see that a lot, where people cherry pick quarters all day long... all the while passing up opportunities to pull out the really valuable items. They convince themselves their strategy is producing great levels of returns! and here's the rub... IT IS. It absolutely is a great return. $20 an hour detecting is freaking awesome! But $200-$400 in the same time, along with $15 in quarters is way beyond awesome. I regularly trade that few dollars an hour (if that, since I'm really only digging about 20 extra trash targets or so, at a loss of just a few minutes total time) for the chance to hit it big... and it pays off at least monthly.
Bottom line still stands... If you're out hunting rings, you'll find them. Sure 79% of them are junkers. But 8% gold and 13% Silver are more than enough to add up to a whole lot more fun that stacking quarters.
Second bottom line... Frankly, none of us are in this to actually get rich and retire... and if YOU (the reader) are reading through this saying, "But I LIKE to dig just coins." That's AWESOME. It's about the fun, the enjoyment, and the experience of getting out. That's the #1 point of why we all do this. If you don't like to dig the trash to hit the gold, and love how you're doing it... I strongly recommend you do what you love! That's what its all about.
I love rings. I love gold. Change goes into a Cool-Whip container and dumped into Coinstar about every 5 weeks. I don't even count it, until then. And I make enough that I have upgraded my system 3 times with 3 coils, and have all the accessories I want... plus gobs of extras just for fun. CLAD PAYS.
Garrett AT Max with NEL Thunder Coil - Garrett Pro-Pointer AT - Lesche Digger. 600+ rings in 3 years ~8% gold find rate. Rings are my primary targets when hunting.
Its probably best to just stick to busting totter finds...a committed to success guy can pull good pay simply running a steady totter route and kicking chips for clad..no doubt will eventually find gold, silver, junk rings, paper money, jackets, food, dope pipes and skateboards...all sorts of stuff, knives, guns, old silver dollar coins that little Jimmy stole from old G'pas coin collection!...All sorts of stuff in the totters! Introductory rig and a cotton nail apron and off you go!...
With an elcheapo introductory rig, a guy could merely hit the totters! No kneepads, no pinpointer, no shovel even, just a swipe of the foot to reveal the target, work a steady route, modify accordingly as the seasons evolve and the herds change, no need to get all scientific and over think this...a guy would do better at the end of the year than most...
This is a great Sport! Biggest factor to success is to simply get out of the house and hunt!...'You gonna talk or you gonna fish?'
I had mentioned "mud-wrestling pits". But as you can well imagine: This is a very niche and rare location. Not much "mud-wrestling" going on anywhere.
But the reason I brought it up, was that one time, I got called out to look for someone's lost gold ring. They had lost it during a segment of one of those "iron-man" events , where the crowd's last stop was at a giant mud fest. Where everyone gets into bathing trunks, and sloshes around and throws mud at each other (and guys sit around and oogle at the girls involved, I suppose).
The pit was created by making borders (with planks or whatever), then filling it with dirt and water, .... about the size of a basketball court. Then 100+ people go in for so-called mud wrestling.
By the time I got there to do the posse commissioned hunt for the guy, it was a few weeks later. The pit had been disassembled, and all the mud left to dry out. The caretaker of the property, upon seeing me detecting, came over to ask what I was doing. I explained that I was looking for a guy's ring.
But what followed next opened my eyes to how conducive this is to loss-of-rings: The caretaker guy (property of an adjacent restaurant tourist stop) said that this event was an annual event that had now gone on for several years. And he said that EVERY SINGLE YEAR, he sees people out there, combing the mud with their fingers following the event, looking for lost car keys, necklaces, rings, etc.... And that I wasn't the first md'r he'd seen out there.
It ended up that I didn't find the ring. But I found several personal clothing effects which showed the concept to be true: Things like zippers, buttons, misc. other jewelry (albeit not gold , nor the ring I was looking for), etc....
Trouble is, mud-wrestling isn't a wide-spread hobby, doh ! So swim beaches, where people are splashing their hands in the ebbing surf, and thrusting their hands into the wet-sand, is a close second
Thanks for the explanation.. I have been wondering for quite sometime where you were coming from as I had seen you touch on this type of location in previous posts.. HOWEVER.. I DO remember Mud Wrestling back in the 80's in So Cal.. was a fairly big thing.
Dear colleagues, I am posting a photo report. So, the event took place and I want to say a few words. Was presented 620 papers and this year was dominated by aviation(Serge Skorobogatov, you thank you very much). Unfortunately, due to the postponement of the date (we will talk about this separately), not all participants were able to come, both Crimeans and from the mainland. But despite this all managed. I would like to thank our General partner "Zvezda" for the prize Fund. Also the company "AMMO MIG" and personally Miguel Jimenez for prizes in special nominations. Company "Aurora-hobby", "Behemoth", " ARM.PNT". Our main information partner is the website scalemodels.ru ahhh! I want to say a huge thank you to Vyacheslav Demchenko, who helped a lot in many issues and provided great support to the exhibition.

Oliver Vaughan Snell Bulleid was born in New Zealand during 1882. He came to live in Wales in 1889 following the death of his father. In 1901 he joined the Great Northern Railway and became an Apprentice under H.A.Ivatt the then CME of the railway, In 1908 he became a Test Engineer with the Westinghouse Electric Corporation working his way up, finally becoming Assistant Works Manager and Chief Draughtsman. He also married the daughter of H.A.Ivatt.
Working for the Board of trade for a brief period from 1910 allowed him to travel throughout Europe getting to know Gresley, Stanier and Hawksworth amongst others. This led in 1912, to his rejoining the GNR to work as Personal Assistant for Nigel Gresley. The war however meant him having to join the British Army where he became Major in the rail transport arm. The GNR took him back after the war as Manager of the Wagon and carriage Works.
Upon grouping in 1923 he again became Assistant to Gresley who was now CME of the LNER. He was offered the post of CME of the Southern Railway in 1937, which he accepted at the salary of £3000 per year.
Well known for his experimental work on steam (Merchant Navy, West Country and Battle of Britain locomotives). He was also forward looking and played a major role in the electrification of the Southern network. Designing the electric locomotives CC1 and CC2 (a third was built by BR in 1948), plus of course the 4-DD double deck EMUs.
With the onset of British Rail in 1948 he was influential in the early stages of the Mk1 coach design.
1950 and Bulleid was appointed CME of CIE (Coras Iompair Eireann), retiring in 1958. OVS finally passed away in Malta on 25 April 1970 at the age of 87.
After the war overcrowding on the Southern commuter services into London, especially from Dartford needed a solution. Extending platforms would have cost an estimated £10million. Bulleid came up with the plan for a Double Deck train to increase capacity. The increase in height however severely restricted the routes that could be taken by the trains thus the trials took place on the Charing Cross to Dartford (and Gravesend) lines.
A full scale plywood model of a type of carriage that may one day revolutionise railway travel is nearing completion at the Lancing Carriage works.
It follows months of work by draughtsmen who have been experimenting with a design which may help railways to overcome the problem of rolling stock.
The "Two-in-one" carriage is an idea which may take years to fulfil, It is in the infancy stage, according to railway officials who are loath to talk about it.
In fact the model making at lancing appears to be as secret as the latest development of automic research. No one there will talk of the double-decker carriage.
Top officials say "Sorry. No statement. Not allowed to say anything" and lesser officials, with furtive, over the shoulder glances say "We mustn't say anything, but we have seen it and it looks as if the idea is pretty good".
Despite the secrecy, the model has been built, and it looks as though the Railway executive are greatly interested in the possibilities of "up and down" railway travel.
Two units were constructed. The frames built at Lancing and some of the bodywork at Eastleigh. Coaches 1300x were Motor Brake Seconds (MBS), 1350x were Trailer Seconds. Unit 4001 was completed September 1949, 4002 out shopped the following month had cast trailer wheels. The trailer coach bodies were on 62ft under frames, the motor coaches being 6" longer. Behind the driver in each motor coach was a guards brake which was 9' 2" wide. The doors to the brake compartment were inset. Each unit weighed 136 tons.
The motor coaches were built to SR Diagram 2128, the trailers to Diagrams 2020 and 2021, different numbers reflecting buffing and jumper box variations. They were fitted with screw couplings and side buffers at the unit ends, with central buffer and three link couplings within the unit. roller blind headcode boxes were installed.
The under frames were of deep girder construction, which along with the bolster less bogies and smaller wheels allowed more body space within the loading gauge. Sole bars were specially designed to be 9" below the passenger accommodation, but increased to 15" at the guards and motormans compartments to allow for conventional buffer heights.
The units had lightweight 250hp EE507 motors with EP control gear. Brakes were Westinghouse EP self-lapping which were unique to the 4-DDs which meant they were not able to be worked in multiple with other classes. (The EP brake equipment was experimental and had previously been fitted to 6-PUL 3016 and 6-PAN 3034 in 1947/8). The motor bogies had non standard 8ft frames, with wheels 3ft in diameter which was 2" smaller than normal. Top speed was 75mph.
Standard air whistles were fitted on the cab ends when new. Latter they were replaced by two tone horns on the roof. 27 Way control jumpers were fitted (as opposed to the separate lighting and control jumpers on previous units). The jumper was located centrally under the headcode indicator. Problems with miscoupling the jumpers lead to them being relocated to under the secondmans observation window. Standard Power Jumpers were fitted.
Load testing took place at Lancing, the Motor coaches failed with the frames going into reverse camber. Alterations to the structure took place; the roofs were cut across at the centre solebars cut at the bottom flange and a vee cut up to the web to the top flange. Truss bars then cut through each motor coach was jacked up until the required alignment was reached. Solebars and truss bars welded up with stiffening plates and finally the holes in the roof were welded up.
Trials took place on the line between Brighton and Haywards Heath, this showed up some a number of problems and both units had extensive modifications between 22 November 1949 and 6 January 1950. Transfer to Slade Green (then known as Slades Green) occurred on 19th September for clearance tests in the suburban area.
Although called "Double Deck" the internal layout was totally unlike that of a double deck bus. Each compartment could seat eleven six on one side and five on the other. The missing seat on one side was replaced by the steps up into the upper compartment. The upper level also had two tip up seats situated where the door would normally be. Motor coaches could seat 120 (110 plus 10 tip-up). Trailer coaches seated 156 (66 (plus 12 tip-up)) on the upper level and 78 on the lower. The centre compartments on the lower level could seat 12 as there was no upper deck accessible from these.
The train was 4.5" higher (12ft 9") than normal commuter trains and was thus severely restricted on what routes it could run, both in service and on trips to the works at Eastleigh and Lancing. Extra room inside was gained by having straight sides, slightly smaller diameter wheels and by making the seating cushions less padded (4" less padding then a 4-SUB). The seats were also narrower at 16.5" (normally 18.5"). More space was saved by the use of specially made filament lamps that were often mistaken for fluorescent tubes. The lamps were in fact 70 volt tubular opalescent lamps that were mounted in the plywood seat partitions above the heads of the passengers.
The upper windows did not open as there was not sufficient clearance, thus the unit could get very hot in summer. Forced air ventilation was installed to try to get over this. Equipment to power this ventilation system was located in a cupboard beneath the large centre windows of each upper level compartment, and drew air from below the train and supplied it beneath the feet of passengers in the upper level compartments. The ventilation system was thermostatically controlled and under the overall control of the guard. Passengers often avoided the upper deck and often stood downstairs. The doors were flat, not having the camber of normal trains. Each door had a droplight with a quarter light above. Passenger communication was via a value situated above each door, there was no provision for an alarm in the upper compartments.
The units were introduced to service 1st November 1949 the first train was filmed by Pathe News. The Top Brass from British Railways Board were present along side senior Southern Region officials and members of the Transport Ministry.
When first delivered the units were in Southern Railway Malachite Green with black ends to the coaches and the under frames, the roof painted silver. There was no ownership markings, coach numbers placed on the left hand of the body sides. In 1958 at Lancing the now BR standard BR(S) darker green livery was applied along with the BR Lion and Wheel emblem on the side of the motor coaches. The livery was further adapted with small yellow panels on the driving ends upon the next overall at Eastleigh (1965), then full yellow ends appeared in 1968. The units were finally painted into all blue livery 28th September 1970 when they were also renumbered 4901/2 in order to release the fleet numbers for use on the experimental PEP units. They were always based at Slade Green Depot though out their life.
The original intention of increasing capacity was not what happened in reality, the two units seated 1104 plus standing room as well. However the number of doors restricted the time taken to load/unload, each door now serving 24 as opposed to 12 in other suburban units. It was estimated that they extended platform loading and unloading times by as much as 36 per cent. Passengers also tended to try to avoid the upper deck would rather stay standing by the doors. There were also reports of an increase in accidents as the units had no footboards or external handles.
The Railway Executive has decided that the experimental eight-coach double-deck train, which has been in service on the electrified London suburban lines of the Southern Region for the past 12 months, does not offer a satisfactory long-term solution of the problem of peak-hour congestion. The conclusion reached from the trials is that the public interest and operating efficiency will be better served by longer trains (ten coaches instead of eight) of normal type but of more commodious design, and longer platforms to accomodate them. The double-deck train provides seats for 1,016 passengers, compared with 772 in an ordinary eight-coach train, and 945 in ten-coach trains of new design (including coaches with central corridors). The trials have revealed that the advantage of extra seating capacity is more than outweighed by slower station working, as the double-deck train affords one door for 22 seats, compared with 10 or 12 in ordinary compartment stock. Moreover, the double-deck coaches provide less cubic capacity per passenger, and have smaller and less comforetable seats. The loading gauge restrictions make it more difficult to provide adequate ventilation in the upper deck and the dimemsions of the coaches impose severe limitations on their route availability. The experimental double-deck train was described and illustrated in our January, 1950, issue."
For an experimental train they remained in service for an impressive period of time, only being withdrawn 1st October 1971. The final service train was the 18:04 Charing Cross to Dartford via Bexleyheath. A plaque exists at Dartford Station commemorating the units.

The withdrawn units were first stored at Plumstead and were stripped of electrical components at Slade Green. They were moved to Hoo Yard in November 1971 where all four coaches of 4001 and trailer 13504 from unit 4002 were burnt and cut up by Smeeth Metals. The remaining coaches were sold to the South Eastern Steam Centre Ashford and were moved there in March of that year.
The South Eastern Steam Centre Ashford was started by Esmond Lewis-Evans in what was the former engine shed east of Ashford station. The shed was designed by the Southern Railway and built in 1931, closing to steam in June 1962, although it was later used for diesel servicing. The Steam Centre was established in 1968, by 1974 opening once a month (Second Sunday). Sadly the centre did not get significant support to survive and closed in May 1976.
"I travelled in this unit when it was at Ashford. It was pulled up and down the shed side by the H class, the O1 was there looking on, it was very disappointing and I am not surprised that the site closed. It was supposed to be the Southern answer to the NRM. As for the ride, I went twice as Dad was in touch with the owner. Both times I had a ride in the coach. It was singular and both times went upstairs. I felt very closed in and it was very quiet, even with the H banging away up front. I think we will see this restored but in their own time, we may even see a complete set. But unless they can find somewhere that has the clearance then they will never run again and will only be a cosmetic restoration. I would be sad to see these fine examples of Bulleid's experimental mind vanish."
Trailer 13503 was scrapped by Car Fragmentation of Queenborough at Ashford following the closure of the Steam Centre.
Following a period of storage in T.W.Woods Silvertown scrap yard 13004 was moved to the Northampton and Lamport Railway (owned by the Bulleid Double Decker Society) at Pitsford (around 1986). During its time at the NLR unsuccessful attempts were made to fit conventional buffing gear.
It was later moved to the Northampton Ironstone Railway, on the 4th June 1999. The move was covered by Anglian TV.
7th March 1972 - 4002 (13003 - 13503 -13004) moved to Ashford. Class 33 via Maidstone West, Paddock Wood, Tonbridge then to Ashford.
4th June 1999 - 13004 moved to Northampton Ironstone Railway Trust, from the Northampton and Lamport Railway.

Home - Product of the week - Senior provides the perfect match for Manchester’s new pitch-side hotel
Aluminium windows, doors and curtain walling solutions from Senior Architectural Systems have been used on the new Hilton Garden Inn hotel at Old Trafford
Enjoying a prime location overlooking the Lancashire Cricket pitch at Emirates Old Trafford, the views enjoyed by the residents of the new Hilton Garden Inn hotel have been framed by aluminium windows, doors and curtain walling supplied by Senior Architectural Systems and fabricated and installed by specialist T A Anders & Co.
Through early engagement and collaboration with main contractor Galliford Try, Senior’s specification team were able to advise on the most cost-effective solution to delivering a glazing package that met with both the desired aesthetic and performance requirements of architects ICA and the client. Senior was also reportedly able to make recommendations to assist with the appointment of a specialist installer, with the contract going on to be awarded to T.A. Anders & Co. The company, which has extensive experience of working in this sector, also worked with Senior to deliver the glazing package for Fleetwood Town FC’s new training ground.
To create the bright and welcoming entrance to the new hotel, Senior’s slimline SF52 aluminium curtain walling was used alongside the manufacturer’s SPW600 aluminium casement windows and SPW501 aluminium commercial doors. The rooms at the rear of the hotel, which directly overlook the cricket ground, feature Senior’s patented, thermally-enhanced PURe Slide aluminium sliding doors which open onto individual balconies that can be also be used as private corporate boxes during events at the cricket ground.
Careful consideration was apparently given to the acoustic performance of the glazing package, particularly on the front elevation of the hotel which is located close to a main road. To further enhance the comfort of the hotel’s guests, Senior’s PURe Slide doors are said to offer exceptional low U-values and improved thermal-efficiency.
As Emirates Old Trafford remained operational to host sporting and entertainment events throughout the construction of the new hotel, teamwork was vital to the successful delivery of the project.
Simon Scholefield, Senior Architectural System’s architectural advisor for the North-West region, said: “We are really proud of this project, not only because of the use of our glazing systems but more so for the fact that it is a great example of what close and early engagement with product manufactures can really achieve. By working with Galliford Try to devise a fenestration specification that was better suited to the project’s requirements, in terms of design vision, budget and timeframe, we were able to maximise the benefits of value-engineering. Supply chain collaboration also ensured that our products were installed by a specialist such as T A Anders & Co, who has proven multi-sector expertise and particular skill in delivering complex glazing contracts for the leisure, commercial and stadia markets.”
Also commenting, David Leyland, senior bid manager for the project at T.A. Anders & Co, added: “We are very proud of securing, installing and completing this project and in creating a glazing package that meets the design and performance criteria set out by the clients Hilton Hotels & Resorts and Lancashire County Cricket Club. The success of the scheme is a result of the positive collaboration between our team, lead by our project manager Carl White, Senior Architectural Systems and the site team of Galliford Try, and we look forward to working together again on future projects.”

The active metabolite of Strattera has the same active metabolite as Prozac. See : http://www.haesbrouck.be/strattera_amfetamine.jpg. When both products were metabolised by digestion, both active phenylpropylamines acts in a similar way as the amphetamines act. Amphetamines are chemically close to these new SSRI’s because their chemical structure is a phenylethylamine. Because of the difference of that one C-Atom between phenylethylamines and phenylproylamines, dosages are adapted: amphetamine-pills are at 5mg , Prozac-pills at 20-60mg. As the result, both are working in the same way: destroying neurons to inhibit control over the nervous system and causing symptoms of hallucination on a long term use. I described the working mechanism of ADHD-medication in my book ( for this moment only available in Dutch) : "ADHD-medicatie: medische megablunder", ISBN: 978-909021709-3.
It’s becoming clear: electric cars are the future. Between electric mainstays like Tesla and legacy car manufacturers like Ford and Chevrolet, the auto industry is racing towards making truly viable electric cars. Now, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are helping that process along, with a nanogenerator meant to help car tires pull their own weight, by pulling latent electricity from the ground itself.
The UW-Madison team created a type of single-electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (a well-studied method of turning mechanical energy into electric energy) and optimized it for specific use in cars.
Reclaiming electricity from our tires could extend the battery life and range of electric or hybrid cars, adding to energy already recouped by processes like regenerative braking.
Zhong Lin Wang, creator of the first triboelectic nanogenerators in 2012, has claimed to regain up to 85 percent of the total energy used. The TENG harvests the electricity that’s naturally transferred between two different surfaces when they come into contact and are pulled apart. A high rate of repetition makes a rotating car tire perfect for this application.
Xudong Wang, professor at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, says that in this application his team has been able to recoup up to 10.4 percent of the energy expended in early prototype stages, which is roughly the amount Wang hopes will stay constant as they develop larger prototypes.
Researchers tested the TENGs by securing six strips of the material on the back wheels of a electric toy car, which also had six LED lights attached. The power generated by the toy car in motion lit all six LED lights, and at its peak, reached 1.79 milliwatts. However, the wattage increases with the weight and speed of the vehicle used, so researchers believe the output will grow with the size and weight of the tires used, according to the paper published in Nano Energy.
While cars may never be fully-powered by their wheels, this technology comes at a time when fully-electric cars (which are greatly limited by the power they’re able to hold) are beginning to gain popularity.
An electric car like the Nissan Leaf uses a 80 kilowatt engine—but if 10 percent of its energy can be recouped, that could mean a considerable amount of extra milage per charge. (Around 8 extra miles for the Leaf, and up to 27 for a Tesla.)
While the materials can scale, Wang is still working on implementation and design. His biggest challenge: he doesn’t know how to build a full-sized car tire. However, he continues to work with his team to scale the technology towards that point.

If you are looking for a way to pass on some of your assets to your family while reducing or eliminating gift or estate taxes, a charitable lead trust is an excellent option.
You make a contribution of your property to fund a trust that pays The Denver Foundation income for a number of years.
If you have any questions about charitable lead trusts, please contact us. We would be happy to assist you and answer any questions you might have and to provide you with an illustration demonstrating your specific tax benefits.
Zero Tax Plan - It is even possible to set up a lead trust that will allow you to transfer assets to your family with zero transfer taxes. The IRS assumes that a lead trust is only earning at the current low federal rate. If the actual investments of the trust produce a higher return than the payments made to The Denver Foundation over the term of the trust, then the full value of the trust may be transferred to family with zero gift tax.
FLP/Lead Trust Plan - To discount your gift to family even more, you may consider first transferring your real estate or other assets into a family limited partnership (FLP), which will fund your lead trust. The combination of the FLP, the lead trust and a gift exemption can permit the lead trust to pay income to us for a number of years and potentially transfer substantial assets tax-free to your family.
Increasing Payment Lead Trust - With increased volatility in the stock market, you may also want to consider creating a lead trust that makes fixed payments of increasing amounts to us over time. Because the payments to us are fixed, your family ultimately benefits from any growth in the trust. Low payouts in early years allow the trust to grow, thus allowing protection should the economy produce below-average returns in the future.
Grantor Lead Trust - A grantor lead trust permits you to transfer your cash or assets to a trust that will make gifts to charity for a number of years. At the end of the trust term, you receive the assets back from the trust.
Salary Increase for Teachers President Rodrigo Duterte has asked the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to find means to increase the salaries of teachers, Malacañang said Tuesday. A salary hike for teachers was discussed by the President during Monday afternoon’s Cabinet meeting, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque Jr. said Tuesday. Roque said Duterte “could be aiming” to double the entry salary for teachers, just as Congress approved a 100-percent increase in the base pay of military and other uniformed personnel in government. Roque said the proposal was “in connection with…

“The hate-crimes bill that’s called the Matthew Shepard bill is named after a very unfortunate incident that happened where a young man was killed, but we know that the young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery. It wasn’t because he was gay,” Foxx (R-NC 5) said during Wednesday’s House debate of hate-crimes legislation.
Shepard, a 21-year-old gay student at the University of Wyoming who was murdered in 1998, is often linked to hate-crimes legislation since his widely publicized killing was viewed as an anti-gay attack.
But Foxx said it is “a hoax” to use Shepard’s name for today’s hate-crimes bill, which includes new protections for gays and lesbians. She argued Democrats are only using it “as an excuse for passing these bills.”
With all my bitching about irresponsible pet owners and the obvious frustrations attendant with the problems they cause to the community, especially during times of budget shortfalls, it's time to recognize groups that working to solve the problem.
Research indicates that 80% of pet overpopulation comes from as few as 3% of pet owners who can't afford the cost of spay/neuter surgery.
In direct response to this reality, AnimalKind launched THE $20 FIX Program, a targeted financial assistance program serving low-income pet owners. Over 6000 pets have already been spayed or neutered for a client copay of $20 or less, and hundreds more have been approved for surgeries.
OK, i just sent them $50. I don't think i've ever done this before, but i'm going to ask my readers to join me in contributing to this cause. Just click here to donate. Want more info? Send an email to BethL AT animalkind DOT org.
DURHAM -- Durham County hosted the second of two Solid Waste Plan Management meetings Wednesday evening at Durham's East Regional Library.
County officials called the meeting to gain input from residents on revising their current waste management plan, but no one besides a county and city representative, both of whom work within waste management, came to the meeting.
"I think that sometimes solid waste, although it's an important issue, it sometimes gets forgotten," said county waste reduction specialist Brian Haynesworth. "I think people just trust the government to take care of it."
The 10-year plan details how the county will deal with solid waste issues including waste reduction and disposal, recycling and littering.
I've looked through my inbox, and i'm just not seeing any announcements from the city about this meeting. Don't know that i would have made it last night anyway, but without knowing about it, there was no chance i was going to be there.
North Carolina's pork lobby swings into action, following reports that poor management practices on hog farms in Mexico may have been a contributing factor in the spread of swine flu this spring:
The industry association for pork producers thinks the colloquial name for the virus being closely monitored by global health officials is inaccurate.
Following the lead of their national organization, they have suggested "North American influenza" — a variant on the other alternative name, "Mexican flu," which has upset some officials from that country.
In an e-mail to Dome, N.C. Pork Council spokeswoman Deborah Johnson said the linkage between pigs and the flu "should have never been made."
Fortunately, the virus does not appear to be as contagious as creeping veganism. (FYI - i had the barbecue at Charlie's on Ninth St. for lunch today. No ill effects so far.)
My husband XXXXX just found a dog on Leon St in our neighborhood. It's a white female and she appears to be pregnant. My neighbors report that she's been hanging out under a neighbor's house today and acting a little snarly. We have no experience with pregnant dogs but my husband thinks she may be very close to whelping. He is taking her to the animal hospital. If you know anything about this dog please email me. XXXXX asked me not to give any other identifying information as he fears someone might claim her to get the puppies. But the opposite is just as likely--that someone dumped her because they did not want the puppies. She has a collar but no tags. If she is microchipped the hospital will figure that out.
The followup email shared the info that the animal hospital wanted $1000 to deliver the puppies, which are due in the next 1-2 days. Which of course the good Samaritans who found the dog aren't in a position to pay. (Who is these days?)
But the real key is the highlighted sentence above. This is almost certainly another of Durham's abundance of unregistered dogs. We've got pretty much no money in the county budget for dealing with the thousands of dogs that make their way to the shelter each year, about 400 of which end up being euthanized, which is a polite way of saying killed.
But do any of our politicians think we need to come up with a better way of ensuring that the thousands of irresponsible dog owners bear the burden of the their irresponsibility and pay the full cost that they are currently making the rest of us bear?
Don't know if that means the owner simply contacted the animal shelter looking for their dog, and they were able to be hooked up with the people who found her, or if the dog was in fact registered. I sincerely hope it was the latter. But of course, the unanswered question remains, how do we incentivize spaying or neutering? Wouldn't it be reasonable to require anyone whose intact dog winds up at the shelter to neuter it as a condition of it being released? Wouldn't that save the rest of us a bunch of money in the long run?
Just wanted to note this article in the Guardian, especially in light of yesterday's post about the N&O's execrable reporting on animal issues. The significance of the N&O's failure to actually investigate issues of animal production is heightened, i think, by all this swine flu stuff.
Since its identification during the Great Depression, H1N1 swine flu had only drifted slightly from its original genome. Then in 1998 a highly pathogenic strain began to decimate sows on a farm in North Carolina and new, more virulent versions began to appear almost yearly, including a variant of H1N1 that contained the internal genes of H3N2 (the other type-A flu circulating among humans).
Researchers interviewed by Science worried that one of these hybrids might become a human flu (both the 1957 and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated from the mixing of bird and human viruses inside pigs), and urged the creation of an official surveillance system for swine flu: an admonition, of course, that went unheeded in a Washington prepared to throw away billions on bioterrorism fantasies.
But what caused this acceleration of swine flu evolution? Virologists have long believed that the intensive agricultural system of southern China is the principal engine of influenza mutation: both seasonal "drift" and episodic genomic "shift". But the corporate industrialisation of livestock production has broken China's natural monopoly on influenza evolution. Animal husbandry in recent decades has been transformed into something that more closely resembles the petrochemical industry than the happy family farm depicted in school readers.
In 1965, for instance, there were 53m US hogs on more than 1m farms; today, 65m hogs are concentrated in 65,000 facilities. This has been a transition from old-fashioned pig pens to vast excremental hells, containing tens of thousands of animals with weakened immune systems suffocating in heat and manure while exchanging pathogens at blinding velocity with their fellow inmates.
Last year a commission convened by the Pew Research Center issued a report on "industrial farm animal production" that underscored the acute danger that "the continual cycling of viruses … in large herds or flocks [will] increase opportunities for the generation of novel virus through mutation or recombinant events that could result in more efficient human to human transmission." The commission also warned that promiscuous antibiotic use in hog factories (cheaper than humane environments) was sponsoring the rise of resistant staph infections, while sewage spills were producing outbreaks of E coli and pfiesteria (the protozoan that has killed 1bn fish in Carolina estuaries and made ill dozens of fishermen).
Any amelioration of this new pathogen ecology would have to confront the monstrous power of livestock conglomerates such as Smithfield Farms (pork and beef) and Tyson (chickens). The commission reported systemic obstruction of their investigation by corporations, including blatant threats to withhold funding from cooperative researchers.
The N&O may have been inadvertently correct. Meat eating "as we know it" may be undergoing some profound changes in the future. But it will come about as a result of the failures of the meat production industry itself, not because a bunch of dirty fucking hippie vegans started lobbying the legislature.

Holy shit! Is someone asleep at the switch over at the Old Reliable? How else to explain the sheer idiocy of Ruth Sheehan's paean to irresponsible driving in today's edition?
Here's a clue - your car is only your private property when it's sitting on your driveway. Once you take it onto a public roadway, where its 3000 pounds moving at 40+ miles per hour is more than capable of killing and maiming, the rest of us have the right to tell you what you can and can't do when you're behind the wheel.
Yeah, i know. N&O columnists get paid to generate controversy. It pulls in eyeballs. I didn't realize that they got paid to write Teh Stupid.
Meanwhile, my friend (and former N&O editor RH) alerts me to this story, which is almost a text book case of irresponsible journalism.
North Carolina's meat industries are battling a bill the Humane Society of the United States and its vegan president say is meant to protect puppies, warning instead that it is the first step toward ending meat eating as we know it.
The House agriculture committee is expected soon to hear a bill pushed by the national Humane Society that regulates and imposes licensing for commercial dog breeding. Some dog enthusiasts oppose the bill but its proponents portray it as a crackdown on puppy mills, such as the one that was raided in Goldsboro in February because of unsanitary conditions. Officials from both Wayne County and the Humane Society of the United States removed about 300 dogs and puppies.
Somehow, from this and the fact that the director of HSUS is a vegan, the pork lobby is convinced that "(t)he public is very unaware that the Humane Society of the United States has a very direct agenda to eliminate the use of animals for food."
Well, actually, the reason why we're unaware of this, is that it's not true. But that doesn't stop staff writer Mark Johnson from making it the top quote in his article. He also misses completely when he writes "(Amanda) Arrington's arrival last year signaled the group's elevated interest in the state." Actually, Amanda's been here for a number of years, putting her money where her mouth is by founding and leading the Coalition to Unchain Dogs, a group we've been highly supportive of at DE. Her work in the local community far predates her position as director of the Humane society for North Carolina. But why let some facts get in the way of a good fear mongering session?
Finally, what the fuck does it even mean to say, "ending meat eating as we know it?" Does Johnson expect that we'll start growing synthetic protein in backyard fermenters? Or maybe he thinks that Soylent Green is going to be the next big thing.
Durham - Don't loosen your billboard restrictions. I hear Memphis is a beautiful city, but you'd never know it from the freeway. And those animated video billboards that our friends at Fairway want to bring to town? Hell, one of the billboards i passed was showing full motion video of dog racing in an ad for a greyhound track. Try keeping your eyes off that while your driving.
Speeding - Holy Cow! The speed limit on I-40 is 70 mph almost the whole length of the road, excepting some urban areas. From Albuquerque to the Mississippi River, i set the cruise at 70, and sat in with the flow of traffic. I don't think half a dozen cars passed me the whole 750 or so miles, and certainly all of the truckers were at the speed limit as well. As soon as we hit Memphis, aggressive driving became the norm. Even with a more visible police presence. Being passed by cars doing 85 or better, and weaving through multiple lanes of traffic seems to be an east of the river phenomenon. We also saw our only accident on the trip in western NC - someone had plowed into the car ahead of them at a pretty high rate of speed.
Barbecue - This wasn't a food excursion, and we didn't have too many opportunities to appreciate the regional barbecue variations along the way. But it's hard to imagine anyone does it any better than the Pig Out Palace in Henryetta OK. Even the sweet potatoes were delicious, and i am not a fan of the yam. Worth seeking out if you're passing through Oklahoma. If they only served beer. . .
Folk with a mental age of four will be amused to know that Chelsea are going to sign CSKA Moscow genius Yuri Zhirkov. They are also eyeing up Stefan Kuntz, Bernt Haas, Brian Pinas, Danny Shittu and Uwe Fuchs. Oh, and Emmanuel Adebayor.
Asked about board cooperation, Bowser said: "As far as working with Ellen and Becky, I'm not going to work with them in their underhanded dirt-slinging. I'm not going to do that."
Christ, it's going to be a long four years. Hopefully we can minimize the damage he can do by keeping him outvoted, as Monday's vote on the 751 development points the way. harder to predict is the effect that his poisonous utterings will have on the greater political discourse in Durham while he sits in office and beyond.
Let's hope Michael Page comes to his senses and realizes that allying himself with someone like Bowser is not good for either Page or Durham.
Reading the article it's clear that they meant to use the word procrastinates, as in, she hasn't made up her mind whether she's running for reelection in 2010 as Alaska's governor, or seeking the GOP nomination for president in 2012.
I'm enjoying a lovely cup of tea this morning as i contemplate withholding my overpriced services from the poor masses.
I don't know the details except that there are 2 Animal Control truck around the greenway searching and warning folks about a rabid pit bull. FYI!!!
Rabid dogs in one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. And Durham still doesn't have a plan to bring the majority of dog owners into compliance with the simple requirement to register your dog with the county and vaccinate it against rabies.
I just spoke with Lt Duarte at Animal Control. Apparently there was a sighting of a loose red pit bull (thought to be the same one involved in the tragic incident a few weeks ago) around Ruffin St. earlier today. I saw the officers shortly after noon warning people on the green way. The rabid part may have been commentary, not actual circumstance. Sorry to cause extra alarm bells. I was just reporting what was told to me. The officers sent out did not see the dog, but they have asked us to be vigilant in calling with information about this particular dog.
Let me try to understand this. Two dogs attacked and killed another dog on the greenway several weeks ago. One was taken to the shelter where, as far as i've been able to learn, it was kept long enough to determine whether or not it may have been infected with rabies. I have not heard that anyone ever came to claim that dog. Now, a potential sighting of the second dog (which was an intact male) draws AC officers out to the site, and they make a casual comment about the dog having rabies? What could possibly have caused that?
I mean, it's probably safe to assume that neither of these dogs were vaccinated, but if we know that the dog that was captured was rabid, shouldn't we be doing a little bit more to find the second dog? And if we don't know that, shouldn't we be a little more careful about saying something like this?
A New York Times article on the practice of "doga," or yoga classes that people are taking with their dogs, included this:
Kari Harendorf, 38, teaches doga in Manhattan. “Jobs are disappearing,” she said. “Mortgage payments are looming. Change is everywhere, but your dog remains steadfast. So, why not spend time together?”
Ms. Harendorf links yoga to reductions in stress hormones, like cortisol, and blood pressure. “People always ask me, ‘Do dogs need yoga?’ ” she said. “I say, ‘No, you need yoga. But your dog needs your attention, and bonding with your pet is good for your health.’ ”
She is saying something many dog owners already know: Were it not for their pets, many people would never take daily walks in the park. By extension, it’s easy to see how taking your dog to doga may be a surefire way to make certain you do yoga yourself.
So, what does it mean for those folks who think that the appropriate way to bond with their dog is to tie it to the nearest tree and splash some water in its dish every other day or so?
I don't really have an opinion as to whether the Mayor's proposal to come up with a budget that doesn't change the property tax rate is a good thing or not. Like many of you, i'm interested in seeing just what services get cut in the name of holding taxes steady, and hoping that federal stimulus money picks up some of the slack.
On the other hand, i'm sure Patrick Baker wishes that the mayor had been more up front and public about what he was willing to see the tax rate go to during last year's budget cycle. As you'll recall, Patrick Baker, then the city manager, put forth a pretty decent budget to the public, only to have Mayor Bell ride in on his white horse to save us from a larger tax hike.
So these guys were doing the community a good deed by picking up just about anything that was recyclable once a month.
Haven't quite finished the revamping of the visual aspects, but that's coming. We did manage to finish the kitchen redo, i've yanked most of the invasive Chinese privet out of the back, cleaned out the garage (bad news? Philco Recycling Services, the guys who used to be in the Whole Foods parking lot recycling everything one Saturday a month, seem to have bailed, and i've got a car full of styrofoam and plastic that needs a new home) we have a pretty good idea of what we want to do with a deck in the back yard, and i got all of the Steely Dan vinyl re-digitized with the new turntable, and it sounds great.
I was kinda hoping that Durham would get its shit together while i was gone, so i wouldn't feel any pressure to come back, if you know what i mean. That detoxing can get kinda addictive in its own right.
Kevin's already been writing about the earlier this week about noting that Durham has $1.2 million in unpaid fines that it isn;t collecting. These fines have been levied against landlords for various code violations. The city isn't collecting the money because it can't use it to balance the budget, but instead has to turn it over to Durham Public Schools. So collecting it hasn't been a high priority.
Most of us don't know the difference between the various branches of local government. It's all "Durham" to us. And those of us who do understand the difference? We don't give a fuck. The fines aren't to help the school system pay for after-school programs, although that's a nice benefit. The fines are to discourage rotten landlord behavior. And for those of us who live next to houses that are owned by rotten landlords, you can't fine them fast enough to start changing their behavior. Hopefully Tom Bonfield gets it, and rather quickly, how bad this makes the city look.
Meanwhile, some moron with a couple of pit bulls let them run loose on the greenway between the Duke Park and Trinity Park neighborhoods about 2 weeks ago, where they attacked and killed another dog being walked by a 10 year old.
The County Animal Control Deparatment managed to take one of the dogs into custody, but not the other one. As of last week, the second dog was still considered to be at-large. I've talked to a number of people who use the greenway regularly who have stopped using it. The county is pretty lucky that only a dog was killed.
No one has claimed the dog that was picked up, so there is apparently no way to find out who owned the dog that is still loose. In fact, when i attended the meeting of the Animal Control Advisory Board last Tuesday night, the director of the shelter said that she could not be certain that the dog had not been turned in by its owner to be euthanized.
I asked that, since the shelter puts down approximately 80 dogs per week, how many pit bulls matching that description might have been put down over the past week. She couldn't tell me that, only that about 60% of the dogs euthanized at the shelter were pit bulls.
I was kinda surprised that almost all of the discussion at the ACAB centered around the 911 response to the emergency callas placed during the dog attack. Yes, clearly there's some protocols that need to be changed at 911 when it comes to dangerous animal issues. The county only has one Animal Control officer on duty during the hours of 5pm to 8am, and on the weekends. That's a lot of hours to have that minimal coverage, and it makes sense to me to have the police brought into the picture more readily when AC officers might be otherwise occupied, as apparently the officer on duty two Mondays ago was.
But that's not the only problem here. There's was lots of heated discussion on various local listservs about potential solutions, but pretty much everybody agreed that there's an abundance of "irresponsible" pet owners in Durham. (Personally, i think irresponsible to too gentle a word for a great many of those folks, but i'll use it for this discussion.) There's a lot more that needs to be done in that area. Moving the animal license fee over to the tax people is a very small first step that will, hopefully, get the number of unregistered pets in Durham county down from the 60% or so level (you read that right - Cindy Bailey at Animal Control estimates the number of unlicensed dogs and cats in Durham at around 60% of the total population). But then what?
What penalties accrue to not registering your animal? Or not getting it vaccinated? Or letting it run around, intact, making more unwanted puppies? Or worse, breeding your dog for fighting? Let's not pretend that isn't a huge problem in Durham.
Here's another thing. I don't know how detailed the minutes of the ACAB get, or even if they get published on the county website. Last i looked i couldn't find them.
The director of the animal shelter raised a concern during the discussion about 911 that getting the police involved in potentially dangerous animal situations is going to lead to more innocent animals being shot by poorly trained officers.
Physician, heal thyself. Apparently, you already knew about this incident at the time you were complaining about the police being involved in dangerous animal situations because it might lead to innocent animals being killed. Personally, i'm willing to take that risk, if it means that the likelihood of some kid getting mauled by someone's fighting dogs is minimized. But really, the irony of the animal shelter director, who's just suspended an employee for putting down the wrong dog, complaining about the risk that the police might get trigger happy is just too delicious.

3 (free) things that journalists can do right now to protect their data and their sources at the border
First up, I've been stalking the Bumble and Bumble line of products for years. My stylist Kazue uses them every time I go in for a cut and my hair would have that perfect "I woke up like this" look for days (of course until I have to reluctantly wash it down the drain). I decided to start off small and picked up the Does It All Styling Spray which is a heat protecting, light holding, brushable setting mist for all your daily needs. It sounded great for those days I'm not into layering a ton of product and just want something quick, easy, done. Next came the Oribe Apres Beach Wave and Shine Spray I picked up at IMATS after being generously misted by the sales lady at the booth. Not only did it smell delicious (and I assume this would be exactly what JLO smells like on the regular as the range was created by her stylist), I loved how it gave my curled hair great definition without feeling gritty or sticky. In the bag it went. Lastly, in a new experimental hair routine, I've been testing the Pureology Precious Oil* as a hair conditioning treatment in lieu of conditioner on days where I am just not in the mood to smother myself in thick heavy products. It's formulated to be super versatile as a pre-treatment, hair mask booster or a styling aid. More experimentation is still in progress but I'm sure loving that my hair smells amazing every day.
So for all you hair masters out there, what is your favourite high end hair product or what hair item makes you feel extra sassy? I want to know!

Abstract: Personal records of U.S. Representative Abe Goff, including clippings, scrapbooks, photographs, and correspondence. Also records relating to his career in the military, his law office in Moscow, and his political career, including service as Soliciter for the Post Office Dept. and as Interstate Commerce Commission commissioner.
Since the papers in this record group were received at several different times over a six year period there was no order to the material, therefore the material was sorted by activity and a series arrangement imposed during processing. Each series was arranged alphabetically. Most material was in labeled folders when received; the original folder headings were retained and in most cases the original order within the folders was also retained.The majority of the papers were considered personal and were placed in series one. Included are biographies and clippings about Goff; correspondence, including over 100 letters he wrote to Florence between 1939 and 1967; engagement calendars of both Abe and Florence; certificates and plaques; invitations and memorabilia from presidential inaugurations from 1953 to 1967; income tax returns and supporting documentation from 1966 to 1983; and speeches given on patriotic occasions or to high school and college audiences. There is also a large collection of photographs which include old family photographs, pictures of Abe, Florence and their children, Abe's military photographs and official photographs from the Post Office Department and Interstate Commerce Commission. Finally there are scrapbooks and memorabilia belonging to Florence, Annie, and Tim. Most of the material in Florence's scrapbook was loose, and only a few pages were used. Therefore the scrapbook was disassembled and only Goff related material retained from the loose clippings.Material related to Goff's political career is in series two. Included are a certificate of election to the Idaho state senate; and campaign brochures and expense records, a legislative scrapbook, testimony given before congressional committees, copies of speeches delivered in Congress, his voting record and office filed on bills concerning the Post Office and veterans affairs, all relating to his two years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Other material concerns his unsuccessful bid for a second term in the House in 1948 and the Senate primary race in 1950.Series three contains material relating to Goff's Moscow law practice. Items in this series include correspondence, a portion of the "M:" case files, financial and other reports of the prosecuting Attorney's Association for which Goff was treasurer, quarterly and yearly social security, withholding reports and workman's compensation information, and a file of uncompleted work.Goff served in both World War I and II and then continued in the Reserves. His records of this aspect of his life are contained in series four. Among these materials are Army Records, especially those dealing with his service in Eritrea, an oversize frame containing his medals, folders on military justice, and a military reserve certificate.The few folders concerning Goff's Post Office career are in series five and include clippings and correspondence.The final series contains material relating to Goff's career in the Interstate Commerce Commission. Included among these records are clippings, notes on cases or topics before the commission, correspondence and inter-office memos, speeches, testimony before congress while chairman of the commission, and correspondence and clippings concerning his non re-appointment to the commission in 1967.Most of the material in the collection was in legal size folders; these were changed to letter size. Discarded from the collection were bank statements and paid checks, blank report forms, blank stock certificates, duplicate campaign material, duplicate near print material, greeting cards, unused post cards, programs for events Goff may have attended, news paper clippings not relating to Goff or his family, and a reel to reel tape recording of an unidentified music recital. Yearbooks from Moscow High School were added to the Special Collections yearbook collection and government documents were sent to the Government Documents Department of the library. This reduced the records by 15cubic feet.
The records of Abe McGregor Goff span the years 1905 to 1985, with the bulk of the material covering the years 1928 to 1971.
Included in the records are personal papers including photographs and scrapbooks of family members, and material concerning his career as politician, lawyer, military officer, post office solicitor, and member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
As will be noticed in the following inventory the career records are sketchy. More extensive records for the Post Office and Interstate Commerce Commission as well as personal papers will be found in an earlier Goff collection, MG 148. Both inventories should be consulted by researchers since the collections complement each other
Abe Goff was born in Colfax, Washington, December 21, 1899, the fourth son of Herbert W. and Mary Francis (Dorsey) Goff. The middle name of McGregor, his wife's mother's maiden name, was assumed in April 1945 during his military service. In addition to his three brothers he had one younger sister. He left high school from September 1917 to February 1918 to serve as a private in the Washington State National Guard during World War I. He returned to school and graduated in 1918. While at Colfax High School he was on both the track and football teams.
Working his way through the University of Idaho he held such jobs as day laborer in a lumber mill, construction worker, plumbers helper, dish washer, and was also sexton at St. Mark's Episcopal Church. He also found time to participate in dramatics, where he appeared in many plays including the part of the Indian Chief in "The Light on the Mountain", in football where his exploits earned him one of the first spots in the University of Idaho Athletic Hall of Fame, and in campus politics where he was elected president of the Freshman Class for the third quarter, and in April 1923 he ran for president of the ASUI, but was defeated by Talbot Jennings. He was also active in the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.
Goff was a cadet colonel in the university ROTC regiment and was commissioned 2nd lieutenant in the infantry reserve in February 1923. In 1933 he transferred to the Judge Advocate General's Department as a Captain, and when called to active duty had risen to Major.
After graduating from the University of Idaho Law School in 1924 he was admitted to the Idaho Bar and joined the law office of C.J. Orland. His first case, which he lost, was defending a West Virginian accused of making moonshine. In addition to his law practice Goff was football coach at Moscow High School for several years, and also a lay reader at the Episcopal Church in Colfax.
He was appointed Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for Latah County in 1924 and elected to the position of Prosecuting Attorney in 1926, serving successive terms through 1934.
On August 24, 1927 Abe Goff married Florence Letitia Richardson, a 1923 graduate of the University of Idaho, who was a physical education teacher at the university. They had two children, Timothy Richardson and Annie McGregor.
In 1940 he was elected state senator after an unsuccessful primary campaign for the nomination as U.S. Senator. As state senator he introduced and secured passage of a bill recognizing the power of the Supreme Court to make rules governing procedure in all courts in Idaho. He also introduced bills amending the community property statutes.
In August 1941 he was recalled to active duty as a Major, later being promoted to Colonel, in the Judge Advocate General's Department. One of the first officers to go overseas, in February 1942 he was sent to Africa and the Middle East as legal advisor to the U.S. Military North African Mission, headquartered with the British army in Cairo. He was with the British during Rommel's advance across Africa in the spring of 1942, and also saw duty in Italian East Africa and Iran. He was military envoy to Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and military escort of Madame Chaing Kai-shek during her visit to Eritrea.
Returning to the United States after sixteen months in Africa, Goff served as assistant chief of the International Law Division in the office of the Judge Advocate General and as Special Council for the War Department in numerous cases in Federal Courts throughout the U.S. involving the constitutionality of wartime powers exercised by army area commanders, and later served as Deputy Director of the U.S. War Crimes Office. He went to London as senior War Department representative to the Allied War Crimes Conference in 1945 and served in Europe and the Pacific area setting up procedures for the prosecution of war criminals. While assigned to General McArthur's staff in Tokyo he organized the International Prosecution Section for the trial of Tojo and other Japanese war criminals, but did not participate in the prosecutions.
He returned to the U.S. and the office of the Under Secretary of War in the spring of 1946 to serve, until relieved from duty in September 1946, as a member of a special clemency board charged with reviewing sentences of convicted military prisoners. He was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Army Commendation Medal, and eight other service or campaign medals.
In 1946, while still on active duty, he was nominated as the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives seat held by Compton White, Sr. He won this election, and, as a member of the 80th Congress was elected president of the 80th Club, a group composed of 74 first year House Republicans; other officers were J. Caleb Boggs, vice-president, and Richard Nixon, secretary. Goff was also a member of the Committee on Agriculture and of the Speaker's Steering Committee for the House. In 1948 he was defeated in his bid for re-election by White when the First District voted heavily for Truman.
Following this defeat he, returned to active military duty for six months on a special assignment dealing with the new code for courts-martial, as chairman of a Board of Review in the office of the Army Judge Advocate General.
In the summer of 1949 he returned to Moscow to resume his law practice, this time alone, Orland having died in the interim. It was not until 1953, just shortly before going to Washington, D.C., that he took in a new partner, Cope Gale of St. Maries. Following the death of U.S. Senator Bert Miller in 1950, Goff attempted to gain the nomination for his seat, but lost out to former Senator Henry Dworshak.
Following the Eisenhower victory in 1952, Goff wrote many letters to colleagues asking for assistance in getting a federal appointment. His chance came in December 1953, when, at the request of Postmaster Arthur Summerfield, he went to Washington, D.C. to accept the position of Solicitor of the Post Office, a title which was later changed to General Council. His appointment became effective February 1, 1954.
He resigned his Post Office position when President Eisenhower named him to fill Owen Clarke's unexpired Interstate Commerce Commission term. His appointment was confirmed by the Senate on January 30, 1958 and he took his oath of office on February 12. On December 29, 1959, he was reappointed for a full seven-year term. In April 1963 he replaced Donald McPherson as Vice Chairman of the Commission, and in 1964 his colleagues elected him Chairman. Although he had the unanimous endorsement of industry and the practitioners, President Johnson chose not to reappointment him when his term expired in December 1966. Goff remained on the commission until July 1967 when his replacement, Grant Syphers, was confirmed. In Goff's words: "Apparently I am too staunch a Republican and advocate of the independence of the Commission to be reappointed by this highly partisan administration."
Since he was within two years of mandatory retirement when he left the Interstate Commerce Commission, Goff decided to return to Moscow, Idaho, where he spent the remaining 17 years of his life. After several months of ill health, Abe Goff died on Friday, November 23, 1984. He was survived by his wife and daughter, his son having died previously.
He was a member of and held national offices in the Idaho State Bar Association, American Bar Association, American Society of International Law, American Judicature Society, Federal Bar Association, and Judge Advocates Association. He was admitted to practice before the U.S. Supreme Court, U.S. Court of Military Appeals, Supreme Court of the Philippines, and the Supreme Court of Idaho. He was also a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Reserve Officers Association, The Military Order of the Carabao, Beta Theta Pi fraternity, Masons, and Elks. He was a longtime member of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Moscow and served as its treasurer for many years while an attorney in town.
The records of Abe Goff were donated to the University of Idaho Library by his daughter Annie Goff between February 1990 and June 1993. An additional donation was received from the Latah County Historical Society in February 1996.

Years later on, he offers up his position offer of teaching on the Avonlea faculty to ensure Anne may perhaps Reside at Green Gables, on which The 2 reconcile and develop into great friends (and ultimately marry).
If the novel Anne of Green Gables was first released in 1908, most of the people could only aspiration of visiting its magical setting.

However, the following explains a basic overview of both.
Paid advertising such as creating and using ads on the Google AdWords platform, generally has an associated cost for each ad click. This is a great way to skip the organics and go straight to the top within the ad sections (generally top and bottom) and start raising brand awareness, signing people up or selling products right away, depending on your goal. This does have an associated ongoing cost, seeing as each click costs. Well worth it if the acquisition cost and cost of goods is below the total sales price, because you are making profit, but that’s where SEO differentiates itself.
SEO has to do with organic rankings, what that means is that it appears in search results naturally without having to pay for clicks. No matter how many clicks you get, that traffic will always be free. Getting a lot of this traffic primarily entails getting onto page 1 or 2 or search results that are most relevant to your business. In order to do this, however, you need a time machine to go back in time when no one was doing SEO and there was little or no competition for your industry online, or if you’re still in 2018 you need an SEO engineer. Yes, an engineer! This is because the internet has become flooded with websites and businesses, and rising above the competition requires the methodical approach and the surgical precision of a brain surgeon. This involves editing website code, decreasing inefficiencies, keyword weaving, link sculpting, working with title content, meta descriptions and much more as part of an intensive data driven strategic plan. It takes some serious expertise and some hard work to get results and appease Google’s indexing algorithms.
Whether you are only considering SEO or considering other services as well we would love to discuss search engine optimization with you and explore the best routes to get your business greater exposure online and a greater resulting customer base.
with the product and quality of service we've received since handing over our website and marketing goals to Cornerstone! It took our last company weeks to do what this team does in hours. You can tell they pride themselves on response time and it shows! Everyone we've worked with at Cornerstone has been amazing and their level of customer service is truly exceptional!
Cornerstone saved me from a terrible experience. They're prompt, professional and incredibly creative. They're basically mind-readers, which helps a ton because I had no room left on my plate. It's great to have people in your corner you can trust!
Mark is absolutely an awesome guy and has a great business. They'll be upfront and honest with you. He gave us feedback and a new perspective on advertising for our business.
We had such bad experiences with other marketing companies, but not Cornerstone! Everyone on the team is always quick to respond. We used to wait months; now we wait hours! In just weeks they created a website beyond what we could imagine & we get compliments on it daily!
Mark & Devon are the two Kings of Google. Not only do they have a corner on their craft, but they also gave me, as the client, the laymen terms on what they were going to do for my company (and had much patience along the way, as it's all very foreign to me). If you are going to dive into this type of marketing, then Cornerstone is your go to.
The dyewizard is loose and this time his fibre of choice is none other than MOHAIR. Thats right silky, shiny almost as soft as angora (grin) mohair. We had an opportunity to support another local farm who is starting out with mohair goats and made a large purchase of her glorious roving - we're dyeing it in 8 ounce lots and the colours are FABULOUS!! We'll be selling this fibre for $25 for 8 ounces. All fund will be used to support the dye artist known as Jared to help fund his summer vacation trips to the zoo and the baseball tournament in August.
Last Saturday I had the privledge of attending the annual Gathering of Spinners and Knitters in Port Hope. What a fun day!!! Lots of goodies including a lamb bbq (organically grown and oh soooo good) -ignore that last post Maggie and don't tell Whizzaroo. It was great fun to watch old and new spinners come together for fun and fellowship. My MIL Barb came with me to help man the booth so I too could have some fun spinning and chatting. Here's some pics!!
Thought this article was interesting -with all the clamour about green fibre. as far as I'm concerned wool and angora are two of the ultimate "green" fibres -think about it no chemicals needed to grow or process, use right off the animal and hey they are renewable resources and best of all their "byproduct" is a natural fertilizer for my gardens ;)
(Oct 2, 2007) Found in your favourite Chinese dishes and on the floors of many modern homes, bamboo has made its way into another key aspect of our lives -- clothing. But just how green is this verstaile new fabric with is variety of benefits?
The beauty and benefits of bamboo fibre go far beyond the surface. More affordable than silk, bamboo has a similar drape (how softly it floats on your body) and is slightly stronger, along with having a natural sheen. Unlike silk, bamboo can easily be tossed into a washer and dryer, making it much simpler to take care of. Also wrinkle-resistant, bamboo can be ironed at a low temperature if ever needed and has very little shrinkage.
Due to the fabric’s natural structure, bamboo is very breathable, helping the wearer to stay cool in the summer and warmer in the winter, making it perfect for layers and exercise wear. Thanks to a natural agent in the plant itself, bamboo is also highly anti-bacterial, absorbing three to four times more water than cotton fabric without sticking to your skin.
These are all spectacular benefits and it is hard to believe that there are downsides to this advanced textile … but there is.
While the bamboo plant has many uses and has quickly become a key source of income for many rural citizens of China, the issues behind the production of bamboo fabric have begun to surface. During a recent investigative mission, the Organic Clothing blog from Lotus Organics uncovered detailed information about how dangerous chemicals are used to transform the plant into liquid and then into fibres to be spun into fabric. These chemicals can cause a plethora of health problems and neural disorders for the manufacturing workers. With no Fair Trade certifications or sustainable production credentials, a developing nation like China rarely (if at all) uses systems to help control the production and disposal of those chemicals.
Seeing bamboo as a "greener" substitute for silk, many designers are clamoring to use it in their collection, including couture and everyday brands. This high demand has forced Chinese manufacturers to begin clearing out natural forests in order to plant more fast-growing bamboo. On top of this, many cultivators are starting to use fertilizers that wouldn’t meet U.S. organic standards in order to increase the yield of their plantations. Additional weeding and tilling of the land in turn leads to increased soil erosion in these areas.
Last but not least, China is currently the only manufacturer of bamboo fabric, making it impossible to look for an alternative, local source for this textile. While bamboo can be easily grown in many areas, there are no factories in North America that have the machines to chemically manufacture bamboo fibres. The Chinese have hundreds of generations of experience in growing bamboo - so far, a number of Americans have begun to try grow their own in their backyard, quickly finding that this tall grass can easily overtake all of their land.
To buy or not to buy - that is the question. If you are planning on purchasing bamboo goods, the key is to look for some kind, ANY kind, of certification (though there is yet to be any kind of international standard for bamboo). The natural benefits available within the bamboo plant are wide, but a more sustainable manufacturing process is still needed to make this fabric truly green; til then, your best (and more eco) alternative is still organic cotton.

Holy cow when did it happen? How did it happen?? Just yesterday I became a mom. Holding the most beautiful little boy in the world. Feeling like I had won the lottery in the great big game of Life. And now I turn around and my baby isn't a baby anymore? Jared is a blessing of the greatest kind. There is no other little boy in the world quite like him and I thank God for him every day. He's warm, caring and so funny at times. He thinks of things deeply and shows me and others around him the beauty and mysteries of life. He's also the one of a kind "dyewizard" who's creations are admired worldwide -we just sent a second shipment to Australia to a fan!
Jared came screaming (me not him) into the world at 11:16pm on April 16th after 4 days of labour. He was HUGE at 8lbs 14oz at least to me. We came home on Saturday and the first visit we made was to my Beppe. It didn't matter to me that I could barely walk from all the stitches -it had to be this way. We still have the pictures that show so clearly the joy his arrival brought to her. My favorite is a picture of their hands together -hers so worn by the world and weary -his firm and strong ready to grab the world with both hands. She left us three months to the day later and eeirly enough his time of birth is her time of death -another reminder of the great circle we all live in.
Today at school was "wacky hair day" -appropriately enough Jared dyed his hair green and purple with some shots of electric blue. He's my handsome boy before and after -check out those beautiful eyes -sigh going to have to beat the girls off with a stick -oh wait too late they're already calling for him constantly. But they're all his "friends" no romance on his part. Don't ask about his soon to be wife or so she informs me -they're going to have bunkbeds and get married at 12 and live with us LOL.
So here was the challenge issued at Cornerstone Fibres- 4 boxes of easter egg dye, 1 pound of merino/ blend sock yarn and the dyewizard himself Jared - the deal to make 4lots of yarn creating as many colours as he could with the dye tabs. Jared's exact response "so what do I get WHEN I win" -not if you'll note. The result -pictured here. So what do you think -did the dyewizard outdo himself and win the gameboy game he wheeled and dealed for -you be the judges :)
I could not help myself -I swear the devil made me do it. Jared who is almost 10 is so hard to get up in the mornings-every morning he grumbles and doesn't want to get up. Yesterday being Apri 1st I decided to test a theory about how to get him moving. When I went it in to his room he rolled over and told me he didn't want to get up. I told him it was okay he didn't have to get up as it was a snow day. He LEAPED out of bed and pulled back the curtains all excited. I replied April Fools and now that you're up you can get dressed for school. he looked at me and told me he didn't like me very much. Later on when he got home from school he laughed about it :) Who says grown ups can't have fun with the jokes too.
a small at home business specializing in fibre, angora rabbits and so much more! Also home to Jazzy Dyesigns by Jared a small exclusive dye artist aged 13 who is creating one of a kind rovings for the world to enjoy.

>Media Center>News Room>PCL Insider – March 2017 – Housing and Transportation Bills Dominating Capitol, PCL Agenda (dup)
Legislators have responded to the state’s decades-long housing affordability problem by introducing close to 150 related bills this year. The approaches range from increased financing for apartments to repealing restrictions on rent control to requiring local governments to exercise their land use control to better meet Californians’ housing needs.
With a long history of fighting for smart land use policy, PCL is neck-deep in these discussions. We’re advocating for land use and finance policies that give all Californians the option of living closer to their jobs, good schools, and other common destinations.
We are also articulating the importance of solid environmental review to ensure taxpayers aren’t stuck with long-term negative consequences that are only revealed through such analysis. This is a careful balance, important to the long-term health of our cherished environment and residents.
AB 73 Planning and zoning: housing sustainability districts. (Chiu) (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB73) Allows cities and counties to create “housing sustainability districts” and receive state funding in exchange for scaled-back local review of individual projects.
AB 1585 Planning and zoning: affordable housing: single application. (Bloom) (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1585) Creates a state board to hear appeals of local development denials if the development would help meet local housing needs.
SB 35 Planning and zoning: affordable housing: streamlined approval process. (Wiener) (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1585) Reduces localities’ ability to deny proposed developments when they aren’t meeting specific percentages of their designated housing needs.
PCL has not yet taken a formal position on any of these measures, but is working with the author’s offices.
We’re also weighing-in on one of this year’s other major issues: increasing revenue for fixing roads and improving transit systems. Senator Jim Beall’s SB 1 (Transportation funding) (http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1) would raise $5.6 billion annually, while expanding a CEQA exemption for road repairs, creating an Advance Mitigation Program, and making a variety of other change to state transportation policies.
PCL and a large coalition of equity, environmental, and transportation advocates sent an “oppose unless amended” letter to legislators earlier this year. We are meeting with senators and assemblymembers who value the state’s environment and expanded mobility options to push for amendments before the bill goes to Governor Brown.
For additional information on any bill, see leginfo.legislature.ca.gov. You can reach Julie Snyder, PCL’s lobbyist, at julie@equityadvocates.net.

"When any CPU includes hardware that decides to redirect the CPU’s attention to a new program…" – Near Future Laboratory
“When any CPU includes hardware that decides to redirect the CPU’s attention to a new program regardless of the nature of the current program we have an interrupt. […] A program comes to a presumably rare situation where the CPU cannot obey the program given the unusual state of the computation. This is a situation that is either unanticipated by the programmer, or anticipated but inefficient to explicitly program for. An example of the latter is division by zero where the application author has not yet decided what to do in such an unlikely event. I call these traps here and say that the program has been trapped.”
We unintentionally overlooked laws that require even foreign employees to be paid based on local US standards.
Friday: I just got back from a dance hosted by the Black Student Union. And yes, it was pretty much as awesome as that sounds.
Dances aren't really my thing. My first dance was 8th grade formal, and it was horrid. My second dance was homecoming junior year, and it was horrid. My third dance was senior prom and it was pretty awesome! I felt like a real fancy gal, I had a great time with friends, they actually played a few good songs, it wasn't hard to avoid the grinders. Now I've been to my fourth dance, and I can say that it definitely falls closer to Prom on the scale. For one thing, the whole night, I think I heard one cuss word in one song. For another thing, no one took off any articles of clothing!!!!!! (the same cannot be said of my homecoming experience, cough cough, you know who you are Magic Mike wannabe). For another thing, there was no grinding circle! In fact, the grinding was kept to a bare minimum. And even the grinding I did see (which was honestly maybe four couples?) was nowhere near as sexual and disgusting as that of public school dances.
There was honestly just an air of fun, no pressure at all to look good or meet a mate or whatever. It wasn't a dress up dance, so there were people there in t-shirts and jeans, and some people in casual dresses, and some people in between.
While I'll admit that there were moments when I was acutely aware of my whiteness, on the grander scale, I wasn't really paying attention to anyone and I'm sure no one was paying attention to me. It was a very welcome escape, and a great end to the week. I would say that I'm still not super into dances, so I definitely won't be going to every dance that comes up. But it was nice to just throw caution and inhibition to the wind for once and actually go have fun with a big group of people. It was nice because I felt like I could actually do that comfortably at a school like this. Now I'm like dead tired, which is a good thing, because it means I'll sleep really well!
Sunday: I almost didn't go to church today. I had to work the closing shift at the Union on Saturday night again, so I didn't get back to the dorm until 12:45, and then I had to take a shower, so needless to say, when I woke up I was so, so tired. Plus, I think I'm getting a cold. I just really was not feeling it. But then I thought about how we're doing a video series in Sunday School, and how if I missed today, then it might not make sense next week. That and a couple other things convinced me that I should go. (Word to the wise: every time you really don't feel like going to church, that's probably the time when you need to go the most.) I'm so glad I actually dragged my butt out of bed and went, because the whole thing was awesome. Here are a few reasons why:
There were only four people on the bus today, two upperclassmen girls that I'd seen there before, and one new girl that I hadn't. I thought maybe she was a freshman trying out a new church, but after talking to her, it turns out she's actually a sophomore and she went to Slate Hill last year, and had just not gotten to come the past few weeks because she went home a couple times. She's from New York and her name is Abby. She was really nice and easy to talk to. We sat together during the sermon and then again during Sunday School.
Apparently, Slate Hill has a group of people from Laos who meet in the basement of the church every week to have services in Lao. They come up for the English service every now and then, although many of them do not speak English. They came up today and shared a song in Lao, and then one of their members, Sing Saengye (I probably butchered that spelling) gave his testimony and was baptized after church. I didn't get to see the actual baptism because the bus dropped me off near my dorm and the baptism was happening down by the covered bridge. But I really enjoyed the testimony. Parts of it were difficult to understand because Sing doesn't speak a lot of English, but what I gathered was that Sing came from a Buddhist family in Laos, and then came to the United States to live with his cousin and younger brother, and accepted Christ in 2012. Then he went back to Laos to engage his now wife and get her a visa to come to America with him. Then last year he was in and out of the hospital with blood clots, which were diagnosed as cancerous earlier this year, and he's on a journey of chemotherapy right now. He said "I want to tell you two short stories that help me to believe that God is real. When I went to go engage my wife, they told me that the process of getting her a visa and getting all the paperwork to go through would take 6 to 8 months. It was finished in 4 months. Then we come to America and they tell us it will take 4 months to process more paperwork here. It took less than 3. When I was in Laos, my family asked me what changed, why I now believe in God and not Buddha. I told them that God is always kindness, God is always love, and I can see God moving in my life". It was really touching. He also said that he doesn't know what's going to happen with his cancer, but that he's confidant that God will heal him. If everyone had faith like that, just so black and white, imagine what we could do as a world! After he spoke, the elders of the church, and the members of the Lao fellowship, and some people from the congregation surrounded him and laid hands on him and prayed for his healing and his baptism, and it reminded me so much of my own church back home. Sing was so adorable too, he had the biggest smile on his face the whole time. It was endearing. And the whole thing just goes to show that the love of God surpasses any language barrier. Hearing Sing up there so joyful, speaking in the best English he knew how. It was really really cool.
Slate Hill also has like a partnership type thing with a local home for Special Needs individuals, so today during the service, the ushers each had a partner with special needs and they helped them pass out the offering plates. It was so adorable watching these like ten year old boys helping 50 something year old handicapped people take the offering. I'm so glad I didn't miss that.
This kind of goes along with the last one because Ulli Klemm, one of the assistant Sunday School teachers for the class I'm in came in and gave us each a flyer. He does work with the special needs home, and they have a fun night one Friday a month that anyone from the college can go to and hang out with the people from the special needs home, watching movies and eating snacks or making crafts and stuff. And literally on Thursday when I was eating dinner with my peer mentor, I was telling her how I was thinking of going to the Agape center to see if there were any organizations I could join to get involved with special needs. And then boom, I don't even have to ask anyone! I can just hop on a bus once a month and go spend time with people at the Cumberland Vista Group Home. And if I hadn't come to church today, I wouldn't have gotten a flyer and wouldn't have known about that opportunity.
The sermon and Sunday School class were both about hope, which was exactly what I needed to hear about today. I'm going through some stuff right now that's really wearing on me and testing my trust and faith and hope in God, and it feels like I need constant, daily reminders that He's got it figured out and everything will work out in the end, even when it doesn't feel that way from my perspective. So I'm glad I went and got to be reminded of that again.
Okay, I guess I should go practice my speech for my Communications class. Have a good rest of the day!
P.S. To anyone who usually gets email updates and hasn't been getting them lately, I'm trying to fix it, but it seems like it might take a while. I'm bad at technology and don't really know what I'm doing. Til then, feel free to read on this regular website!

“Helias' intense and almost indescribable bass playing… exists on a level reserved for the elite of new music bassists today.” —Signal to Noise
The always-inventive Gordon Grdina has a talent for putting together interesting projects and this one is no exception. The Vancouver-based oud/guitar master frequently plays with bassist Mark Helias (BassDrumBone, Open Loose). The addition of genius pianist Matthew Shipp promises a not-to-be-missed collaboration.
Mark Helias last appeared for Coastal Jazz during the 2017 Festival, with his long-running project BassDrumBone. The prolific bassist and composer has performed with a panoply of world class artists including Edward Blackwell, Anthony Davis, Dewey Redman, Abbey Lincoln, Oliver Lake, Andrew Cyrille, Marilyn Crispell, Julius Hemphill, Don Byron, Bobby Bradford, Don Cherry, and Cecil Taylor.
Matthew Shipp has been hailed as a complete stylistic innovator on the piano. AllMusic refers to his "unique and recognizable style," and Jazziz Magazine calls Shipp "stunning in originality.” His recent work touches on the relationship between free jazz, contemporary classical, and popular forms like punk rock, hip hop, and electronica.

Like other stimulants, atomoxetine is believed to enhance alertness by altering norepinephrine activity in the frontal cortex and brainstem. Other behavioral effects include insomnia, anorexia, nervousness, suicidality, hostility, akathisia, and mania.
The fact that atomoxetine does not appear to enhance dopamine transmission in the striatum or the mesoaccumbens has encouraged some clinicians to suggest that atomoxetine is non-addictive.
However, it should be noted that rats, pigeons, and monkeys have failed to distinguish between atomoxetine and low doses of cocaine or methamphetamine on drug discrimination tasks.

In addition, the price binary options forex trading system binary trading options and cryptocurrency trading options are key levels that the trader sets as benchmarks to determine outcomes. We will see the application of price targets when we explain the different types.
Expiry times can be as low as 5 minutes. How does it work? First, the trader sets two price targets to form a price range. If you are familiar with pivot points in forex, then you should be able to trade this type. This type is predicated on the price action touching a price barrier or not. If the price action does not touch the price target the strike price before expiry, the trade will end up as a loss.
Here you are betting on the price action of the underlying asset not touching the strike price before the expiration. Here the trader can set two price targets and purchase a contract that bets on the price touching both targets before expiration Double Touch or not touching both targets before expiration Double No Touch. Normally you would only employ the Double Touch trade when there is intense market volatility and prices are expected to take out several price levels. Some brokers offer all three types, while others offer two, and there are those that offer only one variety.
In addition, some brokers also put restrictions on how expiration dates are set. In order to get the best of the different types, traders are advised to shop around for brokers who will give them maximum flexibility in terms of types and expiration times that can be set. Most trading platforms have been designed with mobile device users in mind.
So the mobile version will be very similar, if not the same, as the full web version on the traditional websites. Brokers will cater for both iOS and Android devices, and produce versions for each. Downloads are quick, and traders can sign up via the mobile site as well. Our reviews contain more detail about each brokers mobile app, but most are fully aware that this is a growing area of trading. Traders want to react immediately to news events and market updates, so brokers provide the tools for clients to trade wherever they are.
So, in short, they are a form of fixed binary options forex trading system binary trading options and cryptocurrency trading options financial options. Call and Put are simply the terms given to buying or selling an option. As a financial investment tool they in themselves not a scam, but there are brokers, trading robots and signal providers that are untrustworthy and dishonest.
Our forum is a great place to raise awareness of any wrongdoing. Binary trading strategies are unique to each trade. Money management is essential to ensure risk management is applied to all trading. Different styles will suit different traders and strategies will also evolve and change. Traders need to ask questions of their investing aims and risk appetite and then learn what works for them.
Binary options can be used to gamble, but they can also be used to make trades based on value and expected profits. So the answer to the question will come down to the trader. If you have traded forex or its more volatile cousins, crude oil or spot metals such as gold or silver, you will have probably learnt one thing: Things like leverage and margin, news events, slippages and price re-quotes, etc can all affect a trade negatively.
The situation is different in binary options trading. There is no leverage to contend with, and phenomena such as slippage and price re-quotes have no effect on binary option trade outcomes. This reduces the risk in binary option trading to the barest minimum. The binary options market allows traders to trade financial instruments spread across the currency and commodity markets as well as indices and bonds.
This flexibility is unparalleled, and gives traders with the knowledge of how to trade these markets, a one-stop shop to trade all these instruments. A binary trade outcome is based on just one parameter: The trader is essentially betting on whether a financial asset will end up in a particular direction.
In addition, the trader is at liberty to determine when the trade ends, by setting an expiry date. This gives a trade that initially started badly the opportunity to end well. This is not the case with other markets. For example, control of losses can only be achieved using a stop loss. Otherwise, a trader has to endure a drawdown if a trade takes an adverse turn in order to give it room to turn profitable. The simple point being made here is that in binary options, the trader has less to worry about than if he were to trade other markets.
Traders have better control of trades in binaries. For example, if a trader wants to buy a contract, he knows in advance, what he stands to gain and what he will lose if the trade is out-of-the-money. For example, when a trader sets a pending order in the forex market to trade a high-impact news event, there is no assurance that his trade will be filled at the entry price or that a losing trade will be closed out at the exit stop loss.
The payouts per trade are usually higher in binaries than with other forms of trading. This is achievable without jeopardising the account. In other markets, such payouts can only occur if a trader disregards all rules of money management and exposes a large amount of trading capital to the market, hoping for one big payout which never occurs in most cases.
In order to trade the highly volatile forex or commodities markets, a trader has to have a reasonable amount of money as trading capital.
For instance, trading gold, a commodity with an intra-day volatility of up to 10, pips in times of high volatility, requires trading capital in tens of thousands of dollars. The payouts for binary options trades are drastically reduced when the odds for that trade succeeding are very high. Of course in such situations, the trades are more unpredictable. Experienced traders can get around this by sourcing for these tools elsewhere; inexperienced traders who are new to the market are not as fortunate.
This is changing for the better though, as operators mature and become aware of the need for these tools to attract traders. Unlike in forex where traders can get accounts that allow them to trade mini- and micro-lots on small account sizes, many binary option brokers set a trading floor; minimum amounts which a trader can trade in the market.
This makes it easier to lose too much capital when trading binaries. In this situation, four losing trades will blow the account. When trading a market like the forex or commodities market, it is possible to close a trade with minimal losses and open another profitable one, if a repeat analysis of the trade reveals the first trade to have been a mistake. Where binaries binary options forex trading system binary trading options and cryptocurrency trading options traded on an exchange, this is mitigated however.
Spot forex traders might overlook time as a factor in their trading which is a very very big mistake.
With the aandacht, temporarily all is reader transmitted also around the strategy, also are options, trade, and laws.

For just a small cookbook collection, you can consider adding a floating shelf somewhere around your cupboards. Look for unused space and see if there’s an area that could fit a small shelf. For example, this shelf from Beneath My Heart makes use of the small bit of space directly underneath one cupboard. Here’s another great example from Eat Well 101 that adds three floating shelves as opposed to cupboards — great for storing the microwave, a few accessories, and of course your cookbooks!
Speaking of kitchen renovating, you have to consider working a shelving area into your counters if possible! It’s perhaps one of the best ways to really maximize space. And the best part is that you don’t need huge counters to do it. This little shelving nook featured on BHG shows how you can get so much extra cookbook (and accessory) space just by turning the end of your counter into a storage area. You can make them as tall or as small as you want. This example from Home Bunch demonstrates how you can mix and match your shelves for bigger books and smaller food items or accessories. Have a look at this cool little wooden shelving unit from Contemporist that was built into a kitchen island, but looks as if you could pull it out and put it anywhere on its own! If your kitchen island or counters include cupboards and drawers, and putting shelves in at the end (on the side) isn’t an option, then why not swap out a small space to make room for shelving? This elegant looking island featured on Home Bunch did just that.

We are excited to announce that we have moved our Moscow headquarters to a new office! It’s a better location and much bigger space!
I co-founded NTR in 2000 and the first office we had was located in the VNIIINSTRUMENT (Russian Research & Development Tooling Institute) building. We used to say that the office was on the roof of the Motherland. It really was so, because the Motherland cinema stood next to us and from our window the view was its roof. At the very beginning we shared the office with a therapist and to get to his office people had to walk through our work area! And when one of our guys worked too late to get home they would sleep on the therapist’s couch.
Congratulations to all programmers! May your code rock and your bugs be few. We wish you all more great ideas and more interesting tasks.
Thank you for turning client ideas into cool software! Thank you for solving problems, providing security solutions and working long hours when the project called for it.

The idea is to “give away” two of our development teams as our way of saying thanks to the community that drives our growth.
The motivation is pretty simple — we grew 51% Y2Y in 2016 helping startups scale their software development.
We had an opportunity to work on great products with entrepreneurs from San Francisco, Austin, Boston, London, Amsterdam and many other amazing places around the world.
We worked with a lot of talented founders and the learning was definitely reciprocal. Although NTR Lab, at 16, is no longer a startup, our development centers feel like startups, with that special atmosphere of new ideas and pure enthusiasm.
The startup community has given a lot to us, so we wanted to give a lot back to it. And what better way than to help two of them succeed?
Our plan is to cooperate with accelerators and venture capitalists, as well as founders, to choose the two most innovative ideas that are likely to succeed.
If you are interested send our founder an email describing the project (it should be interesting/fun for the developers, too). Please include your pitch deck with your message.
We have the right to document and write about how and what is happening. This is the first time we have given back and want to describe the process and publicize the story. (Be sure to follow us on twitter and don’t forget to check for new posts here).
Studies show that learning how to avoid diabetes and reverse diabetes type 2 is simple and even possible for most people.
But research clearly shows that you can avoid getting type 2 diabetes; and learning how to reverse diabetes is actually even highly doable. What’s more avoiding and reversing diabetes is vitally important to you.
Over 30 million Americans and 400 million people around the world have type 2 diabetes and countless millions more are considered to be prediabetic. Plus, worldwide statistics are expected to double within the next 15 years. And the complications of diabetes are downright scary:
What was once called adult-onset diabetes is now showing up in many more adults and an ever-growing number of teens and children.
But the great news is that learning how to avoid diabetes type 2 and even reverse diabetes is simple. But it takes strong commitment and persistence to make the lifestyle changes that reduce your risk for diabetes.
However, with the seven simple steps below, you can also reduce your chance of diabetes complications, heart disease and some cancers.
1. Make exercise a priority. Working your muscles with regular physical activity greatly improves circulation and your ability to use insulin and absorb glucose. Studies show that just taking a brisk half-hour walk every day reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 30%. And adding more physical activity during the day reduces your diabetes risk even more.
2. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight is the major cause of type 2 diabetes. It increases your risk by seven times. Obesity makes you 20 to 40 times more likely to develop diabetes than someone at a healthy weight. But, if you’re overweight, losing just 7% to 10% of your current weight can cut your chance of developing diabetes in half. Healthy permanent weight loss is the best thing you can do to decrease your diabetes risk.
3. Eliminate refined carbohydrates. Sugar, sugary soft drinks, fruit drinks and fruit juice, white bread, white rice, white pasta and other refined carbohydrates cause a fast and furious rise in blood sugar. Eating these high glycemic foods greatly increases your risk of developing diabetes.
4. Focus on plant foods. A diet high in fiber foods, such as colorful vegetables, beans, fresh fruits and 100% whole grains lowers your risk of diabetes and helps keep your appetite and calories under control.
5. Choose healthy fats. The fats you eat affect your diabetes risk one way or another, so it’s important to learn bad fat good fat differences. Fats found in omega 3 fish, such as salmon and tuna, raw nuts, seeds, whole grains and olive oil help to lower your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Whereas trans fats do just the opposite by contributing to diabetes.
6. If you smoke, quit. Diabetes is just one of the many smoking health risks on the long list of health problems caused by tobacco use. Smokers are at least 50% more likely to develop diabetes than nonsmokers.
7. Manage blood pressure and cholesterol. Diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure all damage blood vessels. And when they team up together, they increase your risk for heart attack, stroke and other deadly conditions. But if you exercise regularly, eat for great health and manage your weight, you can lower blood pressure and cholesterol naturally.
Although following these steps for how to avoid diabetes type 2 and to reverse diabetes naturally takes commitment, focus and persistence, avoiding the complications of diabetes makes it well worth any effort.

The highest quality, the most thorough, and Louisville KY’s #1 Home Inspection Company for protecting you, the buyer! Always has been, always will be.
Servicing Louisville KY and surrounding areas with the highest quality Home Inspections available for over 19 years with a perfect Better Business Bureau record.
We work for YOU! , not Real Estate Agents.. We do not solicit agents, period!! And never will! And many so called “Real Estate Professionals” will try to steer you away from us preventing a thorough evaluation of the home because we find so much more than other Home Inspection Companies here in Louisville.
We Are Confident and Competent.. We were the ONLY Home Inspection Company with an iron clad guarantee before the State of KY. required licensing, NO other company gave a “If we miss it, we’ll repair it guarantee” as we did for 10 full years with never a complaint and after 20 years still 0 client complaints (Well except the crazy one who sued us for not telling her that her commodes were high efficiency, the law of the United States), now the State protects you in the Home Inspector Licensing Law which went into effect June of 2006. ALL of our complaints come from Realtors, and THAT should tell you something about them!
We were certified by the American Society of Home Inspectors in 1996 long before any state required licensing. (No longer a member since we felt their extensive advertising over teaching habits in our monthly newsletters were counterproductive and not worthy of our funds)
What To Expect?… The most thorough Home Inspection in Louisville, KY available! Our over 30 years construction experience and 20 years inspecting over 7000 homes gives us the knowledge to know what to look for how to report what we see.
Our Chief Home Inspector Kenny Martin has been inspecting homes in and around the Louisville Metro almost 20 years and grew up in and around construction originally working doing rehabs on 100+ year old homes in and around Old Louisville.
We do not have a fancy website touting “special” tools that make people sound like SUPERMAN that really do not improve ones Inspection skills or knowledge overall, but then again we do have our fair share and more than almost all other Home Inspectors in Lou. KY.
Our many years in and around construction and Inspecting thousands of homes for our clients AND NOT FOR REALTORS make us the most thorough Home Inspection choice period!
We use a computerized reporting system, (available for view at the sample report link on top of each page), and include digital photos of all defects and maintenance needs we find at your new home.
Most inspections take approximately 3-4 hours but run longer when we find more and then we do the report at the office taking another 2 hours on average.
We spend on average 5-6 hours on every home inspection! 2.5 hrs inspecting the home and another 2 hours writing the report is pretty much the minimum ever.. Double what most spend! We do not rush any inspection, if it takes 4, 5 or 6 hours we take our time to ensure thoroughness.
The only way we ever do more than 1 Home Inspection in a day is if both are very small ensuring you always get the needed attention while we are at the Home Inspection allowing you to ask more questions.
Walk WITH your Home Inspector.. you will receive maintenance information unique to your home and learn more about the home in just a few hours than living in the home for years so bring a pad and paper and make notes of minor things which may be important to you as a new Home Buyer.
Unlike many Home Inspection Companies we actually get on the roof and go into attics and crawlspaces, these are the areas we typically find the most concerns including fungus (molds) and structural issues and yet many other Home Inspectors decline entering referring to certain potential safety hazards.
Our Home Inspections are usually twice as thorough as other Home Inspection companies and without exaggeration up to 20 times more thorough, (We know because we have been shown previous inspection reports of some homes we have inspected) we save you more because we find more, every-time, period!!
We can’t get out of any home these days without AT LEAST 75 photos of issues in need of either repair or maintenance, that way you are more equipped with the knowledge you need to maintain your home and be ready for a smooth home sale when you choose to sell your home and we explain which items are typical, which are not, which are major, minor etc.
Pay a little more for a Home Inspection now and you won’t have to pay more after you move in or when you sell your home due to unexpected repairs (excluding normal wear and tear and potential hidden defects) .
If any Home Inspector spends less than 3 hours inspecting your home and 2 hours more preparing the report you are likely NOT getting a thorough Home Inspection! That’s 5 hours total for an average size home and increases dependent on size and condition.
Owned Helping Hands Repairs Maintenance and worked with numerous local Contractors for many years doing remodeling, room additions, roofing, structural repairs and maintenance.

This is the second time I have used Kenny for an inspection and have been nothing but impressed with his thoroughness. He has exceeded expectations both times and will definitely be using him in the future. I wouldn’t trust anyone else with such an important part of homeownership.
Today was the 2nd time I have used Kenny for a home inspection. The first time was 2 years ago, and talk about a disaster of a house! What I took away from that inspection were things to look for, signs of damage etc, and ever since then I have looked at several homes that I knew were no good. Today was different, as we are actually going through with this house! Kenny was thorough as usual, explained every issue in detail, what needs fixed now, later, or not at all, and HOW to fix it, since I do most of my own repairs. Contrary to popular gossip among Louisville Realtors, Kenny DOES NOT talk people into not buying houses so he can get more inspection money later. All he does is point out every single issue the house has, and tells you what needs attention now, later, or maybe not at all, and HOW to fix it, plus what it may cost to have a contractor do it.So really it’s a home care plan too. I have recommended Kenny and will keep on recommending him!
I have bought several homes in the past and the inspectors have missed a lot. Within the first hour (of a four hour inspection) I knew Kenny was different. He walked me through each part of the process and explained what needed to be addressed. Some things were a priority and others were over the next several years. This professional creates a plan for you to care for your home and that is invaluable as a buyer. What sold me on Kenny was when he wanted to make sure I had the right person, he was a adamant about not taking business from another inspector. If you want a high quality, detailed plan, Commonwealth is your place to go. Thank you Kenny!
No, thank you Mike! Always a pleasure helping people get the most bang for their buck! And sorry for the slow response, just getting caught up!
Excellent inspector, very professional and I got a thorough inspection report with about 134 pictures and comments. If you are looking for a responsible inspector and a thorough inspection report, he is the one you should contact with.
Agents still ask me why I take so many pictures and spend so much time on the inspection and report.. REALLY!? It’s what Home Inspectors OWE their clients in my opinion, anything less is just, well.. too little.
Kenny is a very well experienced home inspector.Told me what all the majors & minors were.I will definitely call Kenny on any if not all of my home Inspection needs.
My first impression when I saw Kenny pull up was who’s this in this little car? Kenny gets out and opens his trunk and pops out his little giant ladder and bag of tools and very quickly showed me who he was! I can’t say enough of just how thorough Kenny was and how much he made me feel like his best friend. After the exhausting 3 hour inspection and talking extensively about many, many items I reached into my engineering degree pride and found there was nothing there, literally. I though I had a good, no great grasp of homes being a 3 time home owner doing all of my own repairs, but after this inspection I learned I have alot to learn. Kenny set me strait on things I didn’t see at all and perfectly explained them so I knew he knew what he was talking about. Folks, this guy IS the right choice for your home inspector, don’t let your agent talk you into someone else, or as mine did try to talk you out of using Kenny, because it will be one of the biggest mistakes you ever make.
Kenny is a great guy. Did a great job on the home inspection as well as a detailed report and full of resources to help you addressed issue from the inspection. Just great and very helpful, even after the inspection if you have any questions. Thanks! Would recommend.
Kenny is so great. He makes sure he finds everything wrong with a home. He leaves no stones unturned. not only is he friendly but he will also walk you through the house and explain what he found and make sure you know what you will need to do to fix it correctly. we have used him twice now and my family members have also used him as well. we love how he does not work with realtors so we know he has no hidden agendas to help sell a home. he cares for his customers and his reports are well laid out and easy to read and use when taking them to the table to make an offer. We will continue to use his services in our family for sure and will recommend him to anyone looking to buy a home and needs an inspector.
Kenny was very thorough and did a terrific job of identifying issues (both definite and potential) with a 51 year old home in Anchorage, KY that we had hired him to inspect. He seemed very knowledgeable about every aspect of home construction and maintenance and seemed to know codes by heart. After reading about his higher-than-normal degree of thoroughness on the Commonwealth Home Inspections website and in other reviews online I was wary about the possibility of him being an “alarmist”, but that turned out not to be the case whatsoever; he very clearly articulated which issues were of real concern and which ones were “no big deal”. He answered any questions we had both during and after the home inspection and was always very responsive. I would definitely recommend Kenny to anyone needing a home inspection.
I’ve used Kenny 3x so far and scheduling a 4th. He is incredibly thorough and descriptive. His experience and knowledge enable him to provide the home buyer with a very clear idea of their possible home. Let’s face the reality….ALL homes have issues, lots of them. You just have to pick your battles. I use Kenny’s details to create my own To-Do List for my home. If his details don’t impress you, his knowledge, experience, and friendliness will. Thanks again Kenny and I’ll see you this week!
Our inspections are as much as twice as thorough as other inspectors, we save you more because we find more!!
We were the ONLY inspection company with an iron clad guarantee before the State of KY required licensing, NO other company gave a “If we miss it, we’ll repair it guarantee” as we did.

Last month hundreds of scholars gathered in St. Paul, MN. for the annual conference of the Society of Architecture Historians (SAH). I was there as a speaker, on a roundtable organized by The Architecture Lobby, titled “Labor Issues in Academia.” The roundtable was on a Friday afternoon, at the same time as four others, during lunch, that crucial moment when, at every academic conference, attention starts waning and everyone dips out for coffee or a nap before the afternoon paper sessions.
We expected maybe thirty people to show up, at best, if we got lucky. More than seventy packed into the room. “The biggest SAH crowd in all of history!” I texted a friend. Probably an exaggeration, but still, the crowd was impressive. We’d set the chairs up in a circle, so that the discussion would flow in a collaborative way, contrasting the usual academic conference set-up: expert at the front of the room, sparsely populated front row, dim lights, powerpoint. As people flowed in, we had to expand the circle three times, which, if nothing else, certainly made everyone feel like the room was overflowing.
The size of the crowd was surprising, though it shouldn’t have been. The issue of how academic work works is pressing: we’re seeing teachers on strike across the country, graduate students on strike in New York and Illinois, and an increasing number of organized adjunct faculty demanding that their unions be recognized and given the right to collectively bargain with management to improve the conditions of their labor. Because, as the common phrase goes, educators’ working conditions are their students’ learning conditions.
A large number of the people who attended the panel were adjunct faculty, with some tenured professors sprinkled in, along with a handful of graduate students. A few were in unions, and a few others were from para-academic or para-architectural institutions. Most of them weren’t activists. They weren’t drawn to the panel because of a moral or ethical commitment to the cause of labor justice, but because it’s an issue that directly affects their lives. The crowd made it clear that labor issues within the academy are so pervasive that they can no longer be ignored, not even by architects, who are notoriously aloof and sometimes like to pretend that they are above or beyond it all.
One participant talked about how difficult it was for her, as an adjunct, to manage her relationship with students who she mentored closely. She recognized that of her students’ professors, she was probably the one who knew them best and therefore was best equipped to write their recommendation letters and do their advising. But advising and writing recommendation letters were not in her job description. She simply wasn’t getting paid for them.
Of course, that particular problem is not unique to architecture. Non-tenured faculty in every discipline, and especially in the humanities, have increasingly numerous responsibilities and decreasing salaries, and it’s ever-more common for them to be offered short-term contracts with no job security beyond one or two semesters.
Perhaps the most obvious is the way in which the academic model of architectural education—namely, the studio model—primes students for exploitation later on in their careers by teaching them how to exploit themselves.
But the conversation revealed that there are labor issues within academia that are unique to architecture. Perhaps the most obvious is the way in which the academic model of architectural education—namely, the studio model—primes students for exploitation later on in their careers by teaching them how to exploit themselves. The long nights in studio, the ruthless competition with classmates and the glorification of the studio critic, all translate into the willingness to work for free in exchange for the starchitect line on the résumé and 80-hour work-weeks just to “get ahead” in a profession in which very few wield a lot of power.
Yes, these issues are about students, not faculty. But it shouldn’t be difficult to see how labor issues facing faculty are intrinsically tied to subpar learning conditions for architecture students that produce an educational model that hasn’t evolved in decades, which in turn yields a profession that’s struggling to keep up with the world around it in terms of equity, work-life balance and wages.
One anecdote shared during the SAH roundtable, offered up by a faculty member at Columbia University, was particularly telling: architectural practitioners at Columbia who teach a studio—even those who run their own practice and, presumably, make a salary from it—receive a full professor’s salary from the university. Meanwhile, graduate students campus wide have yet to be recognized as workers by Columbia, whose administration is refusing to respect the NLRB ruling that granted them a union.
These practices are deeply entrenched: who is going to teach architecture classes at Columbia if not famous architects with offices in New York? How could the university maintain its cultural cachet if it didn’t offer them full salaries on top of what they already make from their firms? Through this particular institutional lens, architecture culture writ large looks like an impenetrable monolith.
But seventy people attending a roundtable on labor issues at SAH is a crack in that monolith, a sign that the things architects, architecture students and architecture teachers have taken for granted for decades can change. It all starts with those who teach architecture—adjuncts, lecturers, graduate students—organizing in their workplace.
The reason that significant change will happen through unionization, especially of the most precarious faculty—and not through initiatives like curriculum changes or locking the studio doors after 10PM— is that in order to change architecture culture, we have to tackle the system, not the symptoms. There are plenty of faculty who have good ideas about how to teach their discipline who simply don’t have any power to do so because presenting radical changes means risking losing their job. Meanwhile, those who don’t run that risk—the practitioner who earns two salaries, for example—often don’t have a vested interest in radically changing the profession or the academy, because these systems are already working in their favor.
Unionizing non-tenured faculty isn’t just about getting better wages and benefits. It’s about those who do the bulk of the teaching at universities winning power.
Unionizing non-tenured faculty isn’t just about getting better wages and benefits. It’s about those who do the bulk of the teaching at universities winning power. When a faculty member’s job is guaranteed, when they are protected from unfair retaliation, they have the power—and the freedom—to teach in a way that challenges the status quo, and even to organize and demand change within their academic institutions. This is incredibly powerful for architecture, where for so long the response to any discontent from students and practitioners about the state of the discipline has been “that’s just the way things are.” This response is particularly disheartening for students and young practitioners, who face increasingly lower wages and longer hours, and who presumably got into architecture to make the world better and end up learning that good design is not only hard to get built, but also unlikely to change much in the grand, grinding scheme of things.
Imagine, then, when instead of hearing that things will never change, an architecture student sees their professor organizing with their union to improve their university or teaching against the canon. The lesson is twofold: first, there are things to learn about architecture beyond what’s been taught for centuries. And second, institutional change is possible—if not by design, then by organizing.

Tourists who have dreams of the glitz, glamour and neon lights of Las Vegas but don’t want to give up a vacation in the tropics, Jamaica now offers the best of both worlds. Even for the casual gambler, a trip to any of the island's casinos can add spice to any vacationg
For a long time there have been many rules and regulations regarding casinos on the island, and up until recently the only place to play the slots (which was the only type of casino gambling allowed) was at resorts that had received special permission by the government to operate a casino on property.
In 2010, despite opposition from many church organizations, a bill to expand and regulate casino gaming in Jamaica passed both houses of Parliament. It wasn’t until November of 2012, however, that legislatures unanimously passed two bills to allow full scale casino operations on the island. What this means for the island is that it is not officially legal to begin building full scale casinos – as opposed to mainly slot driven game centers found in many hotels – in Jamaica.
Until the big casinos are officially open, slot machines make up the majority of floor games, but video poker, blackjack, Caribbean Stud Poker, craps, and roulette are also sometimes available.
Due to its origin in Aruba, Caribbean Stud Poker is widespread. It is played by many of the same rules as regular poker but has one big difference: the players, instead of playing against each other, play against the dealer only. Another small difference is that all of the players can see one of the dealer's cards, which he deals face up. With this information, players are free to make bets. This type of poker is extremely popular both in Jamaica and on cruise ships.

Treasure Hunt Montego Bay has a restaurant, so you can grab a bite to eat before or after you try your luck. Treasure Hunt is loved in Jamaica for its clear rules and high pay outs. One of four on the island, this Montego Bay locale is home to some of the most unique computerized games out there.
If you like slot machines, consider giving Treasure Hunt Ocho Rios a try. Open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, Treasure Hunt Ocho Rios features 140 gaming machines for gamblers to circulate amongst. When thirst calls, there is a bar on property.
Acropolis Portmore provides a collection of games for gamers to try out, including Blackjack and Roulette. Acropolis Gaming Center is a relative sports bar and restaurant that also just so happens to allow gambling on site. Not only can you eat and drink at the bar while watching your favorite sporting event, but there are table games and slot machines not far off.

As construction begins on casinos in Jamaica, it is more important to remember to squirrel away a little extra spending cash for your trip. If Jamaica’s current hotel casinos are just a hint of what’s to come, you can be sure that the future of gaming in Jamaica is going to be spectacular.

Do people die of ADHD? How could they? It doesn’t exist! The coroner knew this much. He knew their was no "ADHD brain," no "ADHD heart" or "ADHD liver." He knew there was nothing to test for either in life or death, to prove the existence of ADHD.
Of 2,993 adverse reaction (AR) reports concerning "Ritalin" or "methylpenidate" listed by the FDA’s Division of Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology (DPE), from 1990 to 1997, there were 160 deaths and 569 hospitalizations--36 of them life-threatening. One hundred twentysix (126) were cardiovascular occurrences, and 949 central or peripheral nervous system occurrences. There were 6 cases of "cardiomyopathy," 12 of "arrhythmia," 7 of "bradycardia," (slow pulse), 5 of "bundle branch block," (impairment of conduction apparatus of the heart), 4 of "EKG abnormality," 5 "extrasystole," (heart rhythm abnormalities), 3 "heart arrest," 2 heart failure, right," 10 "hypotension," (low BP), 1 "myocardial infarction," 15 "tachycardia" (rapid pulse).
While many of Ritalin’s cardiac side effects might be due to its action on the sympathetic nervous system, it may bind to and alter cellular architecture, leading to symptoms and signs that are secondary to actual structural damage.
Ritalin is known to cause cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia and hypertension. Ritalin and other amphetamines can interfere with the body phospholipid (complex fat) chemistry causing the accumulation of abnormal membranes visible with an electron microscope. Such abnormalities were seen in an adult treated with Ritalin for 4 œ years. A heart muscle biopsy was obtained during coronary bypass surgery. Fischer (1972) concluded: "Although the patient was exposed to a variety of different drugs, we feel the methylphenindate (Ritalin) should be considered as the incriminating factor since this agent is amphetamine-related."
Henderson & Fischer (1994) next exposed experimental mice and rats to MP (Ritalin), and found identical membrane proliferation to that in the patient described by Fischer (1972). Moreover, they found that "The MP (Ritalin) doses used in the experimental rodents fell within the range of therapeutic dosage prescribed for patients with attention deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD)."
Other such molecules include fenfluramine (Pondimin)—the ‘fen’ of ‘fen-phen’—the weight reduction compound found to cause heart valve defects, leading to it’s being withdrawn from the market. There have been reports of reversible cardiomyopathy with methamphetamine (Desoxyn, Gradumet); of cardiomyopathy with dextro-amphetamine (Dexedrine) ); of left ventricular failure following a single, i.v. dose of amphetamine, and of sudden reversible cardiomyopathy with fenfluramine (Pondimin) and mazindol (a weight loss drug).
In The Pathology of Drug Abuse, Karch writes: "Amphetamine’s adverse effects on the heart are well established …(sharing) common mechanisms with cocaine toxicity…cardiomyopathy seems to be a complication of amphetamine abuse more often than cocaine abuse. …The clinical history in most of these cases is consistent with arrhythmic sudden death (as in Stephanie Hall). Reports of amphetamine-related sudden death were first published shortly after amphetamine became commercially available" (late 1930’s, about the same time Bradley discovered the paradoxical, calming effect of amphetamines that has lead to todays Ritalin epidemic).…
Stimulant-related cardiomyopathy has occurred in association with amphetamine, methamphetamine…and methylphenidate (Ritalin)…In all cases there was acute onset of heart failure associated with decreased cardiac output…".

Kharkiv business leader says Ukraine's illegal gambling industry is currently worth around half a billion dollars annually
DCH President Oleksandr Yaroslavsky (left) with Boris Lozhkin, Secretary of the National Investment Council
The owner and president of the DCH Group, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, has spoken out in favor of legalizing the gambling business in Ukraine and called on President Poroshenko to support the relevant legislative initiatives. "I would like to take this opportunity to address Boris Lozhkin, Secretary of the National Investment Council, and give him a letter for Peter Alekseevich Poroshenko asking him to support the initiative on gambling. We know that the issue has been considered by the Ukrainian parliament for a long time."
Mr. Yaroslavsky's comments came during Kharkiv's flagship International Economic Forum on 22 September. He argued that the legalization of the gambling business would bring much needed additional revenues to the state budget. "The main goal is to get the industry out of the shadows so that this money does not end up in the pockets of corrupt officials and criminal elements. Legalization is part of the fight against corruption while also attracting funds to the state budget.We know that at present, the shadow economy for illegal gambling is worth about half a billion dollars," said Mr. Yaroslavsky.
He also recalled that the availability of casinos was one of the mandatory requirements for the construction of the Premier Palace Hotel Kharkiv prior to Euro 2012. "The previous government called on us to build a five-star hotel and included the requirement to feature a casino. At this point, while I have invested about USD 12 million in this direction, the requisite facilities remain idle," Mr. Yaroslavsky said.

Founded in 1975, OWUSS has sponsored 94 experience-based Rolex scholarships and 93 internships to young people who want to pursue careers in fields such as marine biology, underwater research, and conservation. The society offers summer internships in North America for 1-3 month periods to college undergraduates and recent graduates. Internship recipients receive an educational grant to help fund travel to/from internship site, room and board, and a stipend to cover living expenses. The sponsor organizations that host the internships are leaders in their fields.
George Wozencraft, Vice President Internships, says “This year’s selection process was competitive, with many qualified applicants. In addition to those selected for the 2016 internships, I want to commend the finalists for each internship. We thank the members of our internship selection committee for their contribution. Additionally, we appreciate our internship sponsors and coordinators for the tremendous support that they provide to our volunteer organization.”
This internship provides experience for a young person interested in a future in science, diving for research, or scientific diving-related fields. Intern applicants can be students from colleges and universities with an interest in science and diving. The program runs from mid-May through August and will include training at one of several AAUS organizational member sites. This training will give the intern the necessary dive qualifications to allow participation on research projects requiring scientific diving and introduce the intern to careers that utilize scientific diving as a tool. Once trained as an AAUS recognized diver-in-training, interns will participate in underwater fieldwork at one or more locations and research facilities associated with AAUS.
This internship is named in memory of Dr. Lee H. Somers, who was AAUS’ first President and served as a long time officer and board member of OWUSS.
Based in Winter Park, Florida, the recipient of this internship will gain valuable real world experience in magazine publishing. Bonnier Corporation is one of the largest consumer- publishing groups in America, with nearly 50 special-interest magazines and related multimedia projects and events. The Bonnier Dive Group includes “Sport Diver,” “Scuba Diving,” and “Undersea Journal.” The intern will have the opportunity to contribute to these and other Bonnier Corporation publications.
The National Park Service Research Internship provides a unique opportunity to work with leading archaeologists, underwater photographers, and scientists in the National Park Service and other agencies in the American state and federal government. Specific work projects will be determined based upon the interests of the intern as well as the needs of associated projects. The internship is based in Boulder, Colorado, but it is expected that the intern will travel to projects within the continental United States and potentially overseas as part of this internship. Experiences could involve a specific project in a single park or a larger project in multiple parks.
Offered in Key Largo, Florida, the Marine Conservation Internship provides an opportunity to experience working at a nonprofit environmental organization. REEF is a grassroots, non-profit organization of recreational divers dedicated to protecting and preserving the underwater environment. Outside duties include environmental presentations to local and visiting schools, university, dive, and public groups; working with other local marine conservation entities; and opportunities for conducting marine life surveys during local dives. Office duties include handling memberships, incoming marine life survey data, answering e-mail, and dealing with the public.
It's rare you hear people talk about wedding flowers and what they cost. I guess because we're supposed to be all smiles and happiness when it comes to weddings. So it was refreshing to see this blog post which was making all the rounds earlier this year which actually talked about what those beautiful wedding flowers you see in magazines really cost. All too often, the small town florist (that's me) is in the uncomfortable position of having to say, "Sweetheart, those flowers just aren't in your budget".....And I thought to myself, "I think I'll try a different tact"...so this time when the bride came in and showed me a photo, I just told her "those cake flowers will cost $100" and then I let her decide if it was in her budget or not. You could see the extremely charming and gracious mother of the bride visibly gasp at the price and I have to admit, even I was a little shocked to hear myself uttering that. But now I think, "That was $100 well spent" because the impact was huge.
And the family was Dutch so we used this charming little bi tone tulip as a nod to their heritage. Which made me really happy. Thanks Tobi Sovak from Noisette for making our flowers look so good on that cake.

****This was not a paid post and my honest opinion was used. The opinions are solely my own and may vary from others.The products mentioned below have been provided by www.SuccessCreations.com for the review & giveaway free of charge.****
I love dressing up which is why Halloween is my favorite holiday and Comicon is my favorite event of the year, A big part of dressing up or being mysterious involves masks. There are many kinds of masks which give different effects you can look like an alien, or a mutant or simply wear an elegant black half face mask for a ball. I have received the chance to work with a terrific company called Success Creations who specializes in masquerade masks on a review and giveaway here on Burning Moon's Inside Advice.
For my review I was able to pick out a mask I liked, I choose the Poison Ivy mask. I was told they would also be including one mask of their choice for the review, I am always up for a surprise so I happily agreed and started to wonder which of their many attractive masks would be in the box. My packaged arrived quickly, upon opening it I found they not only sent one extra mask but two I squealed with delight. The Poison Ivy mask is perfect, the material used is vibrant green and shiny, the golden ivy leaves and gold glitter really stand out against the green. The mask also features several green gems and sparkly gold ribbon which holds the mask onto your head. I personally think this mask is perfect and No I am not saying it just for the review [If you have been a reader a while, You will know I am not afraid to state the things I dislike about products], After trying this mask on I told my fiance I thought this mask was made specifically for me. I have a small forehead and most masks leave too much space above my eyes near the brow area which can be quite uncomfortable at times, other masks sit wrong on my cheek bones this mask has the nose/forehead shaped more towards how the curves of a face actually work and it sits perfectly on my face.
The second mask was their Simone with side Peacock Feathers, this is a Luxury Black Laser Cut Metal Masquerade Bejeweled mask is adorned with crystal jewels. I have personally never had a metal mask in my collection so I was pleasantly surprised to find that the mask is light weight. All of the edges are rounded to prevent sharp edges which is always a plus no one wants to cut themselves on part of their costume. The peacock feather is rather large but matches nicely with the mask, I could see myself wearing this with my hair up in a bun or perhaps curls that are pinned back to allow the peacock feather room to sit. One of my favorite touches of this mask are the crystal jewels which line the brow and the rhinestone brooch accent give it a nice sparkle. This mask is secured with ribbon ties.
The third mask included in the package is the Fancy Masquerade - Black-White, which features a fun black and white pattern. If you are looking for something simple but eye catching this mask does the trick my fiance is more inclined to wear this mask as the shape and size says 'Male' to me more than female but it can be worn by anyone. The fabric used is smooth and soft to the touch, it secures with an elastic band. I had a little trouble with the elastic band being too big at first but it was easy to figure out how to tighten it up. Success Creations offers dozens of masks from blank white masks to over the top masks which start at just $0.65 up to $140. The Poison Ivy mask retails for $22.97, the Simone with side Peacock Feathers retails for $29.97 with ties or $34.97 on a stick, and the black and white Fancy Masquerade retails for $11.99 they are sure to have something for any occasion. Head over to their website to see what they have to offer you. Which one is your favorite?
OMG I LOOOOVE MASQUERADE MASKS! I've wanted one for years. Ok...favorites...there's lots. I'll list 3.

Recently, the government has proposed for providing free education for Commonwealth Games medal winners. The entire duration of their studies will be sponsored by the government, according to the plan. The expenditure on education for school going students and college going students would be borne by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC), respectively. The information was given by the Minister of State for Human Resource Development, Smt D Purandeswari, in the Rajya Sabha. Already, a committee has been constituted by UGC to frame guidelines and modalities to implement the scheme 'Free Education for Commonwealth Games Medal Winners' so that the maximum number of sportspersons who won medals in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games, 2010 are benefited. CBSE is also offering Chacha Nehru Sports awards of `6000/- per student for outstanding sportspersons and for athletes who set new records in 15 different disciplines during the annual National CBSE sports and games competitions.

This page contains information on the default XSLT's provided by CForms, and the fi:styling directives they support.
This XSLT does not need to create also all the page layout (that can be added by other XSLT, or aggregating the form with other markup), it should only format the forms field and the form layout.
forms-page-styling.xsl: contains templates for building high-level page layout effects, such as tabbed panes.
forms-calendar-styling.xsl: contains the styling of a field with type "date" and provides a visual calendar for easy selection of date. So the calendar is an advanced styling too, but because it has much specific stuff we separated it out of forms-advanced-styling.xsl.
If you have a look at samples, you'll see also another XSLT, forms-samples-styling.xsl. This stylesheet includes other two stylesheets from the default set. Usually, you will make a clone of this stylesheet for your own project, have it include the library XSLTs, and customize what you need by writing templates in this XSLT by giving templates higher priority than those in the library ones.From the sitemap you only need to reference only your custom XSLT, for example as follows:
It's quite common to want to layout the form. For example, have part of the form displayed in a table with two columns, one with labels the other one with actual fields, while in another part have a single colum with labels followed by fields, and in another part some tabs to group together fields.
We could do this simply writing HTML in the template file, but this is verbose, non reusable, and not easy to style. That's why fi:groups are there. You can layout your form with fi:groups in a simple, efficient, extensible and easy to style way. For example :
The fi:group accept either a layout or a type attribute in its fi:styling element to specify the layout we want. This difference is because the "layout based" groups are quite lightweight, while the "type based" groups are more sophisticated and usually contains other groups.
action, submit and boolanfield widgets does not have a "label" which can be displayed separated from the button or checkbox itself, so they will be placed
multivaluefield with a list-type="double-listbox" will be displayed with a row with a label and another row with the two lists when in a columns group.
Also layout fi:group can contain other fi:group between their items, and can be used to create quite complex layouts.
There are currently two "type" groups : tabs and choice. The tabs group will display some tabs, every tab is (usually) a fi:group. For example :
Will display two tabs, one called "Personal info" and the other one "Internet data". When the user clicks on "Personal info" the field name and surname will be displayed, while when the user clicks on "Internet data" the field email and icqaccount will be displayed.You can specify a widget that will be used to store and retrieve which tab is curently active. This way you can control from the flow which tab will be active when the form will be displayed, or check which tab was active when the user submitted the form. To specify this special field use :
Obviously you can call the widget whatever you want, and the suggested datatype is integer, since the field will contain a number indicating the active tab, the field must be declared in the definition, and can be used in binding if needed. For example :
The group of type choice is identical to the tabs group, but instead of a row of tabs, a drop down is displayed, and selecting one element of the drop down will display the relative group.
You can specify a client side javascript that will be executed when a tab is clicked or when an option of the choice drop down is selected. This is done simply adding an attribute to the items of the group, for example :

On Sunday, Reddit user jspindle shared this frightening piece of trivia with the Today I Learned (TIL) community: “TIL that so many people died by ringing church bells in storms, due to the belief that it would disperse thunder, that the practice was banned by the Parlement of Paris.”
Though jspindle’s fact of the day didn’t come from the most reputable of historical sources, it turns out this one is sadly true.
When you learned about the invention of the lightning rod in grade school, you probably heard something like this: Ben Franklin takes a kite and a house key into a thunderstorm and “discovers” electricity, followed naturally by a thank-you card from the rest of the world and a government-mandated lightning rod on every tall building. Right?
What they didn’t tell you is that when Franklin debuted his life-saving invention, it faced some stiff intellectual competition: hundreds of years of religious superstition.
In the centuries leading up to Franklin’s lightning rod, much of the Western world believed there was a definite connection between God and every instance of lightning.
In an 1887 issue of Popular Science Monthly, Andrew White details how early Christians probably adopted the idea of a lightning bolt-slinging higher power from the Roman god Jupiter.
According to White, the belief that lightning was associated with divine judgment spread, in part due to a 13th-century monk named Cæsar of Heisterbach, whose writings included many lightning-infused religious parables like:
A priest was saved from a fatal storm (but 21 non-clergymen weren’t) because “the thunderbolt had respect for his profession.”
Another priest, this one secretly a sinner, went to ring the church bell to ward off the storm—but was struck by a lightning bolt that “tore his clothes from him and consumed certain parts of his body” to punish him for “vanity and chastity.”
It’s easy to see why religious figures were especially inclined to imbue lightning with divine significance—because churches were disproportionately affected by it.
As the tallest buildings in the area, large houses of worship with steeples and spires were more likely to be struck by lightning than other, smaller buildings during storms.
The odds of getting “struck by lightning” may be a cliché means of comparison to say that something is unlikely, but for many churches, these odds weren’t trivial at all.
As Seymour Stanton Block notes, the 340-foot-tall bell tower of St. Mark’s cathedral in Venice was struck by lightning in 1388, 1417, 1489, 1548, 1565, 1658, and 1745. (Oh, and two more times in 1761 and 1762.)
So, finding a way to prevent lightning damage was more important to the clergy than perhaps any other group at the time.
Unfortunately, the church’s response to this problem was one of the worst ideas they could’ve come up with. Michael Brien Schiffer explains, in his book Draw the Lightning Down:
“In view of this constant threat, clergy and church elders over the centuries had arrived at a technological solution to ward off lightning. Believing that thunderstorms were caused by evil forces or a displeased deity, they involved the ringing of bells as a protection.”
Yes, their answer to the problem of lightning was to have a human being, in a storm, climb up to the top of a tall tower to ring a church bell made of a highly conductive metal. (Using a rope dampened by the rain.)
According to Philip Dray, in his book Stealing God’s Thunder, many bells carried inscriptions bragging about their power to dispel lightning. The engraving on one German bell reads, “Fulgur arcens et dæmones malignos” (or “Warding off lightning and evil spirits”), while a French bell claims, “Ego sum qui dissipo tonitrua” (or “It is I who dissipate the thunders”). Other bells simply bear the phrase “Fulgura flango” (or “I subdue the thunderbolt”).
In addition to the inscriptions, bells often received special lightning-related blessings. In an 1855 essay, French physicist François Arago quotes a particularly colorful prayer from a bell-blessing ceremony:
“May the sound of this bell put to flight the fiery darts of the enemy of man; the ravages of thunder and lightning, the rapid fall of stones, the disasters of tempests …”
Even supposed men of “reason” like René Descartes and Francis Bacon, who weren’t convinced by the church’s superstitions, agreed with the use of bell-ringing as a valid storm repellant. As Dray explains, they thought the acoustical disturbance of ringing a large bell would create “some concussive energy that deterred lightning bursts.”
Thus, this half-baked bit of medieval “church science” became a widespread practice across Europe, and the churches’ poor, designated bell-ringers died all the time.
As proof, Dray offers a widely cited 1784 German publication titled “A Proof That the Ringing of Bells During Thunderstorms May Be More Dangerous Than Useful.”
According to Dray, the text gives a tally of “121 bell-ringers killed” by lightning from 1750–1783, including one storm that took out “seven people instantaneously,” three of them bell-ringers.*
In Jeffery Rosenfeld’s book Eye of the Storm, the author describes a 1718 storm over Brittany in northwest France, in which “two bell ringers died and 24 different churches were struck by lightning.”
W. De Fonvielle, Bell-ringer struck by lightning, Illustrated Library of Wonders, as found at the end of Amédée Guillemin’s, The sun, 1870
You would think that a consistent trend of bell-ringers dying from getting struck by lightning would be sufficient proof that bell-ringing does not, in fact, ward off lightning. So why did the tradition live on?
“… in explaining why lightning struck a church, parishioners could rationalize that the bell ringer was just a little tardy in getting started or had played the wrong tune. Alternatively, had the bells not been rung, the church would have suffered damage far greater.”
As Luc Rombouts points out in Singing Bronze: A History of Carillon Music, the belief in the logic of bell-ringing was so strong that there are “stories of residents of neighboring towns competing to force the thunderstorms to the other village via their respective bells.”
He also mentions that if lightning did strike a church where a bell-ringer was actively sounding the bell and the poor bell-ringer somehow managed to survive, it probably wouldn’t cause people to question the logic of the practice—but it could be “cited as a reason not to pay the bell-ringers.”
When your elementary school teacher shared the story of Benjamin Franklin and the lightning rod, do you remember the ending? You know, the protracted final chapter in which Franklin responds to religious objections from preachers opposed to scientific meddling with God’s meteorological will?
Lightning, of course, was a sensitive subject at the time, so Franklin anticipated religious resistance when he wrote about his new invention that sought to tame it.
In a 1753 issue of Poor Richard’s Almanack, he begins his famous explanation of how to protect houses from lightning with this line: “It has pleased God in his Goodness to Mankind, at length to discover to them the Means of securing their Habitations and other Buildings from Mischief by Thunder and Lightning.”
Or, in other words: God wasn’t casting lightning bolts in holy judgment. If the Almighty was responsible for anything lightning-related, it was giving humans the ability to protect themselves from the phenomenon.
Back in Europe, this opposition to letting science mess with the Lord’s lightning continued well after Franklin proposed a viable solution with his lightning rod—but scientists eventually helped the church see the light.
In the essay “Identity, Bells, and the Nineteenth-Century French Village,” Alain Corbin notes that “an episcopal statute of 1768 banned bell ringing during thunderstorms” in one French diocese. Similar local laws followed, leading up to the 1784 nationwide prohibition of bell-ringing during thunderstorms—ratified by the Parlement de Paris in 1787.
Last page of the (increasingly lengthy and historically complicated) children’s book on the lightning rod, right?
Unfortunately, unlike the poor bell-ringers, the absurd practice did not die right away. As historian Eugen Weber explains, despite the Parlement’s ban, local government officials in France were reluctant to enforce it.
“Throughout Mâconnais and Bourbonnais, as in other regions, mayors hesitated to enforce the official injunctions against bell ringing, well knowing that their people would turn against them,” he writes.
Dray supports this claim, adding that “as late as 1824 four new bells baptized against lightning were raised into place at the Cathedral of Versailles.”
“Clergy and church elders doubtless regretted the loss of life occasioned by the bell-ringing ritual; perhaps that is why some churches were receptive to experimenting with alternative technologies,” Schiffer notes.
Remember St. Mark’s Basilica, that Venice cathedral that was struck by lightning nine times? They installed a rod in 1766, and were free from lightning damage ever since.
By 1768, Franklin’s invention had been installed successfully in enough buildings to give his “heretical rod” more credibility. As he writes in a letter to Harvard professor John Winthrop, lightning rods offered “much better conductors” than a church bell’s hemp ropes—although he notes with subtle resentment that church vestries were “not well acquainted with these facts.”
These days, most of the world’s largest bells are swung via electric motors, but the bell-ringers that haven’t been replaced by machines are unlikely to die by electrocution.
Their salvation from lightning is due to both the gradual disappearance of mid-thunderstorm ringing rituals and the broader implementation of lightning rods and lightning-safe architecture in churches.
Of course, for those brave enough to carry on the bell-ringing tradition, the job is not without hazards.
In a 1990 study on injuries sustained by England bell-ringers, researchers found that the most common workplace injury was arthritis—though the most serious was still death.
Of the seven on-the-job fatalities they reported, however, not one was attributed to lightning. Two were suicides, and the other five were—in no particular order—”broken stay,” “fell from bell frame,” “fell into bells,” “rope caught under foot,” and “hit head on box.” (Other frightening injuries include four “near hangings” and two tooth-extractions due to “rope flick[ing] across mouth.”)
In a comment on the original Today I Learned post, user jspindle explains how they came across the strange fact about the deaths of bell-ringers in the first place. “[I] recently discovered my mother was a campanologist for years,” jspindle shares, “and while Googling bell-ringing I came across this gem.”
For those unfamiliar with the term “campanologist,” it’s someone trained in the art of musical bell-ringing. Perhaps now redditor jspindle will appreciate that their mother survived one of history’s most dangerous jobs.

The first time I ever tried Greek cuisine – it was goat’s cheese I remember – I had a thumping headache. I was about ten-years-old and my primary school class were doing a project on Ancient Greece, so we were very lucky to be tasting such an exotic variety of salads in a relatively provincial school. But I’m afraid I’ve harboured a severe dislike for anything goaty or lemony ever since, and I blame it on my recurring memories of feeling very ill one day back in 1992.
Which is why I wasn’t at all surprised to be feeling exactly the same way whilst waiting to sample Father Andreas’ freshly-made fromage atop a mountain on the island of Crete. But, what took my mind off my throbbing head (which was probably more brought on by the potent Raki the night before rather than the awful memories of child trauma) was the delightful fact that I’d actually helped to bring the cheese to life.
As this is Part One of my Agro-Blog (Agro meaning Agriculture, I think, not somebody losing their temper and getting agro) then I should probably start from the beginning.
Two weeks ago I jumped on an early-morning SAS flight from Copenhagen and landed in Athens just a few hours later. I hadn’t thought about it at the time, but it was the first time I’d landed in a totally new foreign country on my own in ten years.
I was lucky to get there, to be honest, as I’d left my passport in my Check-In luggage, and I only discovered this as the bag was disappearing down the conveyor belt to the netherworld of the airport. As it was an unmanned Check-In desk I had to hop on the belt to retrieve my bag, which caused all sorts of people to react rather agitated. Thankfully it was a simple error on my part and everyone got on with their lives.
Once at Athens I had five hours to kill, and there was no way I was going to spend them in the airport. So I quickly surveyed my surroundings and discovered a Metro line that ran straight in to the city. Having never been to Greece before, and having always been fascinated with the Acropolis and so forth, I decided there was only one place for me to be, so that’s where I headed.
45 minutes later I was out in the sunshine and suddenly regretting not having packed any shorts. The streets back in CPH had been icy as hell (when hell freezes over, obviously) and full of snow, so I wasn’t expecting any kind of pleasant weather a few hours ‘down the road.’ Alas, I had to grin and bear it as I began the steady incline up to the heart of Ancient Greece.
The streets were surprisingly empty for such a touristy part of town and I remember thinking, why have I never been here before at this time of year? Dragging my bag behind me, still with airport labels attached, seemed to attract the attention of the locals, and some of them stared at me with jaws hanging low. At one point I actually stopped to make sure nothing was hanging out of my trousers, because I couldn’t quite understand what the problem was. Maybe it was the huge jumper.
With gusto I moved on, keen to at least catch a glimpse of the mighty abandoned temple of old, and soon enough I reached a staircase made of stone and occupied by a homeless man who had a brain tumour, apparently. Well, that’s what his sign said, anyway. “That way to the Acropolis,” he shouted.
What he failed to mention was that the gates close at 3pm, which was now only 20 minutes away. Regardless of the time, suitcases were totally forbidden anyway, so getting in was never going to happen. Tantalisingly close, but no cigar.
Time was against me now, as I rolled back down the hill and towards a place to eat. All I’ll say here, is that I managed to get a warm wrap, iced cappuccino, some crisps, and lots of refills of water for less than €10. My wallet was very happy at this, and my stomach was pretty chuffed, too. We moved on.
Back at the airport I checked in to my flight to Crete and went to meet the other bloggers, journos and photographers who were joining me on this trip. I hadn’t met any of them before, but instantly I got chatting to a few of them, in particular a guy named Gary from the North of England. He was a videographer who made holiday shorts for Sky, and it was nice to hear a familiar accent again. God how I’ve missed hearing Northern English!
The rest of the group were made up of French, Israeli, Czech, American, Polish and Dutch folk, so a nice mixed bunch.
Once in Crete we drove to the village of Archanes and up in to the hills beyond, where we found our accommodation for the next five days. I was expecting a hotel room somewhere close to the city, but instead we were presented with several private villas with kitchens and dining areas, and great views over the village and the rising sun in the morning. But no sooner had we dropped our bags and chosen our roomies than we had to hop back in the van and head out for our first Cretan evening meal.
For the next couple of hours we were served plate after plate of salads, olives, meats, breads and cheeses, not to mention the on-tap wine that kept getting poured in to my glass every time it was empty.
But, as most of us had been travelling all day, we declined to stay any later and we began the uphill walk back to the villas.
The next morning we awoke slightly later than was originally planned (thank God someone changed it to 6:45 instead of 5:30). And after a big breakfast containing yet more salads, cheeses, bread and greek yoghurt, we climbed once again in to the van and began our short drive to an olive grove nearby.
After being introduced to Stavros Garakis and his small crew of Olive Harvesters (sounds like a a band), we immediately set about gathering the olives ourselves using something known as an elaioravdistiko – which literally translates as an oil stick thingy.
We spent a good few hours soaking up the sun and bagging up dozens and dozens of kilos of olives, finally sitting down at the end of it all to eat lunch amongst the olive trees. I was drunk within the hour.
Our next destination was a factory where the olives are pressed. Believe it or not, this is called an Olive Press. It was pretty funny, actually, as most of the staff could be seen standing there with fags hanging out of their mouths as they dumped the olives and extracted the oil. I wondered whether these olives would be described as ‘Slightly Smokey’ on the labels once they reached the shops. Our friendly local guide, Victoria, kindly asked us not to jump to any conclusions based on what we were seeing.
Our third destination of the day was yet another Olive Press, but this time a family-run one up in the hills. The difference between the two was immense. For starters, the staff actually found the time to talk to us and tell us about their products, and we got to taste a few whilst being told what made them taste and feel so different. It was interesting to learn about the spicy after tastes at the side of the mouth; something I haven’t really paid any attention to before.
The day ended with a well-deserved shower and a brief lie down before rushing out the door to go and eat again. This time our meal was accompanied by a demonstration from a local woman who was making throat sweets using local herbs and spices. It was very random, but helped to liven us all up a bit. We were all feeling pretty knackered from the day’s events.
And then they brought out the Raki – a local alcoholic beverage served one shot at a time. Now, I’m usually a bit of a wimp when it comes to schnapps and the like, but this stuff fell just on the right side of tasty. So I had another, and another, and soon enough I was having ridiculously funny conversations with my new friends, who had been complete strangers just a few hours before.
Stavros, who had joined us for dinner, had noticed how well we were all getting along at the end of the table and motioned to a t-shirt his friend was wearing. Raki: Connecting People, it read.

In “config” or “config.txt” on the smoothieboard, find the line with kill_button_enable and change it to:
I am currently using Patch Management to handle Windows updates on all of our systems. I have noticed some vulnerabilities related to 3rd-party apps and would like to use Software Management to patch them. Will there be any conflicts in the VSA if I use both features? Is one better than the other for Windows updates?
You have posted to a forum that requires a moderator to approve posts before they are publicly available.
Anyone with more than about a few hundred systems and bandwith to spare should leave Software Management alone for now. After testing it is deemed inadequate.
It's poorly thought out and executed in true Kaseya style for a fresh product, meaning not really a finished product and not ready for production, as far as we're concerned. I've heard 9.6 should solve the issues Software Management was born with. If that will actually be true, we'll have to wait and see....
We have a feature within software management which prohibits this behavior (it can be turned off). Here is some detail from our documentation:
Prevent an agent from running both Patch Management and Software Management at the same time - If checked, Software Management will not run Scan Now on an agent if that agent is configured to use any of these Patch Management features:
Personally, I would stay with Patch management for now. What kind of vulnerabilities are you having issues with?
You can use Patch Management for Windows and Software Management for third party software separately.
Have they fixed the issue where Software Management is completely destroying the available bandwidth on networks yet?
No they haven't! I created ticket 249898 and the support rep told me that I should stagger my scan. I'm new to Kaseya, but the onboarding training said that the scan should be done during the day to capture as many machines as possible. My professional services onboarding person said the same. When I explained that we kick this off on wed afternoon for 400 agents, our entire 300down 20up is toast for the afternoon. He said that he's heard that. We aren't even doing the deployment yet. Just the scan. I'm still managing patching with Labtech at this point.
There's also an issue with Software Management Policies - you can't merge a Scan Schedule with an Update policy - whichever applies first overrides the other.
We use a single policy to define server scans, and around 50 policies to define the update schedule. We keep them separate so we don't have to update 50 policies when the scan schedule changes.
This is just one of a few issues in S-M that's keeping us from using or recommending it at this time.
So in regards to the network bandwidth issue, does this mean that "Software Management" has been developed without the ability to use LanCache if configured?
The way they described Software Management was outside of the LANCache ... But that it would use a proprietary client to client type system ... That if a patch was out there that one endpoint needed, it would be able to simultaneously download said patch from all of the other endpoints that had already downloaded the patch (or portions thereof) ... Or at least, that is how we understood it to be ... In practice however, it seems to always download thru the KServer and just bogs whatever network the KServer is on to a standstill (IF you try to deploy more than a few at a time ...) . and Support's answer was to setup 50 thousand different policies so you only do a few at any given time, but if you have more than a handful of endpoints it would take all week to deploy patches without killing anyone's bandwidth ...
I am finally coming to the point where I am able to seriously invest in new computer hardware and the most current Logos version. I have been quite happy with my older version, yet there are too many compelling features for me to not update.
I have been researching a new 15 inch windows Laptop for hardware, versus the Apple Macbook Pro, and the Windows unit seems to be the most versatile and the most upgrade-able.
My problem is, when I begin to maximize the hardware choices to the latest processor, the latest video card, the maximum amount of ram, the fastest and largest SSD's, I can quickly go from a 2200.00 dollar device to an 11,700.00 device. So my dilemma is what would be a good setup that would maximize my Logos experience, and keep me within a 4K budget.
I am looking at the Baptist flavor either Platinum or Portfolio, and am curious if books I am bringing to the table would follow me from prior version, and if so would that impact my package or would I be able to swap out for others to complete the package.
Thank you so much in advance for this information, and guidance and if I could connect with a single salesman, that would be great!
I am not a Logos employee, but just went through that experience. I purchased a refurbished Dell from Walmart:
The model is also sometimes offered with a 500GB SSD for slightly more. I have been happy with my purchase. I earlier purchased a similarly configured model with a Celeron processor, but returned it. The computer comes with a three-month window for return with full refunds (both computer and extended warranty, if purchased). Since I returned the original device within the three-month window, there was no hassle. This model comes with an Intel Core i5-4300M Processor - and works well (by my standards) with LOGOS, WordSearch, OneNote, and LibreOffice, all running simultaneously. Give it a look, and return it if not satisfied for a full refund within three months. Though there is no shipping charge - I had it delivered to my local Walmart so I did not need to be concerned with it sitting outside my house if I was not home.
Note 1: The "Only Two Remaining" message is a bit deceptive. They made the same comment when I purchased my system. After my purchase, the count went down to "one" and eventually "Not in stock" - except that two or three days later the message returned to "Only Two Remaining". That message has recycled through a couple of more times since my purchase last month. I suspect that Walmart purchases only two at a time so they are not loaded down with "refurbished" units.
Note 2: Be sure that a refurbished unit purchased from Walmart says "Sold & shipped by Walmart". Walmart offers the 90-day return policy, other vendors may not. Other vendors may only allow a 7-day return - after that only offering warranty repairs.
MBP => https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/ has PCIe SSD (Solid State Disk) with read speed up to 3.2 GB/s and write up to 2.2 GB/s, which is substantially faster than SATA III SSD with 0.5 GB/s write speed (takes ~6 times longer to write large files). Spinning hard disk has 0.08 GB/s write speed (some hybrid models include smallish SSD for burst writing/reading). Storage speed noticeably affects Logos indexing and daily use.
Laptop upgradability depends on thickness of model. Appls is surface mounting items for smaller space and weight.
My problem is, when I begin to maximize the hardware choices to the latest processor, the latest video card, the maximum amount of ram, the fastest and largest SSD's, I can quickly go from a 2200.00 dollar device to an 11,700.00 device.
You can keep within a 4K budget (but it isn't clear whether that includes your Baptist Library). Go for 8 GB memory (RAM), 250 to 500GB SSD, Intel i5 processor (4 cores, 8th generation), and any 2 GB video card (the latest and greatest isn't needed unless you are a gamer). It should also have USB 3 or 3.1 for speed with peripherals.
Faithlife guarantee that you will not have to purchase a resource twice. All your existing books will follow you when you install the new version of the software.
Eventually Logos 8 will be a free upgrade – unlikely when it is first released. When first released its availability is likely to be linked to the purchase of resource packages or feature sets. You don't say which version of the the software you are running at present but given that your existing computer can run it there is no downside to moving to Logos 7.
My main Logos machine is a year old Dell that was low end (less than 400 bucks) when I got it. 7th generation i3. 6 GB RAM. 1 TB HD. 1 USB 3 port, 2 USB 2 ports. My library is Lutheran Gold, with various other books purchased over the past 16 years for a total of 8.5k books - and a Resource folder of 35 GB.
When running Logos by itself on this low end machine - well - it gets it done. Slow loading up. A bit slower than I want on searches and reports, but workable. But if I start opening up lots of tabs in a web browser and have Microsoft Word also running, it slows down considerably.
Pulling up the "Task Manager" I consistently see that disk access seems to be the only bottleneck. The way multitasking slows things down makes me think that adding more memory would help - and I hear that 8-12 GB would probably be a noticeable improvement. If I were actually using Logos to anything more than just personal growth, I would almost certainly buy a 8 GB chip for 90 bucks or so to go to 12 GB.
But probably money would be better spent on getting a SSD. Probably I could get by for a Logos only machine with a 256 GB SSD. I definitely could with 512.
Just for curiosity clicking the web page for a local big-box story suggests that I could buy an Asus laptop with a 12 GB memory and a 512 SSD for 1k. Since it is Asus, first thing I would do with it would be to go through the Windows 10 process to do a clean re-install to get rid of bloatware, but it should be quite good for Logos.
Changing to look for 16 GB models, and I see many options for around 1k - in fact, with the lack of price difference and increased options at 16 GB, I would definitely go 16 instead of 12 if buying new.
2) Don't go with low end for installed RAM - Logos will use it. For whatever reasons, RAM prices have not been falling like much computer hardware has in the last few years.
3) SSD's make things a LOT faster as long as you get a big enough SSD for your whole library and index. With the way SSD prices are dropping and capacities are growing, this VERY MUCH looks the way to go.
4) I have never had a problem with Logos using the lowest end graphics hardware. The biggest concerns are readability that is easy on the eyes, and your virtual desktop real-estate. With a laptop, the later will always be greatly limited, at least until you dock up with an external screen.
I would consider the Surface Book 2 15". It has a fast SSD (PCIe NVMe SSD). This is the same kind that is used in a Macbook Pro. They're faster than regular SATA SSD's although I'm not sure how much Logos benefits from the increased speed.
That gets you a Core i7 quad core CPU, 16gb of ram, 1TB SSD, and a dedicated GPU. The Surface Book 2 also gets excellent battery life if that's a factor.
If you get an i7 8th generation processor, 16 gig of ram, a graphics card, and a 512 gig SSD, you should be able to handle any Logos program just fine that we can foresee. That should be well within your budget. Of course, I am speaking of a Windows laptop. You would have more money to buy Logos resources left than if you buy an expensive fruity laptop.
"In all cases, the Church is to be judged by the Scripture, not the Scripture by the Church," John Wesley
Of course, I am speaking of a Windows laptop. You would have more money to buy Logos resources left than if you buy an expensive fruity laptop.
Caveat is fruity laptop needs substantially less operating system maintenance plus works well with iOS devices. Also some fruity models have competitive hardware pricing. Albeit not understand fruity decision to discontinue 17" laptop.
Personally prefer best performance per dollar. CPU Benchmarks => https://browser.geekbench.com/processor-benchmarks show Top 20 are a mix of 8th, 7th, and 6th generation Intel Processors: i7, i5, i3, i9, and Xeon. Speed difference in the Top 10 would be humanly challenging to notice since # 1 benchmark of 5931 for 8th Generation i7 is 10% faster than #10 benchmark of 5338 for 6th Generation i7.
Fruity price is $ 2,799 that has several customization options. 15" Display has retina resolution of 2880x1800
Thank you for the message. I appreciate you sharing your experience with me. However, I am looking for something with more processing power and better quality than what walmart has to offer.
I'm an apple fanboy as it is already :) I just can't seem to make the Macbook Pro work for what i want, and I am not willing to go desktop model anymore. I want to stick with the portability.
I have been looking at the gaming lappies as they seem to be the only ones that I can upgrade later and have the most versatility. I am seriously trying to create the best configuration i can for 4k tops. I realize I give up alot at that price point but I just cant justify anymore than that reasonably.

Select models of the Surface Pro (2017) are up to $360 off right now. I just purchased an i5-7300U model with 8GB ram, a 128GB SSD, the Signature Type Cover, and a 2-year warranty from Costco. I'm adding a SanDisk Extreme 128GB microSDXC UHS-3 Card to help make up for the lack of internal storage without completely compromising on speed. That or a similar model might be worth considering for those who can work within such specs. Large Logos libraries can be quite the space hogs! So far, everything has been extremely quick and snappy both inside and outside of Logos, except for a couple bugs that I've encountered in Logos with at least one of them being old. The display is only 12.3 inches but excellent. I have a 32 inch external monitor that I use at home.
That doesn't seem to fit quite what you're looking for, Kevin. Nevertheless, there are plenty of options available as you and everyone else have already demonstrated. Keep in mind that technology moves so fast these days, that you might be better off spending on the lower end of your budget and then planning on upgrading if need be in a few years or so. You might also consider investing some of that money into a decent external display if you don't already have one. Computer hardware tends to offer steep diminishing returns (depending on one's opportunities, needs, and priorities).
If you do as suggested by Brian in the third paragraph of his last message you don't need to go to the special tab!
As for me it’s not such an important thing in the game, there are more important things (the same bugs)
This infuriates sometimes, I click on the reward, that it would be faster to get it, and then advertising, there is no choice
Hello I'm kinda new to these new updates and I'd like to say something to tactisoft about supermechs - Ideas & Features - Tacticsoft Community
Hello I'm kinda new to these new updates and I'd like to say something to tactisoft about supermechs
So first of all I lost my good old account what was lvl 30, rank 2/3, complete campaign and was called powerstorm. I’d like you to help me find this account please I’ll be very greatfull. And the second thing is… where the crud is shop with items and why are colors so expensive?
Someone from SM team said they removed it because the shop’s huge item list scared new players I’m still laughing at this one
Please send an email to Supermechs@tacticsoft.net for assistance. They should be able to assist you.
Hi there, I’m wondering if some of you, who know your stuff, can go and update the Supermechs Wiki. I don’t know enough to go change it myself but if any of the other players can fix it up that would be really helpful
Currently 61 items available for viewing in workshop [ last updated 24-sept-2017 ] Welcome to the official Super Mechs wikia page! Here you can find all the information about items, the game and various things in it such as the Workshop, campaign and...
This issue is especially irritating since TS can do just like they did with the old MYTHICAL page we used to have inside the settings page. It would have all of the pictures, stats, hidden stats, etc BUT the big thing is it would auto update every time TS went all NERFAHOLIC changing game stats.
Where the wiki we have to fully re upload the changed snapshots each time TS changes stuff which happens A LOT.
I did some editing on that wiki a while back, but when the big update a while back where they updated all the torsos and lowered the damage on all the weapons everyone else had stopped updating the wiki but me and I got a bit discouraged and stopped updating it.
As far as I know there are no requirements to edit anything. All I did was make an account and start editing. So if you guys want to start updating it I don’t think there’s anything stopping you.

The second stage of the Viability Study for Burnley Empire is now complete. The study by Bonnar Keenlyside and Theatresearch and commissioned by a stakeholder group, which includes Burnley Empire Theatre Trust (BETT), Burnley Borough Council, University of Central Lancashire, Burnley College, Burnley Civic Trust and Theatres Trust, has concluded that there is a clear opportunity for the restoration of this Grade II listed theatre through a long-term venture with partnership and training at its core. The proposal, which includes restoring the historic auditorium to its original splendour, is seen as a great opportunity for local heritage skills education and vocational training for young people.
The Grade II listed theatre has lain vacant for the last 20 years and in an increasingly poor state of repair. The current situation is recognised as untenable and a decision on the future of the building is required. The Viability Study was tasked to explore alternative routes for the building, including demolition, to allow a balanced overview of all available options.
The report identified a preferred option – an innovative and incremental approach to the renovation of the building. In the short term it would allow the development of the stage house into a fully independent night club / events space, with a long term vision to fully restore the auditorium through an initiative with heritage skills training and to reopen it as a working venue.
Whilst the project route is complex, the potential benefits are numerous: offering training development and job opportunities to the local community; providing new opportunities for independent artists and creative entrepreneurs; and creating community space for the people of Burnley, in particular young people and students. As well as the cultural and economic benefits, the project would breathe new life into an important heritage asset - East Lancashire’s only Grade II listed purpose-built Edwardian theatre.
It is recognised that set against the positive opportunities of the project are the considerable challenges and key to the project’s success will be harnessing the current local support as well as securing the ongoing partnership of key stakeholders.
Whilst it is regrettable that the Council will be unable to commit any financial investment in the project, the relationships and channels of communication which have been established between the Council, Burnley Empire Theatre Trust and other organisations through working together on the Viability Study remain in place, and the stakeholder group will continue to investigate other partnerships to take the scheme forward and to restore the Grade II listed building.
The Council continue to maintain their support for a reuse of the building and would welcome a viable community operation for the Empire.
The Council will be progressing work on a masterplan for Burnley Town Centre which will include the Empire. Theatres Trust and BETT are to be consulted as a part of the masterplan exercise and look forward to engaging with this work going forward.
Burnley Empire is currently vested in the Duchy of Lancashire. The Duchy continue to be very understanding and have extended the timescale for any proposed auction on the building to allow the next stage of the project to complete.
BETT are also currently holding fundraising events to support the future restoration of the Empire – for further details of these events refer to http://burnleyempiretheatretrust.weebly.com/ / https://en-gb.facebook.com/BurnleyEmpire/

” i like living a healthy life. which includes going to the gym for atleast 2 hours a day . i love dancing and lets not forget good sex….. haha… my ultimate fantasy would be …… having a 4some with different guys fucking me really hard ….. “
” Going out to drinking, dancing, chilling with my trans-sisters; eating out at new, exotic restaurants, trying new things in general. My Fantasy is taking two men inside me at once; being fisted by a big, strong, handsome man; one day having both my ass and urethra stretched while sucking down a hard, juicy cock! Mm-mm! Yummy!”
” Hi Boys i’m Eclair, I am a dancer at the clubs and just started shooting for many hot porn sets! I’m into guys with a sweet personality. Sometimes i like to play a sweet innocent school girl.I have two school girl skirts that I love to dress in. I can also be a naughty girl as well.”
“I`m a horny shemale wanting a good gangbang, I love it with guy`s girls and other tranny`s. It gets me really hard when i think about huge cocks throbbing thinking of me as i stroke myself down my tgirl shaft. I get into some pretty dirty things so don`t be shy to ask.”
“My biggest fantasy is to have four or five guys fuck me for hours till i pass out and i can’t stand up after! I want to feel all my holes filled with a blindfold on so i never know who is inside of me, all i know is that the thing i worship most is in me. I love going to parks and other beautiful places outside during the summer and seeing what the world has to offer. I love the sky- no matter how bad it gets down here on planet Earth at least we’ve got this beautiful sky above us.”
“I am the embodiment of all of your XXX tranny fantasies come true. I am versatile enough to make you choke on my cock as well as take your cock deep inside of me. I am a 100% all natural shemale beauty who loves to make sure everyone I encounter leaves with a smile. I not only have an amazingly sexy body but I also have the seductive voice as well. I hope you are ready have your fucking world rocked like never before.”
” My primary fetish is general body worship (focusing on my beautiful feet and amazing ass). I love my body and think I am amazingly blessed with beauty! I also enjoy most aspects of BDSM and fetish play, especially D/s stuff, altough I dont “need” BDSM stuff to get off or be interested in sex. Obviously I like anal, but for girls like us that isnt really a fetish since it’s our only bottom hole, but I love being fucked”
“I consider myself a Renaissance girl since I have a wide range of interests and knowledge. I’m very eclectic in my taste and interests. I love high heels, stockings, garters and lingerie. I’m totally bi so I like all different types of partners. My major fantasy is to be in the middle of a hot 3 way. I don’t care if it’s two boys, two tgirls, or to genetic girls as long as I get to be in the middle and getting it from both ends.”
“As far as I can say, I`m just a horny girl trying to survive like the rest of us. Gotta use what we got! When I am off the porn biz, you can find me in the hellzone we call Phoenix at the underground rave scene. Gotta warn ya, I party hard. I’m a huge weeaboo, meaning I get a boner for anything Asian. Also for some reason the whole babysitter scenario really gets me going…”

Stress is a relatively new notion that everybody talks about, yet few understand. The dictionary defines stress as "pressure, force, strain; a state of physical or mental tension inducing it, or affecting something.' This definition, while obviously correct, is not very helpful in understanding the concept of stress. On the other hand, it is important to comprehend the notion, because all of us are continuously exposed to stress. Stress occurs in many forms. The four major categories which concern us are:
Each of these stress forms can originate from multiple sources. Most of these have appeared as primary threats in our environment as recently as this century. For example, chemical stress can come from pesticides, insecticides, polluted air and water, heavy metals such as mercury or lead, asbestos and worst of all radioactive waste. Even jet travel, a welcome commonplace today but unheard of a mere half century ago, exposes passengers to an unhealthy high level of ozone and random cosmic radiation's. In the light of such widespread physiological insult, it is a true miracle that any if us manage to stay healthy at all.
One of the primary reasons why stress is so important to understand, is because it is intricately linked to the functioning of our immune systems. How many of us have gotten a cold when our defenses were impaired by excessive stress? This is another angle from which to view to view the recent rash of immune disorders unleashed in our culture. Could these problems be partly caused by an overwhelmed immune system? It should be obvious that this is quite possible, and the more we consider the high levels of stress that most of us are exposed to daily, the more relevant the idea become. In other words, understanding and compensating for the stress in our lives will help our immune systems and enhance our ability to stay well.
This is not to imply that all stress is harmful. Exercise, for example, is a form of stress on the body which is quite healthy. Yet if we over-exert ourselves during exercise, we can damage the body and create problems. As we have already mentioned, many unavoidable stress factors, such as pollution, and others that cause damage to the body, stem from today's world of technological progress. In many cases the physical result brought on by several different forms of stress is the same. The unnecessary, but avoidable results are cellular damage caused by over-reactive molecules called "Free Radicals."
Due to their over-reactive nature, free radicals can be extremely toxic and are a direct consequence of the primary stress factors that adversely affect the immune system and threaten our health. However, this is not to imply that free radicals are always harmful or dangerous. Minute amounts of free radicals are essential for many important functions of the immune system and other vital cellular activities. For example, the immune system will actually generate free radicals to use in the process of removing a virus or bacteria. Only when high concentrations of free radicals are present, or when the levels of free radicals overwhelm the body's ability to remove them, does the threat to our health occur.
Maintaining the balance between free radical activity and antioxidant enzyme supply is one of the important functions of the body (Fig. 1)
The New York Giants had the best press release of the year when the team decided to all go bowling together. Yesterday, they faced Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts who were not impressed with their colorful bowling shoes and defeated the Giants 20-12 in the preseason game.
We love sports in large part because of the uncertainty. It isn't scripted, and we can never be sure how it's going to turn out. Andrew Luck is one of the rare cases of something being interesting because we know precisely how the story is going to end.
Luck is everything he was made out to be coming out of Stanford. The Colts quarterback is practically a lock to be a
great player. Everyone can see that. And following his maturation into being that great player is going to be fascinating.
Luck has looked very good in the preseason as he prepares for his second season. In the preseason opener last week, he was 4-of-6 for 51 yards in limited work. Against the Giants he played one quarter, and one drive into the second quarter. He went 9-of-13 for 107 yards and two touchdowns, and when he took a seat the Colts led 17-3.
If someone said that, in about five months, Luck would be universally acknowledged as a top three NFL quarterback, would you be that surprised?
He had some things to work on after a very good rookie season, and looks much better in year two. He still has the athletic ability and the big arm, and in very brief preseason work it's obvious this familiar offense fits him well.
Last season Luck worked in Bruce Arians' vertical offense, and attempted more passes of 20 or more yards (101) than any other quarterback, according to Pro Football Focus. Joe Flacco was second with 92, and only five quarterbacks in all attempted more than 80. And Luck was good on those deep throws, completing 35 (his receivers had eight drops, too). But he had six interceptions (only Drew Brees had more on deep passes, with seven), and the heavy vertical attack also helps explain his 54.1 completion percentage. Not that he didn't do very well in that offense – he threw for 4,374 yards and led the Colts, who were 2-14 the year before, to a very surprising playoff berth.
Now with Pep Hamilton as offensive coordinator, Luck is running the same offense he did at Stanford. Mainly because Hamilton was Luck's offensive coordinator during the quarterback's final season at Stanford. In the Colts' two preseason games it's easy to see that Luck will be asked to complete a lot of high-percentage throws. He looks comfortable and confident. His completion percentage should skyrocket. It's 68.4 percent this preseason. His interceptions probably will go down, although he did get lucky Sunday night when Giants cornerback Aaron Ross dropped one on a play that Reggie Wayne eventually hauled in for a circus touchdown catch. Luck performed admirably in a new offense last year, but he seems like a perfect fit in Hamilton's scheme that has plenty of West Coast elements.
Luck's physical ability is special, even among NFL quarterbacks, and he showed it off against the Giants. His 18-yard touchdown throw to T.Y. Hilton on third and 11 was made with pinpoint accuracy right over the cornerback – and was also a very athletic catch by a rapidly emerging Hilton. His best play against the Giants was probably an incompletion. He rolled left, then contorted his body to deliver a perfect strike downfield between two Giants defenders to tight end Coby Fleener. Fleener dropped the throw. It was still a jaw-dropping pass.
Earlier this week, Andrew Luck was in the news because his teammate Reggie Wayne made a controversial comparison between Luck and Peyton Manning. Watch ESPN's First Take discuss the controversial comparison.
Reggie Wayne recently made headlines when he said the way Andrew Luck approaches practice is a lot like Peyton Manning. Practice does make perfect but what really counts is how a QB performs come game time. Who better to put Andrew Luck to the test than Peyton's brother Eli Manning. Bet on the New York Giants vs Indianapolis Colts.
By activating the NetSuite Advanced Projects module, your company can track time for employees and contractors alike. But many do not know that NetSuite allows an unlimited number of vendors to access you company account. This is great value for companies, such as staffing companies, that use 1099 contractors to track and bill time to clients.
There are some important considerations related to approval management. This article will outline the time approver functionality differences that may matter in you business workflow.
The employee who is marked as a “Project Manager” resource on a specific project can approve time submitted to that project. The project manager will approve time via the Employee Center under their own login.
The Supervisor defined on the employee record has ability to approve all time for that employee. The supervisor can access the Approve Time menu item in various ways. For example, in the Classic Workcenter, the path way is Transactions, Employees, Approve Time.
The Time Approver defined on the employee record, if defined, behaves the same way as the Supervisor noted in the previous item.
Any non-employee center (full service) employee role that has “Transactions –> Time Track” permission can see and approve all unapproved time entries .
The page to approve time is located at https://system.netsuite.com/app/accounting/transactions/timeapproval.nl?whence=
The only way to approve Vendor submitted timesheet is with an employee role that has the “Transactions –> Time Track” permission.
For some business environments, this can be cumbersome. Project Managers will like the ability to only see time for projects they are managing. However, if they have a contractor on a project, they will need to go to a page that show all project based employees and vendors (even ones that are projects they are not managing) and hand pick the vendors that are working on their projects.
I have contemplated building a NetSuite SuiteLet that will allow a project manager see and approve all the unapproved time on a project in one place independent of resource type. This could be hooked up right on the Project page. Going further, why not show all the projects that the manager is caring for and present unapproved time in one place? Indeed, this would become a replacement for the built-in NetSuite employee time approver page — not my idea of fun for creating functionality that arguably should be out-0f-the-box. Perhaps this is the price to pay for no-cost vendor access.

It is a way of changing a non-forest area or land into a forest. Afforestation is not only a part of sustainable development but also cause ecological balances. Due to increase in infrastructure, industries, development of technology, large forest area has been cut off which reduces the carbon sinks and cause global warming. Hence in order to fight the issue of global warming, soil erosion, pollution and creating ecological balance and maintenance of bio-diversity, afforestation is required.Read more
India ranks 10th in the list of most forested nations in the world with 76.87 million ha of forest and tree cover & India’s forest and tree cover accounts for about 24% of the total geographical area of the country by 2013. India has been successful in improving carbon stock in its forest by about 5% from 6,621.5 million tons in 2005 to 6,941 million tonnes in 2013. The forests are playing a significant role in carbon storage and sequestration has increased their importance manifold and brought them to the centre-stage of climate change mitigation strategies. Forests, like other ecosystems, are affected by climate change. The impacts due to climate change may be negative in some areas, and positive in others. However, forests also influence climate and the climate change process mainly by effecting the changes in the quantum of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They absorb CO2 from atmosphere, and store carbon in wood, leaves, litter, roots and soil by acting as “carbon sinks”. Carbon is released back into the atmosphere when forests are cleared or burned. Forests by acting as sinks are considered to moderate the global climate.
It expatiate the deforestation and forest degradation while increasing the direct benefits from it to population and environment by conserving and maintaining the forest ecosystem. SFM is a management regime that integrates and balances social, economic, ecological, cultural and spiritual need needs of present and future generation (United Nation, 1992). For managing forest sustainably proper forest policies, legislation, institutional framework, incentives and technical as well as huge skilled manpower is required. SFM not only ensure the increase in forest products like wood, fire-wood, fruits etc. but also reduces the threat from fires, pests and natural disaster. It also included agroforestry as well as tree based oil and subsequently increase the natural carbon capture and storage system. SFM also contributed the multiple water ecosystem services. It has been estimated forested catchment supply around 75% of fresh water. In India 701.673 Sq. Km is under forest which include 85,904 Sq. Km Very Dense Forest, 315,374 Sq. Km Moderate Dense Forest and 300,395 Sq. Km Open Forest with total carbon stock of 6,941 million tonnes (2013). The National Afforestation and Eco-Development Board (NAEB), set up by MoEFCC in August 1992, which is responsible for promoting afforestation,tree planting, ecological restoration and eco-development activities in the country, with special attention to the degraded forest areas and lands adjoining the forest areas, national parks, sanctuaries and other protected areas as well as the ecologically fragile areas like the Western Himalayas, Aravallis, Western Ghats, etc. Other initiatives of Government of India are (i) The Forest (Conversation) Act, 1980, (ii) National Forest Policy, 1988, (iii) JFM, NFC, CAMPA

The MonkeyLectric LED light system, invented by Instructables.com co-founder Dan Goldwater, turns spinning bike wheels into a psychedelic experience. Over at Boing Boing Gadgets, Brownlee has written a magnificent essay on the inherent weirdness of bicycles and the magic of MonkeyLectric lights. From BB Gadgets:
Today’s post is something I’ve prepared for a long time. Hardware-wise it’s a simple thing – ATtiny45 emulating a PS/2 device, sending a keypress when three knocks are detected in the attached piezoelectric sensor (or piezo buzzer as they are also called). But if your computer can boot on PS/2 keyboard input and you have your computer stowed somewhere hard to reach (or just want to impress your friends), it’s a pretty neat little gadget! Here’s a video of it in action:
My PC takes a few seconds to put anything on display, but if you look at the bottom right corner, you can see the blue power LEDs light up immediately after the knocks.
Hardware-wise this hack is super simple. You’ll need less than $10 in parts and many probably already have these lying around:
ATtiny45. Actually, any ATtiny or ATmega with 4kB or more flash, A/D converter and two timers will work with small adjustments, and with -Os -DMINIMAL compiler flags also 2kB MCUs (ATtiny2313 doesn’t have a A/D but you can either work around it or use a button)
PS/2 connector, or alternatively a passive USB-PS/2 adapter (I have half a dozen from old keyboards and mice) and USB cable (like the one I used in my V-USB tutorial)
Optionally, a 4k7 ohm pullup resistor for RESET line, and a LED and 330 ohm resistor to indicate state
The PS/2 part as discussed in my minimal PS/2 keyboard post doesn’t require any other hardware than the ATtiny. The piezo element uses a 1 Mohm resistor like in the Arduino Knock Sensor tutorial, providing a path for voltage level to get back to zero over time. The LED is connected to PB4.
The PS/2 connector also provides power to the device. Instead of soldering a custom PS/2 connector for the project, I took a passive USB-PS/2 adapter I had lying around and used a multimeter to find out which USB pins correspond to the PS/2 ones. Not surprisingly, PS/2 GND and VCC are connected to USB GND and VCC. In my adapters, PS/2 clock was connected to D+ and data to D-. You can see the mnemonic printout I made on that one below, as well as one possible breadboard configuration.
Note that the USB connector mnemonic and the 4-pin header in the breadboard illustration have opposite orientations (as you can see from the black and red wires in each) – you can mentally rotate the USB wires 180 degress if you are “plugging it in” to the breadboard in your mind. :)
In order to have enough clock cycles for PS/2 communication, it’s recommended to disable the 8X clock divider in ATtiny45 default fuse settings, increasing the clock frequency from 1 MHz to 8 MHz. The clock doesn’t need to be very accurate, as PS/2 spec allows over 10 % variation from the 12.5 kHz we’re trying to achieve. The high/low fuse combination I went for is 0xDD/0xE2.
You can use avrdude to do it, but I like the AVRweb tool I developed some time ago, as I don’t have to reverse engineer my current fuse settings every time. It’s still in alpha stage so no guarantees, but it is very simple and has worked without problems for me so far. You may also want to check out this tip to make future flashing of ATtiny25/45/85 MCUs a breeze.
After changing fuse settings, I like to check that the clock frequency is what I think it is before doing anything else. Here’s something that should blink the LED on PB3 every second or so:
Once the clock frequency is OK, it’s also a good thing to see if vibrations in the piezo sensor can be detected correctly. This required correct A/D converter settings for the ADC register to work like we want it to. Here’s another test program for that:
When you run it, the LED should flash for half a second every time you tap the piezo element. You can download both of these test programs with a simple Makefile that lets you say make blink.hex to compile the blink test, or make piezo.flash to both compile and flash it (you’ll need to edit the Makefile if you’re using a different ISP programmer than USBtiny).
The actual program code that you can download or clone from Github is a complete PS/2 device that will respond intelligently to most PS/2 protocol commands from PC, although it will also ignore most of it, like setting typematic rate or other behavioral things. However, it is plenty enough so you shouldn’t get any errors about malfunctioning keyboard device like I did with my earlier project.
I won’t discuss the code in detail here – you can read my previous post on state machines with C callbacks after which you should be able to understand the basic mechanism how the PS/2 communication is handled. I have separated the code in several files – most of it is rather straightforward setting up of A/D conversion, timers, etc. which you can read better tutorials in the net or AVR Freaks Tutorials forum than I have space to cover here. Here’s a quick rundown of the source files:
timer.c and timer.h include timer setup for ATtin25/45/85 as well as ATtiny2313. Other tiny/mega chips are left for the reader as exercise ;)
ring.c and ring.h contains a simple ring buffer implementation for communication between PS/2 code and main program logic. It is not re-entrant or anything, but current use should not cause problems (although I have no mathematical proof about it)
The code is released under GNU GPL v3. It is by no means a complete toolkit for every PS/2 project out there, but should provide a great starting point for such an endeavor. Implementing fully bomb-proof PS/2 device side code that can handle all possible interruptions by PC (some of which are extremely unlikely but still within spec) is something that would require several days of additional coding and even some information that I could not easily find from the net. I’m fairly certain that the current implementation fares as well as most “PS/2 compatible” USB keyboards, but I know that I could jam it with carefully constructed host side code…
The heart of this hack, however, lies elsewhere than in the PS/2 implementation (which is the “hard part”). The knocking logic is implemented as follows:
I initially just had one knock, but it became a nuisance when the device would type space whenever I placed something on the table. Now every knock increments a counter, and next knock won’t register until 0.5s after the previous one (because one knock will cause vibration for tens of milliseconds). Furthermore, if more than 3 seconds have elapsed since last registered knock, the counter will start from beginning, so you don’t accumulate three knocks in, say, eight hours.
You can either download the github version or use git clone git://github.com/jokkebk/ps2kb to get it. If you’re using the exact things I am (ATtiny45 and USBtiny ISP programmer) you can just run make run to compile the .hex and flash it. There are some settings in the Makefile you might want to take look at if you desire to build a minimal version for 2 kB MCUs or want to omit the LED (just remove -DLED=PB4), use a button instead of a piezo or something like that.
A handy tool to check if everything works is the Arduino-based PS/2 tester I featured some weeks ago. You can try sending “EE” (echo) command to see if the device responds with “EE”, and other PS/2 commands. Furthermore, you can tap the piezo element three times (remember to wait 0.5 seconds between each tap, or you’ll need extra taps) and see if the device sends 0x29 (spacebar pressed) and 0xF0, 0x29 (spacebar released) like it should.
I recently got a Saleae Logic analyzer which was a big improvement over my earlier, sometimes creative, DIY attempts that all left a bit to desire. The screenshot above shows two bytes of PS/2 communications from device to PC. I’ve added red lines on clock low for reasons we’ll see shortly. Even without PS/2 analyzer plugins (I’m planning to try my hands at writing one at some point) the PS/2 traffic is quite simple to decipher:
From the screenshot, we can see that the first sequence of eleven bits is 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1 which means start bit, a byte 11110000, i.e. 0xF0 (here most significant bit is first), parity bit of 1 and the stop bit. The second set of bits is 0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1 from which the data portion is 1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0, i.e. the data byte is 0x29 (00101001, note again the reversed order in written notation). So what we are seeing here is the break code for spacebar – 0xF0, 0x29. Works nicely!
When PC is sending it begins the exact opposite way by first pulling clock low, then pulling data low and releasing clock so the device is free generate the clock signal. Data line is manipulated on clock low, and the device reads the data on clock high. There is also a special way to acknowledge the sent data, see for example this PS/2 protocol page for details.
Once everything is working, just attach the device to the bottom of your desk (I used a piece of paper and tape to make a “pocket” for the sensor, and off you are to amaze your friends! And of course, if you have a hard-to-reach power button, you will actually save several seconds of your valuable time on every boot. I counted that with about 40 hours of work put into this project and its spinoffs, I’ll be on the plus side in half a century or so!
As you can see from the final image, I’m actually using a more compact version of this project. I actually designed a PCB and ordered three of them from OSH Park for $3.90. I’ll be covering the design process and end result in another post hopefully pretty soon, so be sure to check back in a couple of weeks! Or even better, subscribe to the RSS feed, I also have a Saleae logic analyzer test and a few other things planned in the near future. :)
Coding since 1990 in Basic, C/C++, Perl, Java, PHP, Ruby and Python, to name a few. Also interested in math, movies, anime, and the occasional slashdot now and then. Oh, and I also have a real life, but lets not talk about it!	View all posts by Joonas Pihlajamaa
would you be willing to make one of these? I would toss you like 20$ for one if you wanted to make it and ship it
Hi! Sorry, I don’t have the parts at hand (used my last ATtiny45 on the one I have installed), and am also somewhat short on free time, so you’ll probably have better luck in either getting and Arduino (hardware is plenty enough, but code would need some customizing) and just wiring that to PS/2, or maybe contacting a local hackerspace, there might be someone who might be glad to help you.
Pretty cool project! Since I don’t think I have any PS2 ports, I think I will try making this by wiring it into the ATX PSU itself (the connector, actually). We’ll see how it goes.
The ATX power switch would probably be ideal, as I believe it only needs to be turned on momentarily for the motherboard to detect it and boot up the computer.
ATtiny85 and a HHKB! I like your style. Very nice write up. I’m working on a digispark clone with all through-hole parts and this might be a good project to try. I didn’t realize switching power on via the keyboard was not doable using USB (makes sense though thinking about it), come to think of it I’ve only seen power buttons on ADB keyboards. Is that block of wood on the desk a fancy palm rest? I’d say your computer desk if sufficiently friend-impressing worthy.
actually, after doing some research there is a USB keyscan code for power. why it isn’t used is beyond me. if it works, and if motherboards support it is a whole different thing and something i can’t test since i dont have the hardware or knowledge to do so.
Haha, thanks, nice to have a fellow hacker that appreciates my setup – most guests just shrug their heads when I demonstrate the great layout and tactile feel of the HHKB. :) And yeah it’s a fancy palm rest by Filco meant for their Minila line, but perfect for HHKB, too.
Motherboard monitoring USB keyboard would be doable, but significantly harder than PS/2 where it takes a couple dozen lines of code to recognize spacebar – minimal USB stack would probably be a thousand lines at least.
i have downloaded and used the code successfully (after adding support for the extended keycodes like power on and optimising code so it would fit on the ATTiny2313 cause minimal was still to big :P )
however, i fear i will have to move to my ATMega32 (16PU). however, the code in the timer.c is a bit to low level for me to understand.
from my basic understanding the prescales are used to determine how many ticks is a certain amount of time but the low level names and descriptions are kinda over my head.
The 2x difference might just be that I had 16 MHz crystal in one and used 8 MHz internal oscillator for the other. But there are also different timing modes in the chips (for example, I recall some have 2x mode), so it might be just that.
The AVR data sheets actually give very clear and helpful explanations of this low level stuff (just look up the timer chapter for you chip), so armed with the datasheet and my example code, you can probably deduce what it is doing rather easily (the hardest part usually is to figure which registers are needed and in what order, and that is already done in timer.c).
Also, if you have a multimeter with frequency measurement or an oscilloscope, you can easily try different values and see how they impact the frequency.
i should check the instructions but from the looks of it the ATMega32 is the same as the ATTiny2313 ^^;
i take it back. seems the attiny chips have 2 8-bit timers , which you use, and 1 16bit timer. atmega has 1 8bit and 2 16bit timers.
Timer bits should not matter… I recall my PS/2 part only needs one or two timers? My first ideas would be to make sure everything else is 100 % OK (i.e. all pin changes from one chip to another is reflected in the code, etc.), and then double check your 16 bit timer is giving the correct rate (12.5 kHz can be checked for example by blinking a led every 80 iterations, it should result in 1s delays)… Other than that, no idea. :)
– According to ps2config.h, CLOCK pin must be connected to PB0 and DATA pin must be connected to PB1.
There is also some compilation errors about deprecated prog_uint8_t. I can send a patch if you want.
Thanks! Shame on me for two separate errors in one diagram! Fixed those, now it should be less confusing for others. :)
i’ve been programmin attiny45 by atmel studio, which is the full hex code to put in the chip? i saw pag of downloadable stuff but what is the main system config?
You can probably add the .c files into an AVR Studio project and compile. I might be uploading the built .hex at some point to github as well, but no guarantees. :)
It was much more of an odd piece than a practically rolex replica sale useful one, and hence it had not received instant recognition or success. It has to be noted though that replica watches uk at the time of its creation in the middle of the 1950's intercontinental business trips were much less common than rolex replica sale they are today, which rendered this watch less desirable than its similarly expensive counterparts which were equipped with other useful complications as judged by contemporary standards. In any event the original Patek Philippe World Timer is a complicated piece unto itself. The ingenious world time disc-system was invented by Louis Cottier in 1931 was later replica watches implemented by Patek, Vacheron Constantin, Rolex, and others. As times have changed, not only did this complication rolex replica uk become one of the most popular useful functions, but the reference 2523 has also become much more appreciated among collectors, as seen by the seven figure prices these replica watches uk world timers consistently achieve at auctions.

Break In refers to the procedure required to enable these parts to properly wear into the engine, and the surfaces they touch, so that they will preform properly, prevent damage, and to enable proper and prolonged life of a new engine build.
The ONLY parts of a new engine build that "Break In" and therefore require special Break In Procedures:
If you were told otherwise, you were given improper information. A good example of this is Turbos, very often people are told they need a break in period. This is FALSE.
This is different than engine break in, as this only assures oil as been properly and thoroughly forced into all areas of oil lubrication that exist in an engine.
To ensure you are not starting a new engine without proper and thorough oil lubrication throughout the engine and the many parts that require oil lubrication, to avoid metal to metal contact the engine needs to be oil primed before first startup.
Do this by disconnecting the CAS (Cam Angle Sensor) on 1991-1992 3000GT/Stealth or the Cam and Crank Sensors on the 1993-1999 3000GT/Stealth so that while cranking the engine the fuel injectors and spark plugs won't fire.
While using a light to look through the oil filler cap looking at the oiling hole on the tips of the valve rocker, crank the engine until oil starts streaming out of the oiling holes, and the low oil pressure light on the dash goes out.
To help protect all of the metal to metal contact points in the engine I highly recommend using either:
The rings break in by knocking off the sharp edges in the new cylinder bore hone. The rings need to knock this roughness down and seat into the cylinder wall. In order for this to happen efficiently there needs to be adequate cylinder pressure. Driving around for 1000 miles, or even 100 miles, taking it very easy on the engine works against that.
Running the engine gently during the first 100 miles can cause the rings to not seat and possibly never seat. There is a small window of time when the engine needs to break in and if you miss that window it will require a new cylinder hone and new rings in order to properly seat the rings, break in the engine.
It is also recommended, unless you know the tune on the engine will be dead on perfect, that you start and break in a new engine on a stock ECU and stock fuel injectors. If a new engine is run too rich, too much fuel, the fuel will wash down the cylinder walls, washing off the oil and will end up in pushing past the piston rings and into the oil pan.
Washing the oil off the cylinder walls will make it impossible to seat the rings. It will also dilute the engine oil with fuel causing the oil to lose it's lubrication, damaging all parts of the engine that require oil lubrication including the bearings and turbos.
Once this system is completed the rings will be about 85% seated. The remaining 15% will take a few weeks of driving around to complete.
Run engine up to operating temp using a burping funnel to burp cooling system with the heater set on hot but on lowest fan speed in order to also burp heater core. Let cooling fans cycle twice to ensure complete coolant system burping. Close up coolant system and change oil and oil filter. Then do break in runs. Once all break in runs are done, change oil and filer.
Make sure to check your oil level, have a correctly burped coolant system, and don't have any leaks.
*When the engine hits 4000 rpm let off of the gas, leave car in gear and let the car "engine brake" down to below 2500 rpm. The vacuum also helps the rings seat.
*When the engine hits 4500 rpm let off of the gas, leave car in gear and let the car engine brake down to below 3000 rpm. The vacuum also helps the rings seat.
*When the engine hits 5500 rpm let off of the gas, leave car in gear and let the car engine brake down to below 3500 rpm. The vacuum also helps the rings seat.
*When the engine hits 7000 rpm let off of the gas, leave car in gear and let the car engine brake down to below 3000 rpm. The vacuum also helps the rings seat.
Change your engine oil and filter, it will have the fine metal powder that is created from the rings seating into the cylinder walls.

One of the most complicated parts of the O’Bannon ruling against the NCAA stems from the fact that Judge Wilken did not have to take Title IX into account when she ordered stipends and trust funds for football and men’s basketball student athletes.
I am not a Title IX scholar or expert, but I did interview about a half dozen of them when I was writing Saturday Millionaires for the chapter on pay-for-play. One big misconception I’m seeing from fans on Twitter this morning is that Title IX only covers equal opportunities for female student athletes. That is not the entire story. Most of you are familiar with what we call the “three-prong test” for Title IX, which does focus on opportunities. However, the three-prong test is just one of three parts of a full Title IX analysis.
The issues I see with the O’Bannon ruling and Title IX come in the second part about athletically-related financial aid and in the third part (the laundry list) where publicity and recruitment are factors.
Would a court consider the new stipend and trust fund for football and men’s basketball players “athletically-related financial aid”? Does it matter that football and men’s basketball players are publicized in more high-profile ways than female student athletes? What about the fact that the new trust fund will be associated with recruitment? Those are questions that will have to be answered.
I want to give you some excerpts from Saturday Millionaires where I explained the three parts of Title IX analysis to highlight where the O’Bannon ruling might be at odds with Title IX. Here’s an explanation of the three-prong test you’re probably the most familiar with:
Most fans know Title IX requires comparable treatment of women when it comes to collegiate athletics, and a great many also know about the so-called three-prong test for compliance, which looks at proportionality, history of the program or full accommodation of interests. What many don’t seem to not know, however, is that the three-prong test only covers one of three requirements for Title IX compliance.
The three requirement areas are: Participation, Athletic Financial Assistance and Treatment of Athletes.
First, there’s the three-prong test many of you know, which falls under Participation. This area basically measures the opportunities for female vs. male athletes. Institutions can show they comply with this area by meeting one of the following prongs:
Proportionality: the institution can show that it offers opportunities for females and males based on their respective enrollment numbers at the university.
History and Program Expansion: the institution can show that it has continued to offer new and additional opportunities as the needs of the underrepresented sex have risen.
Full accommodation of interests and abilities: the institution can show that the current offerings fully meet the interest level of the underrepresented sex.
Fans believe this three-prong test that is part of the first requirement of Title IX is the only test for compliance, because it is the portion of the test most often focused on by the media. Generally when reports surface that a school is in danger of not complying with Title IX it is because they’re being accused of not meeting one of these three prongs.
If the three-prong test of the first requirement was all there was to Title IX, it’s easy to see why fans don’t understand how paying only football players would create an issue. The problems become more apparent when you look at the second and third requirements of Title IX.
The second requirement for compliance under Title IX, “Athletic Financial Assistance” is where the O’Bannon ruling might make things tricky. From Saturday Millionaires:
The second requirement for compliance is entitled Athletic Financial Assistance. The only express requirement under this section is that scholarships be allocated proportionately in accordance with the number of female vs. male athletes.
Here’s how the math is calculated under this section. The total amount of aid awarded to male athletes is divided by the total amount of aid awarded to all athletes. The same is then done for female athletes.
For example, in 2010-2011 Virginia Tech had total aid of $9,027,685. Of that, $5,591,672 was awarded to male athletes and $3,436,013 to female athletes. The percentages come out at 61.94 percent and 38.06 percent.
Now you look at the unduplicated count of male athletes versus the total number of unduplicated athletes and then do the same for the female athletes. For example, if an athlete competes on both the football and baseball teams he only counts once for this calculation.
At Virginia Tech in 2010-2011, the unduplicated count of male athletes was 358 and female was 204, registering at 63.07 percent and 36.30 percent, respectively.
The test for Athletic Financial Assistance is whether financial assistance is provided in a substantially proportionate manner. There is no set percentage deemed appropriate, instead it is reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
In our example at Virginia Tech, male athletes account for 63.70 percent of all athletes and receive 61.94 percent of all aid. Female athletes account for 36.30 percent of all athletes and receive 38.06 percent of all aid. There would seem to be an argument to be made there that it’s substantially proportionate.
Now that you know what the math looks like, here are two different discussions to be had based on what the proposed pay-for-play plan looks like: (i) cost-of-attendance increases for scholarships, and (ii) other types of payment.
During the summer of 2011, Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delaney and SEC Commissioner Mike Slive, commissioners of arguably the two most powerful conferences in college football, made statements supporting the increase of scholarships to cover cost of attendance. Currently, athletes on full scholarship receive free tuition, room and board. Cost of attendance is often described as the amount necessary to cover all of a full-time student’s reasonable expenses for the year. It would cover things like gas or other transportation costs and laundry money.
Each school individually determines its cost of attendance. Some use figures from the federal government and some use student surveys to determine the amount. There’s also variance for expenses like health insurance or a computer, if the school requires students to have a computer. The number is much higher at a school located in an expensive city like Los Angeles than one in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
The potential for artificially inflating the figure aside, cost of attendance increases would be considered a part of the athlete’s scholarship. Largely, the proposals for cost of attendance increases have been advocated for all student athletes, not just those in revenue sports. If the increase was the same for every scholarship athlete in proportion to their scholarship, the percentages under the Athletic Financial Assistance section would remain unchanged.
If, however, a school decided (and the NCAA allowed it) to award the extra cost of attendance money only to football and basketball players, schools might have problems with Title IX compliance. Let’s take a look at what happens to Virginia Tech’s numbers if only football and men’s basketball players received the increase.
According to a study by USA Today, Virginia Tech’s added costs to go to cost of attendance would be $3,891 per student athlete. NCAA limits football scholarships to 85 student athletes and men’s basketball to 13. If those 98 scholarship athletes received the additional cost of attendance figure of $3,891 each, it would add $381,318 to the male financial aid used in the calculations for compliance detailed earlier in the chapter.
Using those figures, male financial aid would represent 63.48 percent of all aid and female financial aid would amount to 36.52 percent. Based on Virginia Tech’s unduplicated participation numbers, males represent 63.70 percent and females 36.30 percent. On the surface, it would seem Virginia Tech would remain in compliance.
However, many Title IX scholars believe courts would step in, even if the mathematics work out like the Virginia Tech example. Much of Title IX has been shaped by courts’ interpretation of the law, not simply the black and white letter of the law. Add that to the vague nature of the “substantially proportionate” language, and courts have a lot of leeway in these cases. Previous courts have emphasized that the spirit of the law stands for male and female athletes being awarded the same opportunities. Few believe compensating only those athletes in revenue sports would pass muster in a court of law, and as you’ll see later in the chapter, Title IX lawsuits are one of the easiest suits to bring before a judge.
Would a cost-of-attendance stipend for football players and men’s basketball players under the O’Bannon ruling be considered part of their scholarship and therefore part of the Title IX math? That’s a big question mark right now.
And, last but not least, the laundry list contained in the third section of Title IX, as I detailed in Saturday Millionaires, raises issues with regards to publicity and recruitment:
[F]unds of any type cannot be used to provide greater benefits to male athletes than female athletes under the third and final requirement: Other Program Areas.
Other Program Areas basically looks at how athletes of both sexes are treated in terms of facilities, support and benefits. The following eleven criteria are looked at in their totality for each sex:
Locker Rooms, Practice and Competitive Facilities: this is self-explanatory. It looks at the facilities provided for both practice and competition from the locker room to the playing surface to practice facilities.
Equipment and Supplies: again, self-explanatory. The quality, amount, availability, etc. of equipment and supplies will be reviewed.
Scheduling of Games and Practice Times: this factor looks at everything from opportunities provided for practice, competition, pre- and post-season to the time of day practices and competitions are held.
Publicity: this covers everything from the publications produced for each sport to the resources devoted to promoting each sport. [emphasis added]
Coaching: this covers the number of coaches for each sport, the expertise of those coaches, their compensation, etc. When compensation is considered they look to a number of factors, so don’t get carried away with the fact that football and men’s basketball coaches tend to make more. Not only are there a number of things considered under just this factor, but this factor is only one of eleven that are viewed in their totality.
Travel and Daily Allowance: not only are the monetary figures considered, but also the length of stay before and after a game or competition. One area becoming more highly scrutinized is whether opportunities to stay in a hotel before a home contest are provided equitably.
Academic Tutoring: the availability of tutors for men’s and women’s programs, the qualifications of those tutors, the compensation provided to them, the number of athletes tutored per session, etc.
Provision of Medical Training Facilities and Services: everyone from medical personnel to athletic trainers are encompassed. Also included is weight training and conditioning facilities. Expenses and the qualifications of such personnel are all reviewed.
Provision of Housing and Dining Facilities and Service: this one is self-explanatory but covers everything from the type of housing provided, the number of people per room, the laundry services available, parking spaces allotted and housekeeping services.
Recruitment of Student Athletes: there must be equal opportunities to recruit for coaches of both male and female athletes. Monetary expenditures are reviewed as well as the overall treatment of athletes in the recruiting process. [emphasis added]
Support Services: reviews the administrative-type services provided to each men’s and women’s sport.
When reviewing these factors, a disparity in the money spent on female versus male athletes can trigger an investigation into the entire athletic department for Title IX compliance. Thus, there’s no room to increase expenditures on travel or daily allowance, equipment and supplies or anywhere else in order to increase the benefits athletes are receiving unless you do it on both sides of the gender aisle.
The bottom line is that Title IX doesn’t distinguish between sports based on profit. Even though football and men’s basketball make the money it can’t all be spent on them per federal law.
I have more questions than answers, but this gives you an idea of the issues the NCAA and its member institutions will have to tackle as they navigate implementing Judge Wilken’s ruling in the coming months and years.

The historic manor Château Ahlhausen in the Ruhr area Ennepetal is being redesigned concerning cultural and agricultural utilization. Setting up forestry , food manufactures and a local farm shop are just some parts of the plan.
Therefore, they new corporate design has to represent Château Ahlhausen in a cultural and agricultural way for a wide range of use.
Concerning the great history of the manor the logo shape reminds of an emblem with floral baroque elements and the color is the same as the painting of the window frames. As media and marketing are not yet decided, the logo can be applied in many ways such as a stamp, a symbol on packaging banderoles or as a badge.
If the lyric to I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry strikes you as particularly poetic, it may be because it was originally written to be spoken, not sung. There is a long tradition in country music of spoken-word performance with musical accompaniment—refered to as "recitations"—and according to Williams' biographer Colin Escott these words were penned for the first session of recitations Hank was to record in January of 1950. Instead, they became the lyric to one of his most enduring and oft-recorded songs, one that Williams himself cited it as his personal favorite.
Escott also recounts that the overtly poetic nature of the lyric left Hank himself unsure that such artsy material would fly with his rural audience. So although the song has been a hit for other artists and is one of very few songs from that era on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, Hank's own version was a B-side of My Bucket's Got A Hole In It and didn't chart for him.
His is still the definitive take, however, so any study of the song has to begin with this track from 1949. Producer Fred Rose would have prefered that Hank stick with singing and drop the guitar altogether. Though Williams insisted on playing, his guitar was not miked, so that's rhythm guitarist Louis Innes you hear chunking out barred chords to great effect on this track. Zeke Turner is on electric guitar, laying down melodic figures on the low strings much as he did on the Delmore Brothers' Blues Stay Away From Me only a few weeks before this recording session. On this clip you'll hear the beginning of a very tasteful steel guitar solo by Jerry Byrd. Later (and unfortunately, not included on this clip) fiddle great Tommy Jackson steps up for an equally restrained pass. Both are worthy of a careful listen, especially by those who think a solo has to be hyper-complex to be effective.
We could include countless recordings of this song by artists from every niche of the country music world, but we'll limit ourselves to just two. The first is from veteran bluegrass guitarist and vocalist Larry Sparks. Within the bluegrass world he is well known as both a singer and picker, all of which is well chronicled in this feature by Dan Miller in Flatpicking Guitar Magazine (a terrific publication) in 2000. Unfortunately, Sparks doesn't take a guitar break on this cut, but he does establish his creds as a straight-ahead interpreter of Hank Sr. He devoted an entire album to doing so, spendidly (shown right.)
By the standards of Sparks, the young members of Crooked Still are the proverbial new kids on the block. But their success at reinterpreting traditional bluegrass and old timey music has property values going up all around them, so I don't suppose any of the neighbors are complaining. They were featured at the Grey Fox bluegrass festival in 2006 and the following clip is from that performance. I've included one vocal chorus and then yet another tasteful solo, this one by cellist Rushad Eggleston. As it happens, they are performing the song in the same key as our arrangement so you might be interested in trying out the slight reharmonization they employ. After the F chord, our arrangement (ignoring the 7ths for the moment) reads C-C-C-G-C-G; for that same 6 bars they play C-Am-Dm7-G7-C-G7. Fancy schmantsy.
Lest you think that this song is only fodder for the country mill, however, here are a few snapshots of how citified artists have taken their country cousin under wing and shown it the sights. Proof positive that you can't keep a good song down (on the farm!)

Community Radio Kilkenny City may have found a niche market for itself, that’s because on Tuesday evening of last week, it broadcast a mesmerising radio play, writes Sean Keane of Kilkenny People.
It has to be said that the play in question, the iconic ‘War Of The Worlds’ by Orson Welles was an excellent choice for this inaugural radio presentation by the newly formed city based drama group, Lake Productions.
Many people like myself tuned in and were struck by the quality of the production, the sound effects and the American twangs of the all-Kilkenny cast for the play which was broadcast on the 80th anniversary of the first broadcast on October 30, 1938.
For me, Mike Kelly was utterly believable as the narrator while Brendan Corcoran was as always marvellous.
This was the first time in a while I took time out to listen, uninterrupted, to a play on the radio .
HATFIELD, Pa. — Penn Environmental & Remediation, Inc. has been selected as the recipient of Cumberland County Conservation District’s 2017 Clean Water Award.
Cumberland County Conservation District (CCCD) presents this award to organizations that demonstrate exceptional stewardship practices to improve and preserve natural resources.

People working in the construction industry, like any other business enterprise, are in it to make money. While some enjoy their work and get “payment” in the form of loving what they do, we don’t need to take a poll to know that participants in the construction industry would all be agreeable to making more money.
While it’s not a change in the law, a recent holding by the Pennsylvania Superior Court provides a friendly reminder to suppliers in the construction industry. When goods are being sold, the UCC applies; and, importantly, terms and conditions in prior offers not included in the accepted offer are not part of the agreement.

Although regular risk assessments and re-evaluations of insurance coverage are generally a good idea, it’s not uncommon for construction companies to take the approach of renewing their existing insurance policy when it comes up for renewal. Some policies – particularly specialty policies – have renewal clauses in them that sophisticated companies should be aware of when renewing their insurance though. A recent decision by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia sheds some light on this issue.

Monday night was Neko Case’s hosting of a screening of Repo Man, with special guest Michael Nesmith. After I got home I looked her up & discovered that Neko is literally 1 day older than I am. I don’t know if that resulted in any increased sense of affinity, but near-coincidences are nice.
Obnoxious host dude mostly sat back and let Neko interview Nesmith, which was vastly superior to him opening his endlessly annoying mouth. N + N had apparently had a 3-hour lunch already & thus it was kind of like catching new friends mid-conversation, which was neat. Neko had originally schemed to get Nesmith there because she (perhaps logically) assumed that he’d had a hand in putting together the soundtrack, but he quickly established that his only involvement in the project at all was as moneyman.
Which frequently took the form of telling Alex Cox that he couldn’t have any more money & was going to have to make do, which, among other things, resulted in the awesome low-budget glowing-car effect at the end, which was literally achieved via reflective highway paint on the entire car, and a bright green light. That tidbit alone == price of admission.
This time around I came away thinking that Dick Rude was definitely the weak link in the whole thing – everybody loves his lines, but his reactions & timing always seem off.
Anyway. Only real disappointment was that the conversation didn’t/couldn’t go as deep into the soundtrack as I would have liked – Nesmith just kept saying “that was the music that was playing in the production office all the time, really loud.” Fair enough.
The rest of the week traded off ice and snow. I should have had time to write more frequent posts because of that, but the opposite seems to have happened.
I finished the third, and final (and least satisfying) Takeshi Kovacs novel, started the Kim Gordon memoir (which inevitably is going to wind up filed in my head right next to the Viv Albertine memoir), and [apparently] came down with the flu. I can’t remember the last time I had the flu, but the symptoms (fever, all-over body ache, fatigue) seem to fit. I have a good mental model for the trajectory of a cold, but I have no idea what this thing is going to do & how long it’s going to take to do it.
Due to the combination of snow & sickness, I did a lot of comic-book reading. I wish Comixology had a Netflix/Amazon-style recommendation system, because it’s a jungle out there. This is where the nice old-fashioned people jump in & tell me that’s what comic book stores are for. And I’m sure they’re right. But then I’d have to buy paper comic books, and then either store them or give them away when I was done.
I have some good friends who are major comix nerds, and our tastes sorta overlap. But of course they also sorta don’t. In any case, for the record, these are [reasonably] current titles that I really like, in case anyone wants to take a stab at further recommendations:
Friday night we watched Whiplash. I kinda really enjoyed it and kinda hated it. I’m still not sure which side I fall on, because I’m not sure what it’s actually trying to say, particularly since Jason Reitman was involved.
Certain types of people seem to be taking it at its word, as summarized by the bald white asshole’s soliloquy in the jazz club, something about how true genius has to be spurred and flogged and just generally beaten out of people. And that it’s ultimately a solitary endeavor.
But surely it’s so over-the-top that it has to be satire, especially with a known serial deadpan satirist like Reitman as the executive producer. Right?
I finally decided that I was most comfortable assuming that the movie timeline actually stopped with the car wreck, and that the entire second half of the movie was a deathbed fantasia. It was the only answer that made sense of the whole thing & its many contradictions.
It was also extraordinarily depressing to think of all those people busting their asses & enduring endless torment just in order to play kind of bland note-perfect midsize-band arrangements of mainstream swing tunes. I mean, don’t get me wrong, it’s great music, but at this point, 50-60-70-80 years down the line, the stakes in recreating it should be pretty fucking low, and you’d hope that people would just be playing it for fun.

Most of our readers will agree, virtual design and construction (VDC) is revolutionizing construction practices. Add laser scanning to your toolbox and you have a job site game changer. This post discusss how you can solve project’s challenges by utilizing laser scanning on the job site.
What is laser scanning? Laser scanning is controlled deflection of laser beams in an existing space. It captures almost every visible component of a space - every wall, every door, every window, and every nook and cranny is measured in a space. Whatever you can see, the scanner discovers it, measures it, and transfers the information into a virtual model with precision. The information provides a reliable foundation for modeling and can serve as an as-built model for an active or completed project.
Gathering reliable data on complex site conditions. Once the data is obtained, it is then converted into a format that can be transferred into 3D models. This process takes a lot less time than it takes to gather information manually.
Capturing millions of measurement points in seconds. Laser scanning is helpful for gathering information about the existing structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) features within a scanner’s line of sight.
Effectively delegating project tasks. Collecting information about an existing building structure or site in a point cloud file allows that data to be used to assign project tasks.
Developing an in-progress, as-built model of construction. By periodically scanning areas throughout the construction process, the as-built model can be developed as rough-in occurs.
Verifying steel and concrete tolerances ahead of walls, floors and finishes. Laser scans can provide a level of accuracy up to 1/8” (sometimes better). By scanning structural steel and concrete in advance, the various installation tolerances can be used to better plan and lay out walls and casework, as well as floating floors.
Working within tight timelines. Time efficiencies naturally occur with the eased ability to obtain comprehensive datasets free of human error in seconds.
Rudolph and Sletten used these laser scans to help verify structural steel installation was within acceptable tolerances, which allowed us to layout walls and plan for the Owner’s custom millwork and casework. In addition, laser scanning was used to verify the levelling of the concrete floors to determine which areas needed to be floated. San Bernardino Justice Center, Laser Scan
Reduced project costs. Incorporating laser scanning into your VDC project program provides an opportunity for the team to reduce project costs and tighten schedules. The team has greater control over change orders and planning forthcoming activities, allowing for more reliable project decisions and discussions about more accurate data.
Jobsite efficiencies. Empowered with reliable information, construction process efficiencies are realized and there is an added opportunity for prefabrication. Prefabrication will allow for reduced labor costs, fewer schedule delays, and the satisfaction of delivering a project on time and under budget.
Added level of quality control. Continuous scanning during the construction process adds an extra layer of quality control to ensure that building tolerances are met, and systems can be, and are being installed as planned.
It does not take too long to realize that laser-scanning techniques allow the project team to have a clearer understanding the variances between the proposed design and the actual space. The ability to capture so much accurate data about the existing and developing structure and then transfer that information into a working model or, vice versa, into the field, is highly valuable. Optimizing your VDC program with the help of laser scanning gives project teams a solid leg up on productivity.

it has attained over the centuries presents the only real serious danger confronting us at this time. To lay violent hands on the Court of Chancery is at once to weaken us in maintaining our constitutional liberties, our property rights, our freedom of speech and of the press, and our religious freedom as well. It is only by the maintenance of an undiluted stream of equity that these rights can properly be evaluated and efficiently protected. Once that stream is unreasonably weakened by impact with the rigidities of the law, its virtue and its strength are to that extent enervated and dissipated. To maintain that peculiarly nice balance of reason which is so often required in equity, demands the best thought which can be evolved in each age. The court of equity must, and is intended to reach out into the entire field of human knowledge and human experience in its deliberations and yet withal it must stay its own hand where there is an adequate remedy at law. This limitation is of tremendous import and requires the careful thought of experts to the end that the constitutional right of trial by jury may be maintained in its proper sphere. Indeed, to follow this equitable maxim requires the seasoned approach of men extremely well skilled in the niceties involved. The chancellors of old were the keepers of the King's conscience, the modern Chancellor is the keeper of the consciences of all of us and that of the government as well. So it is that the court of equity today, in the exercise of its injunctive and prerogative powers, may say to the rich and to the poor, to the strong and to the weak and as well to the government itself, so far you may go and no farther. Its jurisdiction now over the many delicate and perplexing problems which had their origin in the Revealed Law as it was developed in the ancient ecclesiastical courts, ranging as it does over the entire field of family relations, emphasizes further the necessities of specialization.
It was discovered at an early date that the rigorous and rigid application of the rules evolved in courts of law were, in many instances, inadequate to render justice in its fuller sense. To cast these subjects into the hands of law judges who today are specializing in the legalistic atmosphere of contracts, torts, and criminal law is to weaken the purity and brilliance of equity and put a brake upon its progress in the myriad and everchanging problems of our daily lives. Do not misunderstand me in this. I am not contending the law judges can not and may not make excellent chancellors. I am urging however and I hope with some emphasis, that once a law judge is authorized to function in the court of equity he should remain there continuously to perfect himself in the reasoning which pertains to that court. Nor am I contending that the equity court is of more importance in our jurisprudence than the law courts. They are equally important in their respective spheres and, right here in New Jersey, working separately until

Around the world, vaping is moving towards a status of a mainstream. During the past few years, it has reached a significant spread, drawing a keen interest and converting from being used in private or a narrow circle of supporters to forming a large vape community and many brick-and-mortar vape lounges. It continues to fuel an ongoing debate among its advocates, people who are hostile to anything new, and governmental authorities.
A whole culture is growing around a new smoking practice. Manufacturers go above and beyond to attract new customers and keep existing ones. They apply modifications to vape devices, develop eye-catching designs, and enrich the choice of e-juices. Whether it’s an up to date herb vaporizer or an oil vape, a user has a range of power settings, and an array of e-liquids available, with different flavors and nicotine or cannabis strength.
1. There has been a constant decrease in the number of smokers worldwide from 2000 to 2018 – from 1.14 billion to 1.1 billion. By contrast, the number of vapers has been growing fast – from 7 million in 2011 to 35 million in 2016.
2. Spending on vape products is rising. Five years ago, the global vaping market was worth $4.2bn. Today, it is estimated to be worth $22.6bn.
Vaping culture is a grassroots movement. But people have different reasons to vape. The citizens of states like New York use it as a method of quitting cigarettes that is safer, cheaper and more effective. When a smoker is going to start to vape, they get a liquid which contains nicotine. This helps with the withdraw process as it eases the physical cravings.
For green stuff lovers in states like California or Colorado, a weed vaporizer is a way of smoking weed that is discreet, safer, and more efficient. Even some doctors who prescribe medical marijuana advice their patients to consider vaping for this purpose. It allows feeling the effects faster and avoiding the harmful toxins that are produced by combustion.
For young enthusiasts, it’s a sport. They buy the devices that produce the most massive plumes of vapor and engage in “cloud chasing.” Skilled performers amaze public and judges with vapor tricks.
For many, vaping has evolved into a lifestyle. People visit vape bars and shops. A newbie learns the basic things about this activity there, and the savvy users share their experiences. Of course, it’s possible to buy some oil or dry herb vaporizer there.
RiP Trippers channel has reached 210 million Youtube views. A blogger ends his videos with the slogan: “Smoking is dead, vaping is the future, the future is now.”
Nick Green runs the online vape store, Namber Juice community, and GrimmGreen Youtube channel. “I am all about vaping, e-cigs and tobacco harm reduction,” says Nick.
Austin Lawrence who is known as the Vape God has 2.3 million followers on his Instagram and 1.3 million followers on YouTube where he posts the videos of his vape tricks.
As vape culture grows, it starts to feel the pressure of collective attention. The public health community is taken by surprise, and it’s struggling to catch up. Health professionals are hurrying to conduct research and develop evidence-based guidelines and policies.
An alternative to smoking still has an intricate status when it comes to public places, taxation and the halls of big pharma. Some countries ban vaping totally. Others heavily restrict the industry. The reason is the lack of research. Nobody can say for sure whether it’s safe or harmful.
Often, the debates involve the members of a single organization. For example, the FDA has declared war on vaping. But some of her representatives believe that vaping can be an effective means for quitting smoking.
“If you could take every adult smoker and switch them to e-cigarettes, that would have a substantial public health effect,” says Dr. Scott Gottlieb, FDA. His colleague Mitch Zeller agrees with him and says that a switch to “one of those non-combustible products” would be beneficial for everyone.
For society as a whole, if smokers switch to e-cigarettes and never go back to tobacco again, it would be an enormous public health benefit. Though some studies show the possible risks of vaping, they are not convincing. It’s a new phenomenon, and it’s early to talk about long-term effects.
Many scientists find it safer than smoking. For example, Public Health England (PHE) said in their sensational review that vaping posed “only a small fraction” of the risk of smoking. So, a dry herb vape pen is definitely a better choice than a traditional cigarette.
Smoking money machine is an essential part of the economy of any country. Its disappearance might leave a massive hole in their budgets.
But there’s no reason to worry. Vaping has forced the tobacco industry to change the direction. They quickly understood that consumers want a low-risk alternative to traditional cigarette. British-American Tobacco purchased Blu. R.J. Reynolds developed the Vuse. Even the father of vaping Hon Lik sold all his patents to Imperial Tobacco in 2014.
Besides, rising demand for vape products has fueled a small business boom. In 2017, the Vapor Technology Association reported more than 8.000 new businesses in 50 states. That means higher employment rate and additional money in the budget.
Cigarette butts take about 12 years to decompose. So, they are thrown into water or on the ground, the toxins leach out and harm the wildlife. Second-hand smoke affects air quality as there are about 4000 chemical in smoke.
As for vaping, it’s more eco-friendly. Vapor is much cleaner than smoke. And the counterparts of devices can be recycled.
Vape culture is a new craze. But it’s galvanized by strict federal regulations for production, sale, and use of vape products. Since tobacco harm reduction involves the replacement of smoking tobacco cigarettes with smoke-free alternatives, consumers deserve the right to choose what they want. Modern technology gives people vaping, and they want to enjoy it as long as it doesn’t harm anyone.

Week 10 (Nov. 21-27) Analysis: Week 10 saw the end of November sweep after Wednesday then the Thanksgiving holiday took over. The first four nights were not available yet due to the Thanksgiving holiday, so we only have final ratings for Monday and Tuesday. We can project the last three nights of sweep has ABC on top in all categories, followed by CBS, Fox and NBC way back in fourth. It's hard to predict what will happen for this week, but perhaps CBS could win the week in all categories as the NFL overrun is with then tonight. ABC should be second in all categories this week but there is a chance they could win the week as well. While, Fox should be third across the board and NBC in fourth in everything even with a an NFL game tonight that might be below normal with the Chiefs and Steelers. As for last week, week 9, CBS beat ABC in HH/viewers for first place. CBS nipped by ABC for first in 18-49 for the week as well. Fox was third in 18-49, while NBC was third in HH/viewers. So, Fox was fourth in HH/viewers and NBC was fourth in 18-49.
The final Monday of November sweep had CBS on top again in 18-49 and ABC on top in viewers. Starting with ABC, Dancing with the Stars won the total viewer race but it was only on from 8-9pm as the Finals did 19.61 million and a 3.5 18-49 rating, up from previous week, even though ABC was preempted in Boston/Kansas City for MNF simulcast. At 9pm the series premiere of game show You Deserve It did 8.55 million but only a 1.7 18-49 rating, possibly the preemptions killed some of its ratings, but not a good start. At 10pm, Castle did 10.85 million and a 2.3 18-49 rating, off a tenth from its previous episode two week prior. For CBS, How I Met Your Mother started it off with 10.01 million and a 4.4 18-49 rating, down some from previous week, but it has certainly surprised this season. 2 Broke Girls followed with 11.33 million and a 4.6 18-49 rating, down some from previous week. This is still a big hit. At 9pm, a new Two and a Half Men, with new star Ashton Kutcher, did 15.82 million and a 5.2 18-49 rating, down some from previous week in the demo. All the series have gone down two tenths week-to-week this time. A new Mike & Molly followed the huge lead-in and did 13.05 million and a 4.2 18-49 rating, down two tenths from the previous week. An all-new Hawaii Five-0 was next doing 10.59 million and a 2.8 18-49 rating, down a half a point from from the previous week. Fox started with the expensive Terra Nova and it did 6.5 million and a series low 2.1 18-49 rating, down from previous week. Not too good. And at 9pm, House looks more and more like this will be its last season as it posted 7.46 million and a 2.5 18-49 rating, on par with previous week. NBC followed with another two-hour The Sing-Off doing only 4.27 million and a 1.4 18-49 rating, up a tenth from previous week. Season finale is tomorrow night. At 10pm, NBC aired a new episode of Rock Center with Brian Williams and it did an embarrassing 3.64 million and a 0.9 18-49 rating, a series low. The CW was new with Gossip Girl doing 1.35 million and a 0.7 18-49 rating, up a tenth week-to-week. At 9pm Hart of Dixie did 1.77 million and a 0.7 18-49 rating each, on par with previous week.
On Tuesday, ABC took the honors with the finale of Dancing. Bu first, CBS had the juggernaut NCIS opening the night off with 18.5 million and a 3.5 18-49 rating, down a lot from previous week. What happened? Then spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles was next and did 14.1 million and 3.0 18-49 rating, down from previous week. And a new Unforgettable did 10.42 million and a 2.2 18-49 rating, down from previous week and a series low. ABC started with new comedy Last Man Standing with Tim Allen leading the night off doing 9.29 million and a 2.7 18-49 rating, up some from the previous week. Solid and it will be new for the next three weeks still, too. Get on board! Week six of Man Up! was next and it did 6.66 million and a 1.9 18-49 rating, up some from previous week and the first time it has gone up. Still needs to do better. Then Dancing with the Stars: The Results Grand Finale followed from 9-11pm with 19.56 million and a 4.1 18-49 rating, of course up big from the previous week, as we crowned J.R. Martinez the champion. Body of Proof was preempted and will be new this week. Fox preempted Glee and the comedies New Girl & Raising Hope for a two-hour The X Factor on a special night and did 9.43 million and a 3.2 18-49 rating, below normal. NBC was next with a two-hour The Biggest Loser doing 5.58 million and a 2.0 18-49 rating, down some from the previous week. At 10pm, Parenthood did 4.57 million and a 1.9 18-49 rating, down some week-to-week. The CW aired a new 90210 that did 1.26 million and a 0.6 18-49 rating, down a tenth week-to-week. Then the Sarah Michelle Gellar drama Ringer was preempted for a repeat of Hart of Dixie doing 959,000 viewers and a 0.4 18-49 rating.
Wednesday it was the last night of sweeps and it had lower ratings because it was Thanksgiving Eve but ABC was on top. We only have prelim ratings due to the Thanksgiving holiday. First, CBS started the night off with Survivor: South Pacific recap show at a prelim 7.85 million and a prelim 1.9 18-49 rating. Veteran drama Criminal Minds was a repeat and did a prelim 8.23 million and a prelim 1.8 18-49 rating. At 10pm, CSI was a repeat too and did a prelim 7.26 million and a prelim 1.6 18-49 rating. ABC was all-new with its Laugh On comedy block with a new The Middle doing a prelim 9.09 million and a prelim 2.5 18-49 rating, which was barely down in viewers from previous week. Not bad for Thanksgiving Eve. Suburgatory followed at 8:30pm with a solid prelim 8.32 million and a prelim 2.5 18-49 rating, and it was actually UP from previous week in viewers. The mega hit Modern Family was next at 9pm and it did a prelim 12.65 million and a prelim 4.5 18-49 rating, down only some in viewers from previous week. At 9:30pm the buzzworthy Happy Endings did a prelim 7.22 million and a prelim 2.7 18-49 rating, yes this was actually up in viewers from previous week, too. At 10pm the new drama Revenge did a prelim 7.24 million and a first place prelim 2.3 18-49 rating. Solid numbers, and only down some from previous week in viewers. Fox aired The X Factor from 8-9pm doing a prelim 8.51 million and a prelim 2.5 18-49 rating, down big from previous week when it was two-hours. The special Mobbed followed at 9pm and just a prelim 4.7 million and a prelim 1.6 18-49 rating. NBC opened the night with a new Up All Night at a prelim 4.33 million and a prelim 1.5 18-49 rating, only down some from previous week in viewers. At 8:30pm, a repeat followed and did just a prelim 2.99 million and a prelim 1.0 18-49 rating, down from previous week's repeat. At 9pm, Harry's Law and Law & Order: SVU were preempted for the special The Biggest Loser: Where Are They Now? that did only a prelim 3.69 million and a prelim 1.2 18-49 rating from 9-11pm. The CW had a repeat of Top Model leading the night off with a prelim 863,000 viewers and a prelim 0.3 18-49 rating, down some from previous week. Then America's Next Top Model clip show was next at 9pm with a prelim 992,000 viewers and a prelim 0.4 18-49 rating.
Thursday it was Thanksgiving and nothing really was normal and new for regular series. First, ABC opened the night with A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving doing a solid prelim 5.78 million and a prelim 1.8 18-49 rating. At 9pm, Grey's Anatomy was preempted as ABC aired a repeat of The Middle doing a prelim 4.25 million and a prelim 1.3 18-49 rating. Private Practice was also preempted as ABC aired the special A Very Gaga Thanksgiving from 9:30pm-11pm doing a prelim 5.51 million and a solid prelim 1.7 18-49 rating. CBS opened with a repeat of The Big Bang Theory at a prelim 11.24 million and a a prelim 3.6 18-49 rating, but keep in mind some of these ratings are NFL ratings in San Francisco. Then, a repeat of Rules of Engagement was next doing a prelim 7.88 million and a prelim 2.4 18-49 rating, also with some NFL in there, so expect the finals to go down. A repeat of Person of Interest followed with a prelim 7.97 million and a prelim 1.7 18-49 rating. A repeat of The Mentalist followed and did a prelim 7.76 million and a prelim 1.5 18-49 rating. Fox preempted The X Factor for the special Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas doing a prelim 6.18 million and a prelim 2.0 18-49 rating. From 8:30pm-9:30pm, Fox aired the special Happiness is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown that did a prelim 4.96 million and a prelim 1.6 18-49 rating, as Bones was preempted. NBC preempted its comedies Community, Parks and Recreation, The Office and Whitney for the movie Horton Hears a Who that did a prelim 3.69 million and a prelim 1.1 18-49 rating, but some NFL is in there from Baltimore, so possibly it will go down in finals. NBC's drama bust Prime Suspect was preempted for the special The 85th Anniversary of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade that did a prelim 3.69 million and a prelim 1.1 18-49 rating. The CW's big gun Vampire Diaries and new drama The Secret Circle were repeats that did a prelim 992,000 viewers/0.3 18-49 rating and a prelim 776,000 viewers/0.2 18-49 rating.
Now, final numbers for Friday and Saturday are not available, but Fox won Friday thanks to a Iron Man 2 airing from 8-10:30pm. Specials rules the night, but none did that we.
Saturday numbers had ABC Saturday Night Football on top by a wide margin, while CBS repeats were a distant second.
Tonight ABC Sunday is all-new with half of its normal line-up of AFV, Once Upon a Time, Desperate Housewives, and Pan Am, as the latter two are preempted for the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie. Look for Once to do great again. NBC will win the night with the NFL with the Chiefs and Steelers, but might be below normal. CBS has its normal line-up of 60 Minutes, Amazing Race, The Good Wife and CSI: Miami, but look for an NFL overrun boosting it. Fox has the animated comedies from 7-10pm, with The Cleveland Show at 7:30pm.
As for the week (week 10), it's a tough call. Either CBS or ABC will win it. I'm guessing CBS will be first in HH/viewers and maybe ABC is first in 18-49. Fox should be third across the board and battle NBC. As for the coming week (week 11), it's the beginning of repeats and holiday specials but there are still some new showings, so be aware!
The Simpsons (Fox) - A new episode did 5.77 million and a 2.7 18-49 rating, down big from previous week when it had an NFL lead-in.

Summing it up. Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, 2 Broke Girls, How I Met Your Mother, Mike & Molly, The Middle, Suburgatory, Happy Endings were impressive for the week. Everything else was OK (such as Rules of Engagement, Up All Night) or just plain old terrible (such as Week 9 Allen Gregory).

Today I saw an unusual Junco next door. Usually we get a lot of Oregon Juncos but this looks like a Slate-Coloured. However I can't rule it out as a Cassiar because there does appear to be a very faint amount of brown on the back as well. Last winter there was a Cassiar here as well.

Since moving to our new place, Ben helped me set up a new vegie garden. I was sad to say goodbye to the old garden but I made sure to save all the little sprouts and transplant them to their new home. You may remember how my friend Lowy introduced and helped me set up my first garden well he did offer some sage advice on setting up this new garden but I may have ignore him. I can now confidently encourage you to listen to others or at the very least, learn from your mistakes :p
So lowy's wise words were something along the lines of "I don't think the spot you have picked will get enough sun" to which I said something like "but but it gets all the water run off, which is more important because we're on tank water and last year there was a drought and I couldn't water the garden daily!!!!"
We've now had rain the last month or so and the garden bed is in no fear of being under-watered in fact I think it's now getting far too much and yes, not enough sunlight! Ben has kindly offered to help me move it one more time which I'll probably take him up on. Despite my stubborn ways the garden hasn't been a complete failure it just has had very slow or little growth. I thought it was worth showing photos of the things that have grown though :)
A couple of pumpkin vines have down great, obviously lovers of water! And I spotted lots of bees buzzing around to pollinate :)
Another happy report was our mango tree. The season is now over but I'm still happily having mango smoothies daily from a bunch I froze :)
I've lost count of the number of avo seeds I've planted but I'm super excited to have two successes!
Unfortunately all my seedlings haven't sprouted, possibly from the 'too much water/not enough sunlight' debacle :(
If you have your own garden, don't throw away your spring onion stems - they grow so easily and keep on regrowing!
I really do love gardening and especially picking things to eat from the garden and I know I'm always learning too. I'll keep you updated if I do move this bed and see if some more sunlight will get things growing a bit faster :)
I've had a flu coupled with a sore throat these last two weeks and those cold smoothies have been a joy!!
Lovely garden! And you have a mango tree! So very jealous! I can't wait to start on our garden again this year. We skipped our last year because we were trying to get our garden under control which was infested with crabgrass .. Sometimes I wish we had bigger space just so we can grow more things :)
I bet your garden will be amazing, sometimes limitations are good, I'm thinking of trying out growing the majority of my herbs in pots and see what outcomes come out of that - good for being able to move into the right sun exposure spot and to take with us if we move again :)
It is awesome that you have a mango tree!!! Our garden is pretty big but we're renting so can't really do anything with it - we did add a portable plastic greenhouse and few pots. Really can't wait when we buy a house so we can do whatever we want with the garden, like build a proper greenhouse and get a vegetable patch!
We're pretty lucky to have a flexible landlady to be able to put in some bed :) BUT If we ever own our own place, I plan on going crazy with the garden!! That's the dream anyway!

Strategic Impact of IT Trends – Page 2 – Research, ideas and comments about the way IT is changing organisations
It is slightly more than one month since I’ve launched my eBook and I hope you have found the time to read it – if not I encourage you to do so.
It’s been a great month! Shortly after launching the “Strategic Impact of IT Trends in the Pharmaceutical Industry”, I was invited as a guest speaker to talk to an MBA class at Cass Business School, in London.
This was an amazing opportunity for me to share my views about “Business and IT alignment” and the importance of technology in their roles as future managers. Likewise, it was very insightful to learn about the student’s perception of new IT trends and the impact they will have on the organisations business and operating models.
I believe there is little doubt that in the past only CIOs and IT departments would need to talk IT. Today this is a mandatory skill set for everyone in leadership roles and I would even argue that it is a requirement for everyone in the organisation.
Why is it so critical? Simply because regardless of industry, the world today is driven by technology. Thus, the challenge lies in choosing the best technology for the organisation, not necessarily the latest technology.
The organisation’s vision and strategic goals definition can no longer ignore such facts and therefore they must be fully aligned to different IT options available to the business. This is what defines the best technology for an organisation.
Being aware of what is available with regards to technology is a competitive advantage for decision makers. Firstly because it allows them to ask the right questions, and therefore enables them to invest wisely; secondly because it empowers them to filter which technology drives organisations to achieve their strategic goals and which does not add nor create value.
Decision makers and leadership teams are realising that having an IT savvy workforce and the Millennials always on is both an amazing opportunity as it is a disruption for the organisation. They need to assume the roles of technology evangelists in their organisations to reap all the benefits (e.g. collaboration and knowledge management) whilst mitigating the risk of shadow IT and other pitfalls that result in wasting valuable resources.
What’s needed is a unified vision and approach that meets the organisation’s strategic objectives. IT must become increasingly fluent in the language of business, and business leaders must become more conversant in the language of IT. (Forbes, 2015)

On November 11, 2015 Scientific Ethics launched an open investigation on Sheng-Jia Zhang Case involving publicly disclosed dispute between him and Chan Xie as well as Bai Lu. Open questionnaires were sent to all major players in the dispute as well as minor participants in the event. Responses and evidences were received from Zhang and his students. Xie, Lu, and others did not response to Scientific Ethics. Based on the responses and some direct evidences presented by Scientific Ethics as well as other publications from various sources and in various forms a “virtual academic court” issued a preliminary judgement to all parties named in the Scientific Ethics’ open investigation and requested a response within 10days. Now that deadline has passed and no contempt has been received against that preliminary judgement. Thus, we at Scientific Ethicsfeel comfortable and confident to release initial conclusions of our investigation.

I’ve been developing more material around the whole issue of dealing with the humanity (a double edged word) in complex adaptive systems. Any development of this type involves reading, thinking, speaking and then teaching which is the point at which it all comes together. There are substantial issue in human complex systems where the intelligence, identity and intentionality aspects of our species come into play that defy modelling and more importantly any reliance on a purely Look it worked lets go do more of it approach to method development. I’m wrapping up case based approaches to method development in that as well as they all assume some form of Newtonian universe.
There are three known phenomena that provide some rational for my apparently counter-intuitive criticism of repeating what worked. So I will briefly outline what they are, then summarise some of the implications. If you are not familiar then a simple web search will give you more detail on all three. I didn’t invent or discover them!
In British India a reward was offered for dead cobras in an attempt to reduce the danger to humans. It worked well for a period but then people started to breed cobras to kill then to collect the reward. Thanks to Michael Allen Smith for the picture by the way.
One of the best known cliches, but still a good one. The point of the story is that small changes in the environment combine with other small changes which result in a hurricane. The point being that very small things can result in major outcomes, but its not predictable and the same small changes might not achieve the change in a different context.
Which argues that humans respond to well to novelty, but you should not confuse the novel thing with novelty in respect of cause and effect.
Now any one of these challenges the idea that you can do something a couple of times, get a favourable response and then assume you can carry on doing the same thing. Once people work things out, or get bored (numbers one and three) the cool thing that worked for you may start to turn sour. Then the dice may fall differently the next time, the content shifts and the other small changes you didn’t notice last time (but on which you relied) don’t happen and things flop.
Things don’t work consistently in a complex system at the sort of coarsely grained level that most methods work. That means we need to make sure that any practice can be explained in terms of natural science before we can have any confidence that we can repeat what worked last time. Or we go into the change knowing that it will only work for a period and we will have to change things again.
You might call this part of the necessary dynamic stability of intervening in a complex system and it means you have to be comfortable with uncertainty. The likes of SAFe, Sick Stigma other simplistic aggregative recipes really fail that test.

What we behold in the world today, both in the fields of management and labor as now set up, is simply organized competition and greed. This has produced only strife. It has impeded real progress. It has robbed both employer and employee.
Men have been governed by human passions and not by God. They’re on the getting way instead of God’s law – the giving way, the serving way. In the world today men don’t know how to find happiness and freedom from fears and worries or from the cares of this life.
Happiness is something that one can never reach out and take. It is something that you can have only by giving, and the more you give the more you have. It comes only by finding God’s basic inexorable, spiritual law, the way of love, the way of giving, of serving, of doing good. The true basis of happiness is spiritual, not material.
“Seek ye first the kingdom of God,” said Jesus Christ. The government of God, the government of the very Eternal Creator who created every force and every energy, who rules the entire universe, seek first his kingdom in your life and every physical, material blessing will be added, but the spiritual blessings will come first.
If you do this, you will actually have to live by every word of God, and that is your Bible. You’ll have to study the Bible to find out how to live, and actually live by it. But you won’t be living the way the rest of the world lives if you do.
If you do this you’ll be filled with a dynamic power from without. Most of us only have what we find within and what we find around us, in other words, our fellow humans or neighbors; but we’re not conscious of an above. We’re only conscious of the within and the around. And within, the well is dry. And around we find only competition, strife, consternation and contradiction.
But there is an above, and we need to tap the above. We need to receive and be filled with this dynamic power from above, from God Almighty, the very Spirit of God, the spirit of love and of understanding and wisdom, the spirit of faith, the spirit of patience, of power for self-mastery. If you do, your life will be energized, it will become successful, it will become full and complete, it will become happy. And you’ll be prosperous in the long run.
You will study, and you will use your God- given mind, studying first to find the true way of life, to show yourself approved before God. You will devote yourself, secondarily, to your job, your work, your profession. What you set your hand to do, as God commands; you’ll do with your might, with all of your energy.
You will be industrious. If you work for a man you’ll serve to the very best of your ability. If men work for you, if you’re an employer, you’ll be just as interested in their welfare as your own. You’ll free your mind from all anxious concern and worry and fears, for you’ll have the spirit of faith, relying upon the guidance and help of God Himself. You’ll do your best. You’ll trust God with the result, and you’ll find real peace and happiness and joy first of all. The result will be material prosperity, as well as happiness, within God’s reasonable due time.
That’s the recipe for success, for usefulness, for prosperity, for real and lasting happiness, for the full, abundant life. Very few people follow Jesus’ formula and so very few people are happy, very few people are prosperous.
Nearly everyone today seeks first the material prosperity, and people become so engrossed in the cares of this life and the deceitfulness of riches. If they succeed in acquiring them at all, they seem never able to find very much time for seeking the Kingdom of God or to be governed by the laws of God.
Most people today are in ignorance of the true formula for success, for accomplishment, prosperity; for the happy, joyous life. Most people don’t even know what success is. Many people seem to believe that happiness is something that comes from material possessions. Their chief concern in life is to earn a better living, seek more money to find happiness by acquiring material possessions.
In this chase for that elusive money a large majority find the pursuit so difficult that they become overcharged with the cares of earning a living; trying to make ends meet. And this overwhelming majority never realizes their goal. They remain either poor or worried, and the happiness they seek becomes as elusive as the money. They slave away their lives; yes, empty, worried, unhappy lives.
But a few of those who seek first the material riches of this world – and only a very few -- do have the talents, the qualities for material success and the accumulation of money, but as that few prosper they pay the price. They generally have ability, and they are the ones who have studied and prepared themselves, who have exercised vision, industry, perseverance, determination, yes, they have all of those qualities.
So those who are prospered by God, because they sought first the kingdom of God, that is, to diligently live under the laws of God’s government, they’re not the only ones that prosper materially. No, the few successful ones who seek first and usually only the material riches, many of them also prosper in the world.
Now, there are two kinds of material prosperity. That prosperity which is acquired by those who seek first and only the material assets. And that prosperity found by those who seek God’s way of life first, and who claim God’s promise that the material blessings will be added, and they are added in due time if you trust God and if you’re diligent.
In this world a common pastime of some is to envy the rich, to grumble, to gripe, and to complain, to hate the rich. What does God say about that? Turn to Psalm 37:8. Here is what God says to you: ‘Fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way. Cease from anger, and forsake evil.” What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world, seeking riches in this world and then lose his own soul? That kind of riches is false and soon left behind.
Some of these worldly rich have been unjust. They and their big industrial and agricultural corporations have taken advantage of their positions and paid their laborers too little. Ought the laboring man, then, to organize and to fight back? That’s what we’ve seen in this world.
But is this the true Christian way? It is not. That is not God’s way. Even though the tactics of labor unionism have gained higher wages, employers have often raised prices so that today’s highest wages of all time actually purchase less than is commonly assumed. What increased prosperity is being enjoyed has been due rather to the fact that machines have increased human efficiency. It’s true that machines throw men out of work at first, but some, after retraining, find work in new industries because machines have created many new industries that we did not have several generation ago. Others, however, are thrown out of work and have great difficulty finding work.
What should the man who is oppressed by an employer do? You’ll find the answer in James 5:1-4, 7 Revised Authorized Version: “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your riches are corrupt. You have heaped up treasure in the last days. Indeed the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, (the farm worker is here singled out, it might also be the factory worker), which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of (Hosts). Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord.”
In other words, when God sends Jesus Christ to this earth, he is going to straighten out all of those things, and he’s coming in our time and our generation.
God’s instruction is to be patient until the coming of Christ, to wait until God restores justice. But, a lot of men say, “Oh, if we did that we wouldn’t get anywhere.” Probably they don’t’ know God and don’t trust God. But if you will trust God, your faith will not be in vain, and you will really find the true riches in the end.
By seeking first only material acquisitions, the majority have failed to acquire them. They’ve worn away their lives in a vain pursuit. While the few, even at the cost of hard work, study, application and perseverance have succeeded. But neither group has found happiness. Neither those who did gain their great wealth in this manner, nor those who’ve been cheated out of it. It just does not bring happiness either way because material wealth is not the source of happiness,. Spiritual wealth is the real source of happiness.

When Valet PRO told us they would soon be launching this new product, we were very excited. And when we finally managed to get our mitts on it, it made us even more excited. The details we were given was that they were developing a sprayable product which made removing any fully-cured wax easy, but would also add months more protection to the life of whichever wax it was used it with.
Testing it was easy, and that’s exactly what this product is all about. We first of all washed the bonnet of a car with a wash mitt and a bucket of warm water mixed with washing-up liquid detergent to remove any traces of wax that may have been applied previously.
We then dried the area, before applying a thick layer of ValetPRO Artemis Wax Seal. We then left the wax to cure for around 10 minutes. A quick note – the weather was sunny and windy, which dried out the wax nice and quick. ValetPRO recommend using a paint preparation product before apply your wax to achieve even more impressive results.
After we checked how dried-on the wax was (very), we decided to really test out the Zelos Fortifier by adding another layer of Artemis on top of the already-cured layer, just to make it ultra difficult to remove. After we’d left that for another 15 minutes, we tried to remove some of the wax from a small area of the bonnet using a microfibre cloth. This was ridiculously difficult and a throughly frustrating exercise.
Enough of that hard work rubbish – it was time to break out the Zelos Fortifier. After spraying a light misting all over the bonnet, we left that for around 30 seconds before removing it with a microfibre cloth.
Unbelievably, removing the wax was now just like wiping excess water away as you would when drying a car! What was left was a really great finish to the paintwork, and the metallics sparkled beautifully in the sunlight. It’s not just a nice look it leaves behind though, as this product will add at least another couple of months to the life of your preferred wax, and even longer if you use a decent car shampoo for maintaining it afterwards.
The Zelos Fortifier doesn’t evaporate quickly, so it gives you easily enough time to wipe it all off without having to rush the job. Although it looks greasy, it comes off easily and doesn’t leave behind any streaks of marks.
You can also use this product with a DA (Dual Action) machine polisher, and in actual fact it gives even better results. Simply apply your wax (after claying and prepping paintwork), allow it to cure, mist on the Zelos and using your DA on a slow speed with a finishing pad, spread the wax/Zelos. After this, remove using a soft microfibre cloth.
Purely by accident, we noticed a bit had got onto the unpainted plastic bumper and after wiping it off, it shined nicely and also water beaded up on it excellent – so that’s another thing you could use it for.
We realised that you could actually use this as a quick wax or detailer, but it would be a massively expensive way to do it, so stick with what it is meant for.
A bottle of the Zelos seems expensive as an initial cost layout, but when you weigh up what results you get, just how easy it makes waxing plus the fact that only a tiny amount is needed per panel, then any reservations about price drift away.
A unique and utterly brilliant product. Makes wax removal easy and adds months of extra protection in seconds. You’ll never want to wax again without it!

Today we are pleased to feature author Sherril Jaffe as our Authors Talk series contributor. Sherril discusses her opinions on art and its relationship to character. In particular, she explains the multifaceted purpose of art and how it is interested in the truth, which is currently under assault.
She also discusses the nature of the short story as an art form, referring to her piece in Issue 18, “During the Republican Convention.” She reveals that short stories are powerful because they can break all the rules, and she emphasizes that “a short story should crack something open in us.”
You can access Sherril’s pieces in Issue 18 of Superstition Review and Issue 4 of Superstition Review.
There’s nothing like the first day of class. Coffee, notebooks, and laptops are strewn around the table. The awkwardness of either small talk or silence permeates the room. As the seats fill, the energy is palpable, and the student body seems to carry with it a collective question. What are you about to make us do?
I teach short fiction, often in workshops settings, and though I vary my lesson plans considerably, there is one outline I return to no matter the age or skill level because it is fundamental to fiction writing. This lesson is on characterization, the only lesson I have that is, if not fixed, consistent.
When getting to know a new class, I ask for names, where students are from, how they like to spend free time, their favorite book or movie, and what led them to my class. Sometimes I throw in silly questions, such as how they’d spend a million dollars in three days or who they’d interview first if they had a talk show and could have anyone living or dead on as a guest. In other words, I cover the who, what, when, where, and why to get to know them.
To introduce students to characterization is to introduce them, in part, to all aspects of short-form storytelling. For this reason, I follow introductions by asking my students to answer the first four intro questions for a fictional character as well—preferably a brand-new character. If the more far-reaching question was posed, I ask them to answer that, too.
There is rarely a lot of struggle with this exercise. Characterization is a natural thing. We have so many personal experiences and interactions to draw from that we can often come up with a character by asking ourselves a few simple questions. In fact, if you’re reading this, try it. It’ll only take a few minutes.
Think of characterization in a similar manner to how we get to know people. When we first meet a person, we only have appearance to go by, and it’s easy to deduce a thing or two from body language. In conversation, more information is gathered. The more we see a person and interact, the more data we have at hand to create a portrait in our minds.
Examining fabricated characters at this point, after only a few questions, it would seem they are mere acquaintances. We need to know more, so here are a few more questions:
After adding to our list of questions and answers, a character begins to take shape, and at this early point in the workshop, I tell the class it’s time to share. When we go around the room, the magic begins to take shape. Suddenly, the number of people in the room has doubled. A fresh energy takes over as these quirky new people (usually people) are introduced.
Characters inevitably reflect aspects of either ourselves, people we know, characters from our dreams, and/or fictional characters we’ve been inspired by. We’re processing information day by day, so whether we’re conscious of it or not, all information shapes the way we think and perceive the world as artists. This is never more evident than in spontaneous creative efforts.
Because characters are often a collage of previous interactions, questions about human behavior, dreams, hopes, worries, and joys, they may even lead us to corners of our mind that are strange or uncomfortable. “How did I come up with this disturbing person?” a student might ask. Sometimes a disclaimer will be made: “Just so you know, my writing is not usually so dark.” Or, “I don’t like this person at all. He’s nothing like me.”
Characters, when made up on the spot, are not a reflection of us so much as a reflection of what’s been on our mind, what we know, and what we’d like to know. And in every case, they reflect passions and fears.
That’s not to say that if a student writes a serial killer character, that student is a serial killer. What it does mean is that if we write a serial killer character, that character will likely have some humanizing trait that we share, or reflect a fear we have about the world.
Writing is a way to reframe reality by exploring our emotions through characterization and action, through pure creative output, which, ideally, distills all the information we have and carries with us into potent little worlds that seem both unfamiliar and not.
For the writing-intensive portion of class, I challenge my students to explore their characters by writing a scene in which their protagonists almost get what they so desperately want. This writing assignment is about plot through characterization. It is the heart of the story. It is also important to set a limit on the time they have to write, so I’ll often give them 20 minutes. Knowing a timer is ticking, we tend to find ways to work more words onto the page.
As we conclude, I challenge my students (and anyone reading this) to live like writers, to observe the world like writers, to take notes and take stock. Feel fully that thick, humid breeze or hear the birdsong during morning walks—hear what is always there but you never pay attention to.
Carry a notebook. When you come up with a beautiful line, a new insight, a new observation, or just pure guttural emotion, write it down as soon as you can. Explore it on the page. And through all your observing and listening, keep your new character in the back of your mind.
As you live, this character solidifies. And as you continue to write, I suggest creating a few more and traveling with them, too, examining the world through multiple sets of eyes, and writing when so moved to do so. In this way, characters become vehicles by which to study the world. They can return in different scenarios or deliver a single message and move on.
The more I write, the more likely it is I’ll see a character return, only with each story she becomes stronger, more defined. Sometimes characters from different stories end up meeting in a narrative some months or years down the line. Sometimes, they fizzle out. But when we know our characters, really know them, our writing feels less like work and more like opportunity, a journey.

Creative writers know that physical description is among the most essential tools for establishing a character. How a person walks and talks; the clothing they wear; their hairstyle; how they chew and fidget and fuss, or sit stoically; the way they smile, frown, or stare blankly. These can provide terrific insights into our characters. However, merely listing the gestures often isn’t enough.
In this brief moment, we have two gestures – a “small smile” and a “look.” That’s a fine place to begin, but as written, these are simply stage directions. It’s as if the writer is merely puppeteering the characters, giving us a visual. The actions aren’t telling us anything about the characters, about the situation, about the emotional register of this moment. Is this guy actually happy? Is she happy? Or are they sad? Worried? Are they flirting? Are they ex-spouses who haven’t spoken in months, with a history of conflict between them? Is there resentment, love, nervous excitement? What are these gestures telling us?
Students often express hesitance about “slowing down” the action of the story in order to give backstory about the characters. They say they don’t want to bog down the piece with paragraphs of explication about who these people are and what brought them to this moment.
My answer is this: You don’t have to slow down the action. Weave the backstory into the action. Make it part of the scene. Connect the gestures to the characters’ backstory. Every gesture should reveal something: the character’s personality, psychology, desires, conflicts. Make the gestures work for you.
Mr. Willard eyed me kindly. Then he cleared his throat and brushed a few last crumbs from his lap. I could tell he was going to say something serious, because he was very shy, and I’d heard him clear his throat in that same way before giving an important economics lecture.
Notice that Mr. Willard doesn’t simply “eye” the narrator. That might be misconstrued as creepy. Instead, he eyes her “kindly.” That’s helpful to the reader; it gives us something about the mood, the tone. Next, he clears his throat and brushes crumbs from his lap. Is he nervous? Is he about to say something? People tend to clear their throats when they want to say something. Sure enough, Plath makes it clear with the next sentence.
But most importantly, she adds another line that connects Mr. Willard’s throat-clearing to the characters’ shared history. We learn that he is shy (therefore, they know each other). We learn that he was a teacher, specifically an economics teacher, and she must have been his student. The gestures aren’t only stage direction; they forward the plot and deepen our understanding of the characters. And they haven’t slowed down the scene.
Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he scowled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
Notice how much work Joyce’s verbs are doing. “Overclouding all his features” makes me think this guy is in a bad mood. And then he “scowled” and “hewed . . . vigorously the loaf.” He’s eating, but he’s not just eating: he’s eating violently, piggishly. He sings a dirty little ditty, and then he “crammed his mouth with a fry.” There’s aggression in that verb. He’s literally stuffing his face.
From those six words, I know quite a bit about what kind of dude this is. And I’d rather eat over here, thank you.
Flannery O’Connor is among the best at giving gestures with meaning. She often uses an “as if” structure, and it’s a technique you can easily apply to your own writing. Quite simply, she describes a gesture or expression, but then she adds one – or two, even three – similes that start with “as if,” similes that develop the character and the conflict.
Rayber continued to speak, his voice detached, as if he had no particular interest in the matter, and his were merely the voice of truth, as impersonal as air.
As a writer I would be tempted to quit after “his voice detached,” which gives us something important. But O’Connor keeps pushing it. In what way is his voice detached? The first clause tells us Rayber is talking as if he doesn’t care about the topic. Then the second part really elevates the simile: he has “no particular interest” because his “voice of truth” is absolute. He has no need to argue passionately.
To me, this last clause makes the whole gesture. In his own mind, Rayber’s logic is like an invisible, ubiquitous, and necessary force. No person can live without air; it is all around us at all times. And now the reader truly sees the full extent of the character’s ego.
The most important habit a writer can develop is to read like a writer. So the next time you’re reading, pay special attention to the ways the author uses gesture and detail to build character, to bring us closer to their conflicts. And then, as always, don’t hesitate to rush to the keyboard (or pen and paper) and use their techniques in your own writing.
The Nine Strengths: What a Story-Writer Possesses that He or She May Not Realize as Even Greater Strengths in Novel-Writing
Beginning fiction-writers usually start with the short story–for the obvious reason that at least on the surface of it, shorter seems easier. But most story-writers also aspire eventually to write novels, and the conventional wisdom is that writing short stories is the apprentice work for writing novels. A stupid way that it’s often phrased is that writing short stories is for children, while writing novels is for grown-ups. However, the occasion of trying to write a novel turns out to be so intimidating for even accomplished story-writers that they can forget to use their most highly developed tools and most valuable habits of creative thinking. Something about all those pages, all those characters, and all that narrative time to be covered can make a would-be novelist panic, forget what he knows, and make unfortunate decisions he’d never make in writing a story.
This was the case with yours truly. I’d published five story collections and a novella before I managed to write a publishable novel. And it wasn’t for lack of trying. In the old computers asleep in my attic two complete novel-manuscripts have found their final resting places. The good news is that recently I’ve written a couple of novels, one of them in three months, the other in six months. Like everything else in writing, this productive phase was mostly just a matter of luck, but I also believe that I’ve finally come into possession of things I knew perfectly well forty years ago. I had the knowledge and the tools all along, but the monster that a novel appeared to be when I was trying to write one scared me out of using my strengths. Instead I tried to rely on my weaknesses–big thinking, abstractions, philosophizing, tricky plot moves, high drama, far-fetched characters, etc. What follows, out of my experience, is a brief discussion of some story-writing tools that I now understand to be even more well-suited for novel-writing than they are for story-writing:
1. A veteran story-writer learns when to leave off, i.e. when to tease, to engage the reader’s imagination by way of omission, to motivate the reader to keep going–in the story or in his or her imagination–in spite of frustration. This applies especially to story endings, but it also applies to sections of stories. Or even to sentences in the middle of a paragraph. E.g., the teasing withholding of how Curt Lemon died in Tim O’Brien’s “The Things They Carried” makes a reader understand the deep significance of that death to the members of Lemon’s platoon.
2. A first principle for story-writers–often so much an assumption that the writer him- or herself is no longer conscious of it–is that it is crucial not to be boring. “Leaving out the parts that most people skip” (as Tony Hillerman phrased it) is pretty natural for a short-story writer, but a beginning novelist will often foolishly feel compelled to fill in a lot of blank pages. The novel occasion can persuade one that one must throw everything into the narrative rather than judiciously leaving many things out.
3. A story-writer often discovers both the pleasure and the narrative effectiveness of withholding something of narrative importance–of simply not overtly revealing a basic fact. E.g., the narrative of J.D. Salinger’s “Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes” refuses to say straight out that the woman in bed with the gray-haired man is the wife of the poor fellow who calls the gray-haired man to ask if he knows where his wife is. Everything in the text points to that being the case, but the absence of a factual assertion infuses the story with ominous possibility and tension. John Irving employs a similar strategy with the death of a beloved child character in The World According to Garp.
4. Because short stories are such a specialized and highly refined literary genre, their practitioners assume that their readers are adults who have little patience for the obvious. Thus, story-writers take pleasure in challenging their readers. People who aren’t serious and skilled readers are not inclined to read contemporary short stories. Those who do read them are literary gourmets. George Saunders, Tobias Wolff, T.C. Boyle, Amy Hempel, and Alice Munro expect their readers to bring background, imagination, a deeply ironic sensibility, and linguistic alertness to the reading occasion. But the high-end readers a story-writer wants are the exactly same readers he wants for the novel he might write if he is lucky.
5. Because the main characters of short stories are almost always “outsiders,” story-writers learn to trust their own strangeness, quirks & kinks, improper thoughts, obsessions, etc. as “the good stuff” of a narrative. This is not traditionally the case with novelists who are most often concerned with mainstream or regular citizens. (In The Lonely Voice, Frank O’Connor argues that “the short story more than any other genre involves a protagonist who is an outsider and operates on the periphery of society.”) Contemporary novels, however, are more and more inclined to “involve” oddball protagonists. Story-writers rely on the oddball protagonist who lives within them, but all too often they think that weirdo can’t possibly help them write a novel.
6. You do not become a short story-writer unless you possess a natural inclination to narrow the scope, to rely on a very small picture to bring authority to a big picture–to use mostly detailed accounts of scenes as the stuff of narrative. In fact I’m certain that the little-picture method of composition is the path story-writers take to discover whatever truth their work has to offer. Story-writers become synecdoche specialists. However, when they attempt the longer form, they can lose faith in this sophisticated and long-cultivated talent. My experience has taught me what now seems obvious–that the impulse to focus minutely is of as much value in making novels as it is in story-making.
7. Story-writers become geniuses of narrative transitions–or the writing of transitionless narratives–stories that use white space to represent time-gaps instead of conventional phrasing like “A week later,” or “In the days that followed.” Dead space, or lifeless language, in novels is just as deadly as it is in stories, but the beginning novelist may not think so. By the way, my all-time favorite transitionless moments in fiction occurs in Flannery O’Connor’s “Parker’s Back:
…Sara Ruth agreed to take a ride in his truck. Parker parked it on a deserted road and suggested to her that they lie down together in the back of it.
“Oh that ain’t necessary,” Parker said and as he reached for her, she thrust him away with such force that the door of the truck came off and he found himself flat on his back on the ground. He made up his mind then and there to have nothing further to do with her.
They were married in the County Ordinary’s office because Sarah Ruth thought churches were idolatrous.
8. After Hemingway, “show, don’t tell,” became the story-writer’s mantra. Contemporary story-writers (most extravagantly and brilliantly, Harold Brodkey), however, have shown the way toward both showing and telling. The show-don’t-tell template, though, never leaves the story-writers’ thinking, whereas it often doesn’t show up at all in the efforts of a beginning novelist. And story-writers making early attempts at novel-writing–because they don’t believe it applies to making narratives ten or fifteen times longer than a short story–are all too often inclined to switch off that useful little interior mantra that never stops whispering “show, don’t tell.” They explicate too much of what they should dramatize. I advocate both telling and showing, but I think I do a better job of telling because my habit is to err on the side of showing.
9. The dynamic nature of the interior lives of individual human beings is the bread and butter of fiction-writing. The interior life is what fiction brings to art that the other forms either can’t manage at all or else have to try to accomplish in unnatural ways–e.g. voice-over in movies. Both story-writers and novelists understand this perfectly well. What a story-writer brings to the novel-writing occasion is a refined sense of interior-life management. Which is to say that the story-writer is less inclined than the apprentice novelist to indulge a protagonist in pages and pages of soul searching and mental noodling. Naïve novelists can be wildly indulgent when they open up their characters’ thoughts and feelings, whereas story-writers bring speed, agility, and tact to their rendering of their characters’ thoughts and feelings. Novel readers may want more pages, but they also want narratives that intensely engage them from beginning to end. Which is to say that just because they’re reading a novel they’re no more tolerant of literary fooling around than a story reader is. They want what we all want–the dream that is so compelling we don’t want to wake up.

One of the first (of many) rejections of my novel Revenge of the Teacher’s Pet was from an editor who wrote, “I fear that not even Nabokov’s literary skills could make Mr. Portwit into a likable character.” The character he referred to was Dale Portwit, one of the protagonists of my novel. Mr. Portwit is a 50-year-old middle-school teacher who is, to put it kindly, self-serving, obnoxious, and stubborn. One of his quirks, for example, is insisting that everyone refer to him as “Mr. Portwit” instead of “Dale” because he believes “first-name usage is a privilege, not a right.”
When my second novel, The Girl Who Ate Kalamazoo, was released, it received some fine praise in a few local newspapers and literary blogs. But the Publisher’s Weekly review was the one I had been waiting eagerly to read. They called my book “relentlessly inventive.” I was thrilled. However, the PW review went on to assert that my characters were “irredeemably unlikable,” which made it difficult to care about the “bizarre goings-on.”
Suddenly all the positive comments I had received didn’t matter: What stuck in my craw was that phrase – “irredeemably unlikable.” I pondered it: Are my characters really that unlikable? In what way? What makes a character likable, anyway? Is it essential to readers that they “like” the protagonists of the books they read? What does it even mean to “like” a character? The concept felt foreign to me.
In 7th grade, I read To Build a Fire by Jack London. It was life-changing. I loved the story so much that I even read it aloud for a class presentation. To Build a Fire is the story of a man (known only as “the man”) who is trekking in the Arctic on his way to another research outpost. The temperature is so cold, however, that all of the “old-timers” have warned him not to venture out alone. He ignores their advice, believing himself to be a capable enough outdoorsman to make it easily. Spoiler alert: the man makes a few crucial mistakes and ends up freezing to death in the snowy wasteland. His supersized ego, his belief that his intelligence and rational thinking are more powerful than nature, ultimately leads to his downfall.
In retrospect, I realize that To Build a Fire was a template for the type of story I loved. Nothing touchy-feely or overly sentimental, yet packing a powerful emotional punch. Something that pushes us to question our role on Earth, the very essence of human existence. No feeling of closeness or affection for the main character; “the man” is not someone I idolized or felt a kinship with or “liked” in any specific fashion. But certainly I was invested in him. Certainly I enjoyed living briefly in his skin. My 8th grade was spent blazing through Stephen King’s novels (and Peter Straub and Dean Koontz – I liked horror). By high school, I had moved on to more so-called “literary” authors: Kafka, Poe, John Kennedy Toole, Dostoevsky, Camus.
The opening passage of The Stranger encapsulates the personality of the narrator, Muersault: “Mother died today; or maybe yesterday.” This is only the beginning of Mersault’s journey of detachment through the novel. He ends up confronting and killing a man on a public beach, apparently for no reason. When Muersault is brought to trial, he offers no defense whatsoever for his actions. In other words, a loveable guy!
Fitzgerald’s Great Gatsby, Twain’s Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur’s Court, Wright’s Native Son, Nabokov’s Lolita, Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle, Frank Norris’s McTeague – the hall of my literary heroes, when I step back and catalogue it, is a rogue’s gallery of unlikable characters. I doubt that most people, myself included, would want to spend an afternoon with any of these folks if they were made of flesh and blood. So what does this say about me, as a person? Am I a miscreant, a misanthrope, a misfit?
The honest and boring answer is that I’m none of these things. I don’t like to use the word “average,” but I’m a pretty average guy, at least on the surface. But maybe it’s because I’m a fairly average person that I’m drawn to these unsavory characters. Fiction allows me to walk in the shoes of people who are nothing like me; to observe from a safe distance as characters explore the dark, the absurd, the tragic, and the comically misguided aspects of the self. I can safely live inside the mind of an oddball, a criminal, a buffoon, and then retreat into my own drab routine. The truth is that I read and write stories, in part, in order to live things – people, places, philosophies, beliefs, fears, desires – that I don’t get to experience during my daily grind.
So if my characters are “irredeemably unlikable,” if they are grotesque or “weird,” I can be OK with that – as long as they aren’t predictable or flat. Above all, they must be capable of redemption. Their likability may be “irredeemable,” but I hope their souls aren’t. I’m not interested in perfect characters. I’m not looking for drinking buddies or racquetball partners. I’m not interested in someone like me. Lord knows, I get enough of myself seven days a week.
I don’t seek repellant characters. I don’t set out to create monsters. But I do seek difficult, flawed characters that will push me out of my comfort zone. Three-dimensional people, warts and all; people that are good and bad, ugly and beautiful, sinful and heroic; characters in need of grace.
Don’t misunderstand: there’s nothing wrong with likable characters. I love a charming, personable narrator as much as the next person. I love Scout and Bilbo Baggins and all those adorable and valiant rabbits from Watership Down. Readers seek camaraderie and friendship in the novels they love; or a feeling of connection to experiences and personalities that are familiar.
But as I continue to write, I’ll remind myself that there’s no way to predict what readers want. It’s impossible, and it’s a losing game. The amazing thing about storytelling is that it’s a two-way street; the reader brings their own life to every text they pick up, and they actively help create the characters on the page. All I can do is keep seeing the world the way I see it, trying to push myself and write characters that are living, breathing people, and raise the unanswerable questions about why we’re here.
While this might seem like a statement, it is really a question disguised as an observation. It seems to me that one of the most destructive trends in recent “literary fiction” successes has been the devaluation of style in favor of plot and character. While ideally, all these things should work together, popular literature has always favored plot and character over style, and now it appears that even “literary” works fear too much development of style as a clear sign of a limit to the potential audience for the work, the kind of thinking that was previously more limited to genre writing, best seller attempts, and the innumerable serial novels.
The backlash to this exists in “innovative” fiction and some small press releases, but the gap between the two has been increasing. In poetry, there is an equivalent polarization between experimental and traditional although the reasons seem to have much less to do with the potential popularity of the work.
Fortunately, there are always writers more interested in the most unique and complete experience of the writing regardless of popularity trends, which are usually not really trends at all but disguised returns to more direct explanation in the fiction. “Show us, don’t tell us,” often becomes give us the experience and then tell us what it should mean.
Popular fiction has always been good at stealing the thunder from literary art by adapting its successes to more mundane purposes. One of the latest victims of this is flash fiction, which has in many quarters been increasingly less experimental and wide-ranging in its structures, approaches and particularly its style. Some publishers of flash fiction are now drawing a stricter line between the prose poem and flash fiction. Theoretically interesting perhaps, but isn’t that defeating one of the reasons the form developed?
I began writing shorter prose works first as a poet trying on foreign hats, finding so much more of interest in the form in translated works from countries where the distinction between poetry and fiction was not so clearly drawn, places like Russia, for example, where poetry is actually popular and sometimes sells well. I felt a freshness that caught and held my attention more fully in the form, and one of the reasons was that I could come to it with fewer preconceptions of what it should be.
As I worked in shorter prose forms, I found it veering into essay, autobiography and satire as well as mixing fiction and poetry, and the range of possibilities excited me. There are rhythms and voices that function better in a confined space. There are different kinds of condensation and pacing. There is a different kind of tension created by knowing the experience will end sooner.
As I explored the range of possibilities, I found several of the resulting works rejected by a poetry magazine for being “fiction” and the same work rejected by a fiction magazine for being “poetry” without either of them having actually considered the work beyond their assumptions of its genre. I started sending the work without labeling it or designating which department it should go to and had pieces accepted by both fiction and poetry editors assuming it was meant for them, and even labeled with just as much certainty as “essay,” an assertion I had not considered, but which, once it had been pointed out to me, seemed equally valid.
Now that the idea of fiction completing itself in a much shorter space has been more widely accepted, the attempts to restrain it to more definable dimensions are returning, and the reactions against this are also occurring, making the questions such work raises once again more polarized. Is this healthy disagreement, or merely two equally restricting forms of boxing up creativity?
Many literary magazines and online sites claim to want “experimental” and “hybrid” work, but is this really what they want and publish, or have too many of them narrowed the definitions, and has the label “experimental” become merely an excuse for focusing on a single dimension of the work, just as popular fiction does with a different single dimension?

I came across this quote whilst doing my homework for my Educational Psychology class, and it really hit home. I thought I would share it with you guys.
“I want my children to understand the world, but not just because the world is fascinating and the human mind is curious. I want them to understand it so that they will be positioned to make it a better place. Knowledge is not the same is morality, but we need to understand if we are to avoid past mistakes and move in productive directions. An important part of that understanding is knowing who we are and what we can do… Ultimately, we must synthesize our understandings for ourselves. The performance of understanding that try matters are the ones we carry out as human beings in an imperfect world which we can affect for good or for ill.”

Slaughterhouse-Five, and use this quote as a constant reminder not to dwell on things that I cannot control. As a teacher, it has started more than one conversation with students that didn’t necessarily trust authority figures and wanted someone that could relate to them, however small a degree.
This was posted as a part of “So it Goes” Saturdays. The phrase “so it goes” appears in Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five 106 times. Can you help me collect 106 “so it goes” tattoos? 95 down, 11 to go.
Slaughterhouse-Five countless times over the last few years; it always reads a different way. Each time I get a different insight, a new understanding of the book. There’s too many feelings to express what Vonnegut sums up in three words; So it goes.
“And Lot’s wife, of course, was told not to look back where all those people and their homes had been. But she did look back, and I love her for that, because it was so human.
Slaughterhouse-Five‘ tattoo I got just after graduating from uni. I was introduced to the book in my first week and the repetition of the line throughout it really stuck with me even when many of the others in my class found it an insensitive reaction to the tragedies in the story. Long story short, I had a hard time at uni, I didn’t make friends and slowly got more separated from the ones I did have. At its core I’ve always thought ‘so it goes’ is a lamentation on and an acceptance of the bad, while understanding things were good once and will be good again. I figured it was a fitting goodbye to 4 years that were really hard and I wouldn’t change, but was happy to leave behind.

The line is, “The world was hers for the reading.” I decided to change it and create a little of my own, “The world was hers to read.” I did it in medium typewriter font.
I am in grad school to be a librarian and this means two things to me. One, when I read I have the whole world at my fingertips… I can learn or hear, understand anything. And the world is full of things for me to read… long dead people for me to meet.
the world was hers for the reading. She would never be lonely again, never miss the lack of intimate friends. Books became her friends and there was one for every mood. There was poetry for quiet companionship. There was adventure when she tired of quiet hours. There would be love stories when she came into adolescence and when she wanted to feel a closeness to someone she could read a biography. On that day when she first knew she could read, she made a vow to read one book a day as long as she lived.”

I had the tattoo done on my right wrist, facing me, so when I’m dealing with people that frustrate me and make me feel depressed I can just look at my tattoo and let its meaning sink in.

When you haven't had sex in a long time, it feels like the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone. If you're living in Germany in the 1930s, it probably isn't.
But that's no consolation to Egon Loeser, whose carnal misfortunes will push him from the experimental theatres of Berlin to the absinthe bars of Paris to the physics laboratories of Los Angeles, trying all the while to solve two mysteries: whether it was really a deal with Satan that claimed the life of his hero, the great Renaissance stage designer Adriano Lavicini; and why a handsome, clever, charming, modest guy like him can't, just once in a while, get himself laid.
I was drawn to this book because a) the concept of teleportation - with its dematerializing of objects for transport from one place to another - seems an interesting subject and b) the cover art is extremely cool. The hero (if hero is a good term here) is theatrical designer Egon Loeser and we follow him from 1931 Berlin to early 1940s Los Angeles in his pursuit of the unattainable Adele. In addition to Adele, Loeser is obsessed with Lavicini, a 17th century theatrical designer who may have invented a teleportation device that actually worked. Mix in shadowy Russian spies, a pulp mystery writer, references to H.P. Lovecraft, a possible ghost, plus a Parisian con man and you have quite a stew. In the end though, I'm not really sure what the book is or is about or even if it is successful. That cover art is great though.
This book was the last book I read in 2014. I have been putting off writing a review because I don't know what to say about it. I did not hate it, but I did not enjoy the book while reading it. In the end, I gave it 4 stars at Goodreads, because I felt that the good outweighed the bad. I concluded that it is a well written book that just isn't really for me.
My one-sentence synopsis: As Egon Loesor searches for one woman who has disappeared from his life, many interesting things happen to him and he survives on his wits or his luck. The interesting elements are nice, but they are not enough. A good portion of the story is set in the US, and I enjoyed those parts the most. How true to life the picture of the Hollywood area at this time is, I don't know, but it was still nice to read about.
One disappointment for me was that I expected there to be more science fiction elements to the story. It is loosely based on a teleportation device, but that is not really what the story is about. However, I am sure if I had found other appealing elements, I could have easily overcome the problem. The description on the dust jacket flap implies that the book has elements of historical fiction, romance, noir, and science fiction. That is true, but I don't want a novel to flirt with all of these genres and be a mish mash of them.
My comments above show that a lot of my frustration with the book was due to my expectations. When I go back to the book and read a page or two, I see that the writing is very well done and interesting. But as I was reading it, as a whole it did not appeal to me. This is a book that I plan to re-read, and I expect to like it more the second time around. My husband and I still intend to keep this book, so we haven't written it off. And it does have a wonderful cover.
Many, many reviewers loved this book. There were also reviewers who hated it but I would say overall there are more positive reviews. Certainly the reviews from major publications that I read were very positive.
Probably not, Keishon, but it is hard to say. I really wanted to like it, and I may yet find more things to like.
Bill, I would have liked to know your opinion of it. I did not find the humor in the book, and was taking it too seriously, I think.
Thanks, Tracy, for your candor. This doesn't sound like my sort of thing, to be honest. I don't mind going outside of my comfort zone sometimes, if a book is really well written and so on. But it sounds as though this one isn't sure what it wants to be. I think I'll give this one a miss.
Margot, every book is not for every reader (and we have so much to read already). As I said to Bill, I would love to know your opinion if you ever do try it.
Interesting and honest review. I think it's made me more likely to read the book as it sounds like something you really couldn't make up your mind about. Thanks!
Thanks, Sarah. I do think this is the type of book that is worth trying and many of readers will get a lot out of it. Very difficult to describe.
I actually do enjoy crime when mixed with fantasy when John Dickson Carr does it - and as long as it plays by its own rules I have no problem with mixing genres. I havce a feeling that the obsessive protagonist may not be someone I would want to spend several hundreds in the company of however hmm - thanks Tracy, really enjoyed having the 'family perspective' on this one!
Sergio, I like crime mixed with fantasy or science fiction but this one did not have enough of either for me. Some people have described it as alternative history, although I did not see it as that either. You might enjoy it, it is very clever, but a lot of that goes over my head.
Tracy - I think I was the opposite, I was expecting more of a sci fi plotline, and it NOT having that was a plus in my view. Plus, I did find if very funny. I can't tell - have your or Glen read Boxer Beetle? I preferred this one.
Moira, I do remember that you found the book funny, and many other reviews said the same. I could see that the situations were humorous but I could not get into that aspect of it, which might be one key to enjoying it. Glen and I have not read Boxer Beetle and I had never heard of this author before. Some descriptions of Boxer Beetle lead me to think I would like it, but I am not sure.
Taken in pieces, I could admire the writing in The Teleportation Device. I can admire what Beauman has done. As a whole, I did not enjoy it. I do think I would like it on re-reading, because I would be reading piece by piece and not worrying about an ending, a resolution.
Tracy, thanks for the review. I think I'll hold back on this one for now. "Egon Loesor" is quite a telling name in context of the story.
You are correct about the name, Prashant. But it will tell you something about the way I read that I did not even notice that until other reviews pointed it out.

Defining and understanding complexity as it applies to the entire mining life cycle – Complex Orebodies 2018
John Steen, a keynote speaker, shares his thoughts on the two levels of discussions the mining industry needs to think about:
He is Associate Professor in Strategy at the University of Queensland Business School in Brisbane and Senior Research Fellow at the Australian Institute of Business and Economics. He is currently leading major international research studies about innovation and sustainable development in the resources sector and in developing economies.
• The first of these is technical approaches to complex orebodies and what types of skills and technologies we will need to mine in more challenging operating environments.
• The second is what this means for competition and the structure of the industry. I think we are doing a good job with advancing the technological discussion but considerations about what this means for the strategy of mining companies and their relations with industry stakeholders is lagging a bit.
Many industries have undergone a major transition when the basis for competitive advantage changes. If we consider a future where the basis of advantage isn’t low-cost mining reserves and the difference between highest and lowest cost quartile reserves is small, what does that mean for competitive advantage. I’m arguing that this will be the trigger for profound changes in the industry, where we will see new business models for mining.
I am very interested in new approaches to integrating the mining value chain. We know that productivity losses occur when functions like drilling and blasting, load and haul and processing aren’t coordinated. With new approaches to modelling processes and managing data, we should be seeing advances in the mine to mill agenda.

As the yr 2000 looms, heralding a brand new millennium, apocalyptic idea abounds-and no longer in basic terms between non secular radicals. In politics, technological know-how, philosophy, pop culture, and feminist discourse, apprehensions of the tip look in photographs of cultural decline and concrete chaos, forecasts of the tip of historical past and ecological devastation, and visions of a brand new age of successful know-how or a gender-free utopia. there's, Lee Quinby contends, a threatening "regime of fact" triumphing within the United States-and this regime, with its enforcement of absolute fact and morality, imperils democracy. In Anti-Apocalypse, Quinby bargains a strong critique of the millenarian rhetoric that pervades American tradition. In doing so, she develops techniques for resisting its tyrannies.
Drawing on feminist and Foucauldian concept, Quinby explores the complicated courting among strength, fact, ethics, and apocalypse. She exposes the ramifications of this courting in components as diversified as jeanswear journal ads, the Human Genome undertaking, modern feminism and philosophy, texts by means of Henry Adams and Zora Neale Hurston, and radical democratic activism. through bringing jointly this type of wide selection of subject matters, Quinby exhibits how apocalypse weaves its approach via an unlimited community of possible unrelated discourses and practices. Tracing the deployment of strength via platforms of alliance, sexuality, and know-how, Quinby finds how those energy relationships produce conflicting modes of subjectivity that create percentages for resistance. She promotes various serious stances—genealogical feminism, an ethics of the flesh, and "pissed criticism"—as demanding situations to apocalyptic claims for absolute fact and common morality. Far-reaching in its implications for social and cultural idea in addition to for political activism, Anti-Apocalypse will have interaction readers around the cultural spectrum and problem them to confront some of the most sophisticated and insidious orthodoxies of our day.
Lee Quinby is affiliate professor of English and American stories at Hobart and William Smith schools. She is the writer of Freedom, Foucault, and the topic of the United States (1991) and coeditor (with Irene Diamond) of Feminism and Foucault: Reflections on Resistance (1988).

23 10 EU(JEAN)ICS This is what has occurred over the last twenty years: late capitalism has reappropriated the New Left's appropriation of the discourses of the natural and rebellion. In these processes of appropriation and reappropriation, meanings attached to the discourses of the natural and the rebellious are altered. All jeanswear ads begin from the premise, which may be located along the axis of eugenics, that denim is natural, true, pure. Yet, since by definition ads are simulations, depictions of the natural are already a product of the axis of eu(jean)ics.
Rather, these blank-screen faces, virtually interchangeable, all invested with the power of the outward gaze, are Baudrillard's schizos, subject to the "absolute proximity, the total instantaneity of things. "30 Although physical contact demarcates four opposite-sex couples from the remaining four figures, one woman and three men (a set of numbers that implies a variety of homosexual and heterosexual possibilities), in each case mirrored narcissism overrides the suggestion of sexual attraction to another.
Sexual contact occurs through telephone and video stimulation. "15 In short, eugenics is about reproduction. Eu(jean)ics is about replication. " Sterility emerges as a goal, for this is the era of suspect body fluids that threaten contamination. For eu(jean)ics, administering healthy bloodlines is less a matter of marriage and procreation and more a matter of purchasing items that either simulate EU(JEAN)ICS 9 youth or give death the look of kitsch. 17 Day 3: JeaivSplicing Contemporary jeanswear ads splice together the power axes of eugenics and fashion to create eu(jean)ics.

For the 90 children and families requiring some other form of intermittent service from a Type A unit, the service load is provided by the clinical staff. About 78 of the children (52% of SED total) require assessment and forms of indirect services, whereas 15 (10%) need other forms of direct service. The senior social worker carries a case load of 60 and the half-time social work technician, a case load of 30. The psychologist, with 30% time or 12 hours per week, provides assessment, consultation to the psychoeducational program, and carries a small case load of children seen for individual therapy.

Less than 6% were placed in more restrictive settings such as youth development centers, regional mental hospitals, or private residential schools, whereas 38% returned to special education classes in the public schools; 35% were withdrawn or dropped out, and subsequent placements were unknown. In another study of 382 children exiting the network because they had been judged to have achieved program objectives and no longer in need of network services, Swan and Jacob (1985) found that 34% of the placements at exit were into regular education classes.

Some hardware configurations require special initialisation, often within the first few instruction cycles after a device reset. To accommodate this, you might be tempted to add statements to the beginning of your main() function, but this function might not begin execution for some time after reset, so this is far from ideal.
Before any C code can execute, the runtime environment must be prepared. This is performed by the runtime startup code, which is code that is generated by the compiler and is executed before main() is invoked. The runtime startup code ensures that stacks and operating modes are correctly initialised. It also clears uninitialised global and static variables defined in your program, and it sets the initial value of other global and static variables. The code to initialise these variables can be very time consuming, particularly when there are many values to read from program memory and write to RAM. Given this potential and very significant time delay, what can you do if you have impatient hardware that is threatening to melt down unless it can be configured?
Assembly stubs of powerup routines are provided in your compiler’s sources directory. These can be completed to perform the tasks you require. For PIC18 devices, use the sources/pic18/powerup.as file; for all other devices, use the sources/pic/powerup.as file. Copy the relevant file containing the powerup assembly stub and add the copy to your project, or include it in the list of files being compiled if you are building using the command line.
Edit the powerup file, and add the code you require after the powerup label and before the sequence of code that performs the jump to the label start, which is the entry point to the runtime startup code. You must keep this jump instruction sequence intact. Do not instead jump to main() as this will defeat the runtime startup code and your application might fail. The linking of the powerup routine is fully automatic provided you place your code in the powerup psect, which is already specified in the assembly stub. When you next build your project, the powerup routine will be automatically linked to the reset vector and executed after reset.
Here is an example powerup.as file for a PIC18 device, modified with instructions that sets PORT B into a prescribed state.
Since the powerup code is executed before the C runtime environment has been initialised, it must be written in assembly. This means that you are responsible for all aspects of the powerup code’s operation. You must manually add bank selection instructions and perform address masking when appropriate, and similarly you must be aware of any published errata for the device you are using and follow any recommended workarounds. See the MPLAB® XC8 C Compiler User’s Guide section What Things Must I Manage When Writing Assembly Code? for more information. If you include the <xc.inc> assembly header file, your code can use any of the symbols for the device’s special function registers or bits within those registers, as the above example shows.
To confirm that the everything has worked correctly, check the startup.as file (or the startup.lst list file) after you build. This file holds some of the runtime startup code and is regenerated each time you build your project. By default, this file will remain after compiling if you are building on the command line, but if you are using the MPLAB X IDE you will need to set an option for it to be preserved. Enable the XC8 Linker > Runtime > Keep generated startup.as option. You should see something similar to the following in the generated startup code:

"We had a large group of adults and teens that got day passes to the attractions at the Marriott Mountainside resort, and the Alpine Coaster was the favorite attraction. Each person in a single car with levers you could use to control your speed, unlike the adjacent Alpine Slide (which is also a very fun ride) there was no risk of falling off the tracks!" reviews
Thrill seekers, meet your match on Utah's largest Alpine Coaster. The elevated track winds you through more than a mile of loops, curves and hair-pin curves at speeds up to 30 mph. Just like your favorite roller coaster - but with the refreshing mountain scenery of Park City.

In Bryce Canyon...This 8-mile trail is arguably the most scenic dayhike in Bryce Canyon, and is less-trafficked than other dayhike loops.
Incredible gobsmacking views of hoodoos and more hoodoos that change with the light. Once you get away from the trailhead, very few people around so you can really soak in the experience. Yes, this is more strenuous than the touristy Navajo/Queens type routes, but if you're a regular hiker, it shouldn't be a problem and so much more inspiring. We did the route clockwise. You get more immediate views that way. Reviews Pics of hoodoos!
