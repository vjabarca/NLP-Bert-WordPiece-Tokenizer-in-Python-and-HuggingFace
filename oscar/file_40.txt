Goddard says estrogen levels begin to decline as a woman begins perimenopause. “As a result, we lose muscle mass, and that loss results in a decrease in metabolism — we literally have to consume fewer calories to maintain or lose weight,” she says. “The loss of estrogen also leads to a propensity to deposit fat in the mid-section, which leads to further metabolic derangement (or an inefficient metabolism). It increases insulin resistance, can lead to pre-diabetes and diabetes, and increases the risk for heart disease.”
In one study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, volunteers who got 22 to 55 percent of their total calories at breakfast gained only 1.7 pounds on average over four years. Those who ate zero to 11 percent of their calories in the morning gained nearly three pounds. In another study published in the same journal, volunteers who reported regularly skipping breakfast had 4.5 times the risk of obesity as those who took the time to eat.
“People who have yo-yo dieted all their lives may experience much difficulty losing weight later in life due to this metabolic adaptation,” says Bustillo. “At this point, just about every weight loss program will not work or will take really long to work, because of the adaptation to such a low intake of food.” [SO ARE YOU DOOMED? OR ARE THERE THINGS YOU CAN DO?]
Load up on low-fat dairy: Women who consumed milk, yogurt, and cheese three to four times a day lost 70 percent more body fat than women who didn't eat dairy in a study published in the January 2003 American Society for Nutritional Sciences Journal of Nutrition. The reason: Calcium, along with other substances in dairy, actually revs up your metabolism, telling your body to burn excess fat faster, according to study author Michael Zemel, Ph.D., director of the Nutrition Institute at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. And no, fortified o.j. won't do the trick. The best results come from dairy products instead of from other calcium-rich foods (like broccoli), calcium-fortified products (such as orange juice) or supplements. Women reap the largest fat-burning benefit when they consume three servings of dairy and 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day, Zemel's research shows.
Frustrating? Of course. Impossible? Hopefully not. “You just need to be a little more savvy and prepared,” says Larson. “Be in the best physical and mental health possible right now, so you can move gracefully into the next decade of your life.” Most important, maintaining a healthy weight helps you avoid scary diseases, so you can enjoy a long and happy life—and play with your grandkids.
From her pepperoni-pizza pantsuit to her cow print leather top, if you’ve learned anything about Beyoncé lately—aside from the fact that the woman really can wear anything—it’s that she and Jay-Z are on a vegan adventure. The power couple recently embarked on a 22-day plant-based challenge, complete with mouthwatering Instagram pics hashtagged #22daysvegan. But Queen B and her Brooklyn beau aren’t the first to experiment with dieting. Take a look back at some memorable celebrity diets through the years.
Make a quarter of your plate whole grains or starchy vegetables such as squash, corn or sweet potatoes, and a quarter lean protein. Serve with two teaspoons of healthy fats, and stick to fruit for dessert. This ensures that you get an appropriate balance of protein, carbs, and fat from nutrient-rich, filling foods. And make sure you keep an eye out for the six subtle signs you’re eating too many carbs. 10 दिन में मोटापा कम करने का नैचुरल तरीका ( How to lose weight naturally? )
“Your 30s are an awesome time,” says Larson. “This is the decade you want to get and stay physically fit, and focus on maintaining.” In your 20s, you could binge on pizza and wine and work it off quickly, but in your 30s, it takes a little longer. As your muscle mass and metabolism dip, you lose the margin for error. You’re also leaning into your career, experiencing more stress. And women are having babies, losing sleep, and get into irregular eating patterns. “Don’t wait to lose the baby weight,” says Larson. “You don’t want to take 5 to 10 pounds with you into the next decade.”
While weight loss after 40 is absolutely possible, keeping your expectations about how fast you’ll shed those pounds in check can help you stay on track in the long run. Managing your expectations about your weight loss can help keep you from getting discouraged if you’re not slimming down as fast as you had hoped, making it easier to stick to your plan and recover from those little hiccups that could otherwise send you face-first into the next brownie sundae you see. 5 best exercises for beginners over 40 from home
How My Day Went: It was incredible. Not heeding to a super restrictive set of rules (ahem, “avoid this list of random vegetables!”) made me feel happier and more comfortable, and I think life is supposed to be happy and comfortable, for the most part. For breakfast, I met up with my friends at a diner and ordered a veggie omelet with a side of home fries and toast. I only had three bites of the toast and two bites of the home fries. While not finishing my entire plate is incredibly out-of-character for me (finishing the whole plate is, like, 90 percent of my personality), I was satiated from the omelet and happy to be out and about catching up with my friends, rather than eating baby food in bed like a deranged recluse. For lunch, I made myself a Cobb salad with avocado, egg, turkey and bacon. The meal was so filling that I almost didn’t miss the seven slices of bread with which I typically accompany my salads.
In all honesty, the EU is beginning to break down, the reactions from the centre prove their hostility to change. The handling of the Brexit negotiations prove their dislike of any Country not agreeing with their ever closer Union, more like ever imploding Union, it's finished, we should remain friends, trade together and respect one another's culture and customs. Eat Food To Lose Belly Fat Natural Way !!
If you really want to speed up your metabolism, start with changes to your daily activity. You'll see the greatest benefit if you can move more throughout the day. Then make diet-friendly food choices that help you to feel more energized. And lastly, skip the metabolism-boosting pills and potions (unless your doctor prescribes it). Most of them don't work and some even cause harm.
Keeping your carbs in check—especially the refined kind—can help combat age-related insulin resistance and promote steady blood sugar levels, Cederquist says. Adding more protein to your diet can also help. Not only does the nutrient help stave off age-related muscle loss, but it also helps keep your metabolism revved, because the body has to work harder to digest it than, say, a bagel, Cederquist says. How much of each nutrient you consume each time you eat matters, too. In a perfect world each meal and snack should have: Surprising Foods That Slow Down Your Metabolism
We know by now that juice “cleanses” aren’t the healthiest way to drop weight — but that hasn’t stopped certain celebrities from trying it themselves. The Sun explains this diet involves abstaining from solid food for a few days to a week in favor of consuming only juiced fruits and veggies. Unfortunately, many nutritionists find the diet to be high in sugar — and the body doesn’t need any help in “flushing out toxins,” either. How to Lose Belly Fat in 1 Night With This Diet
Want to maximize your fat-burning potential after 40? Start by making sure you’re getting plenty of calcium in your diet. The results of a study conducted at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville reveal that obese women who consumed more calcium lost 11 pounds of body fat in over a 12-month period. Even better, increasing your calcium intake can help increase the strength of your bones, reducing your risk of a fall or fracture.
The Deal: This one is more of a tip/trick than a full-fledged diet. Every morning when you wake up, have a cup of warm water with fresh lemon juice. That’s right. No Pop-Tarts. No coffee. Lemon juice and hot water first thing. Apparently, the mixture helps with digestion; the acid in lemon juice “works with the body to nourish and to enhance proper function,” Roxanne Sukol, MD, a preventive medicine specialist at the Cleveland Clinic’s Wellness Institute, told Yahoo Health.
Caffeine's ability to speed up the central nervous system makes it a powerful metabolism booster. "In addition, coffee beans provide antioxidants and real health value," says Amy Goodson, RD, a dietitian for Texas Health Ben Hogan Sports Medicine. "Provided your cup is not laden with cream and syrup, coffee can be a great way to give you energy as well as some antioxidants." Coffee has been shown to improve energy levels during exercise, especially endurance activity, and help people work harder longer, which therefore burns more calories. Drinking coffee after a workout can also be beneficial. Consuming caffeine after exercise increased muscle glycogen by 66 percent in endurance athletes, enabling them to more quickly replenish energy stores used through exercise, according to a study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.
Why does eating lots of fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids (salmon, herring, and tuna) help amp up metabolism? Omega-3s balance blood sugar and reduce inflammation, helping to regulate metabolism. They may also reduce resistance to the hormone leptin, which researchers have linked to how fast fat is burned. A study in Obesity Research found rats that ingested large doses of fish oil while exercising lost weight. Take omega-3 fatty acid supplements; Hyman recommends 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams per day. Hate the fishy after-burp? Try flaxseed oil, walnuts, or eggs fortified with omega-3s. Or check out supplements (by brands such as Nordic Naturals) that have no fishy taste. Real Reasons Why You Can't Lose Weight After 50
Noshing throughout the day is a proven strategy to help you curb hunger and eat fewer calories overall. Now, experts are promoting nibbling versus gorging as a way to keep metabolism running by holding blood sugar levels steady and preventing weight-gain-promoting insulin spikes. Enjoying six small meals a day should do the trick; keep them around 300 calories each, or divide your usual day's calories by six.
Jack Yeager, a nutrition coach in Los Angeles spends much of his time getting celebrities into shape. In fact, Yaeger recently hosted the Discovery network's "Body Challenge Hollywood," a 12-week health and fitness challenge starring such actors as Erik Estrada (CHiPs), Charlene Tilton (Dallas), Susan Olsen and Christopher Knight (both from The Brady Bunch), Kym Whitley (Sparks), and David Anthony Higgins (Malcolm in the Middle).
It's essential for carrying the oxygen your muscles need to burn fat, says Tammy Lakatos, RD, coauthor of Fire Up Your Metabolism. Until menopause, women lose iron each month through menstruation. Unless you restock your stores, you run the risk of low energy and a sagging metabolism. Shellfish, lean meats, beans, fortified cereals, and spinach are excellent sources.
I am now 75 and have a BMI of 26 which is technically overweight for my height but not by much. I have found that I have had to make changes to my diet so that they become a habit. For example I only have fruit and yogurt after a meal and never a pudding. When at events where cake is handed around I can happily say no as I find it too sweet now. People sometime say oh you are being so good, but I’m not I just don’t enjoy it anymore and I won’t eat it just to please others. I have also discovered that it is good to eat plenty of protein usually in the form of poultry and a high protein low fat cheese I have discovered.
Eager to lose weight? Start lifting it. Researchers at Wake Forest University found that cutting calories and weight training helped study participants lose more fat and less muscle than aerobic exercise, calorie restriction, or a combination of the two, while losing the same amount of weight as the aerobic exercise group. And when you want to get even more cut, This Is the Safest Way to Lose Weight Over 40.
The easiest 350 calories you'll ever burn: Exercise is obviously important, but regular daily activity known as "NEAT" (nonexercise activity thermogenesis) is equally essential for a healthy metabolism. Small movements such as stretching your legs, taking the stairs, even just standing to talk on the phone can add up to an extra 350 calories burned a day.
Until this point, you've treated annual physicals as optional, but now you need to get serious. Blood pressure, cholesterol, and sugar levels all need routine checks, especially if you know there is a family history of troubles. The ache you feel today could be nothing -- then again, it may have been caused by too much or too little exercise, a diet deficiency, or something more serious. The sooner you catch it, the less damage done. If your knees ache, your back hurts, or you suffer from persistent headaches, see your doctor. Wouldn't you be hesitant to pilot a plane that didn't receive regular maintenance and service?
“The chemical messengers that control our metabolism begin to decline in our early 30s which makes it very difficult to maintain an ideal body weight or even lose unhealthy fat weight,” says Robert Kominiarek, D.O., medical director and hormone specialist at the Alpha Male Medical Institute in Springboro, OH. Once you hit 40, add lower testosterone, higher blood glucose, and higher insulin levels to the list of physiological changes that now make losing extra insulation about as difficult as keeping your full head of hair.
I am 51 years old and I’ve been following you for about four years. I have lost 25 pounds, and physically I look great. I eat mostly grass fed beef organic chicken and vegetables. I am gluten-free except I do drink some beers from time to time and eat some pub food about once a week. I do an intense free weight workout about 10 minutes four times a week. I am a UPS driver and move constantly for about 9 to 10 hours a day.
Sometimes, you have to eat fat to lose fat. Specifically, healthy fats — those with omega-3 fatty acids, monounsaturated fats, and oleic acid — dramatically help to satisfy hunger and fire up your metabolism. Think avocados, walnuts, coconut oil, and even full-fat dairy. (Low-fat often does more harm than good, which is why full-fat is one of the 20 Supermarket Trends of 2016!) To make sure you’re eating the right kind of fat, check out our exclusive report on the 20 Best Full-Fat Foods for Weight Loss. Changes to Your Body at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 (Shocking Facts!)
This is another "healthy" swap gone wrong. Sure, egg whites have less fat and fewer calories than whole eggs — but they also have fewer nutrients. Vitamin B-12 is one of those nutrients you’ll only find in the yolk; it’s essential for your brain health and keeps your blood flowing normally. Your body absorbs B-12 more poorly as you age, meaning that cutting one of your main sources of the nutrient is a bad idea. Egg yolks also have impressive stores of vitamin D, A, E, and K, along with lots of omega-3s. You’d be surprised how many people subsist off of egg whites but still take extra omega-3 pills.
With her flowing, untamed blonde locks, piercing blue eyes and perfectly defined cheekbones, Michelle Pfeiffer is truly genetically blessed. Known for her tendency to portray strong women with intense sex appeal, the 60-year old is credited as one of the most talented actresses of her generation. She has received countless accolades and awards and is universally recognised as one of the most beautiful women of all time.

It takes the body extra effort to break down whole grains than more refined and processed grains, like the flour ordinarily used to make bread and pasta. You can help keep your metabolic rate elevated by consuming foods that the body has to work harder to digest. Your go-tos are whole foods that are also rich in fiber. We’re talking brown rice, oatmeal, quinoa, and sprouted grain bread. MEN OVER 40 How To Increase Testosterone And Get Rid Of Belly Fat
If your tummy has been rounder than a pufferfish, it’s time to cut foods that cause bloat from your diet. “As we age, our bodies can’t break down lactose as efficiently. When we can’t efficiently digest something, it tends to cause gas and bloat, which is the opposite of a flat stomach. Avoid dairy foods, and you’ll likely see some improvement!” advises Amy Shapiro MS, RD, CDN of Real Nutrition NYC. Can’t give up your late-night cereal sessions? You don’t have to! Just opt for these better-for-you milk alternatives.
The powdered stuff that dissolves into your cup of Joe and transforms it from dreary to creamy contains some unexpected ingredients. Sodium aluminosilicate, which is added to the creamer as an anti-caking agent, is also found in detergent and has been found to cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritations. Not only that, Coffee Mate’s Original also contains hydrogenated vegetable oil, which adds to the heart-harming saturated fat content. If you’re not dairy-averse, you’re better off getting healthy fats from a splash of heavy cream or even opt for nut milk.
Without kids or a spouse, a lot of women in their twenties have the freedom to eat out with friends whenever the hell they want. That means you eat way more calories from that yummy Thai restaurant than you would if you actually used your stove, says Ansel. But you can still stay on track without sitting at home. Since most restaurants have at least one healthy option, make it your goal to order first, she says. "Research shows people follow the lead of the first person to order in a group,” says Ansel. And instead of revisiting the same old high-cal spots, do your homework and suggest new (healthier) joints that your friends will like, too. Another option: Eat half of your meal, and box the rest for leftovers tomorrow night.
Remember that banquet feast scene from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom? The one where Indy and his posse sat down to a scrumptious feast that began with a scorpion and spider salad and ended with a chilled monkey brain sorbet? With some of these celebrities, that's not too far from the level of sheer disgustingness we're dealing with here. That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but these weird, questionable, and for some, downright gross celebrity diets are all the proof we need that sometimes, the rich and famous will do just about anything to keep themselves looking trim!
"Celebrity plans have a tendency to promote a very quick fix, are hard to stick by and are touting all types of products and when the author doesn't have a degree in health, it can be very scary," agrees Rachel Beller, director of the Brander Nutritional Oncology Counseling and Research Program at the John Wayne Cancer Institute in Santa Monica, Calif.
“Modern life puts such pressure on us to do, produce, and succeed that we often find ourselves racing from one activity to another,” Bernstein points out. “In the process, we can easily lose a sense of ourselves. Downtime brings us back to the integrity of being ourselves. In the not doing, we are open and relaxed and thus insights and creative ideas find their way to us.”
One of the most important nutrients to load up on during middle age is iron. Spinach has much more iron than iceberg lettuce, which is made of mostly water. If you’re choosing a green for its healthfulness, spinach or another dark leafy green is a more nutritious option. But a Caesar salad now and then won’t kill you — so long as you wash your lettuce correctly! Lettuce is one of the foods most likely to give you food poisoning.
If you're cutting calories to lose weight, add 200-300 to your daily intake once in a while, says Amanda Bonfiglio Cunningham, a senior Yoga Medicine instructor. "The body will get used to a calorie deficit diet, adjusting by slowing the metabolic rate. By allowing yourself a day of indulgence (not overindulgence!), you're creating a healthy balance," she explains. "The extra calories raise leptin production, a hormone that regulates appetite and energy. This rise triggers thermogenesis, the body's natural tendency to create heat, which results in burning calories." Pass the dessert menu!
However, just like those rehab-loving design gurus on HGTV, your body breaks down muscle as regularly as it builds it. "All of the cells in your body need protein to function. When there aren't enough amino acids from food available in the bloodstream, the body will start to break down and harvest amino acids from your muscle in order to keep more vital cells—like the ones in your brain and other organs—functioning," says Dr. Paddon-Jones. "This is a natural, continuing cycle. Muscle-protein synthesis goes up after you eat a meal with protein, and your body switches back to muscle-breakdown mode a few hours after you've eaten. Normally, the ups and downs equal out and your muscle mass stays the same." However, eat too little protein for too long and your muscles start to shrink, eventually causing your metabolism to take a nosedive.
The paleo diet has been picking up steam over the years thanks to its promise for a fitter physique and optimal health. Everyday Health explains the paleo diet only allows you to eat foods that were available for human consumption millions of years ago. That means all processed foods are out — but that’s not all. True paleo followers also don’t consume dairy, grains, or legumes.
Buying organic fruits and veggies might cost a little bit more, but it's worth it for your waistline. Researchers in Canada found those with the most organochlorines — AKA pollutants found in pesticides that are stored in fat cells — are more likely to experience a halt in metabolism opposed to those who eat pesticide-free organic produce. To avoid letting what you eat get in the way of burning more calories, try to at least buy organic produce when it comes to the Environmental Working Group's "Dirty Dozen": strawberries, spinach, nectarines, apples, peaches, pears, cherries, grapes, celery, tomatoes, sweet bell peppers, and potatoes. How To Lose Belly Fat After 40
In a study conducted by Swiss and German researchers, lucky participants ate about 1.5 ounces of dark chocolate daily for two weeks. Ultimately, these chocolate nibblers had lower stress-hormone levels and a more regulated metabolism than a control group. Scientists speculate that chemicals in cocoa, such as flavonoids, play a role in regulating metabolism by alleviating stress that can cause your fat-burning engines to go on the fritz. Should you think this is a license to go wild, take heed: We’re talking small amounts of high-quality dark chocolate. Researchers say 1.5 ounces is enough.
I look at life as a plane flight. Several decades ago, your parents started the engine. They revved the motor and headed down the runway until -- liftoff! -- you were born. Your plane continued to climb through childhood and adolescence, until you reached adulthood: full cruising altitude. Throughout your 20s and 30s, flying felt effortless. No matter what you ate, how little you slept, or how infrequently you exercised, your body kept its sleek, strong lines. No engine troubles for you!
The freezer aisle is stocked with appetizing frozen dinners that make busy weeknight suppers a breeze, but these convenient and inexpensive foods may cost you your health in the long run. Many of these meals are jam-packed with sodium and preservatives and are void of sufficient fiber, which will help keep you full and less prone to midnight munchies.
In other words? If certain foods seem to open the floodgates for you without fail, it might be better to steer clear altogether and stick with treats that don't trigger a binge. It might feel tough at first. But instead of seeing it as deprivation, reframe your decision as a choice—and a positive one at that. "Acknowledge that these foods don't work for you and the health goals that are important to you," Cederquist says. How To Lose Weight Fast For Men Over 40 (In 6 Easy Steps)
The secret to Katy Perry's "California Gurl" body? Mushrooms. With the M-Plan diet, Perry eats a mushroom-packed lunch or dinner every day for 14 days, then watches the pounds slip off. Great for removing unwanted bulk from problem areas like the stomach and thighs, the program still allows the dieter to retain her womanly shape—the mushroom meal plan won't effect the bust. How I lost 50 lbs at 47 years old | My Weight Loss Journey
Celebrities who say they're eating more veggies, fewer processed foods, or more moderate meal portions may be onto something—"that's a great idea for everyone," Dr. Seltzer says—but their diets, on the whole, might not be ideal for you. Should you look to their food logs for, say, breakfast inspo? Sure, Dr. Seltzer says. Just don't let their habits take the place of common sense—or sound medical advice.
1. Eat less added sugar, processed food and refined grains (white bread, bagels, pasta, white rice, you know the drill). A lot less. According to the sugar science department at UCSF, added sugar is hiding in 74% of all packaged food. And, the majority of carbohydrates in the typical American diet is made of refined grains. This means reading labels folks and knowing how many different names there are for sugar. Just because it’s called “agave nectar” or “cane juice crystals” doesn’t mean it’s any better for you than the white granulated stuff. Your body doesn’t know the difference and once you eat it, it’s all the same to your pancreas (the organ that produces insulin in response to sugar). Click this link to see 61 different names of sugar then run to your pantry and read the ingredients on your packaged food. Prepare for a rude awakening! Tips To Boost Your Metabolism After 40 | Marlo Thomas
While using it for treatment in the context of a medical facility appears to be safe and effective (when used correctly), the evidence for using activated charcoal as a health and diet aid is sketchy at best. In fact, it has been shown that activated charcoal can interfere with certain medications, and slow, or even completely prevent nutrients from being absorbed from your gut. Consuming it in small amounts is fine, but the side effects of consuming too much include black stools, vomiting, diarrhea and/or constipation, and a black tongue and lips; a look that will undoubtedly be on display at the next Yeezy fashion show.
In your 20s and 30s, you may have been able to lose weight with a walking program or simply by staying more active during the day. But in your 40s, losing weight takes smarter planning. You need three types of exercise to slim down, tone up and stay healthy. Make sure you incorporate cardiovascular exercise, strength training and stretching into your weekly program. Each type of exercise provides unique weight loss benefits.
What does that mean for you? That the weight loss process naturally becomes harder as you get older...that's just a fact and accepting it means you can stop punishing yourself or feeling ashamed about your body. Instead of focusing on the negative, focus on the things you can control: Your workouts, activity levels, diet, stress management, sleep management and, most important, your attitude.
Just one medium-sized carrot is bursting with 203 percent of your daily recommended vitamin A, which will help keep your skin smooth and vision as sharp as it was in your twenties! “This vegetable is orange thanks to high levels of beta-carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin A… which also happens to be a form of the main active ingredient in Retin-A (the topical ointment that helps fight dark spots, wrinkles, and acne by increasing cell turnover),” explains certified board dermatologist and Founder of Baumann Cosmetic & Research Institute Dr. Leslie Baumann.
The benefits of Greek yogurt are far and wide while making your figure tighter and slimmer. High-quality Greek yogurt is low in calories (less than 100 for 6 oz.), has a very high amount of protein (20 grams), and provides your gut with some much-needed probiotics. Flavored, non-Greek yogurts, on the other hand, are often packed with additives that harm your health and can even make you hungrier. If you’re not a Greek yogurt fan, do know that it can be an acquired taste—but mixing in some berries, walnuts, or homemade granola might just become your new, belly busting addiction!
When we don’t sleep enough, our hunger and stress hormones surge the next day, encouraging us to overeat — especially on sweet and fatty foods. The areas of our brain responsible for rational decision-making are compromised, making it much harder to say "no" to temptation. We also lose our lean muscle mass and burn less fat when we don’t sleep enough, setting us up for weight gain. Make getting 7 to 9 hours per night a priority, and watch your weight loss efforts improve dramatically. How I Lost Belly Fat In 7 Days: No Strict Diet No Workout!
According to a study in Nutrition, Metabolism & Cardiovascular Diseases, eating just two-and-a-half serving of whole grains—like pearled barley—can slash your risk of heart disease by more than 20 percent. So start your day off right with the tastiest early-morning grain: Oatmeal. For best (in other words: tastiest) results, cover it in berries and cinnamon, both of which have heart-boosting benefits.
A 2003 study demonstrated that a low-calorie diet that’s rich in almonds could help people shed weight. Not only do the good monounsaturated fats in almonds have an effect on insulin levels, say scientists, but also give dieters a feeling of fullness, meaning that they are less likely to overeat. So stock your pantry with almonds, walnuts, and nut butter. My Diet and Exercise Routine! After 40!
VB6, the term popularized by food luminary Mark Bittman, encourages eating only vegan foods and meals until 6 p.m. This translates to a higher intake of fiber-rich, plant-based foods throughout the day. (Think walnut-topped oatmeal for breakfast rather than eggs and bacon.) Considering that the average American consumes only half of the daily recommended intake of fiber, that’s a win!
Gluten-free breads and other products are fooling you with their healthy-looking labels. Studies show that gluten-free replacements of foods that normally contain the protein are not healthier than the real thing — and they’re more expensive. Often, these breads have significantly less fiber than bread made with real whole wheat. As you get older, fiber is one of the nutrients you need the most. It keeps you full and ensures that your digestion keeps moving regularly.
Case in point: In a 10-week preliminary study led by Dr. Apovian and Dr. Westcott, baby boomers who exercised regularly and followed a moderate-calorie diet (1,200 to 1,500 calories for women; 1,500 to 1,800 for men), while simultaneously increasing their protein intake to 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight, lost nearly 5 times more weight than participants who exercised without changing their diets. They also lost 4 more pounds than exercisers who increased protein intake but didn't keep calories in check. Even better: The calorie- and protein-conscious group gained more muscle, reduced their blood pressure, and dropped 2 inches from their waists.
There’s another huge reason to cut back on bovine: “One in three men over 40 will die from heart disease, and eating more of a plant-based diet is the best way to optimize endothelial nitric oxide levels for cardiovascular protection and health,” says Kominiarek. In fact, a Mediterranean diet particularly heavy in healthy fats—olive oil, eggs, nuts, fatty fish—lowers your risk of not only heart disease, but also type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, according to a new study analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine. That’s three of the top 10 causes of death for American males that you can reduce your risk of just by eating less meat and more healthy plant-based fats.
Have a few cups of java for a metabolism boost, but if you’re never seen without a mug at your lips, that could work against you, says nutritionist Amy Shapiro. Caffeine is a natural appetite suppressant. If you’re constantly consuming it, you may not eat much—or realize how hungry you really are—until you get home for dinner. “Not eating enough throughout the day can make your metabolism sluggish,” she says. “By the time you eat dinner, instead of immediately using that food for energy, your body is aggressively storing it as fat, just in case it will be deprived again.” What's Causing Your Belly Fat After 50 and How To Lose It
“Women in their 40s come to know that, while socializing with friends is fun and rewarding, partying out late brings more burden than good,” Dr. Rosenfeld says. “They might choose to invite friends over for a quiet night in or spend their nights engaging in self care (reading, relaxing, taking a bath). Either way, they’ll get more sleep, won’t be hungover, and will face the next day energized and refreshed.” 44 Year Old Dad Bod Transformation | Lost Over 50 lbs
If you’ve never added this delicate green to your salads, now is definitely the time to start. A study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that consuming 85 grams of raw watercress (about two cups) could reduce DNA damage linked to cancer by 17 percent. What’s more, the leafy green is teeming with beta-carotene and vitamin A, two compounds essential for youthful skin. No wonder why watercress is our #1 best superfood healthier than kale!
Capsacian, a molecule found in spicy chiles, has been shown to raise body temperature and speed up fat loss — although only temporarily, and only by a small percentage. Celi says there’s also some evidence that chemicals called isothiocyanates, which are present in pungent foods like spicy mustard, wasabi, and horseradish, may help activate brown fat and speed up metabolic rate. Bloody Mary, anyone?
4. You’ve got some unwelcome guests living in your gut – our gut flora (our micro-organism friends) outnumber our own cells by 10 to 1! You could say we are just providing a home for the billions of them. I’m talking bacteria, yeast, fungus, viruses and parasites. We all have good and bad types and generally they all live happily together, but if you have too many of the bad guys through either too many antibiotics, poor diet, infection or other reasons, then they can hugely impact your weight loss efforts.

I’ll be sharing a list of 15 things that no woman who is middle-aged and older should have. But this isn’t going to be one of those judgmental lists that makes you feel bad about getting older. This list is meant to be empowering, and help you get rid of the unnecessary clutter that tends to build up over the years! As older women, we have moved into a more mature and practical stage of life, and our homes should reflect that! So get those garbage bags ready, because it’s time to clear out some clutter. :-)
Although you shouldn’t go to bed starving (that presents its own sleepytime problems), you also shouldn’t hit the sack completely stuffed. When you eat a large meal before bed, your body works to digest it long into the night — and if your body is still worked up, so are you. The later you fall asleep, the less rest you’ll get, and you’ll wake up feeling groggy and more likely to reach for calorie-dense items. We know that you’re still cool, and you’d like to eat dinner at a more fashionable hour, but supping on the earlier side could be a huge boost to your weight-loss goals. (And avoid these 30 Bad Habits That Lead to a Fat Belly!) 3 Secrets to Burn Stubborn Belly Fat Faster
Bring on the funny cat videos — they're good for your health, according to researchers. No, you won't get the same calorie-burning results as you get from your spin class, but laughing does give your metabolism a small boost. Astudy published in the International Journal of Obesity found that genuine laughter increased both energy expenditure and heart rate by 10-20 percent above resting values. Another study found that watching cat videos in particular can boost your energy level. Guess you know what you're watching on the treadmill from now on.
Recent research suggests that women on average will lose muscle mass twice as fast as men the same age, and that can make a huge difference in their ability to lose or at least maintain weight, Peeke says. Muscle is far more "metabolically active" than fat, meaning that lean, more muscular people have an easier time burning calories at rest than to people with higher proportions of body fat.
Christy is a spokesperson, nutrition and food writer and blogger for Huffington Post and others, a recipe developer and YouTube video producer. She is regularly interviewed by CTV National News, CBC, The Globe and Mail and many more on nutrition and health. She has her finger on the pulse of the latest nutrition and food science and trends, and synthesizes and prioritizes it just for you.
Experts agree that including a weekly cheat meal into your healthy-eating plan can actually help you reach your weight loss goals. Having a strategy is key: “By planning your cheat meal, you know what you’ll be eating and can cut a few extra calories earlier in the day,” says Jim White, RD, ACSM Health Fitness Specialist and owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios. “This also allows you to really pick a favorite food instead of wasting calories on something you didn’t enjoy.” Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN, Real Nutrition NYC, gives similar advice. “Pick your poison. If you’re going out, pick your splurge. Are you going to dig into carbs like a bread basket or pasta or dessert? Or are you planning on tossing back a few cocktails?” She urges cheaters to avoid consuming all three of those common categories in one sitting. “Focus only on one,” she says, adding that by saving the others for another time you can “enjoy without going overboard.”
The truth: The diet is based on the misleading idea that you can change your blood pH with food. While the pH of the stomach is acidic, the blood is slightly alkaline, something the food you eat can't change. Still, one positive part of the diet is that it advocates eating more fruits and veggies, something most dietitians agree we should all be doing.
Fred Cannon – you may want to check your form while doing squats. If your knees are going past your toes, you are putting a load on your knees that they’re not meant to bear in that position, and will cause knee problems. Try using a mirror and focus on pushing your butt back and down. This will keep your knees behind your toes, and prevent you from going past 45 degrees.
Evolution is a slow and gradual process. Since the typical modern diet does not resemble the diet humans have followed for the majority of history, our metabolisms are designed to work best on a “feast or famine” schedule. Our bodies store fat when food is plentiful, and burn it off in times of scarcity. Since most Americans do not experience periods of fasting, we retain that body fat and gain weight. Because of this, intermittent fasting is a very effective way to lose weight. Not only will our bodies burn off fat stores while we fast, but fasting has also been shown to reduce inflammation in the body, speed up metabolism, reduce blood pressure, and lower risks for type 2 diabetes. How I Lost 30 lbs. Clean Eating & Walking!
It’s no surprise that Victoria Secret models follow some strict diets, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is no exception. She follows a plan by Dr. Nigma Talib, who practices naturopathy, which is a system of treatment that focuses on diets, herbs, vitamins, and natural agents to heal, rather than surgery and prescription drugs. Dr. Talib doesn’t let you have sugar, dairy, gluten, or alcohol.
On game day, dinner is always the same in the Curry household. “We have pasta, and I make the same sauce every time,” Ayesha said of her go-to gravy from her cookbook, The Seasoned Life, made with San Marzano tomatoes and her own herbs and seasonings. “We’ll switch out the protein sometimes—ground chicken, ground turkey, ground beef, sometimes straight-up vegetarian—but, for Stephen, it’s all about the carbs. It’s just getting that pasta in.”
I'm on the cusp of my fiftieth birthday. My forties have been hard, as reality and gravity collided with me in the middle. But they've also been THE most clarifying and freeing decade of my life. As I look to my future, I fully expect the years to come to be full of wonder. But these last ten years have been lonely too. I've found the voices of women to be somewhat hushed in my middle-ages. It's tempting to sit down quietly in a culture that feeds on youth, as if we have nothing valuable to say.
Thinking about having a cocktail — or two — before dinner? Think again. Having a drink before a meal causes people to eat around 200 calories more, several studies show. Drinking with dinner isn't such a good idea either: Other research has found that the body burns off alcohol first, meaning that the calories in the rest of the meal are more likely to be stored as fat. If you do have a cocktail craving, stick to wine, which packs only 80 calories a glass — or minimize the calories by drinking a white-wine spritzer (two ounces of wine mixed with two ounces of seltzer). How to start a healthly lifesyle and lose weight after 40 I Get fit and healthy
There appears to be a connection between estrogen and body weight regulation. With lower estrogen levels, lab animals tend to eat more and be less physically active. Levels that are too high or too low appear to lead to fat storage. And, lower estrogen levels may also slow down your metabolic rate (the speed at your body converts stored energy into working energy). Exercise for Women Over 40 - The Key Exercises for Women
Whether due to the night-waking of young children or hot flashes from the onset of perimenopause, middle-age is when sleep quality goes downhill for many women. Lack of sleep has long been linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes, because it’s harder for the body to regulate glucose leading to something called insulin resistance, which can cause weight gain.
Muscle burns more calories than fat. So will building more muscle not boost your metabolism? Yes, but only by a small amount. Most regular exercisers only gain a few pounds (kilograms) of muscle. That is not enough to make a big difference in the number of calories you burn. Plus, when not in active use, muscles burn very few calories. Most of the time, your brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs account for most of your metabolism.
If you’re having trouble losing weight after your 40th, it’s time to ask your doctor about a thyroid screening. Women are more likely to develop thyroid health issues than their male counterparts, which can lead to symptoms like weight gain, fatigue, and depression. Fortunately, for many people, the problem can be fixed with medication and dietary modification, getting you back on track to the body you want in no time.
Thanks for the response, Abel! I do consume homemade bone broth, but until recently it wasn’t on a daily basis. I would make it and use it up, then maybe wait a week or two before making the next batch. Now I’m making it every few days so I always have it on hand and drink some everyday or make a soup with it that I have a bowl or two of everyday. Probably too soon to realize the full benefits yet. I do use bulletproof collagen in my smoothies also, although I will probably be switching to Dr. Axe’s collagen powder for reasons I won’t go into here.
Not everyone relishes the idea of getting older, but if you’re experiencing serious blues you just can’t shake, you could be putting yourself at risk for pounds you can’t shake, either. Research published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a link between depression and severe obesity, particularly among women, but found that weight loss improved mental health outcomes, potentially breaking you out of this vicious cycle for good. Start on the path toward a happier you today by kicking the 20 Foods That Put You in a Bad Mood off your menu.
Conclusion: I wouldn’t recommend exclusively eating smoked salmon and capers any longer than one day, as scurvy is a very real and serious affliction (you know, among other things). But if you love smoked salmon and capers and want to get your lifetime supply of Omega-3s in one fell swoop, this diet plan is for you. Just make sure you don’t have any plans to socialize during the day because it’s sort of awkward to bring a pack of smoked salmon along on, say, a date. Awkward, yes … but not unheard of. Another story for another time.
Despite her culinary chops, the Barefoot Contessa star keeps it simple in the mornings. “I’ve had the same thing for breakfast every single day for ten years: coffee and McCann’s quick-cooking Irish oatmeal,” she said. Other staples in her kitchen include “a bowl of lemons on the counter (and other citrus), butter, eggs, Parmesan cheese, and chocolate.”
Our bodies need dietary fat—particularly healthy oils—in order to lose weight and function properly. The right kinds of fats and oils help quash hunger, maximize your metabolism, and speed nutrients through your body. Healthy monounsaturated fats like olive oil can actually help the body to burn calories. Extra virgin olive oil may also increase blood levels of serotonin, a hormone associated with satiety. Plus, olive oil is also loaded with polyphenols, antioxidants that help battle many diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis and brain deterioration.
While most Americans consume plenty of protein, research shows that some women begin skimping on the muscle-sustaining nutrient as they age, consuming less than the RDA. Calorie-conscious dieters also tend to cut back on protein, when they should be doing the opposite. "Cutting back causes your body to rob your muscles for energy, leaving you thinner but also flabbier and weaker," says Dr. Apovian. "Not only does losing muscle make your clothing fit poorly, but you begin to burn fewer calories, so even if you're eating the same amount, you can easily regain the weight you shed." Having less muscle mass also makes you weaker, making it harder to do simple activities, so you become more inclined to crash on the couch. Eventually, the scale climbs back up and you start all over again, chipping away at muscle mass and putting the chill on your metabolism with each diet you try.
A good chunk of the canned soups sitting on supermarket shelves can pack in a half day’s worth of sodium as well as additives such as appetite-spiking MSG. Instead, opt for meal prepping your own soup at home with grass-fed bone broth and store leftovers for easy use. “When we ingest bone broth, it acts as an intestinal Band-Aid, protecting and healing the lining of the digestive tract which aids digestion and helps us absorb extra nutrients from the foods we eat,” nutritionist Lauren Slayton, MS, RD tells us. Not to mention, bone broth is chock-full-of collagen, which helps turn back the clock on our skin.
Whether it’s eating well, exercising, or going to therapy, the sooner you start working on yourself in a healthy way, the better. But you should enjoy where you’re at, too. It’s cool to love your body and your brain, so start now. The flaws you think you have will not be a big deal to you one day very soon, so enjoy yourself. Get naked. Every woman had a different idea of caring for your body looks like, from yoga to vegetables, but they all seemed to agree that you should protect your skin:
You could say one of Oprah's favorite things is the diet she follows from Weight Watchers, which U.S. News ranks No. 1 for weight loss. Joan Salge Blake, a registered dietitian in Boston and author of "Nutrition & You," picks Oprah as a diet "celebrity crush" because Oprah achieved her 40-pound weight loss while enjoying an eating pattern and lifestyle that contains less sugar and heart-unhealthy saturated fat, and more fruits and veggies, movement and mindfulness. Unlike most celebrity-endorsed diet programs, Salge Blake points out that Weight Watchers is reasonably affordable. But if Weight Watchers is still more than you'd like to spend to trim pounds, try logging on to MyPlate.gov for a free weight-reducing diet you can tailor to your needs. 4 Steps To A Flat Belly After 40
To clarify, we’re not betting that all the marinaras in the pasta aisle should be avoided like the plague—just some. Processed pasta sauces may contain tomatoes or tomato paste as the first ingredient, but oftentimes, these sneaky saboteurs also contain loads of inflammatory oils, added sugar, and salt. And alfredo sauce is no exception: the creamy white stuff can contain around 20 grams of fat per half-cup serving—an excessive amount to ingest in one sitting.
This fad diet reminds many of Atkins — and if you want to live life like Kate Middleton’s sister, you should certainly try it. Healthline explains Dr. Pierre Dukan, a French general practitioner, created the diet. It consists of meals that are high-protein and low-carb. There are also four phases of the diet: The first two are when you’ll lose the most weight, and the last two are designed for the long-term maintenance of your goal weight.
Beyoncé is reportedly a fan of the Master Cleanse diet, also sometimes referred to (appropriately in this case) as the Lemonade diet. The Master Cleanse is essentially an all-liquid diet that at its core basically consists of lemonade, salt water, and a laxative herbal tea. If it sounds too good to be true, that's likely because it is. Proponents of the diet claim that it's a panacea for all that ails you; you'll lose weight, feel energetic, and lose your cravings for unhealthy food. The Best Ways For Men Over 40 To Lose Belly Fat
Pull-ups require a lot of control, and they’re highly effective for building muscle and strength in the upper body — something that diminishes as we age. Pull-ups simultaneously engage the back, shoulders and arms, and by building those three large muscle areas, you’ll help keep your metabolism stoked for years to come. “Another great thing about pull-ups is that they can be done in many different variations, which work different muscles,” says Jim White. Speaking of muscles, don’t miss these 30 Best Proteins for Your Penis!
Seeing as Jenny McCarthy began her career modelling nude for Playboy in 1993 and won playmate of the year, it’s no surprise she is still as sexy as ever at 45. She has gone on the act in BASEketball, Diamonds and Scream 3. The mother of one is also a former co-host of The View and became an autism ambassador after her son was diagnosed with the condition.
If you want to weigh less, you’ve got to eat less, right? Well, if you take in too few calories, it can cause your body to lose muscle mass, which will decrease the rate of your metabolism. Plus, when you skimp on calories, your body slows the rate at which is burns calories to conserve the fuel it’s got. “Under-fueling is just as risky as over-fueling,” explains Carolyn Brown, MS RD at Foodtrainers in Manhattan. Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN agrees: “In an attempt for quick, noticeable weight loss, many people wrongfully believe that eating as few calories as possible is the best solution. Not only can this lead to numerous nutritional deficiencies as the body is getting less food overall, it can actually have the opposite effect on weight loss.” Instead of cutting calories like crazy, use the simple diet and exercise hacks below that can help you slim down quickly and safely without screwing up your metabolism.
Unless you’re spiking your home-baked goods with hidden veggies and swapping sugar for stevia, you should actively avoid these sweets. Store-bought muffins and cupcakes make our list of foods that age you because they can contain a full day’s worth of added sugar—and the effects of the sweet stuff on aging are quite bitter. A report in Clinics in Dermatology states that glucose and fructose can compromise the collagen and elastin that support your skin’s elasticity, so avoiding baked goods with added sugars is a sure-fire way to keep wrinkles at bay. What's Causing Your Belly Fat After 50 and How To Lose It
Once you reach age 40, the weight-loss tactics you used in your 20s seem to stop working. You can no longer refuse dessert and fit in extra workout once a week to effortlessly drop a few extra pounds. Even if you make every effort to eat healthfully and exercise when possible, the number on your scale keeps climbing. Weight loss over age 40 still responds to eating fewer calories than you burn, but hormones, life's obligations and natural muscle loss makes this equation harder to achieve. Quick weight-loss efforts only backfire as they fail to teach you how to sustain any weight loss and endanger your energy and health. Stick to the safe rate of losing 1 to 2 pounds per week to get your weight on track.
"At age 40 to maintain your weight, that is to not gain weight, you're going to have to eat 100 calories less a day, and that has nothing to do with anything other than the natural course of aging. That means your resting metabolic rate," Madelyn Fernstrom, PhD, director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Weight Management Center and associate director of the UPMC Nutrition Center in Pittsburgh, tells WebMD.
This diet, created by trainer-to-the-stars Tracy Anderson, has reportedly been tried by the likes of Jennifer Aniston and Lady Gaga. The gist of the 7-day eating plan? Eat jarred baby food for breakfast and lunch, followed by a low-calorie dinner. Anderson cites this as a way to “eliminate toxins”—a red flag because the body naturally expels toxins. This is nothing more than a short-term crash diet that is very low in calories and nutrients. Lose 10 Pounds This Month: Food to Eat, Exercise to Do, Thoughts to Think
I was the type of person who up until my late 30s could eat whatever I wanted and never work out and rarely gained a pound. If I wanted to “loose” weight meaning the five pounds of holiday weight I had put on all I had to do was start exercising doing some cardio and it fell off. Then all the sudden that stopped and now I am 20 pounds over weight and almost 41 years old and the only way for me to loose weight is to starve. I have been tested for medical conditions, I do not take any medications. I have been to a nutritionist, several actually. I have revamped my diet, I have done weight watchers, I hired a trainer and I work out 6 days a week. I have been told work out less you will be less hungry, did that nada. Cut carbs, cut diary, tried that too. The conclusion I have come to is that due to my small frame (I am only 5’1) I have to work out daily and not eat more than 1200 calories a day if I want to lose weight. I cannot do that, it makes me utterly miserable and angry. I had my metabolism tested via one of those breathing machines and it was so slow. Doctors will never admit that anyone should eat less than 1200 but my doctor looked at me and basically said 1200 is the maximum you can eat. I have never yo yo dieted, in fact I was never on a diet until I was 38, never needed to be. My Mom had the same exact thing happen to her. At this point I have two choices, be miserable and hungry all of the time, or be 20 pounds over weight and be happy, I chose the latter. Trying to live and eat 1200 calories a day every single day, is not reasonable and is a recipe for failure. I compare this to men who don’t want to admit that as they age they need Viagra. All of them say oh no I have sex like a 20 year old, no you don’t. And they don’t talk about their struggles with each other they just boast. For women I think we may just need to accept that extra 20 pounds that comes along with age, rather than fighting a loosing battle and being miserable.
In your 20s and 30s, you may have been able to lose weight with a walking program or simply by staying more active during the day. But in your 40s, losing weight takes smarter planning. You need three types of exercise to slim down, tone up and stay healthy. Make sure you incorporate cardiovascular exercise, strength training and stretching into your weekly program. Each type of exercise provides unique weight loss benefits. Nutrition for Women After 40
At the height of Billy Bob Thornton’s career, rumors swirled about his crazy lifestyle. Aside from the gossip about his taste for blood, the story that he only ate orange food was one of the oddest. A vegan with allergies to dairy, wheat and shellfish, Thornton’s skin reportedly turned orange because of all the carrots he consumed. He says it all started when his papaya breakfast fascination set the press in a tailspin. “I eat papaya every morning -- it's orange. It's not all I have all day, but it is orange.” Glad he cleared that up. How to Lose Weight for Men over Forty - It's 80% this...
The 36-year-old model's body is so incredible, she's logged camera time for Victoria's Secret and Sport's Illustrated Swim. And her tip for keeping her diet in check is kind of genius: She keeps her bod on display at all times. "Eating smart is all about having an awareness of your body," she explained to Women's Health in 2012. "The most obvious way to do that is by seeing it. So when you're trying to lose weight, spend more time wearing less. I don't think I could eat a plate of nachos naked—could you?"
Before you try anything else, make sure there isn’t an underlying factor interfering with your weight loss, like a thyroid condition. Did you know that nearly 1 in 5 adults over 40 suffer from thyroid problems that can interfere with weight loss? Your thyroid is the main regulator of your body’s metabolism, so having an over or under-active thyroid gland (hyper or hypothyroidism) can truly interfere with weight loss. Talk to your doctor if you’re having trouble losing weight and also experiencing any of the following symptoms of a thyroid disorder:
For Brenda (and many of my patients), this high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet helped reset her insulin, estrogen, and other hormones. She lost weight, felt better, dialed down her hot flashes, and on her third visit seemed thrilled that finally she was back in the mood again. Especially for menopausal patients, I’ve found these nine hacks help optimally transition into this effective diet:
High amounts of sodium can lead to belly bloating and there’s a good chance you are already getting more sodium than you need. (Psst! Get rid of bloating, fast, with these 24 Ways to Shrink Your Belly in 24 Hours.) To cut back on salt intake, Alexandra Miller, RDN, LDN, Corporate Dietitian at Medifast says to eat fewer processed foods like bread, pizza, and condiments. “Read the Nutrition Facts label to find how much sodium is in each serving,” she says. “Very Low Sodium is 35 milligrams or less per serving; Low-Sodium is 140 milligrams or less per serving; Reduced (or less) sodium is at least 25 percent less sodium per serving than the usual sodium level.” Beat Menopause Belly Fat by Starving Your Fat Cells (Not Yourself)
Jillian Michaels, of former Biggest Loser glory, is not a fan of elimination diets and encourages people to follow an 80/20 nutrition lifestyle – 80 percent of the time focused on healthy eating and 20 percent of the time taking a more relaxed, moderate approach. Brynn McDowell, a registered dietitian and owner of The Domestic Dietitian, points out that Michaels gives tips on her blog for people who are looking to develop a healthy relationship with food and encourages people to take the time to educate themselves about what's in the foods they eat. McDowell appreciates that Michaels encourages people to read the nutrition facts panel on packages and to stick to foods with short ingredients lists. Michaels advocates for packing your lunch to alleviate the difficulty of choosing foods from restaurant menus while saving money at the same time.
Note: A English relative and Dr said to have my Testosterone checked. It never occurred to me to do that. He said getting that boosted would be like taking steroids and renew my motivation and energy to 25-30 yr old levels. So that's first, and cut out the beer ;)…. Oh, Doc said Coconut oil has been found to be bad, loaded with bad fats, the kind that raise the bad cholesterol, LDL. So that's out. Any other direction or guidance would be appreciated. Like healthy cooking/eating, getting some pork and fish in there, etc.

How My Day Went: An essential part of my morning is coffee and eggs. I will never, EVER be one of those people who is “never really hungry in the morning” or “always skips breakfast.” No matter how much I eat the night before, I wake up starving … and angry, and coffee and eggs are the only way to make it better. Breakfast is everything to me. Which is why prepping myself a caffeine-free, egg-free meal of hot water and lemon was … disappointing. But the taste was surprisingly pleasant, and the concoction did keep me fuller longer than I’d expected. I felt less of an impulse to snack mindlessly throughout the day. Losing Weight After 40 - Super Effective Tips!
As we age, we tend to become more insulin resistant which can put us at risk for type 2 diabetes. When you eat foods that break down into sugar, the pancreas pumps out insulin to escort the sugar out of your blood. People with Insulin resistance don’t use insulin effectively so that cells have trouble absorbing sugar which causes a buildup of sugar and insulin in the blood. Researchers still aren’t 100% in agreement as to why, but at the end of the day, people with insulin resistance gain weight, particularly around the middle. And some research shows that lack of estrogen may cause insulin resistance.
“As people get closer to menopause, their quality of sleep deteriorates,” explains LeVeque. “Making sure you're getting seven to eight hours of sleep guarantees your hunger hormones are regulated. One poor night's sleep can increase the hunger hormone, grehlin, and decrease the satiety hormone, leptin, by about 15 percent for both.” Translation: If you have a 15 percent increase in hunger and a 15 percent decrease in satiety, a clean eating plan can be super difficult to stick to day to day (sleep-induced food cravings are real, people). So, make sure you adhere to a reliable sleep schedule to avoid any food binges caused by exhaustion.
Even when you’re at rest, your body is constantly burning calories. In fact, 75 percent of the calories that you burn each day are being used up just keeping you alive. “Resting metabolic rate” is much higher in people with more muscle, because every pound of muscle uses about 6 calories a day just to sustain itself. If you can pack on just five pounds of muscle and sustain it, you’ll burn the caloric equivalent of three pounds of fat over the course of a year. Workout Advice for Older Men (STARTING AT AGE 15!!)
Slimming down over 40 doesn’t have to mean meager meals. In fact, eating a big breakfast might just help you reach those goals. In fact, a 2013 study reveals that women who ate the bulk of their calories at breakfast lost more than twice as much weight as those who had the majority of their calories later in the day. And for more health news, check out the 30 Weirdest Things You Do in Your Sleep.
In addition to being low calorie, baby food is also low in additives and preservatives, and comes in very portion-controlled, infant-sized jars. From a health standpoint, one could do a lot worse. However, be prepared to get some pretty funny looks from your fellow human beings.  As Jim White, a registered dietician with the American Dietetic Association told The Huffington Post, "Who wants to eat baby food 14 times a day? We’ve got to enjoy ourselves too, and chew our food. It’s just not livable, unless you’re in a retirement home."

The cabbage soup diet? Really? Just no. Restricting calories and losing body fat too quickly can wreak havoc on insulin, leptin, ghrelin and other hormones, prompting a surge in hunger and a slump in metabolism. These effects can last for more than a year, even after the diet is abandoned, according to a 2011 study in the New England Journal of Medicine. Yo-yo diets also prompt decline in dopamine, which means you’re left feeling unmotivated and sluggish. Make sure you’re not also guilty of any of these 25 Things You Do That Slow Your Metabolism.
The smoothies are made from a combo of fruit, nonfat Greek yogurt and milk, and a few nuts, and they run about 300 calories. Snacks can be cut vegetables and a handful of almonds or whole-grain crackers with 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. In reality, the daily calories are slightly low for this to be a safe plan, and there’s not enough protein or whole grains on the plan.

Re-Roofing - Zimmermans Construction will tear off and remove slate, cedar-shakes, metal, asphalt, rubber and rolled roofing. We use the Equipter Roofer?s Buggy wherever possible to protect your lawn and expensive landscaping. ZC will completely clean up and dispose of all removed material. Our goal is to leave the property looking exactly the same as when we arrived.
Underlayment - We use only heavyweight (30 lb.) felt paper, or a high-quality synthetic underlayment. Ice and Water-shield is applied on all bottom-edges and gable-ends. Applying the Ice and Water-shield helps better seal the gable-ends and protects against ice-dams above the gutters.
The New Roof - We will install and warranty a copper, asphalt, cedar, rubber, slate or steel roof. A five-year workmanship warranty is standard on all GAF-Elk shingles, 7/8" cedar shakes, metal, and rubber roofs. A 10-year workmanship warranty option is available. This warranty means that if your roof leaks because of our mistake within five years, we will correct it free of charge.
Comparing Roofing Companies - You dont' have to look long to realize there are a large number of roofing companies in Lancaster. Roofing in Lebanon PA and Roofing in Lancaster PA has become a competitive industry. Homeowners in small towns like Manheim, Mount Joy, Lititz and E-town have plenty of roofers to choose from. When selecting a roofing company, make sure they are fully insured and stand behind their work. Check their references and find our how long they have been doing roofing. You will find Zimmerman's Construction to be a quality and reputable roofing company.

Lighter than regular paper, bends around corners and easy to apply, no raised surface (like regular paper), gives the look of hand-painted art and is sturdy, unlike store-bought tissue paper or napkins. It is semi-opaque and looks great on light colored surfaces. Terrific on wood, terra-cotta, clay, metal, jewelry, glass, and resin.
This a thin self-adhesive clear mylar. The color in the background will show through. Looks great on metallic & light colored surfaces, jewelry, candles, paper, cardstock, glass...and so much more. Easy to use, cut, peel, paste.
Ultra Heavy at 110LB this cardstock is great for 3D decoupages, card making, jewelry, scrapbooks, and all your arts and crafts that require a heavy weight paper.
A new addition to our line. White sticker sheets are a bright white thin semi-gloss sheet. Wonderful on all applications; decoupage, cards, paper, wood, scrapbooks, glass.... just about any surface. Easy to use, cut, peel, paste.

I had been meaning to see if I could share this video from a speaking engagement I did this fall with several other women. Some of you may have already seen it, since it was up briefly this fall, but it’s back up. It’s the last day of the year and with a million things to do, blogging is not on the list but for some reason I was lead to share this. Happy New Year!
Thank you for sharing that. I must have missed it the first time you posted it. Either way, very poignant speech and “letting it rip” is definitely something I need to work on. Also, thank you for all of your posts throughout this year and years past. As a 28 year old Black woman (from a working class family also) I really identify with you as a person, your posts and the spirit behind your posts. You are truly an inspiration (and kind of like a big sis in my head : ) Thanks again and may 2012 bring you and your family an abundance of blessings!

Although the hair vendors who sell synthetic hair on AliExpress are much fewer than the ones who sell human hair on AliExpress, it doesn’t mean the demand for synthetic hair is few. Sometimes we don’t have enough time to do a fancy hairstyle with our own natural hair. Sometimes we don’t want to spend that much money on human hair bundles since we may only need an already-done styled wig to attend a special and occasional event. Some times we just want to try the hairstyle because of our changeable mood.
Most AliExpress synthetic hair vendors mainly sell hair extensions and only sell a few synthetic hair wigs to enrich their product lines. To satisfy the girls who are interested in synthetic hair wigs instead synthetic hair extensions, I made this list, Best AliExpress Synthetic Wig Vendors.
All AliExpress hair vendors in the below list are focusing on supplying various styles of synthetic hair wigs.

Britain’s countryside is amazing. Those of you who think it’s all about sheep, cows and bulls are in for a big surprise. Enormous areas of countryside are set aside as national parks that can be enjoyed by anyone who likes to get out into the fresh air. So far, Britain’s national parks are free to enter, unlike many other countries. Some of the national parks are seriously big, so don’t for a minute believe that you will cover them in a day. The largest of the parks is the Cairngorms in Scotland – a gigantic 1,748 miles and home to Scotland’s six highest mountains ..and you don’t need to be a climber to enjoy it’s many other treasures.
At the other end of the scale is The Broads in Norfolk and Suffolk and just 117 miles. It’s a wetlands and inland waterway and has long been a very popular holiday boating destination. There are lots of holiday cottages and pine lodges to rent for a short or longer stay in national parks.
Each park has it’s own character so one is bound to appeal to you more than another. Unlike in other countries, the boundaries of our national parks often include towns and villages – surely wonderful news for all of you rookie countryside explorers who feel that you’ll need the occasional whiff of concrete and asphalt to feel at home!
Admittedly, most of the national parks are in the northern half of Great Britain, but by no means all, the west country and south also have their gems.
In the south there’s the South Downs National Park that only came into being in 2010 and is already drawing more people than any of the other longer established parks. I think this is partly because it’s a mere hour’s journey from London. A full 631 square miles of coastline, hills, heath, grasslands and woods awaits you all.
Spend a day visiting the lovely Kingley Vale National Reserve with it’s 500 plus year twisted Yew trees; some an amazing five meters in diameter. Not only will you get a chance to breath good clean air but you’ll go home believing that depression is just a part of the US’s late 20’s to early 40’s history!.
If you’re a fan Barbara Erskine’s book Daughters of Fire, get a better idea of how her heroine, Queen Cartimandua lived by taking a look at one of the many Celtic Iron Age hill forts in the South Downs National Park: Chanctonbury Ring and Devil’s Dyke are but two.
Find more hill forts in the Northumberland National Park. It’s on the boundaries of England and Scotland and has the additional attraction of Hadrian’s Wall. Take a walk along a section of it’s scenic 73 miles and transport yourself back to AD 120.
As the name implies it’s the home of Snowdon (3,560 feet) the highest mountain peak in England and Wales. But you don’t need to be an experienced climber to get to stand on the summit. Nowadays, it’s the Snowdon Mountain Railway (only rack and pinion railway in UK) that takes the strain of the 4 mile journey.
Enjoy the park’s many beautiful lakes and waterfalls. Here as everywhere in Wales there are castles and steam railways, the latter much beloved by the Welsh. Do take the scenic ride on the Bala Lake Steam Railways – it’s a lovely 9 mile trip.
Wherever you go in the countryside you just have to sample the local food. The best way to do this is to look out for farmers markets. But be warned you’ll start off just buying for the afternoon’s picnic and finish up filling the car with sumptuous fresh delicacies to take back to your holiday cottage!
If you walk just one forest let it be old Willie the Conqueror’s old hunting ground, the new forest now the New Forest National Park. It’s just 90 minutes from London and there are 219 square miles to explore.
You can do it on foot or on a bike without any fear of being mowed down by a car. Just look out for the New Forest’s own breed of ponies and the deer, cattle and pigs that still roam the forest. Alternatively hire a horse and cover the ground like William did while hunting deer and wild boar. I can’t guarantee you’ll go home with a wild boar but you’ll definitely not be bored.
It’s also worth having a look at some of the villages that fall within the boundaries of the park. Buckler’s Hard is a good one if you’re interested in marine history. Back in the 18th century this is where the ships for Admiral Lord Nelson’s fleet were constructed, using great oaks from the New Forest. There’s even an interesting museum for you to wander around.
If you’re a night owl, you can still enjoy the attractions of a national park. Exmoor National Park’s dark skies have earned it the official title of Europe’s first International Dark Sky Reserve. So professional stargazers and rookies alike grab your telescope or binoculars and get out into the cool night air and enjoy a totally free starlight display. Stay over in the area for a few days and visit the park’s lovely wooded valleys and moors and earn yourselves a traditional west country cream tea.
See I wasn’t talking a lot of old bull when I said the countryside was more than a few cows, bulls and sheep.

The following are examples of my approach to adapt some of my favorite poems from Stephen Crane's Black Riders and Other Lines into comics form. The plan now is to publish these ten poems as a book along with the strip Wakefulness by way of a comics preface, with an eye towards someday illustrating/adapting Crane's entire book (for a decent wage). These works and this impulse were born out of a personal time of both darkness, light, and transformation. I mean, what isn't? But I hatched many of these lines while surfing a particularly turbulent personal tsunami. Enjoy these now; I may take them down as the print version nears fruition, but, either way, here's a peek behind the curtain...

A remarkable number of the archeological sites on La Palma line up with astronomical calendar events: particularly sunrise or sunset at the solstice or equinox, and the rising and setting of the star Canopus. In 2013 I went with a group of friends to one of these sites to see the sun rise behind the highest point of the island, the Roque de Los Muchachos. It meant an early start, but it was well worth it. (From the observatory heliports, take the footpath market “Puntagorda”)

Hi….so 2015 didn’t end as I had hoped. A bladder infection kept us HOME on NYE. I was so bummed that we had to cancel our BIG plans….
#6- AND…this Year’s theme is “twothousandsexteen!” meaning, my goal is to be sexy and enjoy some a lot of good sex this year!!
Just got back from a 44 min hike around our land with Travis and little Cuji– all of us needed the fresh air and a bit of exercise…crazy how the same run can be done in about 15 mins. That’s why I don’t walk/hike more, I like to go FASTER, HA!!
Feeling about the same as I did yesterday– the bladder is still a bit sore, my kidneys ache and now the effects from CIPRO are coming on. Typically that means headache, itchy skin, overall body aches and my eyes feel really dry. Anyhow, 4 more days and I’ll be off it.
Were you are like me and have found that starting the NEW YEAR on a long holiday weekend was less than ideal timing to stay on track with diet and exercise??
AND, now that Monday is here the MOJO is still not anywhere?? Well, suck it up buttercup, get moving and FORCE that Mojo to rise!
1- MOVE– do what I call “1 min Mojo” sessions. Just get moving for even 1 min to feel your mental and physical motivation rise. Examples: march in place, do a set of push ups, hop on one foot (30sec each), walk up and down a flight of stairs 3 times, walk outside to get the mail, shadow box, etc…
2- LISTEN– listen to an upbeat song or one with a great message! Feel free to even sing along. A few great ones I love:
3- READ– read an article or part of a book about how to get motivated or how to workout. Seriously I have a shelf full of fitness, diet, exercise books and reading just a few pages about how my body works fires me up! Google it, read it and get motivated. Try these articles:
Hi Ya!! First off thanks so much for your effort to JOURNAL so far this year!! I just love reading your posts! The workouts inspire me to get mine done and your thoughts are so inspiring, you are full of HOPE for the year to come, I just love it!! thanks for sharing!!
My day was spent in “recovery” mode…I slept in and rested in bed most of the day. Much like the last 4 days, but today I actually felt better while doing it.
I just now finished a 20 min easier than normal interval run and some stretching. It was good to shake off the dust and sweat a bit.
I’ve been researching some cleanses and think that in a couple weeks I’ll be up to doing one. I also tried to get a Dr. Appt, but it’s been over 3 years since my last visit to him so I have to get a new referral in first. So, I’ll work on that more tomorrow.
Tomorrow, I have got to get some cleaning done around the house and make progress on getting Gracie’s room painted. PLUS, get in a workout at some point. MY goals for the next 30 days are a daily workout, to eat 2 green veggies daily and a carrot. Carrots are a GREAT veggie for me!!
Tomato soup– only about 1/4 cup with about 4 crackers, I was craving sweets and this was my choice– it was sweet!
So…for days 1-3 I’ve improved, but need to get more focused. I have an issue, I flounder in my eating when I DO NOT workout very hard. I’ve been working out at about 50% this week, so my eats reflect that. I’ll do better on my eating as I feel better and as I can get in normal workouts.
Hey ladies, I am certainly feeling better each day. Today, I’ve been up and moving more– I just finished a short workout. Filmed this little silly video for you– (should be done loading soon)
Plus did 3 sets of squats 10 reps at 135, a bunch of body weight stuff, some more bouncing, biking and knee extensions. It was not super intense, but good for me today.
I got some cleaning done, but not nearly as much as I had hoped~ Seriously I am cleaning impaired. I hate it!
I also ordered a bunch of stuff from AMAZON. Several of the supplements listed here actually http://chriskresser.com/treat-…-utis-without-drugs/
Got an appointment with my Gyno for the UTI stuff, figured he could refer me to the urologist again if he wanted.
Also, had the insurance adjuster here regarding our lightning strike and they found a separate claim in that we need a new roof– hail damage. THEN, just as I was finishing my workout the ceiling started leaking– SHEESH!
A Tiny, very weak biceps workout got done last night and shessh am I sore from it! Good to know it worked but it’s also a reminder that my body is in a state of “REPAIR” right now. Being on an antibiotic and weight training means you need to be CAREFUL! I updated my eating journal here http://www.teambuffmother.com/blog/eats-mon-wed
I started a blog post yesterday, but never finished it– it was about HUMP day, so I’ll post it next HUMP DAY, lol!
Today, I have the HVAC guy coming around 1:00…so my entire day is revolving around that. Our upstairs heater/ac hasn’t worked since the lightning strike. THE PLAN is to workout AFTER he leaves, hopefully he won’t be here all afternoon!
I had a good week despite being sick. I got in my workout even if it was TINY each day and I ate my 2 greens and a carrot each day!! BIG WINS!!
I also got my butt to the Dr. I hate going to the doctor! I feel like a hypochondriac when I go…I am seriously too in tune with my body that doctors probably think I’m a little nuts, Ha!! The Dr. gave me a refferal to the Urologist which was my goal. He also gave me a prescription for some “emergency” antibiotics for my UTI issues. Gotta have those on hand at all times! And he wants to test my thyroid, testosterone, insulin/a1c and creatinine levels, since I’ve gained 10 pounds since May.
Just a reminder that to workout, workout clothes are optional…got in a great 11min workout last night for upper body +booty and abs all in my everyday clothes, Did my workout in my jeans…as many rounds as possible in 11 mins of 10 push ups, 10 inverted pull ups and hanging hip ups…did about 7 rounds #noexcuses #noregrets#sweatpink #buffmother #motivation#UltimateResults #pullups #pushups #workoutproof
I could totally do a workout like this during a lunch break and not even break a sweat. That’s the great thing about STRENGTH TRAINING- you don’t always have to shower afterward!
Just now, Got an interval run done on treadmill…easy mins at 6.4 hard at 8, 7 total intervals 17mins was my 2 mile mark- 20 mins total for 2.3 miles….feeling much more normal! Yay!!
Weight is still same as on Jan 1 (141) despite drastically cutting calories this week, but that’s honestly a win since my activity level was so low, plus antibiotics cause toxins and water retention. I should do a set of pics and measurements this weeknd. I need a good new BAD baseline.
Now it’s time to hang with DH, watch some Football. My Alma matter NDSU is playing for the national championships again! they’ve won it for the past 4 years!! GO BISON!!
Feeling so much better the past couple days!! YAY!! I had enough energy to get my laundry folded and do dishes even! HA!!
the POA is to get back to it, with weights as my main focus. ALSO, I will keep up my running– been trying to run M, W, F or Sa each week– 3 solid runs a week– each 20 mins of intervals for the goal right now, once the weather warms up, I’ll get in some hills and sprints outside.
For the remainder of January I am committed to working out every day, eating a carrot daily + 2 greens + other foods
Been dealing with some bad GUT issues– lots of pain in my tummy so trying to get that “recovered” this week. I keep on thinking I need to go on a liquid diet, but then I get too hungry, lol!
Be sure to mark your calendars!! We are having a 10 week SuperSTAR Success CONTEST, it starts Feb 1st!!!
Run on Treadmill 2mile mark was 17:23, slower today than Saturday–my recovery had to be at 6.0 instead of 6.4 after 3rd interval, my legs were tired. Probably because I had just ran on Saturday and that day I didn’t lift prior to running. 20mins total, 7 hard mins, 2.26 miles.
I’ll add my stats to this post later, I can tell you I weighed in at my low for the year, 139.8! so nice to be under 140 again!
So…in the past 2 months, I lost muscle and gained a lot of fat. YICK! My goal is to reverse that trend in Jan. and be ready to attack our 10 week contest come FEB 1!!
I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life. Change is bound to happen when this “feeling” comes over me. Dayle’s post really hit home with me today. It’s time for me to make some DECISIONS that will lead to the change I want in my life.
I’m going to dig deep, pray and journal for the next few days, about what I truly WANT for my life in the near future. Time to CROSS THE ROAD to a better me!
One thing that I know I DO want is to feel more healthy and lean. I hate having this tummy pooch that I’ve developed the past few months. I’m also so sick of my bras not fitting~ Seriously annoying!
yesterday I rode the bike for 20 mins in the morning and got in a solid leg workout in the late afternoon.
Today will be a bit more tricky to get workouts done, I’ve got several errands on tap and am already “LATE” to get going!
LSD means Long Slow Distance…it’s a common term in the world of track. My 3.24 mile for 31:19 run is my LSD, HA! That’s a long way for me to go~ Did it outside too, first run outside in quite a while. (thinking it may have been a bit longer distance, my phone gps doesn’t seem to work on my trail and on hills)
Been very busy the past 2 days- But also feeling very excited!! I’ve had some realizations and ANSWERS to my recent discontentment with my business. I’m excited to roll out the changes!! One thing is to do more features on BUFFMOTHERs, One each week!!
Which means…I’d love to interview YOU for a feature on www.BuffMother.com!! If you are interested in sharing your story with the world, please comment and we’ll see about getting you featured!!!

Also, your success doesn’t have to be directly related to my program. All you need to be featured is a “BuffMother MINDSET!” and be female

I had a great week of workouts, got in one daily and felt like I am making progress. I feel so much more healthy this week too!! YAY for ENERGY and MOJO!! I can do better on my eating, but overall making progress there too– my weight was down to 138.8 yesterday. That’s 3 pounds off this week!
Just now I did intervals on treadmill– 2 mins at 8mph x 5, recovery of 1 min each at 6mph, all at 2% grade– 2 mile mark was 17:07 and 20 mins of 2.33mi total
Th- mish-mosh recovery lifting day…whatever isn’t sore and some extra abs Did run outside for 30 mins
I’m back up to 141 this morning, It’s a MONDAY and I’m also on cycle day 23 so holding some water is to be expected. I’ve been really HUNGRY recently~ It’s nice to feel like I have a metabolism.
Kids are off school today, got to drive them around a bit, but other than that I just need to get some work done around the house.
In other SAD news, our local Wal-Mart is closing. Now the closest grocery store will be 30 mins away! So stupid!! they opened the Wal-Mart here 2 years ago, and drove the other Grocery store in town out of business and now Wal-Mart decides to shut down this store. It’s STUPID! Corporate bologna!
What is BuffMother? is it a person, a group, a facebook page, a website, a fitness program??….Yes it is all those things, but TRULY BuffMother is a MINDSET!

HI Ya ladies, I am on cycle day 26 and boosting is on Full Boar. For me a few things happen when I am boosting.
*I become hyper focused (meaning I don’t multitask well at all and I forget to do half of my “normal” things)
Many times too, I feel very unproductive. Not this month! I am getting things done~ Did you see this new video?

I hope you’re having a great weekend!! I’m taking today off its cycle day one and wow it’s a doozy. Yesterday I went for a little hike/hunt with my husband we were doing some predator calling. The only thing we managed to call in with a bunch of crows it was crazy. There were about 30 crows circling us and crying and going nuts.
I am excited for the secret of success contest, we start in one week this week is about preparing and I have a lot of support videos on my YouTube playlist called the superstar success playlist. Those videos will be updated but the information and content is still very very helpful. Check out the week 0 ones and also there is full workout examples, too.
Today we are chilling out watching the show Peaky Blinders and also planning to watch the football games this afternoon really low key just trying to make it a true rest day.
For myself, I’ve found it very helpful to look into my past to see how best to move forward toward my goals. Honest evaluation of current habits, current mindset and current behaviors vs. those I had when I was at my best.
At the end of December I posted my blog “Obsessed”…I was determined, on fire and totally excited for what was to come in 2016~ http://www.teambuffmother.com/blog/obsessed
Yes that’s the mentality I want for this SSS contest. 70 full days of being obsessed, maybe even being a FREAK about it!!
It’s so easy for me to FORGET my resolutions. Does that ever happen to you?? I’m going to really try to keep them in the forefront of my mind this year. Certainly reviewing them monthly will help– but I’m also going to print them off and put them around my house as a reminder!
Over all I am off to a good start on them. The 6 am morning wake up thing has been a work in progress. The past 2 weeks I’ve managed to do it 3 days each. Today, as every week day I got up at 6, fed my DH and got him and the kids off to school, then went to sleep again, was having bad Period and tummy issues last night and this morning. Once I got up (at 10am), I did feel better…The plan is to do the 6am wake up the remainder of the week.
My goal for February is to figure out and stick to a strict protocol to heal up my gut, to detox with some cleanses, dig into the blood tests from the Dr. that I’ll be getting done tomorrow. Along with keeping up with doing all I know how to stay free of a UTI.
2 of the big things I started today to assist with that is NO COFFEE and NO DAIRY. Coffee because it really seems to upset my tummy and dairy because I know in the past when I’ve been strictly off it, I’ve felt so much better. Less inflamed, less toxic, less cellulite, leaner, better tummy function, etc…
Some other things I plan to implement are to make and drink bone broth and learn more about fermentation.
Fitness wise, more of the same this month– just progressing with my weight training workouts and running. I want to be sure to add in more outdoor runs, hill runs and sprints in the coming weeks. The weather forecast looks very nice so it’ll make it much easier!
Ran intervals– added in some extra warm up and extra stretching between many of them treadmill was on a total of 27 mins for 3.1mi easy mins at 6mph, hard at 8– felt much better the second half than the first half
Overall it was a good workout considering how badly my tummy was hurting last night and this morning.
Dinner is going to be left over baked chicken and something?? not sure what just yet, I left over have quiona in frig, but I ate that last night and seemed to make my tummy bad! I may go for just the chicken.
Hey ladies, I can’t believe how fast this week is flying by!! I got my hair done today, yaya!! Feel so much better!!
Just a reminder that we are starting the SSS contest on MONDAY!! Be sure to GET READY and invite your friends!
Frump? is that a word?? Let me look it up for you….Here’s a funny description from the URBAN DICTIONARY
A woman who is generally not concerned with her appearance and doesn’t make any attempt to look womanly or sexy. Frumps are very common in the Seattle area. They need not be overweight but commonly are somewhat “doughy” and are characterized by lack of makeup (except for ugly art-school or Goth-style makeup), poorly-fitted, unstylish clothing, general lack of muscle tone or a tan. They sometimes wear very bright red lipstick or substitute teacher cat-eye glass to make themselves even less appealing to men although they are not dykes. They’ll often complain loudly that they can’t find a man yet make no attempt to present themselves in a manner that might attract a man (showing skin or cleavage for instance). They might even be somewhat attractive (do-able)if they made an attempt at dressing better and wearing makeup and/or a better hairstyle.
You may be asking yourself, am I a frump?? Well, I’m not the one to judge but I challenge you to do something every day this month of February to be less frumpy! NO FRUMP FEBRUARY!
I did get up again this morning at 6, 2 days in a row…also it’s my 3rd day without any coffee!! Doing great with that, feeling good too!
Eats yesterday were weird since I was in town half the day and couldn’t stand the thought of any fast food.
Side lunges- just bodyweight, I’ve found that I’ve been neglecting my side movements a ton, can barely do this!
The workout was not as long as i wanted it to be- needed to be done to cook burgers for family, plus energy was low and back was stiff, but it was good one
Oh man, my journey seems long…My twins are almost 13, that means I’ve been done having babies for a long time. Thankfully for me it’s not about regaining my pre-pregancy body anymore, it’s about keeping my body from getting old and fat. I’ve really struggled the past couple years actually. Been trying many methods, medicines and yet come back to the “natural” cures. I just had some new blood work done, wondering if it shows anything interesting?? I’ll keep pushing into the natural until I find out. I have been learning a ton about the gut, bone broth, fermentation, vagus nerve, brain/gut connection, gut hormones, etc…
My goal is to weigh 129 by April 10th, I also have the aspiration of feeling sexy, confident and energetic! I want to fit into my summer clothes nicely this year!
Yes, I am. I love the sense of accomplishing finishing a challenge gives and I love how much difference I can create in my body over that time.
I am concerned about family birthday month– which is FEB we have 3 bdays and it’s always so busy on top of the already busy time. I’m also concerned about the threat of getting sick again. I’ve had a rough patch with getting UTI’s the past 8 months and if I get over trained or I over-diet or over stressed those come on more easily. Plus when I get sick over and over again making progress is difficult!
My why is my health. I want to be healthy vs. sickly– I feel like recently I’ve been more sickly than healthy– That trend has to stop!
Yes, the best one in the world, TEAM BUFFMOTHER! Also, my husband…he’s on a kick to be more healthy too, so that helps a ton!
Blogging daily, reading others blogs, commenting and also striving to LEARN MORE daily! I’ll also be doing the monthly focuses in Team BuffMother NO FRUMP and FOODIE FEB to start!
I’m ready, I’m also hoping the ladies who are also in this contest realize it’s more MENTAL than anything. My body is capable of amazing things, but often my mind holds me back. Time to tune up my MIND so I can tune up my body!!

The Holloway Road Odeon building opened as a Gaumont cinema in 1937 before it was hit by two rockets during World War II
Vacant shops on the Holloway Road side of the listed building would be converted into a new restaurant linked to the foyer of the cinema.
The iconic Odeon sign, currently above the entrance, would be moved onto the tower, if proposals submitted to the Town Hall this week are given the green light.
The news comes weeks after Marks & Spencer announced it would be closing its nearby Nag’s Head store as part of nationwide streamlining plans.
In the planning documents, the cinema group states: “On completion of this major refurbishment, the Holloway Road Odeon will be one of Odeon’s leading ‘traditional’ London cinemas, a flagship for the brand and a key leisure anchor for the Nag’s Head centre.”
The revamp would include refurbishment of ground-floor entrances and removal of screen three to open up the foyer area, which used to be a tearoom.
Removing the screen is expected to reveal the original ceiling. The area will then become a bar – a modern “reincarnation” of its original use.
All remaining seven screens would be refurbished to include new seating and modern screening technology.
Mario Thoti, who owns Mario’s barbers next to the proposed restaurant, said: “I would 100 per cent like to see it redone. It would be much better.
“Having a shop here is good, but it would be nice for them to redo the building because there is a lot of potential. It would open up the area, bring in more people, so it is a positive thing that they want to do it up.”
Odeon Cinemas could not confirm what the restaurant would be, but an artist’s impression app­ears to show a pizzeria.
The building opened as a Gaumont cinema in 1937 before it was hit by two rockets during World War II. The auditorium was destroyed but the foyer and front of house survived. It was left derelict for 14 years before becom­ing an Odeon in 1962.

Fraktur (German: [fʀakˈtuːɐ]) is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand. The blackletter lines are broken up – that is, their forms contain many angles when compared to the smooth curves of the Antiqua (common) typefaces modeled after antique Roman square capitals and Carolingian minuscule. From this, Fraktur is sometimes contrasted with the "Latin alphabet" in northern European texts, being sometimes called the "German alphabet", despite simply being a typeface of the Latin alphabet. Similarly, the term "Fraktur" or "Gothic" is sometimes applied to all of the blackletter typefaces (known in German as Gebrochene Schrift ("Broken Script")).

Definition: A niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is focusing; therefore the market niche defines the specific product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range, production quality and the demographics that is intended to impact. (Thank you wikipedia)
In Guild Wars 2 a niche market is generally considered to be a market that has a small but regular demand, but little supply. Some trader’s also use the term to describe their own ‘unique’ set of items of which they profit from.
Being successful in a niche market is all about dominating it, these markets don’t tend to generate a large number of sales, so you want to make sure you’re offering the lowest price and making the most profit. Is it also the reason why a lot of trader’s keep their niche markets secret, competition is not profitable.
Build a strong list of profitable items that can be flipped regularly. Make sure that what you already do every day is completed as fast as possible, so you can use your valuable time experimenting in new markets instead of spending an entire afternoon re-listing new buy orders.

Columbia University has awarded the 2016 Naomi Berrie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Diabetes Research to Peter Arner, MD, PhD, a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Medicine at the Karolinska Institute, whose studies on the turnover of fat tissue in the human body has revealed processes that contribute to obesity and diabetes.
The Naomi Berrie Award for Outstanding Achievement is Columbia University’s top honor for excellence in diabetes research, and Dr. Arner is the 18th winner since the award’s inception in 1999. Dr. Arner received the award on November 19 at a ceremony which took place at the Frontiers in Diabetes Research Symposium in the Russ Berrie Medical Science Pavilion at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC).
“Peter has been responsible for identifying some of the key molecules, genes, and pathways that influence the production of fat cells and their growth,” said Rudolph L. Leibel, MD, the Christopher J. Murphy Memorial Professor of Diabetes Research, co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, and chair of the award selection committee. “These discoveries have had a major impact on how we understand the role of body fat in metabolic diseases.”
Dr. Arner and his collaborators were the first to show that the human body continues to produce fat cells into adulthood. Dr. Arner’s team developed a method of measuring fat cell turnover in adults, which led to the discovery that fat cells are renewed relatively rapidly—around 8 percent of adult fat cells die every year and are replaced by new ones. Fat turnover was the same for all individuals in the study, including those who had lost a significant amount of weight, showing that the volume of fat cells, not their abundance, that causes body mass to rise and fall during a lifetime.
Dr. Arner is also credited with discovering several adipokines—molecules released from fat tissue that can trigger inflammation and regulate the size and number of fat cells. His group showed that a molecule called Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) alters the levels of leptin, a hormone secreted from fat that plays a critical role in the regulation of body weight.
In the clinic, Dr. Arner’s group designed and conducted a clinical trial of the drug ibertesan, showing that it slowed the progression of neuropathy—a type of nerve damage that develops in 40 per cent of type 2 diabetes patients.
Peter Arner studied medicine at the Karolinska Institute, and received specialty training in internal medicine and in Endocrinology.
The Naomi Berrie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Diabetes Research includes an award of $130,000 that is used by the recipient to support a junior investigator in his or her laboratory for two years. The program also includes a similar award to a junior-level investigator at Columbia University. These individuals are designated “Berrie Fellows in Diabetes Research.” The Berrie Fellowships for 2016 were awarded to Hui Gao, PhD and Kristin McCabe, PhD.
Dr. Gao is a senior researcher in the Department of Biosciences and Nutrition at the Karolinska Institute, Sweden. He will work under Dr. Arner on the role of long non-coding RNA molecules in regulating genes in the adipose tissue of patients with diabetes.
Dr. McCabe is a postdoctoral research scientist in the laboratory of Alan Tall, MD, at CUMC. She will investigate the ability of specialized heat-producing “brown” fat cells to reduce obesity risk, with a focus on a molecule called TTC39B.
Taiyi Kuo, PhD, Yann Ravussin, PhD and Lina Sui, PhD are the Russell Berrie Foundation Scholars for 2016. This program provides support to international scientists to work at the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in collaboration with Columbia scientists. Each scholar will receive $75,000 in support of their research activities.
Dr. Kuo completed her PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Domenico Accili, MD, the Russell Berrie Foundation Professor of Diabetes (in Medicine) at CUMC. She will research the role of epigenetics on insulin release from pancreatic beta cells.
Dr. Ravussin completed his undergraduate training at the Université de Lausanne, his PhD at Columbia, and has worked at the National Institutes of Health. Currently, he is a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Anthony Ferrante, MD, PhD, an associate professor of medicine at CUMC. He will investigate overfeeding and pathways that regulate body weight.
Dr. Sui completed her PhD at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and was a Research Associate scientist at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Science. Currently, she is a postdoctoral scientist in the laboratory of Dietrich Egli, PhD, assistant professor of developmental cell biology (in Pediatrics) at CUMC. Dr. Sui will use stem cells to dissect the pathways that cause beta cells to fail when starved of glucose.

Two flight school employees in Redding, CA charged with kidnapping and other charges related to trying to force a student pilot to return to China.
Everyone knows that when flying VFR, that a pilot’s priorities are to aviate, navigate, and communicate. But when flying IFR, pilots are often confused by their priorities when faced with a high task load while preparing to fly an instrument approach. 2008 National Flight Instructor of the Year Max Trescott explains that IFR pilots should prioritize these three things above all other activities. 1. Rolling out onto headings 2. Leveling off at Altitudes 3. Intercepting the final approach course Getting the ATIS, briefing the approach, talking to ATC and everything else are all lower priorities. Max then talks about how to brief an instrument approach while in cruise flight and setting up for an instrument approach.

Everyone feels nervous to some extent when they go for a checkride, so we share 14 ways to reduce your anxiety before and during a checkride. Checkride anxiety applies to student pilots in particular because it’s your first checkride. But it also applies to all pilots who think that someday they’ll go for an instrument, or maybe a multiengine, seaplane, glider, Commercial, ATP, or CFI checkride. Professional pilots working for a Part 135 charter company or an airline, also have to periodically be rechecked.
Do whatever it takes to guarantee that you get a decent amount of sleep the night before the checkride.
If there’s a gouge available, a report that someone has written about their checkride with your examiner, see if you can find it and read it ahead of time.
The CAA has launched a survey for GA pilots flying in U.K. airspace in an effort to encourage ADS-B usage by the flying community. The survey seeks information on the types of devices already used by private pilots and the devices they would prefer to use.
You’ve undoubtedly heard of a stabilized approach and know it’s helpful to have one prior to landing. But many pilots don’t know all of the elements of a stabilized approach, or the potential expense of an unstable approach. Last year, two pilots I know dug deep into their wallets to pay for damage resulting from landings that followed unstable approaches. Both considered going around, but didn’t. The pilots of an IFR charter fight into Akron, Ohio in November 2015 weren’t so lucky; everyone died after their unstable approach.
So what is a stabilized approach, and why does it matter? Cirrus Aircraft’s Flight Operations Manual gives a good description. It says: “A stabilized approach is characterized by a constant angle and constant rate of descent approach profile ending near the touch-down point. Stabilized approach criteria apply to all approaches including practice power-off approaches.“ It goes on to say that for VFR landings, an “approach is considered stabilized when all of the following criteria are achieved by 500′ AGL:
A go-around must be executed if the above conditions are not met, and the aircraft is not stabilized by 500′ AGL.” This episode contains lots of tips to help you consistently fly stable approaches every time you fly the traffic pattern, including tips for long, straight-in approaches, which often lead to unstable approaches.
My husband and I have finally made our way to season six, the final season, of The Sopranos. Today’s Poetry Friday entry is inspired by a poem one of the characters on the show reads to another character in one of the early episodes of this season, which we watched just the other night. I don’t want to spoil anything for anyone (though I know we’re slow in getting to the show and the rest of the country has seen it, I’m sure), so I won’t name names, but it may or may not have been during an existential crisis of sorts that one of the characters was having. In fact, this character was experiencing his own visions of life after death when the poem was being read.
Now, I am convinced that I think about life after death more than a person should (not in a morbid way, but in an enormously curious way) and that I’m, likely, terribly abnormal in this regard (as in, a total weirdo). But to me, it’s Life’s Greatest Mystery, and I think one reason I don’t mind aging at all in this wild life is that, each day, I’m one step closer to finding out the big answer. To say I claim to have no answers on the matter is a big ‘ol understatement, but I hope the atheists are wrong and that, in the words of Peter Pan, to die will be an awfully big adventure. All of that is to say that, well…you give me a book or a movie or a whatever that deals with the issue in an intelligent way, and I’m so hooked. This is one reason the poem really intrigued me. The character only reads the first two lines of the poem before the camera cuts away (to the other character’s ongoing journey through what you figure out is his own afterlife — not that he necessarily stays there, mind you), but my interest was piqued nonethless. (And the first show of this season opens with William Burroughs’ spoken word recording, Seven Souls, which was OH MY a TERRIFICALLY captivating way to open a season, but that’s a Poetry Friday entry for another day.)
Jacques Prévert—who wrote this poem, who is pictured here, who was born at the turn of the last century, and who is new to me—was a French poet and screenwriter. Evidently, he was an active participant in the Surrealist movement and also often wrote of sentimental love, even creating poems that were eventually set to music by the likes of not only many French vocalists, but also folks like Joan Baez.
I finally just finished my library copy of Sonya Hartnett’s The Ghost’s Child, originally published in Australia in 2007, I believe, and published last year in the U.S. by Candlewick. Remember when Sonya stopped by in ’07 and said quite determinedly that she doesn’t like her books to be pinned down when it comes to labels (such as “YA”)? Well, she’s done it again (I see here in The Guardian that Linda Newbery wrote last year in her review, “{e}mphatically, The Ghost’s Child has the quirkiness and the sense of being true to itself that often marks out fiction not written with any particular readership in mind”). This time she’s crafted a contemporary fable of sorts—an ethereal, lilting, poetic one at that—about the very nature (and very complicated nature) of human love. Or it could be a modern-day fairy tale? I dunno; I’m still thinking about it. And there I go, trying to categorize, too. Anyway, I wasn’t so sure about this book at first, though I’m a huge Hartnett fan, but I have to say it suddenly endeared itself to me, invited itself right in and took a seat in my mind, refusing to catch a cab and head home. It made itself some coffee and settled in to stay.
Devoted Readers of 7-Imp With Good Memories may recollect that, back in November of ’07, author Jack Gantos stopped by and sung the praises of author/illustrator Laurie Keller. Well, what a good reminder that was that I’d love to chat with her one day. Over one year later (hey, sometimes I’m just really slow) and after the birth of the handy-dandy seven-
Laurie’s here to join me for breakfast, and can I just tell you how fun it is to chat with her over a cyber-breakfast and how much I wish it were a REAL, in-person breakfast in her cottage in Michigan? Any hugely huge fan of Waiting for Guffman, a movie I’ve seen PRECISELY seven blajillion times and can probably quote to everyone’s great irritation, is a friend of mine. But I’m getting ahead of myself.
Welcome, everyone, to this week’s Kicks post. And welcome to John Hendrix, our featured illustrator for this week. If you’ve been following the Cybils nominations, or if you just happen to like good picture books, you may have already encountered his work in Abe Lincoln Crosses a Creek: A Tall, Thin Tale (Introducing His Forgotten Frontier Friend) by Deborah Hopkinson (Schwartz & Wade Books, September 2008), which has made it into the list of finalists for the Fiction Picture Books category this year. If you haven’t read it, check out the image above and the two below for a sneak preview.
Doesn’t seeing young Lincoln up there, being all heroic and brave and stuff, make you feel a little patriotic? Doesn’t it fit in nicely with this week’s inauguration awesomeness? We thought so too.
Do you know who the first President to have poetry read during the inauguration ceremony was? John F. Kennedy. And in case you didn’t know who he chose, it was Robert Frost. A natural choice, being a fellow New Englander and all. But – stop me if you’ve heard this before – there was kind of a hitch during the reading.
It’s been a while since I’ve done a totally random illustrator feature (as in, the Illustration Junkie just sometimes can’t wait ’til the usual Sunday illustrator feature), but here I am today with German (but London-based) author and illustrator Viviane Schwarz, whose books I’ve never even seen. But I stumbled across her site (thanks to Canadian illustrator Eric Orchard), liked what I saw, and asked her to stop by. (This is the way I roll sometimes, for good or bad. Emily Gravett has sung Viviane’s praises before as well, as I see here, so hey, I’m in very good company in liking what I see.)
Because Eisha and I are so excited about today’s inauguration, we’re sharing this song, which is by Maddy Wyatt, whom Eisha says she actually kinda knows:
Also, not appropos to that at all…7-Imp has a new mad-tea-party image, all thanks to author and cartoonist Ray Friesen, whom we featured Sunday at our kicks post. And we’d simply like to share it with you. He created this just for our blog, and he even put me and Eisha AT THE TABLE with Alice, the Hatter, the March Hare, and the Dormouse! I could even argue that I’m drinking coffee there at this tea party. (Right? Right. Let’s just pretend anyway.)
Ray was trying very hard to finish it for Sunday’s post, but he sent it after we had already posted. He also said he intended to fully color it, too, but time just slipped away from him (hey, he was having way too much fun at a book-signing, including free cartooning classes for kids, which is way more important than an image for our blog anyway, I’m sure you’d agree). But you know what? We like that coloring.
In the book, Alice might think it’s the stupidest tea-party she ever was at in all her life, but we love this cartoon so much. I believe Eisha’s words when she saw it were: “We’ve been cartoonified by a professional! Into an Alice tea party! I think I can die happy now.” We plan to add it to the header of one of our site’s pages, such as we’ve done here and here previously with those mad-tea-party images.
Illustrator John Manders is here for seven questions over breakfast (there he is with Sherman and the day’s first cup of coffee). He can’t linger for too long, since he and his wife just moved into an old farm house in November and have a ton of work to do. And, since John has only been able to answer interview questions “in between plumbing emergencies, appliance deliveries, demolition, unloading and unpacking, and—of course—billable work,” as he put it, I’m even more grateful he took the time to stop by. In fact, about the picture above John told me that behind him and Sherman is the void to be inhabited eventually by a refrigerator. Seeing as how he also just installed a new copper pipe to replace a decrepit old iron hot water line (er, John did…not Sherman), he says that he can be a plumber if the bottom falls out of the children’s book biz, but I hope that doesn’t happen, because I like the energy he brings to his illustrations way too much.
Jules: You know we like to mix things up here at 7-Imp. Last week, we featured contemporary paintings and photography, and today we switch gears big-time and welcome author and cartoonist Ray Friesen (the cartoon version of Ray greets us here), who draws a series of humor/adventure graphic novels for young children. Pictured above is one of the many characters he’s created, the timid superhero Captain Cautious, whom I chose randomly from Ray’s site, since I’d like to have the superpower of creating a vortex into the ice cream dimension, which Captain Cautious can do.
In celebration of poetry’s return to a presidential inauguration—this is the first time that poetry will be featured at the ceremony since Bill Clinton’s second swearing-in back in 1997—I’m featuring a poem by Elizabeth Alexander today. Alexander, Obama’s choice as the inaugural poet, is also an essayist, playwright, and teacher, born in New York City and raised in Washington, D.C. She has published five books of poetry and currently teaches in the Department of African American Studies at Yale University. As you can read here, she’s “completely thrilled and deeply, deeply honored” to have been chosen.
That’s from Alexander’s “Ars Poetica #100: I Believe,” and the full version can be found here at her site. Also of interest: Alexander’s “The female seer will burn upon this pyre,” archived over at The Poetry Foundation.
Lastly, this is well-worth your time: The Poetry Foundation’s 11/25/08 episode of Poetry Off the Shelf discusses “poets in the age of Obama,” or “how the Derek Walcott-toting, June Jordan-quoting president will affect poets and poetry.” For approximately nine minutes (audio only), Curtis Fox discusses with Ms. Alexander how Obama will affect not only our current intellectual culture, but the world of poetry as well. Here’s the link.
As of Thursday night, I’m not sure who’s hosting the Poetry Friday round-up, but we’ll get it straight soon enough, I’m sure.
Friday-morning update: The round-up will be hosted by Karen Edmisten over at her blog with “the shockingly clever title.” Thanks for rounding-up, Karen!
Jules: Many thanks to Michael Foreman and Candlewick for this illustration today. Just look at this lovely image from Nicola Davies’ and Michael Foreman’s White Owl, Barn Owl (released this past April and reviewed here this week by Jules). This is a beautiful book — well-written, well-designed, and including both a fiction narrative and non-fiction facts about the common barn owl, these things merged together with eloquence and ease. And Michael Foreman’s illustrations are almost breathtaking, especially the ones showing the owl in flight. Have you ever really stopped to consider how seven-kinds-of-prolific this man is? Go here and scroll down a bit. My oh my, I bet he’s capable of way more than seven impossible things before breakfast.
A huge heapin’ thanks to the honorable Mr. Foreman for letting us feature this gorgeous illustration today, the moment in which the young girl and her grandpa first spot the barn owl’s pale face in the nest box they have created for him.
On to our kicks then . . . By way of explanation for any new folks (who we hope will leave their lists), our weekly 7 Kicks list is the meeting ground for listing Seven(ish) Exceptionally Fabulous, Beautiful, Interesting, Hilarious, or Otherwise Positive Noteworthy Things from the past week (whether book-related or not) that happened to you.
I made some wonderful connections with folks whom I respect and admire this week (see below), but without a doubt, this just HAS TO be Numero Uno on my list:
1). My three-year-old daughter (very nearly 3.5) loves and adores All Things Winnie-the-Pooh. A good while ago I tried to read to her one of the original Pooh stories, as in A.A. Milne, and it didn’t go well. Not surprised. Gotta be able to sit and focus and listen. Very few pictures there. Etc. Etc. But, she is so crazy about Pooh and Heffalumps (and now she’s a bit older), so I tried again — with “Chapter Five, In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump” from Winnie-the-Pooh. And she sat and listened all wide-eyed and mesmerized and loved it! Now, you have to understand here that, when I first found out I was pregnant, my one very particular joy and anticipation was the thought of reading the classics of children’s lit to my child. Every parent has that One Big Joy, you know? Maybe it’s dreaming of the child playing soccer and watching her games or taking ballet or football or what-have-you. For me, it’s reading Pooh and Charlotte’s Web and The Secret Garden and The Hobbit (though my husband wants to read that one to them), etc. So, that’s my BIG BIG BIG FAVORITE KICK of the week. We even read a few more, including “Chapter Three, In Which A Search is Organdized, and Piglet Nearly Meets the Heffalump Again” from The House at Pooh Corner.
Best of all, she’s been walking around with a copy of George Bernard Shaw’s Arms and the Man, which she found randomly on one of our bookshelves, and has been pretending to read Pooh stories, making up nonsense narratives all involving Piglet and Heffalumps. You gotta love that — the lost George Bernard Shaw Pooh tales. (Hmmm, Pooh as a Young Fabian would be intriguing, no?). We’ve also been building a lot of Very Cunning Traps for Heffalumps all week. She gets so excited that it’s a bit difficult to follow this game, but I just have to follow her and whisper “mystery” and “danger” a lot, as she does.
2). The Southern Festival of Books will be here in Nashville this October (the weekend after the fabulous 1st Annual Kidlitosphere Conference in Chicago). First, look at the great authors-who-will-be-attending list! I don’t want to single any authors out, but I’m excited about the opportunity to meet many of them.
Oh wait! YES! I am going to single one of them out, and that would be Haven Kimmel, whom Eisha and I adore (and we’ve made that quite clear here at 7-Imp). I not only get to meet her, but I get to host her session (this is most very quite possibly ninety-nine percent likely, but even if something changes later, I still can’t help but tell you about it now). And I couldn’t be more excited* or honored! What a great month October will be. I only wish Eisha could meet her with me, but alas and alack, she cannot make it.
3). We get to interview** Naomi Shihab Nye this November for the upcoming Winter Blog Blast Tour, organized by Colleen Mondor! Remember when Eisha and I interviewed ourselves? And my response to the fantasy author wine/coffee soiree was Maurice Sendak, Haven Kimmel, and Naomi Shihab Nye? Well, now I get to meet Haven, and I’ve already corresponded a bit with Naomi about the interview. And I’m happy to report that she’s brilliant (we already knew this) and terrifically nice. We also have confirmed Phyllis Root and Gabrielle Zevin! How great will this be? How humbled are we? Very.
4). I won a copy of Zoopa: An Animal Alphabet by Gianna Marino from author Jama Kim Rattigan just for visiting her great new blog. Thanks, Jama! I just got it and can’t wait to read it.
5). I had a great brainstorming session with Eisha and Susan and Anne and a nice editor from The Poetry Foundation about feature ideas for their site. It was quite a thrill to talk to them all at one time. I really wanted to ask Susan about her chickens but figured that would be off the point.
6). This report on coffee. OH YEAH, that’s what I’m talking about, people. (And do you want an anti-kick? Read this: “‘Anybody would rather have fun while they’re learning, instead of sitting there staring at a book, staring at a piece of paper . . . This is different, this is something that the kids love.'” HUBBA-WHA???? (Thanks to my friend, Missey, for both links).
7). Particularly great new review copies: Haven’s new novel; Barbara McClintock’s new illustrated picture book; Adam Rex’s new book; Polly Dunbar’s new picture book; Mo Willems’ two new Elephant & Piggie beginning readers; Matt Phelan’s new picture book; and more. Whew, so much good stuff to read and not enough time.
Sorry my kicks are so long this week. Excellent week for me. I’ll try to, uh, write a short haiku or something next week . . . I’m going to leave you with a 7½. My husband emailed me this video this week. Chris Thile is obscenely talented. Here he is covering “Morning Bell” by Radiohead. It’s long — a little over eight minutes. You’d have to be really interested in this kind of jammin’ to sit through it. But — if you are, as I am (there’s always been something about Chris’ voice that is extra kick-ass to me) — then enjoy:
Jules, I can’t think of anyone who deserves a chock-full-o’-kicks week any more than you. So, enjoy! And good luck with the Heffalump hunting. I hope you’re just planning to catch-and-release, though – you don’t want PETA all up in your grill.
1* I also got a bunch of excellent review books in the mail this week, including Haven Kimmel’s new one, The Used World, and the two new Elephant and Piggie books from Mo Willems.
2* Jules gets to meet Haven Kimmel (maybe I’ll figure out a way to go see it – I’ve got over a month to figure it out…). Even if I don’t get to go, I’ll be cheering you on from afar, J!
5* Birthday presents continue to trickle in, including an adorable stuffed Baby Owl from a certain co-blogger BFF of mine. Thanks, Jules! He really really is SO CUTE!
6* The most recent play my husband designed, a musical based on The Mysteries of Harris Burdick by Chris Van Allsburg, is amazing. If you can, really, go see it. I can’t get the “Oscar and Alphonse” song out of my head.
Can’t wait for all the fabulous interviews! See, that’s the great thing about YOUR kicks, j & e: we all know that we’re going to get to share in the kickiness too!
1. My neighbor knocks on the door. “Do you know you have a flat tire?” Yes, I knew. But the rain, and I was tired, and… “Well, I’m fixing it for you.” Wow!
2. Poetry Friday. So much good stuff out there, and I love the thought of all of us “paying calls” to each other’s blogs that day. Ooh, and I did actually find some very awesome literary calling cards!
3. Mother Reader’s comment on my blog on Poetry Friday. I loved everyone else’s too, but there’s something about reaching a self-proclaimed heretic that gets me every time. 🙂
4. My sister, after having to take a break due to mental health issues, is back to studying for her GRE.
5. Cocoa and fig spread. Yum. Plus, I discovered two “new-to-me” cheeses. I love trolling Whole Foods.
7. It’s official! My book is going to be a Cafe Book for middle schools in two counties! Yippee! And I get to talk to them all at the end of the school year!
Sara, now, those are all nice, but numbers 1, 4, and 7 are particularly kick-y. What kindness from your neighbor, yay for your sis, and yay for you! What exactly does Cafe Book entail? Is this something the librarians or language arts teachers do?
Speaking of that (schools), I wonder if I should have made my anti-kick in number six a whole separate and very disgruntled post. Did you read that, Sara? An elementary school going “paperless” — the books stay on the shelves, and they’re going to use computers only for instruction (oh but don’t fear – they will use paper when they take things like worksheets home). WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TO?
Yikes, jules. I went and read that anti-kick, and all I can say is: if they’re talking about leaving those clunky textbooks on the shelves, then: woo-hoo! But surely they don’t mean novels, too?
Cafe Book is a lunchtime book club for middle schoolers. It’s run jointly by the county and school librarians (isn’t THAT great?) and the kids themselves. I’ll email you the link.
Well, that’s a good question, Sara. I had assumed they meant novels, too, but maybe I assumed too much.
Too much computer instruction makes me nervous, too, though. Different types of learning and all. What about those kids who don’t want to stare at a screen that much? I hope they mix things up for them.
(Oh, and relying on the Web alone for non-fiction, though I know there are computer programs/databases for that type of stuff, is rather terrifying).
What great kicks you all have this week! Jules and Eisha–I’m excited for all your great features and that you’re all so excited about them. (And that’s cool about “Pooh,” Jules. I had the same moment twice, so i know how great it is. The Secret Garden, however, didn’t win any fans as much as I talked it up.)
Sara: How great is Emma Thompson? And how much would we like a Queen L in our lives? I need her to move in now. Oh, and huge congrats on your book being chosen!!
1) New audio. I just listened to a book I hated so, so much. And it’s over, thank god. And here’s the thing: the book was “literary,” written really, really well. Short-listed for many an award. But, I loathed it. I have A LOT of work today–grunt work–so I need an audio friend to get through it.
3) School started for the kids. School-adverse son likes teacher and a boy in his class. His reading is picking up and things are looking good for him.
4) I have an e-mail from Helen Dunmore in my inbox. I have always loved her writing for adults and now I love her writing for kids. And I have an e-mail from her in my inbox 🙂
Jules and Eisha: Interviewing Naomi Shihab Nye? I am so envious!! Think I mentioned it before I took a class from her in the 80’s. She is coming to the 2008 joint Oregn and washington library conference.Sara, I want the link for Cafe Book also. I love it. Congrats.I also want the ling for the “paperless” school. Yuck!! But I need to read about it. Kelly, good luck with school.
2. The owner of Beach Books in Seaside, OR gave me the ARC copy of Vegetable, Meat, Miracle to read.
5. Reading The Memory Keeper’s Daughter. I had to put the book away last night or I would have stayed up waaay toooo late.
I’m going to have to alert Tammy to White Owl, Barn Owl. So pretty — and she loves owls, probably because she didn’t have any living in her barn growing up and didn’t have to confront any pellets or mangled discarded food. Not that this happened to me. Much.
Jules, Lucas is suddenly into Roald Dahl, which I am so completely excited about as I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting for him to get old enough to appreciate the wonderfulness that is Dahl. So I get the reading Pooh aloud thing. Incidentally, not to be all consumerish, but The Silly Old Bear Shop in Niagara-on-the-Lake is completely fun, and NOTL is also the location of the annual Shaw Festival. Perhaps your daughter sensed this Pooh-Shaw connection?
1. One week off work, one more to go. I’m at that point in my vacation where I have to think really, really hard to remember even what day of the week it is. Instead of “Monday,” “Tuesday,” or “Wednesday,” I’m now thinking of the days as “The Day We’re Eating Ice Cream Cake” or “The Day Tracy’s Visiting.”
2. Speaking of which, ice cream cake. We decided that it was time to celebrate, although, in the end, we couldn’t settle on exactly what we were celebrating. Maybe it was ice cream.
4. Visiting one of my childhood friends and her kids who live about an hour away. Between the drive and everyone being so busy, it always feels like an event to get to see them. And I seriously adore her children.
5. Playing catch — like, with a baseball — for the first time in I-don’t-know-how-long. Lucas played, too, so I got to feel like maybe I’m slightly athletic (which, for the record, I’m not).
6. Ooo! And I bought new notecards and postcards and STAMPS. I’m going to blog about the stamps, because the current selection at the P.O. is freaking awesome.
The selections for the 2007-2008 list aren’t on there yet, but there are good, detailed pages about how the program runs, and lists from previous years.
I can also put you in touch with someone who’s worked with the program for several years, if anyone’s interested in this professionally.
O.K. Jules. It’s Sunday morning again, and I remembered to check the 7-Imp list! I guess that should be Kick #1.
Kick 2: Grace, my 15-year old, had to choose an author from a list provided by her English teacher in order to do a research paper or biography or some such. She had a hard time choosing between C.S. Lewis and Richard Peck. She finally decided on Richard Peck, because she knew Jules would be positively thrilled. She actually asked me to take her to school early on the sign up day so that she could be sure she got her first choice. Then she figured out that nobody in her class knows who Richard Peck is so we didn’t have to go to school early AND she got Richard Peck. She’s told me that he’s visiting our most wonderful, awesome local public library, and she asked her teacher if she could go to the special face time he’s got scheduled just for teachers. What an over-achiever (but I love it)!
My son moved into his dorm at Maryville College this week. He’s a sophomore and a transfer student to MC. His dorm room is twice the size of the room last year in the freshman dorm (Kick 3); and he said the food in the cafeteria is pretty good (Kick 4). Between missing him so much last school year (he was 2 1/2 hours away), and his unhappiness . . . well, it was a long school year for us both. There is definitely hope for this school year (Kick 5).
I thank the Lord for all my blessings. As my friend, Claudia, says *I know where I am, and I can wipe my own behind* so life is good (Kicks 6 and 7).
Finally, Jules, you and Eisha ROCK! I can’t wait to meet Eisha. Your blog is so great; your work is garnering recognition every day from the folks you respect. For the most part you get to work from home, even in your p.j.’s. How cool is that? You ROCK. I know I just said that, but I really, really mean it!
Sara, your neighbor rocks. I’m so glad your sister is doing better. And I really liked Stranger Than Fiction, too.
Kelly, you hereby have my permission to just STOP LISTENING/READING any book that doesn’t grab you. Seriously, life is short. Put it down, and read something good. And break a leg today!
Jone, what a lovely book-filled week! I keep hearing great things about MKD, and will have to add it to my pile.
adrienne – Baby Owl’s little-er owl is even a finger puppet!!! And since I’ve been unemployed for over a month, I’ve totally lost track of days too. It’s kind of awesome, isn’t it?
OOH, EVERYBODY: I FORGOT A KICK!!! My friends Adrienne (the other one) and Scott came in to town for a day and we all ate at Moosewood and shopped around the Common. It was great to see them.
it’s been rough readjusting to life-after travel, full of promises and deadlines and all. things aren’t hectic so much as i’m feeling very scattered right now…
1. camping with the fam in vermont, including a hike up to the top of a dam and an awesome sideways waterfall over giant boulders
3 – 7. crossing the i’s and dotting the t’s getting things in order to apply to grad school, despite having to rewrite an essay from scratch after realizing that i totally misread the focus of what it was supposed to encompass.
Jone, my girls’ granny bought them I’m the Biggest Thing in the Ocean this weekend. I imagine that buying books for grand kids is a particularly wonderful kick.
Adrienne, you bet I’ll be willing and ready and very eager to read Dahl’s The BFG to my girls as soon as they’re ready. Could there be a better read-aloud? Could I stop talking like Chandler Bing all day? I just dunno.
HI, GLORIA! Thanks for visiting. Go, Grace! I interpreted for Richard Peck once, though Shannon Collins was my team interpreter and stole the show (that’s a compliment to him, by the way) and did a much better job than I did. Wem Glo, I hope you come back and share kicks every week. Boy howdy it made my day to see you visiting. Plus, we can keep up better this way. (And thanks for complimenting our blog — it’s fun to do). Oh, and I hope Will loves MC!
David, congrats on good words from the editor. Good luck with settling in and all the deadlines and such.
Moosewood was yummy. When you talk to locals, they always say “yeah, you never know with Moosewood, it depends who’s cooking that day, blah blah…” but both my experiences have been very tasty.
I feel a bit of a fraud sticking my nose in here each week when I don’t comment much on Blogs during the week. I promise I AM reading them – just not commenting much ! Still, until someone asks/tells me not to bother, I’ll keep on coming by…
So kicks – unsurprisingly they’re largely Doctor Who related – ‘cos as anyone who’s looked at the header on my Blog recently will know The Doctor has stolen my brain, my heart, my soul and my life… (Yep, I’ve owned my addiction IN my Blog header – does owning it mean I’ll find a cure – somehow I doubt it ! Do I care ? Not so much, not when I’m having so much fun !!)
1 – Anyway (as the Tenth Doctor likes to say !), I got the new Doctor Who Magazine yesterday – yay ! Lots of exciting news about next year’s season…
2 – I also got a free copy of the DWM Special – the season 3 Companion with TONS of photos, information and articles on Season 3 – Nerdgasms galore !
3 – I’ve now written and posted 18 Tenth Doctor/Martha stories on my Journal in 6 weeks… And more and more people are reading them, which is fun as I’m making even more friends…
4 – Actually having people tell me that they wait impatiently for the weekend to roll around so they can read my latest stories – that’s a serious ego boost after a week of work-related gloom…
5 – Watching David Tennant in “Taking Over the Asylum” – oh what a brilliant and beatiful man, he is !
6 – Tomorrow’s a public holiday and I have the DAY OFF work (can’t really afford it but I SO need it !)
7 – Given it’s a public holiday tomorrow, it’s purely astonishing that we’re having a mini heat-wave here in England at the moment – actual SUNSHINE has been seen and experienced… I almost died of shock ! 😀
Hope you all have a good week (and Kelly, I’m not a BIT jealous of your 4th Kick – not a bit ! Hope the teaching went/goes well !)
Michele, do you know how often I visit blogs but don’t comment, usually ’cause I don’t have time? No worries there . . . Congrats on a sunlight-spotting.
Eisha, my nickname for Gloria (“Wem Glo”) actually is children’s lit-related. When I worked as a full-time interpreter at UT, I did some mentoring, and Gloria was assigned as my student. I believe it was for a particular success in her studies she had (or her first real interpreting assignment — I can’t remember??) that I purchased her “Wemberley Worried” by Henkes, ’cause we both bonded over — amongst many other things, including a love for some good bluegrass — being natural worriers, which little Wemberley is big-time, as you know. And then there’s a “Jewels” in the book whom Wemberley bonded with, as she and I did. So, well, she’s Wemberley Glo now, or Wem Glo or WG for short. (I might have missed some vital piece of information in that story, but I think that’s pretty much how it went).
I’m thinking that the beautiful owl book you shared makes my pb ms for a book about a barn owl in an owl box superfluous. Le sigh.
But I’m very psyched you guys scored Naomi Shihab Nye for the WBBT, and I love the Piglet Heffalump stories by GBS. And Jules? During John Green’s keynote at LA, he named two “perfect books”: Ulysses, by James Joyce, and Wemberley Worried, by Kevin Henkes.
1. I’m tickled pink about my interview with Tony Mitton for the Under the Radar Tour, even though I did it weeks ago. Still, tickled. It goes up tomorrow. Must. Code. Today.
2. New bookcase for the basement = JOY. It will allow at least 4 other areas of the house to be decluttered, at least in part.
4. Reluctant soccer player S now wants to be team captain of the freshman girls’ team. I knew it was just nerves that made her balk in the first place. Hee.
Wow! What amazing lists everyone has this week. As a self-professed poetry lover, I can’t wait to read the Nye interview. And Sara, jeez, how can we keep up?! I love your blog and am always inspired.
2. During our faculty colloquy on Wednesday we finally got to meet our new University President. He is charasmatic and has great vision. I can’t wait for the year ahead.
3. Finally saw some of my travel buds from our trip to China. I got some great hugs of hello and realized we all missed each other a lot.
4. I met my new advisees–all first year students–and they’re adorable, smart and excited. One is from Panama and she’s amazing.
5.I just returned from the Green Valley Book Fair where I spent just over $100 and came home with a box full of books. I bought copies of An Abundance of Katherines and Happy Kid for my students, some early readers for William, and LOTS for my teaching.
Jules: YAY for your kicktastic week! There is something so amazing about sharing something you love with someone you love – be it stories, secrets, a movie, a good meal, or even silence.
Your kicks list makes me so happy for you, and for all of you – you have family and friends and good times all mentioned and involved in these plans. I think it’s hilarious that she’s carrying around another book (and such a DIFFERENT book!). I think it’s awesome that you are going to the various conferences and being the hostesses with the most…ess…es for Kimmel and Nye.
eisha: Please tell your husband that I said congratulations, again, over and over on repeat. Throw in a big YAY for good measure. Sing Best of Luck by Nickel Creek. (Or don’t, because the lyrics actually aren’t that uplifting.) I wish I could go see the show.
1. More travels. This time to the Poconos for a night and a free stay in the most Kitschy and Extravagant room — we had a POOL IN THE ROOM! Plus a sauna and a steam room and a jacuzzi and and and…. Too much fun!
2. A liesurely and scenic drive home, on the old highway by the Delaware river. Windy and hilly and beautiful and dotted with old towns that time forgot.
3. My neighbor picked almost all the pears off my horrible pear trees, and he put them out for people to take, so now I don’t have to worry about weeks of shoveling up rotten pear guts from the road and sidewalk.
4. I made it through my first department budget. I started out way over budget, and within a day I cut 1/3 without too much anguish, and can now get back to my day job.
5. I’m reorganizing my department and caught up in meetings and writing announcements and basically keeping all 10 fingers in the dam, but it’s going WELL and I know that in 6 months we’re going to wonder how we ever survived before this reorg, and staff will be so much happier. So I’m completely excited and happy about it myself.
6. I loved our recent cold snap. I wasn’t ready for it (no heat in my house, no warm clothes that fit) but it still made me very happy. I love fall, and it’s on the way!
Little Willow, HA! Didn’t know that about them covering “Toxic.” Just found it. This might make you dizzy, but here it is. That’s just awesome, especially Chris’ coy look there at the end — and all his slinky, Britney dancing:
Kelly F, I share your tableware sickness. We should start a support group. And squee right back at you, ’cause we get to interview you!
Nancy – this place in the Poconos sounds so fun – I’m going to email you for details. And I agree – the cold snap was such a relief! I’m so ready for fall.
eisha: 🙂 Fantastic. Thank you for asking. I continue to be amaze by that in progress, while the other is winding to a close.

We have a new artwork ficlet challenge for November from Lurena! This scene is called Stealthily Slipping Away.
(There are also still a few days left in O-cat-ober's challenge by Atomicmayo - closing date 6th November.
Superb as always. I'd love to see a comic made from these wonderful drawings. I'd be there to buy a copy or 2. Perhaps something a little different. The picture with a story description at the bottom. It would be like Telesnaps Blakes 7 style.
The Supreme Commander's yacht was moored at Moonai, the principle port of Saturnalia on the pretext of honouring President Armah's tenth year as ruler with a cruise and elegant supper, topped off with a firework display of ostentatious magnificence. But Blake had discovered from Orac that Servalan planned to detain Armah during the celebrations on charges of sexual harassment so that his Deputy, Saidar Khane could succeed him. With Khane as Saturnalia's puppet ruler, the Federation would effectively take control of sector five-something Blake was anxious to frustrate.
Unfortunately when the time for action came, Blake was laid up with a sprained knee and it fell to Cally to lead. She was eager for the task, Jenna and Gan less keen to accompany her and Avon and Vila not keen at all. In fact Avon considered permanently disabling Orac to prevent it coming up with any more titbits about Federation ploys that required the intervention of the Liberator Crew but by the time he had calculated that they were safer with Orac than without it, Cally and Blake had already got Gan and Jenna onside and Vila, much wiser than Avon, had rendered himself legless on soma. Since the success of the plan required that "someone" knockout the alarms on the yacht and download copies of Servalan's correspondence with First Minister Khane, Avon was forced to concede that he was the only "someone" with the skills to accomplish this who was also able to stand unaided.
Cally, Jenna Gan and Avon teleported down, leaving Blake in charge of teleporting them back when ('if', Avon reflected sourly) they were free to request it. To their surprise, it proved easy to gain access to Servalan's quarters (her name was even on the door) and even easier to download copies of Khane's treachery. It was then the work of an instant for Blake to contact President Armah with the evidence.
So it was that as Travis and Servalan waited on the poop deck for the grand arrival of the Presidential Party, the Liberator crew inched their way beneath them, making their way to the prow of the ship where they could be transported to safety; a platoon of picked guards marched on the yacht, ostensibly to escort the Federation Party from the planet and another effected the arrest of First Minister Khane.
As Cally remarked later, " There is a saying among my people. There is nothing more satisfying than a plan that comes together."
It was dispiriting then but hardly surprising given Blake's customary levels of success, when they discovered that Orac had been fed false information. Far from foiling Federation plans, the crew had been used to get rid of Khane, a rebel sympathiser who had been poised to depose the despotic Armah and free his planet from a Federation presence.
Orac chucked to itself. Stupid humans. That'd teach them to keep interrupting its research with their trivial demands.
Note: While my story makes obvious reference to recent events, I don't state whether we live in the 'normal' time stream, or the 'altered' time stream, therefore regardless of where you stand on Brexit or the US Election, there is no real reason to take offense.
Orac whirred. “Recall from your experience with the Moon Disks that my carrier waves transcend normal space time.”
Avon frowned. “But if we could alter the frequency of the teleport beam to match your carrier wave, we could, theoretically, travel in time, as long as the destination is in teleport range.”
Orac whirred. “Correct, but highly inadvisable. The smallest change could alter the present in unforeseen ways according to the Bradbury Butterfly Effect.”
“Both of you, shut up.” Blake stood. “If we could pinpoint the events that led to the founding of the Federation, we could destroy it before it ever got going. Orac?”
Orac whirred. It was his job. “The two most powerful democratic regimes on Earth held history changing elections in the early part of the twenty-first century of the old calendar. Both elections were close. Both elections had the unforeseen consequence of setting both democracies on a more authoritarian path.”
Blake clapped his hands. “Set course for Earth. Orac, provide the coordinates and the carrier wave frequency for time travel teleport.”
Orac whirred (yes, again), “I have set the coordinates for an old command center abandoned by the Federation years ago. The building dates back to the old calendar. You will materialize in the old calendar for exactly ten minutes. Proceed down the access tunnels to the matrix hub. There you can install a program that will spread like a virus and alter the computerized tallies of both elections. When your ten minutes are up, you will return to your proper place in the space time continuum. Then you can teleport back to Liberator normally. Once again, I highly advise against this course of action.”
“Good luck.” Blake sat down at the teleport console and randomly pushed buttons until his crew disappeared.
They materialized in an empty warehouse. A large grate covered a tunnel. Gan pulled it off. It was his job, after all.
They emerged from the tunnel into the command center in their own time. Travis said, “Congratulations, Madam President.”
Avon marched to Orac. “It all went wrong. The base is no longer abandoned. Servalan is president two full seasons ahead of schedule, and now there are TWO Travises, er, Travis’, er, Travi? We saw a Travis, and then we saw another one! What went wrong, Orac?”
While Gan checked the soles of his shoes for deceased butterflies, Orac whirred, “I did try to warn you.”
Jenna looked lovely. It was all she could do since Blake was at the teleport. - made me laugh out loud
Brad and Anniew, thank you for your fantastic stories! Again I start to long for an Orac spin off series!
Spaceresearcher, I know what you mean, the concept of the picture with a story description at the bottom. And I would love to do a comic. If only time allows.
@Brad: Somehow I knew you would do a Bradbury homage. That was hilarious. The "two Travi" got me. And Gan:“Ooh, he’s my favorite author.”
And now they were hiding in the grey gloom beneath the overhead gantry, waiting with bated breath as the Supreme Commander considered her next move.
It needed just a casual glance and they would be discovered. Jenna hoped that glance would never come, especially as Cally was ready; gun poised.
Behind her was Avon; likewise prepared. Jenna thought it odd that a man who claimed not to have killed anyone could be so adept at handling a firearm.
And then there was Vila...hidden from view and working frantically to open the door. That door was their only way out of this mess.
All of them knew that any hope of slipping stealthily away would vanish the moment that door opened. It would only take one sound and the guards would open fire upon the hidden rebels.
As a barrage of shots rained down upon them, they managed to squeeze through the gap to the next room and safety.
“It doesn’t matter,” Jenna replied, “At least we are safe; for the moment. Any luck getting through to Blake?”
“They’ll be through that door in no time,” Avon declared, “Either Blake gets back with Liberator within the next few minutes, or we are dead. Vila...is there another way out? Vila?”
Vila was startled. He was about to tell them about another exit when he slipped and brought a pile of boxes down on him...just as the Liberator’s teleport took hold.
“But I was sure the information was good,” Blake murmured, “Something about bars. Was there any bullion?”
“Well, I don’t know about gold or silver,” Vila began, still in the teleport and covered in the contents of one of the boxes that had teleported over with him, “But the Milky Bars are on me!”
@Lurena-- as always, superb illustration. So much detail here and your wonderfully expressive faces. Wonderful visual storytelling as usual! <3
I'd like to contribute a story but I can't seem to stay concise and within the word-count. (I get carried away) This excellent picture would equal about ten pages of fan fiction for me, lol.
Security Operative Macintyre swung back and forth in his chair, keeping his eyes on the vis-screen. The inspection was over, and the Supreme Commander was making her way to the platform where her shuttle was docked. Throughout the day, she had said little; Space Commander Travis even less. This was good, it meant they hadn't found any fault with the running of the base. All the same, Macintyre would be relieved when they'd gone. He yawned, stretched and checked his chronometer.
Returning his attention to the screen, he froze and stared, unable to believe what he was seeing. In the lower part of the landing bay, four people had appeared out of nowhere. They were beautiful; their brightly coloured clothes an exotic contrast to the grey steel platform and the formal white and black of the Supreme Commander and her escort.
Macintyre suddenly recalled the stories his grandmother used to tell. She claimed she could see Sprites - mythical folk with magic powers. They were capricious creatures, kind or malevolent by whim, granting wishes to mortals or playing tricks on them. Although captivated by her tales, he never believed that these Sprites really existed. But four people had just appeared in front of him, as if by magic. He watched transfixed as they conferred, then were apparently engaged on individual tasks before drawing together again. One of the women held up her arm and spoke into a copper bracelet. They were briefly outlined in dazzling light, and then were gone.
None of the troopers on the upper level had noticed them. Overhead, Macintyre heard the roar of the shuttle’s engines as the Supreme Commander departed. His hand hovered over the alarm button. If he sounded the alert, what could he say? "Four strange-looking people appeared in the landing bay, and then vanished." His career would disappear, that was for sure, and he'd be sent for mental assessment. He rubbed his eyes. It must have been a trick of the light, that’s all. Too many hours spent staring at the screen.
Still, it wouldn’t hurt to check. He enlarged the image, focussing the camera where the strangers had been. There was something - dark objects that hadn't been there before. They looked like... oh, god! Macintyre hit the alarm button as the first explosion rocked the base. The lights went out and the screen cracked, the image turning to static and snow. The second explosion catapulted him from his chair, the room turned on its side and the floor rose up to hit him.
Pinned beneath a fallen girder, hot dust choking his nose and mouth, he thought again of his grandmother. As she aged, she insisted ever more fervently that the magical folk of her stories were real. She ended her days alternately smiling with pleasure or whimpering in fear at things no one else could see.
@Travisina-- Ooh, excellent!!! I love the whimsical fantasy touch. I find myself liking poor Macintyre a lot. (Maybe he survives...? Tell me he survives.)
Well, Macintyre's grandmother warned him the sprites could be just as dangerous as they are beautiful and magical.
I don't know whether Macintyre survives - it's possible, because we don't see him die. On the other hand, this is B7...
You don't *have* to stay within the word count, but 10 pages is a bit long for a forum post! However, if you'd like to submit a longer story for consideration to go on the website, I'd be very happy to read it!
I like the idea that tales of magical creatures survive even in the Federation. Wonder what our heroes would think of being mistaken for sprites?
Actually, among my people there are a few stories about "Macintyres" reactions and actions that made difference in our history.

The evening has arrived…and with it the music, lights, and sounds of the breeze softly blowing through the palm trees. Everything comes together perfectly in Cartagena, to offer you the perfect night on the town. These are some of the best spots that you shouldn’t miss out on during your stay in Cartagena:

Getsemaní: This neighbourhood has become one of the hottest spots to party in the city. The infrastructure of the neighbourhood, along with the African and Caribbean rhythms has transformed Getseamaní into the perfect place to enjoy the night.
Some points of interest include: La Habana and Donde Fidel, where the latin salsa flavour can be experienced in all of its splendour.
Bocagrande: This is the hotel and tourist zone of the city, and offers some of the best parties and nightclubs. You can find everything you’re looking for, whether it be a bar, or a party that won’t stop until the sun comes up.

Some PCI compliance guys are making noises that our server is advertising SMTP Auth, since we don't use it we might as well just stop announcing it.
Uhm.. we're actually going to classify thit as a bug - if SpamFilter is not configured to use authentication, then your PCI guys are right - we should not advertise it being available.
FYI a patched build (v4.7.4.250) is now available for download in the registered user area. Thanks for the report!
Running v4.7.4.250, still seeing these - 07/11/18 07:25:19:033 -- (40641232) User failed AUTH LOGIN:
If a hacker tries to authenticate anyways... SpamFilter is simply sending to NULL the username/password and will simply ignore the auth request (but we are logging the attempted username/password in the logs so admins can see what the hacker is trying to do...).
My mail Server requires Authentication - I am not using SSL or TLS - How do I Pass this through the spam filter to the Server The Log entry is: User failed AUTH LOGIN: my IP Address
As mentioned in the support email, the issue is likely caused by this bug that is fixed in the licensed version of SpamFilter but that has not been added to the eval version yet:
{TODO -cFix : Outbound TLS connections were only being made with TLS 1.0, even if TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 were configured and in use correctly for inbound emails}
{TODO -cFix : Due to a regression error since v4.5, the AUTH LOGIN appeared in the welcome banner even if authentication was disabled in SpamFilter

In the first case INNER is a function expression, while in the second case INNER is a function declaration.
Javascript execution context has two Lexical Environments. One is called LexicalEnvironment (he-he), and another is VariableEnvironment [§10.3].
The CATCH statement introduces new LexicalEnvironment where E is defined, and leaves the VariableEnvironment untouched.
Function expression receives current LexicalEnvironment as its scope, while function declaration receives current VariableEnvironment as its scope [§13], therefore E is invisible for the function declaration.
To support this behavior, the variable INNER is created and bound to the function object early, when control enters the surrounding function; before any CATCH is executed; and therefore it doesn't see the variable introduced by the CATCH clause.
Unlike normal variables, visible in the scope of the whole enclosing function, the variable introduced by CATCH is only visible inside the CATCH clause:
During years of JS programming I never hit this difference in practice - never captured a catch variable by a closure. I only detected this strange thing when reading the standard in order to implement some code transformations needed for POCL, and was wondering, why does it need to distinguish LexicalEnvironment from VariableEnvironment.
BTW, another case when names are bound within a scope smaller that the enclosing function is the WITH statement. So it has the same problem regarding function expression / function declaration:

United States design patent #86,245 was granted to Gotthilf Lehmann on February 2nd, 1932 for the design of this particular glowing emblem lamp. Lehmann also patented the design for the German made Masonic emblem lamp shown elsewhere in the OSA category
Lehmann sued the Aerolux Light Corporation on May 1st, 1941 in a New York District Court for infringing on his design patents for both the Masonic emblem lamp and the Crucifix lamp. Aerolux refuted the case and argued that Lehmann’s two design patents were not valid to begin with since they allegedly “lacked invention”. The case was dismissed.

Liveable, sustainable cities are defined by their green spaces. And so landscape design is key to the long-term success of developments.
Landscape architects help developments work in sympathy with places, people and nature, so that buildings and infrastructure become valued, enduring assets.
“As landscape architects we don’t always need to make design statements; some of our best work is invisible. The profession is about delivering creative and sustainable solutions to real problems.”
Contemporary landscape design must tackle pressing challenges. So while our landscape solutions help create inspiring places, they are also strategies to produce more liveable cities, greater biodiversity and resilience to climate change. and better resource management.
Our landscape designers help steer sustainable outcomes on projects of any scale. We contribute to masterplans for new cities and renewal schemes worldwide. We are as well equipped to design landscape for major infrastructure projects as we are for streetscapes, the public realm, mixed-use developments, ecological habitats and green roofs.
We develop and realise pragmatic ideas that are economic and achievable as well as being better for people and the environment. For clients and design teams, we play an important interpretative role: taking the advice of environmental specialists and translating it into deliverable plans.
In one such project, Beam Parklands. we worked closely with the Environment Agency and Land Trust to create a new 53ha wetland park. Our design integrated and balanced advice from ecologists and other environmental specialists with the requirements of our engineering teams. The result is an award-winning new park, valued by local communities and purposefully linked to local ecology.
At Arup, landscape designers work closely with other specialists to produce more rounded solutions. We become part of integrated design teams from the start of complex projects such as the Pinewood Studios masterplan and the UK’s High Speed 1. By contributing early, we add greater value – whether by informing better designs, helping secure planning consents, or finding programme savings in cost, time and resources.
On High Speed 1 we worked closely with Arup engineers to set the railway unobtrusively within the landscape. To achieve that effect, we designed subtle landscape interventions using millions of cubic metres of excavated spoil – a resource-efficient approach that also significantly cut the costs of transporting and disposing of waste.
Likewise, our involvement in masterplanning helps developers act early on issues that will influence the acceptability of their plans. For Tangye New Town, China, for example, we created a city park designed to store flood water. Doing so, we avoided the cost of constructing flood management systems underground.
The Construction Carbon Calculator estimates embodied carbon. Embodied carbon is the carbon released when a product is manufactured, shipped to a project site and installed. This calculator looks at an entire project, and takes into account the site disturbance, landscape and ecosystem installation or restoration, building size and base materials of construction. It does this simply, requiring only basic information that is available to a project team very early in the design process.
The calculator provides an estimate that establishes a base number to clarify the carbon implications of the construction process - to be used as tool to address the reduction of that footprint. The results you obtain will be an estimation and approximate - accurate within 25%, plus or minus.
This first version of the carbon landscape model conservatively estimates the potential of the landscape to release and sequester carbon. (Please see the assumptions for more detail.) The Calculator's estimation demonstrates the role of the immediate landscape in the site carbon footprint and how it should be considered in the whole site design.
The value of the building carbon model will also increase through user input and more data sets. The base model takes the overall building square footage and divides it evenly between floors. A higher carbon footprint per square foot has been assumed for stories below grade to account for excavation work and soil removal from the site.
A complete life cycle analysis will provide more precise carbon quantities. There are various cost consultants, environmental consultants and life cycle software programs that will allow an interested party to generate a more accurate estimate of embodied carbon, however, we are not aware of one that will also address landscape impacts.
13-18% of the total embodied carbon footprint of any construction project (UNEP, 2007) and 100% of the total embodied carbon footprint of any landscape project is released the year the project is built or installed.
The remainder of the carbon footprint is the operational carbon released and the landscape carbon sequestered over the life of the project, typically 30 to 80 years.
Air travel represents about 13% of the total global transportation carbon footprint, and about 2% of the total overall global carbon footprint (Tufts, 2006). Embodied carbon in non-residential buildings contributes about 19% of the total overall global carbon footprint in the United Kingdom (BioRegional Development Group BedZed toolkit) making embodied construction carbon a significant percentage of the overall total. Embodied construction carbon is a more significant factor than air travel, and has an equally immediate impact.
Why is landscape significant? The ecoregion and the maintenance of landscaping both have an impact on the quantity of carbon that can be sequestered there. Certain landscapes, like wetlands, have the capacity to store significant amounts of carbon. This carbon is released when the landscape is disturbed or destroyed. Landscape should be considered in conjunction with the building and site design and can be a key element of carbon sequestration. This calculator is the first to allow landscape impacts to be quantified and applied to the full project embodied carbon footprint.
What about operational carbon? Operational carbon is a footprint that increases over the life of a building. Building design and the behavior of building occupants can greatly reduce that operational carbon footprint. The remaining carbon footprint can be addressed through the purchase of green power - power from renewable energy sources. Any carbon footprint not addressed this way can be offset. There are many carbon calculators and offset retailers that address operational carbon.
As summer is winding down I thought I would post a mix of old and new sounds from my studio. This soundtrack has been perfect for the long daylight hours of a Montana summer. I'm always interested to hear what you have been listening to so please leave comments about your new music, or your old summer favorites.
The first notes of this song transport me back to childhood beach trips to Ocean Isle, NC. As we left the mountains and got closer to the beach my parents would switch to vacation mode by popping beach music into the cassette player.
A got turned onto this great band through the ATO records Spring Sampler on Noise Trade. If you aren't familiar with them or Noise Trade they are both definitely worth a look.
Another family favorite for the summer. My dad would put this on and we would dance in the car. This would completely embarrass my older brother which only made us dance harder.
They just played the Newport Folk Fest which is available as a free download from NPR Music. A unique voice backed by toe tapping Americana music.
One of my favorite tracks off of Damian Marley's Grammy award winning Welcome to Jam Rock. Perfect sonic motivation for working late in the studio.
Ha....great bunch of tunes. Some I'm not too familiar with so I've written them down to explore while in the studio. Lately I've had a Pandora station playing called 'Mellow Happy Music' Lol good mix of kind of Americana, country, singer song writer kind of stuff. I also scored a few CD's (remember those?) of latin, indian, african, and a few other world music.
Tourist season is almost over and wont have to worry so much about drop in traffic in the studio and teaching workshops so I can CRANK up this Damian Marley album!!!
Good to hear from you. Thanks for reading the blog. Your Pandora channel sounds like a good studio mix. I've been listening to comedy on Pandora lately and its been a good uplift for my studio day.
A lot of these are new to me as well, so I'm looking forward to listening to them! As for me, this summer's highlights have been:
Thanks for reading the blog. Tallest Man on Earth is one of my favs but I'm not familiar with the others. Thanks for posting some new tunes.

The Library of the Centre for Advanced Study Sofia is developing collections of printed and electronic resources in the area of Humanities, Social Sciences, and Balkan Studies in the modern and contemporary era. It aims to serve as a Balkan information center about major scientific forums in these fields which take place in Bulgaria, the region of Southeast Europe and the Western Europe. The library is an open-stack, lending facility primarily designed for the use of CAS Fellows, but it is also open to the general public upon request. It provides library and reference services based on traditional and electronic information sources.
“The Balkan Bibliography” is a successful project of the CAS Library in co-operation with the National Library. It has created a bibliography of monographs, encyclopaedias, reference books and articles published in Bulgaria in the period 1985-2001. On the basis of the electronic databases a bibliographic index on ‘Bulgarian Publications in Balkan Studies 1985-2001’ has been published in April 2003.
CAS Library hosted a meeting of directors of Balkan national libraries and presidents of library associations from Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey in 2002, and a meeting of bibliographers from the national libraries of Bulgaria, Serbia and Macedonia on the 12th of June 2003.

Based on Lauren Hale’s enthusiasm, that sentence almost requires two exclamation points. Hale fell in love with the University at first sight — orientation, 2009 — and her experience as a student and alumna has only deepened that ardor.
Much of her initial passion was the result of a welcoming talk by Dr. Stefanie Whitby, then director of Alumni Relations Services and now senior director of the University Partnership Center. At the orientation, Hale expressed interest in a proposed Student Alumni Association. She was invited to the first meeting, where, she says with typical enthusiasm, “I had a blast.”
She subsequently became chapter chair and continues to serve in that post today. “Our mission is to bridge the gap between students and alumni,” Hale says. “We encourage students and recent alumni to join the chapter that is closest to their location.”
Alumni Relations Associate Stacey Stickel points out that all alumni are considered part of the Alumni Association. “There are approximately 300 active members who regularly attend chapter meetings and events,” she says. “The seven chapters are based on geography: New Castle County, Kent and Sussex, Pennsylvania,
Chapters host various events throughout the year. In Maryland, for instance, it’s the Crab Feast, and in Pennsylvania it’s Spirit of Philadelphia Boat Cruise. Hale ticks off the Student Alumni Association’s major events: Spring Fest, Kick-off the Semester Social at Iron Hill Brewery, Pause for a Cause, I Love WilmU Week, and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 5K.
Hale received her bachelor’s in Criminal Justice in 2010 and a master’s in Homeland Security and Information Assurance in 2012. Her take on her student experience is typically impassioned: “Great instructors. Best place I could’ve ever been while having a full-time job. You can work around your schedule — online classes, night classes, Saturday classes.”
A resident of Mantua, New Jersey, Hale is senior account and marketing manager at Hire Edge Logistics Personnel in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
“Being part of the Alumni Association has helped me grow my leadership and networking skills,” she says. “There have been opportunities afforded to me in leadership and networking that I would have not gotten anywhere else and have truly shaped me into the professional I am today.” WU

I've been having lots of fun with scraps the last week. Making little lambs means lots of little tiny pieces of chenille lying around, and they work wonderfully on red foxes. And all the tincy little pieces of blanket and fur make little bunnies and bears... my scrap piles are dwindling again.
Oh that fox is so gorgeous!! I'm not crazy about foxes but yours is super sweet. What a great idea using chenille in this way, it looks ace xo

Look at all the detail and attention in those dolls. They make me a little restless, & the blogs are pretty amazing too. Hope you like them as much as I do! :)
I know how you feel about making dolls. I would love to make more. But I honestly need to be in that head and physical space.

It is not often that we are invited to think of God as mother. Two occasions can be found in the book of the prophet Isaiah. First, we hear God speaking the beautiful words: "Can a mother forget her infant,/be without tenderness for the child of her womb?/Even should she forget, /I will never forget you" (Isaiah 49:15).
Then, today we hear words of comfort addressed to the exiles in Babylon, calling them to rejoice with Jerusalem, to exult with her. God will make a new Jerusalem and all her children will be nursed at her breasts. Then suddenly the image shifts from Jerusalem as mother and the peoples as nurslings to God as mother: "As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you" (66:13).
Jesus sends out the seventy-two disciples to bring comfort by proclaiming that "The kingdom of God is at hand for you" (Luke10:9). The first words of the disciples when they enter a house are to be "Peace to this household" (10:5). The God who comforts wishes to dwell with us in peace.
In concluding his fiery letter to the Galatians, Paul wishes peace and mercy to all who follow him in boasting in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through Christ's dying on the cross a new creation is coming into being.
We are always free to reject this peace, to refuse God's comfort, to avoid entering into the dying and rising of Christ. Yet Eucharist offers us the opportunity to open our hearts once again to God doing new things in and through us.

Now—more than at any time in its history—the Church addresses believers with a variety of teachings. The Catechism of the Catholic Church alone presents 2865 numbered paragraphs of teaching in almost 700 pages! This is just one of several official catechisms, and there are many other forms Church teaching takes—from homilies to bishops' articles in diocesan newspapers to papal encyclicals and documents of Church councils. But what if I disagree with one or several of the teachings I encounter in these sources? Join us on Wednesday evening, July 14, from 7:30 to 9:00 in the Pastoral Center to address this question. We will discuss the place of Church teachings in the Christian life, the kinds of teaching and the responses they call for, and the role of conscience. This is a special session of our RCIA (Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) that is open to the whole parish.
To the following parishioners who have attained honor roll status at Aquinas Academy. These middle and high school students include: Marile Schraut with Highest Honors, Caroline Henry with High Honors and Clare Mortenson with Honors.
INFANT BAPTISM is celebrated at noon on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month. Please make arrangements with the parish secretary at least 2 weeks prior to the desired date.
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN BECOMING A CATHOLIC? R.C.I.A. is the process which enables adults to become initiated into the Church. Call the pastor for information.
St. Scholastica Parish on Saturdays after 9:00 a.m. Mass. For your convenience, the parishes in our cluster have the following opportunities for reconciliation:
I’ve been wanting to try Ellary’s Greens since they opened, but just never quite made it there. Until my friend Mirva had her birthday lunch. Ellary’s menu focuses on natural, organic vegetarian food with limited meat and fish options. Butter and cream are banned from the kitchen. Menu clearly indicates what dishes are vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free and dairy-free. Decor is very warm and earth-tones rule the restaurant. Plus lots of greens. This is a place where I could hang out writing blog posts, sipping some delicious green juice and snacking some vegan delights. Note that they do not offer WiFi, so if you need to be connected find another spot.
ELLARY’S GREENS juice was absolutely frigging mind-blowingly delicious: kale, green apple, lime. So simple!

“Come now, let us reason together,” says the LORD. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool. If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land; but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
By giving humans freedom of will, the Creator has chosen to limit His own power. He risked the daring experiment of giving us the freedom to make good or bad decisions, to live decent or evil lives, because God does not want the forced obedience of slaves. Instead, He covets the voluntary love and obedience of sons who love Him for Himself.
The commandment of God is, that we love Our Lord in all our heart, in all our soul, in all our thought. In all our heart; that is, in all our understanding without erring. In all our soul; that is, in all our will without gainsaying. In all our thought; that is, that we think on Him without forgetting. In this manner is very love and true, that is work of man’s will. For love is a willful stirring of our thoughts unto God, so that it receive nothing that is against the love of Jesus Christ, and therewith that it be lasting in sweetness of devotion; and that is the perfection of this life.
See, the day of the LORD is coming—a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger—to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
The holiness of God, the wrath of God, and the health of the creation are inseparably united. Not only is it right for God to display anger at sin, but I find it impossible to understand how He could do otherwise.
And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
[Jesus] went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”
We do not know if it is God’s will that this or that person should recover from sickness, or this or that calamity should be averted. God is wiser than we are. We do not know whether it is God’s will that we should have rain that is so necessary for our crops. There are things like these that lie in a region of uncertainty into which the intelligence of man cannot penetrate. So then as the object of prayer is not to bring the divine will down to the human, but to lift the human up into correspondence with the divine, for all these uncertain things we can pray indeed, but uncertainly—‘If it be possible, let this or that come to pass; nevertheless, not my will, but Thine, be done.’
Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.
It is further objected that [Jesus] hath left us no example of that, which by many is esteemed the only religious state of life; viz. perfect retirement from the world, for the more devout serving of God, and freeing us from the temptations of the world, such as is that of monks and hermits; this, perhaps, may seem to some a great oversight and omission: but our Lord in great wisdom thought fit to give us a pattern of a quite different sort of life, which was, not to fly the conversation of men, and to live in a monastery or a wilderness, but to do good among men, to live in the world with great freedom, and with great innocency. He did, indeed, sometimes retire himself for the more free and private exercise of devotion, as we ought to do; but he passed his life chiefly in the conversation of men, that they might have all the benefit that was possible of his instruction and example. We read, that “he was carried into the wilderness to be tempted;” but not that he lived there to avoid temptation. He hath given us an example of denying the world, without leaving it.
[Jesus:] “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.”
Lord, enlighten us to see the beam that is in our own eye, and blind us to the mote that is in our brother’s. Let us feel our offences with our hands, make them great and bright before us like the sun, make us eat them and drink them for our diet. Blind us to the offences of our beloved, cleanse them from our memories, take them out of our mouths for ever. Let all here before Thee carry and measure with the false balances of love, and be in their own eyes and in all conjunctures the most guilty. Help us at the same time with the grace of courage, that we be none of us cast down when we sit lamenting amid the ruins of our happiness or our integrity: touch us with fire from the altar, that we may be up and doing to rebuild our city: in the name and by the method of him in whose words of prayer we now conclude.

For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
[Christian Unity] is not a secular unity, and must be prompted by no secular motive. The unity we seek is deeper than anything that the world offers. Communism, Fascism, National Socialism, and even Shintoism have proved their ability to bind men together in a common enterprise with great devotion and self-sacrifice; but these are secular ideals, intermixed with self-interest, the love of mastery, and the use of force. Christian Unity can only be “in Christ.” It is based on the New Birth and New Life in Christ, and upon the oneness of all the members in the Christ who is the Head. Therefore, “the quest for the unity of the Church must in fact be identical with the quest for Jesus Christ as the concrete Head and Lord of the Church.” *
What kind of unity, then, do we ask? It must be God’s kind, that for which Christ prayed, and which, therefore, must be in the line of God’s purpose. Will He not then take the initiative? It is for us to wait upon Him, and to go through the gates which He opens, to cast up the highway, to gather out the stones of stumbling, to lift up the standard, and to prepare the way of the Lord. (Isa. 62:10)
Through [Jesus Christ] and for his name’s sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.
More than any other religion or, indeed, than any other element in human experience, Christianity has made for the intellectual advance of man in reducing languages to writing, creating literatures, promoting education from primary grades through institutions of university level, and stimulating the human mind and spirit to fresh explorations into the unknown. It has been the largest single factor in combating, on a world-wide scale, such ancient foes of man as war, disease, famine, and the exploitation of one race by another. More than any other religion, it has made for the dignity of human personality. This it has done by a power inherent within it of lifting lives from selfishness, spiritual mediocrity, and moral defeat and disintegration, to unselfish achievement and contagious moral and spiritual power [and] by the high value which it set upon every human soul through the possibilities which it held out of endless growth in fellowship with th e eternal God.
[Peter:] “Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders. But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord, and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you—even Jesus.”
What men turn to is more important than what they turn from, even if that to which they turn is only a higher moral truth; but to turn to Christ is far more important than to turn to higher moral truth: it is to turn the face towards Him in whom is all moral truth; it is to turn to Him in whom is not only the virtue which corresponds to the known vice from which the penitent desires to flee, but all virtue; it is to turn the face to all holiness, all purity, all grace. It was this repentance which the apostles preached after Pentecost.
In Romans 7, St. Paul says, “The law is spiritual.” What does that mean? If the law were physical, then it could be satisfied by works, but since it is spiritual, no one can satisfy it unless everything he does springs from the depths of the heart. But no one can give such a heart except the Spirit of God, who makes the person be like the law, so that he actually conceives a heartfelt longing for the law and henceforward does everything, not through fear or coercion, but from a free heart.
Lord, lead me to know what You desire from me, and grant a cheerful heart to do it. CQOD Blog email RSS
Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart. In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
Only he who flings himself upward when the pull comes to drag him down, can hope to break the force of temptation. Temptation may be an invitation to hell, but much more is it an opportunity to reach heaven. At the moment of temptation, sin and righteousness are both very near the Christian; but, of the two, the latter is the nearer.
He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.” In reply Jesus declared, “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”
Jesus’ good news, then, was that the Kingdom of God had come, and that he, Jesus, was its herald and expounder to men. More than that, in some special and mysterious way, he was the kingdom.

It's been almost a year since my last product review, which was the Skechers GoRun Speed. In the time since, I've had the unfortunate experience of #OopsIBrokeMySpine and the long road to recovery coming back.
As part of that recovery, it was also peak time for a new pair of shoes. My good friend Seth had opened up Granite City Running this past winter. As part of his opening, he had Newton Running come to the event with some demo pair of footwear. After chatting with their rep, as well as Seth talking up the Kismet, I decided to try a pair on.
I immediately knew that I was going to need to take a pair for a long-term test. I bought the orange pair that you see above in April from GCR and have been piling on the miles in it over the last two months.
The Kismet was a new model for Newton during 2014, as part of the year-long switch from the original four-lug platform to the new five-lug shoes. Part of this was due to advances in manufacturing tolerances; Newton had always wanted to be able to do five-lugs, but couldn't ensure the quality of the manufacturing to ensure the lugs would actually stay on the shoe when they were pushed out to the edges of the outsole.
In the image above, you have an old Newton Distance S; underneath, a Newton Tri Racer. As you can see, the five-lug pattern pushes out to the lateral edges of the midsole, whereas the old four-lug placement required a decent amount of offset from the edges.
The Kismet is part of the "P.O.P 2" family in the Newton line. Newton divides the line-up into the three distinct ranges:
P.O.P. 1: These are the classic shoes in the Newton family: the Gravity, Distance, and Motion ranges. They feature the lowest drops, most exposed lugs, and the classic Newton responsive ride.
P.O.P. 2: Referred to as the "Core" models, these shoes have a slightly higher drop than the P.O.P. 1 shoes. The lug pattern is also slightly less obtrusive, while also featuring slightly more cushioning than some of the P.O.P. 1 shoes.
P.O.P. 3: The most "traditional" of all Newtons, the lugs barely protrude from the outsole. These are designed to get people used to the feel of a Newton before transitioning into one of the other two families of shoes.
It's not so much the lugs that you should be worried about, it is the membrane that the compress into. This Action/Reaction membrane is compressed upon impact and then provides energy return. This is what gives Newton their snappy feel and has led to the claims from runners that they simply run faster in a pair of Newton's than anything else.
The Kismet is Newton's stability shoe in the P.O.P. 2 line. Newton takes a non-traditional approach to stability these days; rather than putting in a medial post to try to slow the rate of pronation, Newton fills out the shoe under the midfoot for maximum ground contact. This creates a more stable platform for the entirety of the foot to land on. Newton found during development that this approach provided a more stable and natural experience for runners with higher pronation rates.
The Kismet weighs in at 9.7 ounces in a size 9, with a 4.5 mm drop. Naturally, I have to take these published weights with the whole shaker of salt in my size 13 boats.
One of the primary things I noted when I slid my foot into the demo pair of Kismets back in December was what I didn't notice:
I've put about 200 miles on the shoe thus far and can say that, for the most part, those initial feelings continue to hold true. Unfortunately, the Newton logo attachment on the medial side, coupled with an overlay, tends to bunch up a little bit on the side of the foot over time; I've blistered a few times over in this spot.
That said, though, the ride of the shoe has been a revelation. I had a pair of the original Newton Motions, which I found the lugs to be overly obtrusive and the ride too harsh for long runs. Newton has finally found the feel balance: well cushioned yet responsive enough that you really feel the snappiness of the shoe when you pick up the pace.
A note: be prepared for the shoe to sound a little slappy, especially on some downhills. Don't be alarmed; it's just the AR membrane compressing in the heel. It took me a minute to figure out what the sound was, but it has not impacted overall performance of the shoe at all.
The beauty of this shoe is that it is light enough to race long distances in, while still retaining the cushioning and feel of an everyday trainer. It is an excellent swiss-army knife to add to your running arsenal, assuming that you need that touch of stability on offer here.

New community-run league starts on December 3! Check out the league thread for details and sign-up instructions.
- Fixed a case where a player would skip the loading screen, resulting in unpredictable game glitches
- Fixed a rare case where your client would "reconnect" to another game in progress when your game server crashed during the loading screen
- Fixed a bug where bots taking over for leavers sometimes wouldn’t build (and would actually cause the game to lag)
If are you interested in helping test bots in the future, type -bot in debug mode in a custom game to have a bot take over your lane.
- Fixed a bug where sometimes auras wouldn't get applied if your lane aggroed too quickly (Aura targets are now computed at the start of the wave, rather than when the ability is cast)
- Fixed a bug where units with multiple auras would only use the targets of the first aura (e.g. a Leviathan with Hero - the Hero aura would mistakenly only affect flying units)
- Improved UI for when FairPlay is globally disabled (now hides alert status/mute status in lobby and in-game)
The Bone Warrior line is monopolizing a lot of Forsaken's power. Nerfing these units allows us to buff underperforming units, such as Gateguard and Nightmare.
This change is intended to nerf Pyro opening only for Mech because it forces you to receive a Snail on 1 or send a Snail on 1 or 2 to afford the 4th worker on wave 2. The +3 income in Mastermind will give you just enough gold.
The bug fix to auras indirectly buffed Harpy/Sky Queen, but that fix only happened 2 days ago, so we need more time to evaluate
This change should make Sea Serpent/Deepcoiler weaker when massed without nerfing their intended use as a flanker. If this change is ineffective, we have some ideas for a mini redesign.
In fact, the reason why they are cheaper, ha sless to do with quality but rather lower labour costs, cheaper type of laquer and apply methods etc.Japanese Fenders are considered to be above the Mexicans and perhaps even just as good as the US.Alder is also the most neutral sounding of the commonly used wood types with a full tone, well balanced lower end a hint of mid range.
Alder is used in most Fender Strats mainly because of its light weight and it’s easy to finish due to minimal grain lines.
Squier Classic Vibe The Classic Vibe series captures the essence of the 50s and 60s models with all the characteristics and looks.
This can easily be adjusted later on, so don’t dismiss a perfectly good guitar just because the setup isn’t how you normally prefer it.
Keep in mind though that there’s a difference between a setup that you don’t like and a bad setup caused by poor assembly and parts. Over the last decade, Squire has regained much of its old reputation of producing high quality instruments for even the tightest budgets.
A good tip when you’re trying out new guitars is to focus on how the guitar plays and sound acoustically.
Don’t start by plugging it into a loud amp and lots of pedals but listen to the acoustics, the natural resonance and sustain.
However, over the last decade or so, the MIMs has gotten a considerable face lift and the overall quality is very high.

U.S. Army sergeants are learning they have to practice their writing competence as well as their marksmanship skills if they want to be promoted. Recognizing the importance of concise communication, the military has decided to mandate certain standards for soldiers to pass some advancement examinations.
Soldiers who want to move up the promotional ladder are finding that knowing when to use “there” “their” and “they’re” is required to communicate effectively up and down the chain of command.
The Pentagon has issued new guidelines for all branches of the military and has have encouraged soldiers to take courses in English composition. The website Military.com wrote about the military’s new standards for writing and grammar in an article Army to Require Polished Writing Skills for NCO Promotions.
Grammar and math are two subjects people seem to have either an aptitude or aversion for and it’s difficult for many as adults to go back to school and confront them again. Modern technology sometimes entices us to cheat, and many people will get away with it if they can. “Just Google it” is a universal phrase these days and the website Mathway solves math problems if you can’t remember your high school algebra.

Kremlin allegations of an oppressed Russian-speaking Ukrainian minority are an absurd distortion of a bilingual and tolerant culture in which Russian remains the dominant language
Russian-speaking Ukrainians are not necessarily pro-Kremlin. To anyone who has lived in Ukraine and experienced the country’s laid-back bilingualism firsthand, this statement might seem redundant. However, for many of the international correspondents currently reporting on the Ukraine crisis, it may come as something of a surprise. After all, Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and subsequent intervention in east Ukraine have been depicted by Moscow as a crusade to save Ukraine’s allegedly oppressed Russian-speaking minority from impending genocide.
The Kremlin narrative of oppressed Russian-speakers has always appeared absurd to ordinary Ukrainians, but this has not prevented it from becoming a convenient way for foreign reporters to bypass the complexities of Ukrainian identity politics. Time after time over the past eighteen months, correspondents struggling to explain the Ukraine crisis to their international audience have sought relief in the easy-to-understand-yet-hopelessly-inadequate formula of Ukrainian-speaking West Ukraine vs Russian-speaking East Ukraine.
"Ukraine’s multicultural past has helped foster a climate of tolerance that provides Russian-speakers with the kind of freedoms their Russian neighbours can only dream of"
In this crudely simplified version of Ukrainian reality, all of the country’s Ukrainian-speakers are uniformly pro-European in sentiment, while the Russian speakers are necessarily pro-Kremlin. The boundaries on the accompanying maps are always stark and distinct, with Russian and Ukrainian speakers treated as clearly defined and completely separate ethnic groups engaged in a zero-sum game for control of the Ukrainian state.
Real-life Ukraine is not nearly so straightforward. The first and most glaring problem with these attempts to divide Ukraine neatly into rival camps of Russian and Ukrainian speakers is the notion that speaking Russian somehow implies political allegiance to Moscow. Not only is this not true – it actually flies in the face of contemporary Ukrainian reality and does a great disservice to the millions of patriotic Ukrainians who just so happen to be Russian-speakers. Many of the Ukrainian volunteer battalions currently defending the country in east Ukraine are composed of Russian-speaking troops who grew up in the region. Meanwhile, around half of the current Ukrainian government, which is by far the most reform-minded and pro-EU in the country’s history, are native Russian-speakers.
The prominence of Russian-speakers in Ukraine’s frontlines and higher political echelons is, by Ukrainian standards, unremarkable, and would have passed largely unnoticed by Ukrainians themselves if the Kremlin hadn’t claimed that a genocide of Russian-speakers was underway. Speaking Russian is simply not regarded as a political statement in Ukraine. It says nothing about the personal beliefs or geopolitical sympathies of the speaker, and cannot be employed as shorthand to indicate an individual’s political affiliation.
The issue of Ukrainian bilingualism also undermines Russian claims of oppressive Ukrainian language policies. The boundaries between Russian-speakers and Ukrainian-speakers in today’s Ukraine are far from distinct – in reality these boundaries are blurred, and in many cases, overlapping. While most Ukrainians identify one or other of the two languages as their mother tongue, in practice it is rare to find someone who genuinely struggles to make themselves understood in either. Far from living in mutual antagonism, the vast majority of Ukrainians enjoy some degree of fluency in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages, and are capable of using them interchangeably in their everyday lives.
"Far from facing extinction, the Russian language appears to be thriving in the new Ukraine, where it remains the de facto street language in most Ukrainian cities"
It is common to see Ukrainian and Russian spoken alternately in the same conversation, with no offense taken by either side. Perhaps even more commonplace is the practice of speaking in the ‘surzhik’ dialect, which combines elements of Russian and Ukrainian, thereby upsetting purists and snobs in both linguistic camps, while accurately reflecting the hybrid and dynamic nature of language politics in modern Ukraine.
Even if we choose to ignore the extremely high incidence of bilingualism in Ukraine and, for the sake of argument, accept that the population is divisible into mutually exclusive Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking groups, the resulting picture would nevertheless remain largely unsatisfactory. Broadly speaking, Russian is indeed the lingua franca in the cities of southern and eastern Ukraine, but in the surrounding countryside, you are far more likely to encounter people speaking Ukrainian.
Then there is Kyiv. Typically depicted as being located firmly within the ‘Ukrainian-speaking’ western half of the country, the Ukrainian capital is actually the biggest Russian-speaking city in the entire world outside of Russia itself. Confusingly, it is also a bastion of pro-European political sentiment and fount of Russian-speaking Ukrainian patriotism.
Nor is there much evidence of anti-Russian language discrimination in post-Maidan Ukraine. The entire ‘oppressed Russian-speaker’ narrative is usually justified by reference to a single parliamentary vote held in early 2014 in the immediate aftermath of President Yanukovych’s flight from Ukraine. The parliamentary decision to strip Russian of regional state language status - a status granted by the Yanukovych government just a few years earlier - never came into force. Nor was it a particularly radical step – it would merely have returned Ukraine to the linguistic status quo which had existed in the country for the first two decades of post-Soviet independence. It was certainly not, as the Kremlin would have us believe, a step along the road towards genocidal fascist dictatorship.
Beyond this single vote, there is literally no evidence whatsoever of Russian-speakers in Ukraine suffering from any form of discrimination. Probes by international agencies like the UN and human rights groups such as Amnesty International have repeatedly rejected Moscow claims of an oppressed Russian-speaking minority.
Far from facing extinction, the Russian language appears to be thriving in the new Ukraine, where it remains the de facto street language in most Ukrainian cities and continues to dominate TV, radio, online media, and the printed press. All the best slang terms and swear words are still in Russian.
A visit to a press kiosk in Kyiv will confirm that somewhere between 80% and 90% of all available print publications are in the Russian-language. Despite efforts to cut back on Russian TV content, Moscow-produced soap operas and other Russian programming continue to dot the country’s daily TV schedules. Ukrainian pop stars release albums featuring songs in both languages, while Ukrainian football commentating teams often feature one Ukrainian-speaker and one Russian-speaker. Almost every evening, the country’s endless political talk shows feature a dizzying megamix of linguistic switches as the talking heads move from Russian to Ukrainian and back again, usually while shouting at each other. It is a confusing situation and one that the uninitiated often find hard to grasp, but it works in Ukraine.
This linguistic pluralism is a product of Ukraine’s rich multicultural heritage, which stretches back for centuries. A melting pot land for as long as anyone can remember, Ukraine’s multicultural past has helped foster a climate of tolerance that provides Russian-speakers with the kind of freedoms their Russian neighbours can only dream of.
Unsurprisingly, the relative freedoms enjoyed by Russian-language Ukrainians have not gone entirely unnoticed inside the Russian Federation itself. Some Russian writers and journalists have already taken advantage of these freedoms to publish their work in Ukraine, while a number of prominent Russian TV journalists have established themselves in Kyiv in a bid to ply their trade without having to cope with the Kremlin censors.
There is every reason to expect this trend to intensify in the coming years as the current trickle of Russian intelligentsia émigrés becomes a flood. Post-Maidan Ukraine is already the freest Russian-speaking nation in the world. It now stands poised to become a global focus for freethinking Russian-language dialogue.
In previous centuries, Ukraine provided Russia with some of its most important religious figures and literary greats. It is quite possible that the next generation of Russian thinkers will also emerge from the relatively unrestrained atmosphere of Ukraine. This Russian-language pedigree should be a source of national pride for Ukrainians and a cause for considerable concern in the Kremlin. Russian-speaking Ukrainians may not need rescuing by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, but they might yet have a key role to play in the battle for hearts and minds inside Russia itself.

The notion of $f$-derivations of UP-algebras is introduced, some useful examples are discussed, and related properties are investigated. Moreover, we show that the fixed set and the kernel of $f$-derivations are UP-subalgebras of UP-algebras,and also give examples to show that the two sets are not UP-ideals of UP-algebras in general.

Of all the fabled swords of legend, none hold more power or mystery than Excalibur. Now, Skye Mathers will learn her connection to the legendary sword once wielded by King Arthur, when she falls under the spell of the magical and deadly Lady of the Lake.
Stories of Camelot have been told on earth for ages. The Legend of King Arthur and Excalibur had long been considered nothing more than a fairy tale by most historians. But Camelot was once a real place and now the tales behind the legend will finally be revealed…and the truth of its history is much more a nightmare than a fairy tale.
As Merlin continues remaking Camelot in his image, the Black Knight may be regretting her decision to turn down his offer. Meanwhile, Skye takes a trip that may hold the answers to everything.

It has already been established that I did a mighty amount of shopping during our pre-christmas trip to England. I did a good chunk of it at Superdrug, a beauty chain with some pharmacy services, that offers a lot of cheap makeup brands that I can’t get back home. Now, I like the products Superdrug carries. I don’t like the actual shops at all.
There are two reasons I don’t like the shops, and they are closely connected. One is that there is a lack of upkeep in the shop. Missing or used-up samplers are rarely replaced, and the shelves are equally rarely cleaned and tidied. Second is the costumer base — cheap makeup means lots and lots of teenagers. These teenagers do not give rat’s ass about how they leave the place. When they use samplers, they spread product over half the shelf. If they can’t find samplers, they’ll just open the product they want and try it, putting it right back if they don’t want it. Y’know, behaviour that most other shops would consider theft.
The two factors combined means the average Superdrug is a filthy mess. The only reason I go back is because it’s months between each visit, and in that time I manage to convince myself it’s not that bad. This is wrong. It is that bad.
At the first Superdrug, I picked up a Bourjois mascara and a powder. The mascara is a gimmicky type that comes with a small battery-powered motor that rotates the brush. Sitting down in a coffee shop post-shopping I noticed the battery cover and the battery was missing, and they were not lying loose in the bag. Back to the shop with it. The cashier offered me a replacement, but the only possible replacement had been left turned on, letting the battery run down. I got a refund instead, with the shop keeping my receipt.
With no receipt, I’m sure you can imagine how trilled I was when I later found out that the mirror in the powder compact was cracked. The powder itself was covered in plastic, so there shouldn’t be any glass bits in it…
At the second Superdrug, Sleek was my main target. I grabbed two three-shades compacts of blushers. The compacts were boxed, and I didn’t want to be that rude person opening boxes. Bad mistake to make at Superdrug.
Finger marks in every colour. Someone opened both of these, sampled the colours with their fingers, then put the compacts back in the box and back on the shelf. Ugh.
Mugging a guy is a LOT easier if you run him over first. I know I've seen this design but I can't think of what one it's from. why is she not taking the job back (as offered) and looking for a lawyer instead.

Of course anyone that has anything to say about the left must love the Trumpster. They pooled accidents from drunk driving in with the rest of the risk, and although it's certainly a risk caused by drinking, a huge portion of that risk is to people other than the drinker, so abstinence wouldn't make one completely safe from it's effects and if one doesn't drink and drive, teetotaling wouldn't make other people any safer either in that respect.

This just out from the World Archaeological Congress plenary session. I did not attend, so I did not hear the arguments that were made there, and I need to digest the statement, but it seems at first glance ethically misguided in several ways. More to come, but here's the statement. It is preceded by a press release which Jon Price, member of the WAC executive committee, notes (in his comment below) is not WAC's officially authorized press release. (WAC's official release does not specify that WAC has a policy to refuse to cooperate with the military, and WAC does support the Hague Convention.)
it is important to indicate that this text was forwarded to the assembly of WAC from the plenary session at the end of conference, but was critically reworded by WAC council. This is not a WAC press release. The press release as authorised by the president, is more circumspect and does NOT specify that WAC has a policy to refuse to cooperate with the military. WAC supports the Hague Convention.
It appears to me that, rather, both "pro-engagement" and "anti-collaboration" archaeologists support the Hague Convention and the UN Charter, but they find themselves in the invidious position of needing to choose the lesser of two evils.
The pro-engagement archaeologists regard themselves as professionals first, for whom, being archaeologists, violation of the Hague Convention would be a greater evil.
The anti-collaboration archaeologists regard themselves as individuals first, for whom, being citizens, violation of the UN Charter (by collaboration in an aggressive war) would be a greater evil.
First, just to be clear, we are not talking about WAC's official position but of the vote that was taken at a plenary session (see Jon Price's clarification and my later blog on this).
It is not possible to support the Hague Convention without also supporting collaboration with the military, since only archaeologists can provide the site coordinates for archaeological sites. So a choice needs to be made. But the real question is whether collaborating to protect archaeological sites and museums is aiding the military in the conduct of war. The military would be less hampered if it had fewer -- or no -- sites on its no-strike list because archaeologists refused to supply them. The targeters who spent many hours inputting the coordinates of archaeological sites could spend their time instead targeting electrical grids, roads, etc., as well as pure military targets. Non-collaboration in this sense makes it easier for the military to fight the war that you (and I) deem immoral. To call for non-collaboration on this particular issue is misguided. As a citizen, you should be concerned with both the immorality of an illegal war, and with the immorality of a war conducted without the restrictions of the laws of war, including the 1954 Hague Convention.
Yes, I understood that WAC6's vote was not WAC's position, but in disavowing the press release of the authors of the resolution, Jon Price stated that (the organisation) WAC doesn't have a policy of non-cooperation with the military and that 'WAC supports the Hague Convention', which rather suggests that the resolution (and thus (the conference, delegates, whoever) WAC6, which passed it), does not.
The choice of the lesser of two evils, nevertheless, does not imply that the lesser evil is a good; anti-collaboration archaeologists are not rejecting the Hague Convention, but upholding the UN Charter. If the UN Charter were not being violated by the militaries, the anti-collaboration archaeologists would cooperate with them; however, in the case of Iraq, and, God forbid, Iran, it is/would be an aggressive war, which violates the UN Charter.
Having seen some brusque exchanges between archaeologists (I hasten to add, none of the ones named here), and heard some remarkably unacademic language used by one side of the argument, I thought identifying where the archaeological community split.
It will not bring them any closer together, but it might hope to restore a little mutual respect. After all, they are both implementing international law. It is just that both international laws may not be implemented simultaneously.
As George Monbiot observed on the 17th of October 2006, not only have activists disrupting the arms trade and military activity been cleared of criminal charges in several countries, but:
the German federal administrative court threw out the charge of insubordination against a major in the German army. He had refused to obey an order which, he believed, would implicate him in the invasion of Iraq. The judges determined that the UN charter permits a state to go to war in only two circumstances: in self-defence, and when it has been authorised to do so by the UN security council. The states attacking Iraq, they ruled, had no such licence. Resolution 1441, which was used by the British and US governments to justify the invasion, contained no authorisation. The war could be considered an act of aggression.
Thus, at least in Germany, if not in Britain (where wars of aggression are not illegal under domestic law, and thus not citeable as lawful excuses for criminal acts), non-cooperation with the military is legally defensible.
If archaeologists refused to cooperate with aggressors to uphold the Hague Convention, they would infringe upon, or cause the infringement of, the Hague Convention, but they would uphold, or refrain from violating, the UN Charter.
Thus, both sides are principled positions; and indeed, both sides are legal positions, insofar as no-one has been prosecuted for cooperating, but contrarily, people have been exonerated for resisting. Yet, something, somewhere in the system, must change.
Still, even the establishment of a "Cultural Red Cross/Crescent" - or the effective implementation of one, if the International Committee of the Blue Shield is already supposed to be just that - would not rescue us from this problem, because the planning of the wars would still require cultural heritage to be protected.
Sorry, but anti-collaboration archaeologists are indeed rejecting the Hague Convention. The whole point of the resolution was to stigmatize any archaeologists who did try to make sure the military fulfilled its obligations under that Convention. That is a big mistake, for both practical and logical reasons. The logic, again, is that fulfilling this obligation is a constraint on military action -- it makes it more difficult, not easier, to wage war. If archaeologists oppose a war on the grounds that it is illegal under the Charter, they should see the Hague Convention as one among many things they can do to limit that warmaking. They should also protest vociferously of course.
I understand the logical and practical arguments you're making; I do not necessarily deny them, in a narrow sense, at least, but I do fear that they reduce us to acquiescence to any and all crimes.
Nevertheless, if anti-collaboration archaeologists are rejecting the Hague Convention, then pro-engagement archaeologists are rejecting the UN Charter. Do you think pro-engagement archaeologists would agree to that characterisation? To mirror your argument, it is not possible to support the UN Charter without also rejecting collaboration with an aggressive military.

My name is Lisa Brooks and I’m a twisted psycho. I wasn’t always a total nutcase. Before the accident, I thought I was doing pretty okay.
My family moved to Shadyside in February. It took a little while to adjust to a new house, a new town, and a new high school. That’s normal, right?
I had some hard times. I was lonely at first. I missed my friends back in Shaker Heights. Shadyside High was big and confusing, and most everyone I met had been going there forever and already had a group of friends.
I’d walk down the long halls to class, and everyone was laughing and talking, and sometimes I felt as if I didn’t exist. I’m a little shy, and it’s not easy for me to go up to someone I don’t know and just start talking. So I felt kind of invisible my first few weeks there.
But by April, I was beginning to feel at home. I was making friends. Saralynn O’Brien and I were hanging out a lot. We seemed to have the same sense of humor and the same bad attitude about guys and school. We both thought high school was basically a crock—something you had to get through so your real life could start. And we both thought guys were an inferior species, inferior but necessary.
Yes. Necessary. I even had a boyfriend by April. Nate Goodman. I met him when I walked out of the cafeteria, bumped him from behind at the top of the stairs, and sent him tumbling headfirst to the bottom. I had my eyes on my phone and didn’t even see him.
Luckily, Nate is a pretty slick acrobat. He managed to somersault most of the way. He had a few cuts that were bleeding a little, but he didn’t break his neck.
Of course I went tearing down the stairs to make sure he was okay. He sat there shaking his head. I think he was dazed a little. I huddled over him. “Are you okay?”
I apologized at least a hundred times and helped pull him to his feet. I felt terrible. At least a dozen kids stopped to stare at us.
Nate is a good-looking dude. He’s tall and lanky. He has straight black hair that he’s always brushing back from his forehead, round dark brown eyes, and an easy smile that makes a dimple appear on his right cheek.
“You’re Lisa, right?” He studied me. “Saralynn told me about you. She didn’t warn me you were dangerous.”
I gave him a look. “Yes, I’m very dangerous.” I guess that was my idea of flirting. I had pulled him to his feet. Now I realized I was still holding onto his arm. “How do you know Saralynn?”
He wiped more blood off his forehead with the sleeve of his black T-shirt. “We grew up near each other. On the same block.”
Saralynn and I are juniors. I hate that word, but it’s awkward to say you’re in eleventh grade. “You need to see the nurse,” I said. “That cut on your forehead is kinda bad.”
“Yeah, I collect posters and comics and masks and stuff,” he said. “You seem to know a lot about me.”
I shrugged again. I could feel my face growing hot. It was true. Saralynn and I did talk about him a lot. Ever since we watched him read a long Edgar Allan Poe poem at the senior talent show. I thought he was hot. Strange but hot.
I had a strong feeling about him. Like some kind of laser force field pulling me toward him. A hundred years ago, I think they called it love at first sight. Cornball music would be playing with lots of violins.
What I mean to say is that I liked the way he looked at me, and I liked talking to him. I even thought he looked cool with a line of blood leaking across his forehead.
Nate and I have been hanging out ever since. Sometimes it’s just the two of us. Sometimes it was like the night of April 12, when we went to the hamburger hangout, Lefty’s, with Saralynn and Nate’s friend Isaac Brenner.
Yes, I remember the exact date. April 12. The night of the accident. The night of so much horror. The night I turned into an insane lunatic.
“Mr. Hammer explained it to us,” Saralynn said. “In Drama class. They had these aisles in theaters. Like in Roman times. For the audience to leave the theater quickly. They were called vomitoriums. In Latin, it meant spew forth.”
“No. That’s a mistake people make,” Saralynn told him. “Vomitoriums didn’t have anything to do with vomiting.”
I rolled my eyes. “Can we talk about something else? I mean, we came here to eat cheeseburgers, right? Why do we have to talk about vomitoriums?”
Nate nodded agreement. We were sitting in a wide, red vinyl booth in the back of the restaurant. He had his arm around my shoulders. Saralynn and Isaac sat facing us.
“’Cuz that’s what the lunchroom looked like yesterday,” Isaac said. “Kids were heaving all over the place. It was totally sick.”
“It’s still a mystery,” Saralynn said. “Someone said they all had the mac and cheese. But what could go wrong with mac and cheese?”
Yesterday had been a bad day at school. A dozen kids had to be sent to the emergency room at Shadyside General. But this puke talk was making me queasy.
I was glad when the waitress came back to the booth to take our order. I recognized her from school. Rachel Martin. She is a senior, but we are in the same Politics and Government class.
We all looked to the window that opened into the kitchen. We could see Lefty’s back. He was at the grill, frying up cheeseburgers.
She scribbled something on her little pad. Then she poked Isaac again with the pencil, turned, and headed to the kitchen.
Nate slid his hand from behind my back. “Okay, phones on the table, guys.” He slid his phone from his jeans pocket and set it down in the middle of the table.
Nate moved the switch on Isaac’s phone. He stared accusingly across the table. “You did have your ringer switched off.”
This was a serious tradition we had. We piled the phones on the table. First phone to ring? The owner had to pay for dinner.
I was usually the loser. That’s because my mom and dad are total pests. They’re your basic helicopter parents, hovering over me wherever I go. They call me constantly. They pretend they have a question they want to ask. But they’re really just checking up on me.
At my old school I had a boyfriend they didn’t like. Just because he was out of school and he had a tattoo sleeve on his right arm. He wasn’t a bad guy, but they couldn’t see beyond the tattoos.
“What’s up with your band?” Nate asked Isaac. Isaac has a rock band called The Black Holes. They say they are a Metallica cover band, but it’s hard to tell when you listen to them.
Isaac had been shuffling the ketchup and mustard dispensers. Suddenly, he squeezed them at Nate. Nate dodged away. A spray of ketchup and mustard splashed the table.
“Sorry,” Isaac said. “I didn’t mean to squeeze them. Really. Thinking about my band gets me all tense.” He grabbed some napkins and dabbed at the stains on the table.
Isaac ignored her. “We have a gig Saturday night. At the Hothouse. You know. That club on Park almost to the River Road? And the dudes haven’t learned any of the music. I can’t even get them all to a rehearsal at the same time.”
Isaac shook his head. “We’ve had a whole month to get even more sucky. It’s a horror show, Nate. Seriously. You could put us in your horror collection. Right next to Evil Dead II.”
Nate had at least two hundred horror films on DVD. Last weekend, he forced us all to watch Evil Dead II. It was his all-time favorite. Especially the flying eyeball scene.
Rachel brought us our cheeseburgers and fries. She started to set down the plates, then stopped. “Who spilled ketchup and mustard on the table?”
Rachel stared at Isaac for a long moment. She laughed. Everyone likes Isaac. He’s short and a little chubby, with a tangled nest of black hair and brown eyes that crinkle up when he smiles. Isaac is always making jokes and interrupting classes with his wisecracks. He says he has a desperate need for attention. I can’t tell if that’s another one of his jokes or not.
He’s very smart. I don’t think he studies very hard, but he’s a straight-A student. And he learned to speak Mandarin. He says he wants to go to China for a year before he starts college.
We were all into our cheeseburgers now. Lefty makes them juicy and piles on the lettuce and tomato and pickles.
“I have to do a video for Film class,” Saralynn continued. “And I think we should do our own horror movie. Maybe in your attic, Nate. With all your totally gross horror masks?”
Nate swallowed a chunk of cheeseburger. He had juice running down his chin. I mopped it up with a paper napkin. “Sounds cool,” he told Saralynn. “Do you have a script?”
“I have some ideas,” she said. “But if we could use some of your props and masks and posters … it would be awesome.”
“How about a vampire movie?” Isaac said. “My cousin works in a medical lab. I can probably get buckets of blood from him.”
I shrugged. “Sure. Why not? But you know me. I’m not into horror. I mean, I really don’t get it. What’s the fun of being scared?”
Saralynn set down her cheeseburger. “Lisa, you had to sneak out? It’s Friday night. Why didn’t your parents want you to go out?”
“Because they’re jerks,” I said. “I’m supposed to be in my room writing thank-you notes for my Sweet Sixteen party. Like that can’t wait till tomorrow. I’m serious. My parents treat me like a total child.”
Isaac pulled the pickles from his burger and jammed them into his mouth. “Wish my parents would treat me like a child,” he muttered.
“They don’t know I exist. No one ever says, ‘Where are you going, Isaac?’ Or ‘What are you doing? What’s up?’ All they care about is their golf scores and their friends at the country club.”
My dad stood just inside the door. He had his shiny blue hoodie open over a Cleveland Indians T-shirt. His wavy brown hair was unbrushed and stood up in tufts on his head. His eyes surveyed the restaurant until he found me. He stomped past some girls waiting for a table, making his way to our booth.
My dad is tall and good-looking, with reddish brown hair and pale blue eyes in a tanned face. Mom says he looks like a young Clint Eastwood because of the lines down his cheeks and his hard expression.
I look more like my mother. Her parents came from Denmark. We’re blonde and pale, tall and kind of bony.
Dad stopped a few feet from the booth. His hands were balled into fists at his sides. He’s not violent at all. He does that when he’s tense. He had bright red circles darkening his cheeks.
“Lisa, you promised to stay home,” he said. He kept his blue eyes locked on me. I don’t think he noticed that there were others at the table.
Dad finally turned away from me. “Thanks, Nate. But we need Lisa to come home now.” He raised his eyes to Saralynn and Isaac. “Sorry to interrupt your dinner.”
He suddenly appeared embarrassed. As if he realized he’d gone too far. He’s not a beast or anything. He’s actually very reasonable most of the time.
I decided it would be easier to go with him rather than cause a big scene. I did sneak out of the house, after all. But I should be able to decide when I can go out with my friends. Like the thank-you cards couldn’t wait a day or two?
Muttering under my breath, I squeezed past Nate and climbed out of the booth. I kept my eyes down and didn’t look at my father.
I waved goodbye to the others. They all flashed me sympathetic looks. They probably thought my dad was weird, following me to the restaurant.
I stormed angrily past him to the door and stepped outside. It was a blustery, cold night. It felt more like March than April. I was wearing a long-sleeved top over a short skirt and black tights. The wind brushed my hair straight back.
I spotted our Camry at the curb near the corner, ran to it, and dove into the backseat. As soon as I arrived, Morty started to wag his tail and pant like crazy. He bounced across the seat to me and began to give my face a ferocious tongue bath.
“Morty—down! Get off me!” I cried, laughing. My face is very ticklish. His tongue felt like sandpaper. “Stop! Morty! Give me a break!”
Morty is a big white sheepdog mix. My parents gave him to me for my birthday. He goes everywhere we go. He thinks he’s a little puppy. He’s always jumping on me and slobbering his tongue over my face.
“It’s not a big deal,” I said. I could feel my anger grow. I had a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. Following me to Lefty’s was a real invasion.
“Then don’t act it.” Mom still didn’t turn around. She’s very soft-spoken. And she doesn’t like scenes.
Dad pulled the car away from the curb. He still hadn’t said a word. He squealed into a turn onto Park Drive and headed for home. We live on the Village Road, about half a mile from the salon where Mom is a hairdresser.
I heard a pattering sound and saw that it had started to rain. Raindrops sparkled on the windshield in the light from an oncoming car.
“I shouldn’t have to sneak out,” I told him. “Why did I sneak out? Because you’re both impossible. You totally embarrassed me in front of my friends. Did you even think about that?”
“Jimmy, you went through a red light,” Mom said. “Concentrate on your driving. We can have a family discussion when we get home.”
I stopped. And then I screamed: “Turn around! Turn around! I left my phone on the table.” I pounded the back of Dad’s seat. “Turn around!”
Still swerving. The car was still moving. The light seemed to be all around us, tossing us like on a bright ocean wave.
I saw Dad’s head snap. And then I heard a crack and knew it was the crack of his skull. I knew it. Knew it.
I heard his skull crack, saw his face split open, saw dark blood rise up like a fountain and then pour down his forehead.
My head jerked to the side. The back door flew open. I heard a powerful rush of wind. I saw Morty leap out.
And then the pain hit me. The pain shot down the back of my neck. The pain swept over me. My chest … my legs … my head. Blinding pain.
Pale, watery light with dark forms floating across it. Moving blurs. Like gazing into a camera totally out of focus.
I heard a murmur of voices, nearby but too soft to understand any words. I gazed up at the shifting light, struggling to squint away the gauzy curtain that kept me from seeing clearly.
As I blinked and squinted, the pain grew stronger. My head throbbed. I felt a painful throbbing at my temples. I tried to turn my head, but a sharp stab of pain forced me to stop.
“Should I increase it?” A woman’s voice came from somewhere behind me. “It’s already set near maximum.”
And now I could see the thick orange tube stuck into my wrist. And a narrow window with the blinds half-drawn. My hands at my sides on the white linen sheet.
Ignoring the pain, I turned my head and saw a bed across from me. I gasped as my dad came into focus. Yes. I remembered the accident now. The crash and the shatter of metal and glass and the hard jolt of the collision.
I remembered the accident. And now I stared at my dad in the bed across from me. He went in and out of focus, clear and then a blur. His head—it was slumped forward. Bright red blood poured down his face.
He didn’t move. He just slumped forward on the bed, with the blood-spattered steering wheel stuck deep in his head.
I turned away. I couldn’t bear to watch. And I opened my mouth in a shrill wail of horror. “Help him! Somebody help him!”
My mother’s face slid into view above me. She appeared even paler than usual, as if her skin was white paper tight against her cheeks.
Lifting my head, I saw a gray-haired man in a green lab coat step up behind her. He had a clipboard in one hand. A stethoscope swung on his chest as he moved.
Mom placed a hand on my shoulder. “Lisa, why were you screaming?” I saw that her other arm was in a cast inside a blue sling.
“I-I thought I saw Dad,” I stammered. Again, the room started to spin. “In that bed. I saw him so clearly. He was bleeding. I mean, his head was down and blood was pouring … and no one was helping him. No one.”
The gray-haired man edged my mother to the side. He peered down at me with silvery eyes behind black-framed glasses. He had thick, arched eyebrows that looked like fat white caterpillars. “I’m Dr. Martino,” he said. “Lisa, I’m glad you’ve come around so quickly. You’ve been out since last night.”
“I’ve been out?” I glanced at the window. Orange sunlight filled the bottom half. Afternoon sunlight?
“You’ve had a serious concussion,” Dr. Martino said. His breath smelled of coffee. Light reflected on his glasses and hid his eyes. “You may have nightmares and even hallucinations for a while. Your brain had a nasty jolt.”
The doctor nodded. Beside him, Mom let out a sob. She cut it off quickly. She never likes to show emotion. It’s a Scandinavian thing, I think.
“I really thought I saw him,” I said, my throat suddenly tight. “I can’t believe I was hallucinating.”
“We will have to keep you here,” Dr. Martino said. “Perhaps for a week or more. Internal bleeding is something we have to watch for. We need to keep a close watch for that. You may suffer other hallucinations. I feel I must warn you.”
I only half-heard his words. He kept fading in and out. His eyebrows seemed to move on their own as if they were alive.
Mom bit her bottom lip. She took a breath before she replied. “No, Lisa. I’m sorry,” she whispered. “He … he’s not okay.”
Entitled ‘Rethinking Theory, Space and Production: Henri Lefebvre Today’, the conference reflected the huge revival of interest in the work of Lefebvre today, which most architects are perhaps unaware of. However, if there’s one twentieth-century philosopher who engaged intensively with the city and is worthy of study, then it’s Lefebvre. Particularly in the 1960s and 1970s he wrote various books and articles about the city, the production of space, modernist urban planning and everyday life. What’s more, he maintained intensive contact with architects and planners and even took part in architecture competitions.
But that doesn’t entirely explain the contemporary fascination of planners and geographers for Lefebvre (1901-1991). An important reason is the central role he accords the city, architecture and everyday life in bringing about a social revolution – one that he, a convinced Marxist, aimed for all his life. That revolution, he believed, had to be an urban revolution. Or more precisely, a revolution is not a revolution if it doesn’t change everyday life in a fundamental way. In this regard he directly challenged the then dominant, orthodox opinion about revolution, which centred on the economy or politics. Lefebvre’s viewpoint therefore made him a dissident within the communist movement in France. It also explains his huge popularity among revolting students in May 1968, for whom the change of apparently secondary issues such as love or education was also considered essential.
The benefit of Lefebvre’s ideas for planners and architects is that they, as producers of space and everyday life, are suddenly promoted to the vanguard of a changing society. Or, put another way, they are no longer impotent, indefinite objects from whom every well-intended attempt to change society is just a shot in the dark, as long as these are not supported by economic or political change. It’s a position taken by an architecture historian like Manfredo Tafuri or a geographer like David Harvey. The big promise of Lefebvre’s work for architects is that of an architecture that no longer forms just a camouflage or a progressive face for an unjust society – and therefore has in fact a contra-revolutionary effect – but, on the contrary, an architecture that, by organising the everyday world of people differently, forms the basis for a general change in society. This was undoubtedly also the ambition of the conference: to use a confrontation with the work of Lefebvre in order to arrive at a reformulation and re-evaluation of the current and potential role of architecture.
But it was precisely in this area that the conference came up short and left the public dissatisfied – despite a packed programme featuring 23 speakers, 8 keynote speakers and five panels with three papers each. The biggest cause of this was the emphasis at the conference on the applicability of Lefebvre’s core categories for reading and analysing the contemporary city. This, based on the view that sufficient attention has already been paid to the more theoretical sides of his work in other conferences and books. As a result, attention focused on analyses of urban situations around the world in which Lefebvre’s work was deployed as an alternative key to interpretation. Among them the architectural mutations carried out by residents of communist housing blocks in Hanoi, the construction of shared gardens in New York, a study of various users and patterns of use of a square in the centre of in Sao Paulo, and of a neighbourhood with lots of creative people in Hamburg. The problem with the presentations was that on the one hand they clung to Lefebvre’s work and related all this central concepts to practice. On the other hand, concepts were bandied about too loosely. The analyses didn’t demonstrate a more fundamental understanding of his work. (Almost all speakers apologised that they weren’t ‘Lefebvre scholars’.)
Owing to this flaw, as well as the keynote lectures that lacked real direction and offered little in the way of theoretical support, a number of fundamental questions remained unresolved or even undiscussed. Not only the question concerning the essential role, or not, of architecture and planning in changing society, but also the question of how Lefebvre’s life-long involvement with Marxism can be reviewed. As one of the organisers remarked, it is a paradox that the Lefebvre revival has taken place at a time (since the early 1990s) in which belief in radical change – Marxist or otherwise – seems to have vanished.
These fundamental issues haunted the entire conference and sometimes led to painful outbursts. Like when a man in the audience, after a lecture about a typical creative makeover of the Schanzenviertel district in Hamburg, called the speaker to order by pointing out to her that the ultimate aim of Lefebvre is still to overthrow the state. He hereby implied that all creative initiatives by architects and designers are senseless as long as they make the state the biggest enemy. He was left unchallenged by both the audience and the speaker, who promptly hardened her point of view by stating that she, too, disapproved of the developments in the Hamburg district.
No doubt it would have been a better idea to involve in the conference the global movement that has grown up around one of Lefebvre’s core concepts in recent years. 'The right to the city’ – also the title of one of his most polemical works – is an inspiration the world over in the struggle against all sorts of social injustices. Despite the activist slogan 'seeking spatial justice' on the conference posters that were display all around the university, the movement was noticeably absent. A confrontation with such radical social engagement could have made clear how Lefebvre's theories on architecture and space could be brought up to date for the early twentieth century.
This lack of an activist perspective was probably also the reason for the remarkable absence of the community of architects and designers. That said, the conference was held at the faculty of architecture. Although one of the organisers emphasised Lefebvre’s relevance for architecture and design, an explicit treatment of them was totally lacking. Architects could learn much about how to look at the city through the eyes of Lefebvre but little about how they could really change it through their practice – and that was the main ambition of a radical thinker like Lefebvre. In that sense, contributions from groups and movements that engage with Lefebvre in an activist manner would have been welcome.
Since I quit playing Overwatch for good I finally broke out South Park The Stick Of Truth. I already played it, but the old disc got wandered off with, so I got the version of Shattered But Whole that came with the download of SOT so I could play it again. I really like the mechanics of SOT. If they ported them to another game that was serious it would work just as well. I really like that they made the game with so much care. There’s some kind of weird Ubisoft club the game keeps trying to get me to join, but fuck that noise. Anyway, I’m gonna get the all friends achievement and all the chimpokomon this time. Because you have to do one to get the other. I’m not a game achievement guy but to get all the ability perks you have to get all the friends and not doing that really bugged me the first time I played. I just wanted to play the old game again before playing Shattered But Whole since they take place on consecutive days. I made my character look like Thomas since they have the perfect options to make him a south park kid.
After the Hollow Knight debacle I started looking for other platforming games that don’t have ridiculous difficulty spikes in the end game, or stick the best endings behind skill walls. Salt & Sanctuary came up as a suggestion. I thought it looked cool and spooky. Owl Boy was suggested too, and Celeste. I think all of those are on the Switch, which is perfect since I can play them in whatever mode I want. Anyway, if you have any game suggestions I’m all ears. The only condition is I don’t want to come up against a bunch of bullshit spike avoiding nonsense at the end that requires a million tries. I don’t have time for that shit. Mega Man level spike encountering is fine, but no “every wall has instant death spikes on it”. I game to enjoy myself and not be frustrated. Not anymore at any rate.
I bought a used copy of SimCity DS, even though it’s not exactly what I wanted to play. For five bucks it’s probably close enough to make me not want to play the SNES version, which I can’t find the parts for at the moment. I went looking but the storage space has been moved around. I really wish I had bought it for the Wii before they lost the license now though.
for Jackie: I’ve been hearing good things about Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap, including that there’s a transgender option (you can play as Wonder Girl, and there’s been quite a few digs that it’s obviously the same character) You can find it on Steam, and can choose to play it in 8-bit mario mode. I’m hoping to be able to afford it soon.
ok this is goign too far who cares about transgenderism in video games our society is going too far with this crap. i say enough’s enough go back to the good old days of yor for video games, if transgenderisim is your thing thats fine, but honestly i just want video games to go back to the way they were before this politically correct activisim crap started poluting them.
Yeah, things were better when queers were ignored regarding representation in media and entertainment. Modern entertainment was better when it was exclusive and refused to acknowledge anyone on the spectrum as being a potential consumer.
He’s on about the concept that, if you push your kink on others, there’s a point where they start to push back. If I like, say, straitjackets, and insist that everybody else wear one, too, pretty soon people will think I’m a nut-bar and not take me seriously any more. The tail doesn’t wag the dog, so if you’re between 1 and 3 percent of the population, you shouldn’t expect the other 97 to 99 percent to follow suit, and trying to force it on them will produce a backlash. Just be who you are, and let others be who they are.
Yeah – I couldn’t really think of anything from the movie that worked, although in retrospect, “also, there’s a photo from the twenties with someone who looks just like me” would probably have been a better joke.
(In the novel, part of the reason the hotel needs a caretaker is a faulty boiler, and neglecting it is what ultimately kills Jack.)
Ever been snowed in for three days with two smokers who run out of cigarettes? Ever watched the Shining? When the dozer comes through and pulls out your 4×4 you will brave the drifts and drive the 20 miles to town and buy cigarettes-when you don’t smoke.
Should try the Shantae series, good platforming and the only things behind difficult ending challenges are artwork variations.
I really like Rulette. I speak to people in a similar manner and like anyone I have some stories where fact is less believable than fiction. =D
Salt and Sanctuary is even more in the Dark Souls category than Hollow Knight. Celeste is nothing BUT spike avoidance. Owl Boy is fantastic though. You could also pick up the Mega Man X Legacy Collection. Only get Collection 1 though. Collection 2 is 75% awful. You could also look into Bloodstained: Curse of the moon. It’s basically Castlevania 3. Additionally, The Messenger is basically a more modern take on the original Ninja Gaiden games.
I do not like the games with High difficulty either but there are some platformer games out there that are challenging enough to keep me going despite the learning curve.
On the Megaman spikes level is a neat one for Switch, Steam and others called Dead Cells. very colorful, great replay-ability.
Also super colorful and great story (I’m seeing a trend in my games here) Outland which at first has a challenging ‘polarity-color-swap’ game that normally i dont like. but the controls are so tight and the story is so good I ignored it and enjoyed the hell out of the game.
I really don’t recommend Salt and Sanctuary, nor its contemporary equivalent, Dead Cells. Both games have a boner for “Hard for the Sake of Hard”, where the core enemy to enemy combat is fun and fluid (particularly Dead Cells’) but every single boss is a war of attrition with a large and fast HP sponge that takes 10+ minutes to whittle down. Hell, you can’t even grind to make it easier in Dead Cells, since the bosses scale with you. It was honestly disappointing to me, as someone who greatly enjoyed Dark Souls (aside from the Ringed City… yeesh, HP Sponge central).
Oh man, you went with the SimCity DS version instead of playing the SNES version via browser emulator? You inspired me last weekend to try to build a Megalopolis, which I couldn’t do as a kid no matter how hard I tried, but also do it on Hard mode. Ate about a day and a third when I definitely should have been doing other things.
What is really interesting about the SNES version is just how abusable zone stacking is, and later SimCities completely removed the system that used it. Probably for the better though. Also, minor disasters (plane crash or fire) were way easier to not utterly wreck you, but nuclear meltdowns on non-easy mode were a looming threat.
I still recall trying a flight simulator once (can’t remember the name of it) in which i was able to crash and burn due to a fuel problem. With a non-powered Hang-glider. No fuel. no way to burn up. how? just how?
Clearly your pilot was trying to smoke while flying over cattle grazing land. Them methane factories, mang.
It’s those little things in life and business that shoot those ideas down really fast, like liability and insurance … ouch.
You just like drawing these two since you don’t have to use up space drawing height differences, don’t you?
It’s certainly a nice change of pace from always having to frame things based on the wild height differences between most of the cast.
Some days you want to challenge yourself, by soloing a group boss in an MMO, just keep grinding at it until you run out of revives, or manage to kill it by the skin of your teeth (cutting your best time on a platformer level works too). These days are getting rarer the older I get, most of the time, if i game at all, I just want some mind-numbing nonevent, like fishing in an adventure game.
For platformer suggestions, and in particular platformers you can load up on the Switch, I can recommend 20XX. It’s an MMX style platformer with roguelite mechanics (random item pool that you extend between runs, randomized level layouts–bosses are fixed), with decently tweakable difficulty options (it’s a rare Normal mode run that ends in death for me, but the wrong set of challenge options, like spikes being deadly instead of damaging, and I’m probably only getting a few levels in). 2P coop, local or online for PC and I think that’s also the case for Switch, or Switch might be local only, not sure.
Chasm is another game in that vein that I’ve been having fun with, that released just recently. They intend to port to Switch, but haven’t yet. Metroidvania style platformer with randomized room layouts between playthroughs (set pieces serve as anchors, though). I have heard it’s been getting lukewarm reception more generally, though, and I probably have a lot of positive bias on it given I backed the Kickstarter, but if it has you curious, I’d look into it.
I know it probably won’t be too much help, but if you go for a spell build in hollow knight and collect all the soul vessels and spell upgrades, most bosses should roll over with a few tries or a little luck. It’s the only way I got past the watcher knights.
Also have you tried shovel knight? I got it at about the same time I got hollow knight and I love them both. Plus shovel knight is getting a new campaign soon, King of Cards.
Kind of a different suggestion, but who knows. I am a story driven guy, I love games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, stuff with a story, play the crap out of them, explore all the story options. But I recently started playing No Man’s Sky after the Next expansion, and I am completely hooked, like I haven’t been with a game for a long time. There are story lines you can follow, or you can just wander around and do your own thing if you are so inclined. I am constantly getting sidetracked, then getting sidetracked from that, going for hours before I remember what I was planning on doing. Is available on PC, PS4 and Xbox.
Owl Boy is a definite must try. It has a surprising amount of heart and the buddy attack system is quite unique!
Kind of reminds me of the part in ‘Saturn’s Race’ where a group of students ask the transgenic cyborg shark what the meaning of life is and it responds by saying “keep moving or you sink.”

The most recent findings of a Transparency International report, show that in the United States, nearly 70 percent of Americans believe the government is failing to fight corruption, and 74 percent no longer feel that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption.
These feelings are not limited to the United States. In a 2017 survey of 162,136 people in 119 countries, territories and regions around the globe, 57 percent said their government is doing a poor job of fighting corruption. In fact, one in four people reported paying a bribe for public services.
The answer to these corruption woes may be to encourage more women to run for office at all levels of government — and to vote them into office. A study, published in the July 2018 issue of the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, reports that corruption is lower in countries that have a greater share of women in elected roles, and that this correlation holds true at various levels of government — from federal to local.
“This research underscores the importance of women empowerment, their presence in leadership roles and their representation in government. This is especially important in light of the fact that women remain underrepresented in politics in most countries, including the United States,” said researcher Sudipta Sarangi, an economics professor at Virginia Tech in a press release.
Sarangi and his colleague Chandan Jha, an economics professor at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York, analyzed data from more than 125 countries and found that not only do fewer bribes occur when women are in office, but that this type of corruption remains tamped-down even if women have been in power for a greater length of time and have access to more powerful networks. This data negates the idea that women aren’t as corrupt as men simply because they “have been in politics for less time and have less access to the ‘old boys network,'” Sarangi says in an interview. “Women in high gender-equality countries are still less corrupt.”
While there are hundreds of previous studies on the impact of women in government, a review by Sarangi and Jha found that most of the studies involved simply establishing a data relationship between female politicians and government corruption.
“It was purely correlation to say that more women in parliament is associated with less corruption,” Sarangi says. “That may be true, but that does not establish a ’cause and effect.’ If I say, ‘every time my grandma buys shoes, it rains in Spain, does that mean that every time my grandma buys shoes, it causes it to rain?’ Certainly not.”
He adds that an extensive body of previous research shows that women who are elected officials “favor policies aimed at health, education, public safety, the kinds of things that are more closely related to the welfare of women, children and families.”
“Women may handle power differently than men, as many women have personally experienced having a lack of power at some point, so they may better understand the needs for representation for those not in power,” says Heather Conklin, a political scientist and researcher, and founder of SPOT Strategies, which specializes in civic engagement and civic leadership training. “Potentially, more women in positions of political power could contribute to more inclusive policies and political decision-making.”
The study results show that the impact of women in government can be felt at all levels, not just federal seats. It’s an important notion, considering that in the United States, there are three menin political office for every one woman.
There are, at least preliminarily, signs of change. As of April 2018, 527 women — a recordnumber — are campaigning for elected office in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, a 67 percent increase from 2016. While the U.S. currently ranks 102nd out of 193 countries, in terms of the number of women in the national legislature, this increase could be a sign that times are changing.
As of June 2018, Rwanda had the highest number in the world of women who are elected officials. Women in Rwanda hold 61.3 percent of seats in the country’s parliament. In the U.S., women hold 19.5 percent of the seats.
Hi, I’m Laurie L. Dove, and I am an award-winning journalist, entrepreneur and mayor. I thrive on public speaking with a focus on community engagement and leadership. I am currently the president of Dove Media Group Inc. and High Plains Marketing, serve on several boards and am a degree candidate at Harvard University.

You can read my full bio here or inquire about my professional speaking services here.
My first visit to Bosque del Apache over a decade ago left such a lasting impression on me that I have returned nearly every year since. Each Thanksgiving finds me headed to New Mexico migrating, like the birds, for a short visit. Each visit brings new and wonderful experiences and photo opportunities. With more birds than they have had in years, the photo opps have been plentiful.
From the morning blast off when tens of thousands of snow geese take to the air at once in a chaotic orchestra of sight and sound that threaten to overload the senses to the point you have to remember to bring your camera to you eye and fire…
After the blast off we head to the “Crane” pools to capture flight shots as the Sandhill Cranes (numbering over 14,000 this year) depart for the farm fields to munch on corn, alfalfa and this year barley that was donated to the refuge to sustain the birds when the corn crop failed…
The snow geese count is higher than I have seen in years (over 56,000 as of the 23rd of Nov) and when the wind and light come together the magic happens…
I always find time to visit New Mexico Tech at least once to photograph the Wigeons that hang out in the pond on campus…
Once the light begins to fade rather than packing it in right away, we take time to work on our panning skills with slow shutter speeds creating blur pans…
You would think that after a long day we would call it a night to download images and prep for the next day but if the skies are clear, it doesn’t take much to entice me back out into the dark to work the night skies photographing star trails or the Milky Way…
An enthusiastic group of adventures arrives tomorrow and after a mere two days here, I know that we will have an amazing time trying to capture the magic that is Bosque del Apache. Stay tuned.
My love affair with the camera began at the age of ten when my father handed me an old, beat up Pentax Spotmatic... MORE

BPS018 - Voltage rectifier board used in most early solid state Bally and Stern pinball machines. See game listing below to see which games this supply supports.
This is the most difficult circuit board I have ever had the "pleasure" to replace. The procedure involves desoldering from the old board and then resoldering the wires onto the new board! You need to take extreme care to track which-wire-goes-where.
Always in mind that R&D is a key part of the “puzzle”, and so, our constant works and studies on every aspect related to acoustical transducers, are conveniently applied to the final product in order to satisfy the latest -and even further- audio systems requirements.
The different components of a transducer require different approaches and technologies to obtain the best results in a final professional application.
As long as quality, tolerances and manufacturing process of the metal parts are standardized for several years in our magnet assemblies, the problem we faced with the subwoofers was to manage the heat dissipation. Several improvements have been done in the last years. The most relevant improvement was found in 2008, the HELICEX® Technology, which is patented and allows our loudspeakers to work in lower temperature rates. Other speakers without the patented system take profit from our knowledge in heat dissipation as well.
Professional devices force to use the ultimate and more advanced materials. When we are talking about soft parts, the non-linear behaviours, and asymmetries are critical factors that determine the sound quality and the distortion.
The study of the efforts in the critical zones of the cone and suspension, have resulted in ourNCR membranes (Neck Coupling Reinforcement) and new spider materials and designs.
The MMSS (Mechanical Mirror Suspension System) is a quick tool for application in soft parts design, and provides a symmetric and linear behaviour of the moving assembly displacement, resulting in low distortion and low offset issues.
Our new PM4 diaphragm is a High Tech Polymer never used in the audio field before, and is the result of our research in new materials, done with the aim of providing our products properties for being beyond any available loudspeaker in the market, conferring superb sonic response with unparalleled natural sound as well as the strength, stability and resistance that is required in the professional applications.
The visible part of this knowledge is reflected in the papers, that Beyma has been demonstrating in the AES congresses since 2004.
The knowledge gives us a fast and technical approach to the challenges in our daily work in both, our internal and OEM projects.

Savoring the Pieces: The 19th Annual New York Ceramics and Glass Fair — January 17-21, 2018 | Beyond-Beige
The description of the Fair sounded a little daunting—5 centuries of artifacts from “30 top-tier vetted Galleries, Private Dealers, and Artists”—but I can assure you there was no museum fatigue as I worked my way around the New York City Ceramics and Glass Fair, chatting with dealers, artists, and arts professionals during the engaging opening reception. I was dazzled by the hundreds of examples of glass, pottery, and ceramics makers’ art–names as familiar as Minton, Delft and Baccarat alongside contemporary, practicing artists–which I previewed on January 17 throughout two floors under the beautiful roof of the classic Bohemian National Association building at 321 East 73rd Street in New York City, which is the home of the Czech Republic Consulate and a vibrant cultural center.
While the wide sweep of human history was represented in techniques, decoration, and value of these pieces, the ability to pause and converse with experts, collectors, and makers prevented any tedium and made touring the New York Ceramics and Glass Fair a great pleasure. Like a world tour plus time travel without the jet lag! While the Fair is broad in scope and offering, each exhibitor came with a reasonable number of artifacts, so moving to each next station was refreshing. As this was the preview, wine and hors d’oeuvres were served to celebrate and enhance an already excited and pleasant vibe.
Artists and Art Business Professionals from United States, England, Ireland, Israel, Czech Republic, and Asia were happy to explain their exhibits, which included artifacts from nearly every continent, dating from the 17th century to today. Eclectic tastes welcome. So many exhibitors eschewed glass cases, and I appreciated the open viewing while understanding that the many fine antiques require special handling. A stylish antique Royal Flemish vase, for example, caught my eye through a glass door, and I also had the pleasure of seeing it unmediated. Pictured below, this vase features a “cut rim blackberry bead design,” manufactured by Mt. Washington Glass Company , (later the Pairpoint Corporation), New Bedford, around 1893-5.
Bouke de Vries whimsical peacock, fashioned of 18th century ceramic fragments will greet you as you step of the elevator on one floor. This piece is a highlight from one of the highlighted “loaner” exhibitions from Ferrin Contemporary, part of “Revive, Remix, Respond: Contemporary Ceramic Artists,” an exhibit that opens at the Frick Pittsburgh on February 16.
A chat with Alexandra Jelleberg, Associate Director of Ferrin Contemporary, led me to discover two new artists whose work I want to follow: Paul Scott, who creates new work from old fragments, crafting in the Kintsugi practice of repairing broken ceramics, healing scars with gold to make the piece more precious than before; and Mara Superior, who approaches the topic from a different perspective by making and assembling her own “old school” fragments. Her Artist’s Statement at the exhibit sponsor Ferrin Contemporary explains her work as “the reinterpretation of historical inspirations synthesized with my own visual vocabulary.” Photos of these pieces can be found at these links: Bouke de Vries and Paul Scott and Mara Superior.
A second loan exhibit concerns a remarkable find: examples of an unusual 18th century Philadelphia slipware found during excavations on the site of the new Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. This recovered collection numbers some 85,000 artifacts. The loan exhibit is sponsored by Ceramics in America published by the Chipstone Foundation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Martyn Edgell offered a generous selection of antique pieces— what caught my eye especially were the nineteenth century whimsical, homiletically decorated pearlware dishes: “God speeds the plow”; “Industrey [sic] produces wealth.” Who could resist a bowl inscribed “Your affectionate father,” or a plate that featured your name to be uncovered after finishing your meal? Easy to channel your inner grandparent here.
A fascinating contemporary exhibit from Pascoe Gallery featured South African decorative ceramic art. The gallery features the largest U.S. selection of Ardmore Studio art featuring lively museum quality ethnic art commissioned from the Studio in Kwazulu-Natal. The intricate decorative pieces are often fashioned by a group of artists—a sculptor or two and a painter, for example.
I would be remiss if I did not mention the shiny object category. As you round one corner, you will encounter the beautiful wearable and decorative art–so at home in this building–of the Czech Republic’s Precioza. Warning: you can keep going back for this lovely eye caviar, and it makes your eyes sparkle!
Meeting LaiSun Keane and Lucy Lacoste, Director of the Lacoste Gallery in Concord, MA, led to a thoughtful discussion of the role business plays in the life of the artist. I also took away a great many details of interest about the 8 artists they represent, notably the nonagenarian Warren Mackenzie , a longtime client of the gallery, who was inspired as much by functionality as form, and Mark Shapiro, whose vibrantly colored, functional work is displayed at the Smithsonian and the Alfred University Museum of Ceramics, among other notable exhibiting institutions. Mr. Shapiro will be speaking at the Fair this week. Below are some examples of small vessels, including the work of these two artists:
At the Fair, I also discovered the work of Martha Rieger —a ceramic artist who confessed in a whisper during our conversation that she was “a late bloomer.” You might not imagine this, considering the monumental exhibits the Brazilian-born Israeli has already achieved throughout her chosen home: At this Fair, Rieger has brought some of her extraordinary pomegranates, pictured below—spheres made of rough black stoneware clay, decorated on the inside with gold.
Ms. Rieger has made up for lost time. Humbling, too, is the result of her study of Shibori painting that is featured on her blue and white ceramic bubbles, on exhibit at the Trumpeldor Gallery in Be’er Sheva. Other large-scale works have appeared throughout Israel, including the Museum of Islamic and Near Eastern Culture in Beer Sheva. I want to hear more about her fluid translations of her own multi-cultural life into these elemental metaphorical shapes that capture a meaning but remain open to interpretation. A good starting place is the book Rieger graciously offered me, her own bilingual Oasis, which tells the story of her passionate, evolving art. You can also read and see more about her work at her website.
It’s New York City Antiques Weekend , so be sure to include a visit to the New York Ceramic and Glass Fair along with other fine exhibits, and enjoy the presentations as well as the objets.
La Guarida in Havana – Deborah Greenhut | Author, Photographer, Motivational Speaker on Emblem of Havana: La Guarida January 11, 2017
3 September 2013 BEYOND THE BALE UPFRONT Getting on with business We are continuing with initiatives to help increase the demand for wool through investments in marketing and R&D – from farm to fashion. I would like to inform you of some recent activities in which the organisation has been involved. AWI three year Strategic Plan: Our Strategic Plan for the three financial years 2013/14 to 2015/16 was released on 1 July and is available on the AWI website at www.wool. com. We consulted widely with woolgrowers and their representatives to ensure that industry views are incorporated into the plan. Through AWI’s extensive Planning and Consultation Cycle, we will continue to ensure that woolgrower levies are directed to projects that deliver the greatest value to woolgrowers. A summary of the Strategic Plan was posted to recipients of Beyond the Bale along with this edition. Statutory Funding Agreement (SFA): Through a consultation process with the Federal Government we have renegotiated a new SFA between the Commonwealth of Australia and AWI. At the end of June, Minister Ludwig signed the SFA, effective from 1 July for three years. E-communications: In our endeavour to communicate better with our shareholders, AWI has launched a totally revamped Wool.com website with information and tools to help woolgrowers increase their on-farm profitability, and inform them of where AWI is investing their wool levies. Wool.com complements AWI’s other two main websites: the Woolmark.com website for trade and designer audiences, and the consumer-focused Merino.com website. AWI produces several free e-newsletters to which woolgrowers can subscribe and receive by email. Visit www.wool.com/ subscribe for details. Shearer and wool hander training: Adequate numbers of highly skilled professional shearers and wool handlers are key to the profitability of the Australian wool industry. In the past year, AWI investment has increased the number of shearers and wool handlers trained across Australia. 1571 shearers and 983 wool handlers were trained directly through the AWI shearer and wool handler training program in 2012/13. An additional 786 participants attended crutching and other introductory workshops, and 1370 high school students received an introduction to wool harvesting. AWI state networks: AWI continues to invest and grow its state based extension networks which have increased their membership base over the past 12 months to 8100. Strong partnerships with state departments, private providers and woolgrowers have secured ongoing funds for Leading Sheep (Qld), Sheep Connect NSW, BESTWOOL/ BESTLAMB (Vic), Sheep Connect Tasmania, Sheep Connect South Australia, The Sheep’s Back (WA) and Bestprac (pastoral) networks. Call the AWI Helpline on 1800 070 099 if you want to get involved with a group in your area. EverGraze regional packages: The results and recommendations from the EverGraze research program, carried out across the high rainfall zone of southern Australia between 2004 and 2013, are now available on a new EverGraze website (www.evergraze.com. au). The results have been presented as regionally relevant information packages to help producers in particular regions manage their pasture and livestock systems. The information quantifies the productivity, economic, environmental, risk and lifestyle impacts of implementing changes on farm. Merino Wool. No Finer FeelingTM: In the lead-up to the northern hemisphere autumn/winter retail season we have intensified our efforts with the Merino Wool. No Finer FeelingTM fibre advocacy campaign that is informing a new generation of consumers about the natural attributes and benefits of Merino wool. This year, the campaign involved AWI strengthening its partnerships with well-known designers, brands and fashion media. Brand endorsements of the campaign provide real penetration in fashion markets. International Woolmark Prize: The regional finalists have been announced for the 2013/14 International Woolmark Prize global final, to be held in Milan next February. The interest in this award from the fashion communities and media globally continues to be phenomenal. It is helping put wool back on the agendas of fashion designers across the world, and consequently into retail stores for consumers to purchase. Items from the 2012/13 International Woolmark Prize winning collection of Christian Wijnants are now available in the Sydney city store of David Jones. International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO): The environmental credentials of wool and the unique properties of wool that set it apart from other fibres in the marketplace were at the forefront of discussions at this year’s IWTO Congress held in June. The content of many of the presentations on the first days of the Congress echoed this theme, and Australia and AWI in particular were heavily represented. On the last day of the Congress there was an AWI-sponsored session titled “From Farm to Fashion – The Wool Supply Chain and the Consumer” led by myself and a panel of leading industrialists from Italy's fashion industry including Nino Cerruti, Paolo Zegna, Pier Luigi Loro Piana and Franca Sozzani. Annual General Meeting (AGM): The AWI 2013 AGM will be held on Friday 22 November at the Grace Hotel in Sydney. Formal notice and meeting papers will be sent to AWI shareholders in October. AWI shareholders who are unable to attend the AGM in person will be able to view the AGM proceedings via webcast. Further details are available on the AWI website at www.wool.com/agm Stuart McCullough Chief Executive Officer, Australian Wool Innovation
For the majority of homeowners, the purchase of their own represents their biggest investment and their largest loan. Selecting, qualifying, and obtaining the right type of mortgage is one of the most important parts of purchasing your home.
The purpose of this guide is to educate you on mortgage terminology, provide calculators so you can get a rough estimate on how much mortgage you can safely afford, and to allow to to pre-qualify for a mortgage so you can start shopping for a home.
We all know that good credit is necessary to qualify but do you know your score and how can you improve your credit?
Don’t let your eyes get too big for your wallet. Knowing your price ceiling before you start looking can save you from disappointment and financial trouble.
Once you determine what you can afford, you need to see how much the banks are willing to lend to you.
If the rate looks favorable but you haven’t found the perfect house yet, you can ask to have your rate locked. What does that mean?
So you know what you can afford and how much the bank is willing to loan out. Once you pick out a potential home, it is time to determine its value.
If you are first time home buyer without a significant down payment, chances are you will need to buy PMI.
Nobody wants to be in foreclosure or bankruptcy but it is important to knwo the facts and consequences.

Two Australian songwriters have settled a copyright lawsuit against singers Ed Sheeran, Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. In their suit, Sean Carey and Beau Golden claimed the song The Rest of Our Life was a "blatant" rip-off of their song When I Found You.
“The copying is, in many instances, verbatim, note-for-note copying of important and original elements of the song, and is obvious to the ordinary observer,” Carey and Golden wrote, naming McGraw, Hill, Sheeran and Sony Music Entertainment as ...

I know most of my Coatikid brothers and sisters don’t really care for the whole water thing. Honestly I think the secret to my beautiful fur is that I am not afraid to play in the water and take my baths. It’s really most refreshing. Since I am the prettiest Coati and, of course, definitely everyone’s favorite, you should really watch my video. It’s quite magical. I look like I am playing a magically harp made of water……

I liked myths. They weren’t adult stories and they weren’t children’s stories. They were better than that. They just were.
We picked some pea pods, opened them and ate the peas inside. Peas baffled me. I could not understand why grown-ups would take things that tasted so good raw, and put them in tins, and make them revolting.
I wished I could have seen who was talking. If you have something to fear, rather than something that could be anything, it is easier.
Every program should have release notes. This document contains important information about the installation and use of the program. For following versions, it contains changes that the user should know of.
Of course there always is a readme file. This document will only mention general information about the program, like licensing policy, status of the version etc.
A lot of users never read a readme file, release notes or even a manual. Many don't seem to know where such a document is to be found. I must admit that I myself only glance over readme file and release notes, and read a manual only when a problem occurs .
A program desktop icon makes it easy to start the program. But there is another way to start a program, by using the programs menu found under Start, Programs. This menu usually contains links to all relevant documents associated with the release.
In the case of FsXPand and FsClient, the program menu contains shortcuts to the following documents:
And of course there is Gauge3D_TD.rtf to explain the data model for the gauges, to be used with the gauge editor (to be found in the program menu)
Before you start asking a question via e-mail, or start a new topic on this forum, please check the appropriate documents, and the manual.

The second of two webcams near Armadale at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig College, part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.
This webcam looks north east from the college across the Sound of Sleat to "Britain's last wilderness", the Knoydart peninsula. Knoydart is accessible only on foot or by sea. There are regular sailings by Bruce Watt Cruises from Mallaig to Inverie, the sole village on Knoydart. In addition to being home to approximately 100 people, Inverie boasts The Old Forge, the remotest pub on mainland Britain.
A picture is taken every 15 minutes between the hours of 05:00 and 22:00 UK local time (5am to 10pm). Outside of these hours there is nothing to see but blackness.

This webcam is located on the Àrainn Chalum Chille campus of the Sabhal Mòr Ostaig College, approximately 3km (2 miles) north east of the Armadale ferry terminal.
The Sound of Sleat used to be the main thoroughfare for coastal shipping to and from the Highland and Islands. Today commercial shipping has largely been displaced by pleasure and leisure craft, including the luxurious Hebridean Princess cruise ship (the former CalMac ferry MV "Columba").
These waters were used extensively by the Royal Navy for training during World War II and were protected at each end by an anti-submarine barriers controlled from a nearby requisitioned hunting lodge, now the Duisdale Country House Hotel. Today the barriers may be gone but Royal Navy surface vessels can still be seen on this webcam as they traverse the Sound on their way to the British Underwater Test and Evaluation Centre (BUTEC) to the north west of the Skye Bridge. The submarines are much harder to spot, especially when submerged!
Thank you to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig College for providing the infrastructure and view. A special thank you to Caoimhín and Dòmhnall for their assistance and enthusiasm.

In the minds of many people, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing can be perceived as a business failure. But for businesspeople who experience a Chapter 11, reorganize the company’s debts and successfully emerge, there are lessons learned that make their companies stronger and more likely to prosper in the future.
“It was definitely very interesting and an experience that we, as a company, learned a lot from, but probably not an experience we want to go through again,” said Russell Devendorf, senior vice president and chief financial officer of WCI Communities Inc., a Bonita Springs-based homebuilder that developed projects like …

Now that the turkey coma has sufficiently subsided and moving is a little more comfortable, it’s time to catch up with those wacky American Idol kids. It may be X Factor season, but our AI friends James Durbin, Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina were all busy this Thanksgiving Day. For some, Thanksgiving means eating more quantities of turkey than is absolutely necessary, ever, and football. For others, it's parades and American Idol. I multitasked, just for you. Here are the highlights of my sacrifices from this past weekend! Thank God Nickelback didn't come up through the American Idol ranks or
Lauren Alaina’s debut album could have easily been called Coming Out From The Shadows Of Scotty McCreery as Lauren is making her own mark on the country world with her debut of Wildflower and setting herself up as a wholly separate and legitimate country artist. Wildflower is currently sitting pretty at No. 3 on itunes albums chart while Scotty has slipped a little, down to No. 9. Lauren’s making the rounds promoting Wildflower and her upcoming second single “Georgia Peaches” (“Like My Mother Does” was released before her album was complete). Lauren stopped by Good Morning America and chatted with
Lauren Alaina may have come in second to fellow country singer Scotty McCreery on American Idol’s season 10 but her debut release Wildflower might just put her at the top of the heap. I was never a huge fan of Lauren during her Idol run; she was too immature and not ready for the grueling schedule winning the American Idol title would entail. I also grew tired of her cutesy personality, along with her inconsistent performances. I never disputed her singing ability; she has a huge voice but needed to learn what to do with it and how to control it.
Another week, another release from American Idol's resurgent 10th season. Last week it was winner Scotty McCreery and Clear As Day, which won a rave review from our American Idol correspondent and dominated the charts in its first week of release. It's runner-up Lauren Alaina's turn this week as the tango these two have been doing -- releasing singles and videos in close succession -- continues. Her debut album is called Wildflowers and we have our review of it, as well. I’ll also throw out another tease and remind you all to stay tuned for details on fellow Season 10 contestant
Just like fellow Idol finalist Scotty McCreery, Lauren Alaina's record features some of Nashville's hottest songwriters...
Lauren Alaina’s debut album Wildflower is set to be released October 11, she recently revealed the cover art, and today she released the track listing to further pique our interest. Lauren has assembled (or had assembled for her, rather) some of the heaviest hitters in Nashville, snagged one co-writing credit, and had a song penned for her by her own idol, (and former American Idol winner) Carrie Underwood. As the runner up to Scotty McCreery on American Idol’s tenth season, Lauren has been used to doing everything second to Scotty and going head to head with him with coronation singles
The wait is almost over, kids! Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina have announced release dates for their debut, full-length albums and they are a week apart. Have I mentioned these two seem to do everything in tandem? Scotty’s album is titled Clear As Day and will be out October 4, just shy of his 18th birthday. Lauren’s debut effort Wildflower will be out the following week, October 11. Scotty is working with mega-Producer Mark Bright, who has produced music for Carrie Underwood, Reba, and Rascal Flatts, just to name a few. Bright also produced Scotty’s post-Idol coronation single “I Love
I was Team Scotty throughout Season 10 of American Idol and had mixed feelings about runner-up Lauren Alaina but I might be changing horses in the Battle Of The Debut Videos. My mixed feelings about Alaina continued with her debut single, "Like My Mother Does" but my feelings aren't mixed at all when it comes to the video: I love it. Lauren Alaina’s video for “Like My Mother Does” was released the day before Scotty McCreery’s debut on CMT and she enjoyed being #1 for a while before “I Love You This Big” premiered and snatched the spot right
As predicted last week, Lady GaGa took over the iTunes chart watch but not with the immediate dominance I expected. Born This Way is the #1 album but Adele holds onto the #1 single with "Rolling In The Deep" for one more week. American Idol winner Scotty McCreery was #1 by the end of the week but didn't quite take the weekly title, debuting at number three. Runner-up Lauren Alaina is in at #8. On the albums front, Adele is #2 followed by Brad Paisley. Alaina and McCreery both placed their American Idol digital albums in the Top 10
Season 10 runner up releases her first single and once again she's right on the heels of the winner...
Lauren Alaina’s coronation single is "Like My Mother Does" and, like Scotty’s, hers was released directly after the results show and she shot right into the top five on iTunes’ singles chart. She didn’t surpass him at any point and likely won’t, at the time of writing this review she was still in the top ten. "Like My Mother Does" is a total "for the heartstrings" country song that is too contrived, forced, and hard to swallow. This the 3rd time it’s been released, most notably was on Kristy Lee Cook’s first post-Idol album (this song never charted for Cook). Lauren
OK, we’re at the end of the road here... we got our closure, seeing Pia Toscano, Paul McDonald, James Durbin and the three of you who still care got to see Casey Abrams on the Idol stage for the final time this season. There have been a lot of positive and cringe-worthy happenings over the course of this tenth season of American Idol. We lost Simon and then lost everyone except Randy and in the process gained a music legend and a diva at the judges' table. The three shined brightest in the auditioning process with JLo sat smack
Tonight’s show starts off with the introduction of the two remaining Idol contestants- Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina. Ryan refers to the match up as the “boy next door” versus the “Southern belle” and informs us they both love country music, both are merely teenagers, and both want to win this season’s American Idol. Ryan addresses rumors that were swirling around right before the show began regarding Lauren's lack of a voice in rehearsals. One rumor was that Haley Reinhart was prepping to take Lauren's place in tonight’s finale, just in case. Ryan called out the show’s doctor who
The night we as American Idol fans wait for is finally upon us! Tonight, Tuesday May 24th, Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina will perform for your votes for the final time. One thing is absolutely certain-whoever wins will release a country album, which is okay with me because the last three winners (David Cook, Kris Allen, and Lee DeWyze, respectively) have all been one-note and virtually interchangeable with minor differences. I’ll be happy to have them pollute the country waves and leave mainstream radio alone. I kid, I kid- I don’t even listen to “real” radio anymore. And while I’d
I know we know who’s in the finale on Tuesday vying for the title of this season’s American Idol but I wanted to go over the performaces anyway since I already had all these notes and just got behind this week. We are left with Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina which is no surprise to most people… the big surprise to many is Haley Reinhart. She was at the bottom of the pack for much of the first half of the top 13 results shows, never appearing to be a front-runner or even a contender, and now here she is, Top
Here we are- Top Three Results Show and I have to be honest, I’m a little nervous, not because I care a lot at this point but, because I know I’m covering this through the finale and a few different scenarios are more painful to imagine than others. Let’s carry on and see how intense my level of pain is going to be, shall we? Show starts off with the top four contestants (James! I’m so happy to see you, even if you’re wearing a trucker hat!) going to JJ Abrams’ studio Bad Robot and getting a sneak peak of
Dear America, Contrary to what I’ve told you and everyone believes, voting for American Idol is not an exercise of opinion when it comes to this nonsense… I don’t care how wholesome Scotty is, how adorable and ditzy Lauren is, and I definitely couldn’t give a flying... duck about Haley’s sass. James is unequivocally the most talented of the final four. His absence from here on out with be felt more than any other Idol contestant voted off this season. I don’t care about excuses and weak attempts at making me feel better. I don’t care that Daughtry was voted
Hi kids, remember me? I’ll spare you the details of my absence and leave it with you’re just happy to see me, right? Good, thought so. Now that that’s settled we need to discuss a few things that we missed in our time apart. Jacob Lusk has been eliminated- are we sad, happy, indifferent, or asking ourselves “Jacob Who?” Yeah, me too. Okay, we’ve given that all the attention it deserves. Moving on to the performances of last Wednesday May 11th where the remaining four Idol contestants regaled us with songs of the Lieber and Stoller song writing duo
I did the same thing with Lauren Alaina that I did with Haley; I went back and listened to her audition and watched all of her Hollywood Week performances. Her audition was so annoying to me at the time, I didn’t like the sad story angle (sick cousin Holly, who hasn’t been mentioned since…have we even seen her in the audience?) and I judged her as a chubbier, Carrie Underwood-knockoff. I was wrong. She’s much more of a Kelly Clarkson knockoff but with blonde hair. She is, however, coming into her own and we have to remember this little girl
On tonight’s American Idol our remaining five contestants perform songs from a very loose theme, “Past and Present,” which is supposed to be current and '60s songs. Jimmy Iovine has Sheryl Crow as the guest mentor; she reveals she wants to see more depth and desire in each contestant. Randy gave the “America wants to know, who’s in it to win it” speech and implored the contestants to show us what music they want to record, and what kind of artist they want to be. James Durbin starts us off with “Closer To The Edge” by 30 Seconds To
Oh goodness, this Carole King medley at the show’s open is almost as offensive as Jacob’s camel toe in those mom jeans. It’s off key, hard to hear at some points, and just a big jumble of weirdness. We’re subjected to a bland Ford commercial- by far the worst yet and that’s saying something. Then we get a dose of Crystal “Mama Sox” Bowersox doing a song from her new album. It wasn’t worth me paying attention, it was snooze-worthy, also I was very distracted by her dreadlocks-with-a-mullet hair. Banter with the contestants answering questions from fans. Yawn. Ryan
To start off Wednesday night’s show, Ryan Seacrest comes out like Flava Flav or some other crack-addled hype man, making long, slow strides across the stage yelling “Let’s hear it!” over and over. It was a little disconcerting but let’s focus on the reason we’re here. Tonight the remaining six not-yet-worthy American Idol contestants will attempt to do the songs of Carole King justice. 118 of her songs charted on the Billboard 100, she has garnered 4 Grammy awards, and was still a teenager when a little song she co-wrote called “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” was recorded by

Burundi has been involved, for more than 20 years, in economic reforms with the help of the Bretton Woods institutions. However, the positive results which were becoming more and more significant were harmed by the 1993 crisis. Although the crisis persisted, the economic reforms were curried on with the help through a minimum humanitarian assistance by the World Bank, and few other partners.
To attract both national and foreign direct investments, Burundi has reviewed its code of investments in most of its main core. The procedures of enterprise approval as a priority enterprise have been simplified. Furthermore, some measures of the investment code have been reviewed in function of the evolution of the foreign exchange policy change which has been simplified. It is also the concern of simplifying the approval and adaptation procedures to the new exchange policy that has motivated the promulgation of the law nº1/15 of 31 July 200 modifying the statutory order nº1/30 of 31 august 1992 related to the creation of a free trade Area Regime in Burundi.
Burundi has adopted the trade liberalization policy specially by abolishing quantitative restrictions to imports, by instituting the freedom of fixing prices and by observing the right to negotiate with the private sector the price structure of a very limited number of strategic products for the national economy in respect of WTO and COMESA rules and regulations. This is specially the case for oil products and sugar.
In the banking sector, the State has been oriented since some years towards the free exercise of this activity and towards a progressive disengagement in the social capital of banks. This policy has favored the creation of many new banking to the great benefit of customers.
The monetary authority applies a rigid monetary policy to sustain a weak inflation rate. It relies mainly on the target of the growth of the money through the imposition of upper limits refinancing to the financial institutions. The refinancing interest rate is periodically adjusted by considering the underlying inflation rate.
The government gives also a lot of importance to the abolition of the difference which persists between the official change rate and the rate in the parallel or informal market which is a serious threat to the efficient affectation of currencies. In the short term the monetary authority intensifies its efforts for improving the operation of the exchange market. With this respect, it is fortunate to note that the unification policy of the exchange rates has already led to a reduction between the two rates which went from 30% to 17%. In order to reduce more this gap, the Government of Burundi has started to liberalize completely the exchange policy particularly through the authorization of free opening of the “private forex bureaux.”
All the products are in fact eligible to importation except the legal prohibitions and there is no required deposit before importation. The financial transfers such as rental revenues, education and jobs’ bonus, traveling fees, foreigners’ economies done before leaving the country are completely liberalized.
Moreover, the monetary authority is determined to maintain the floating exchange rate system which would lead to fluctuation of the exchange rates according to the evolution of the supply and demand of currencies. It is in this context that the monetary authority has adopted a dynamic approach in its management of the market for currency auction installed in June 2000. To facilitate the commercial banks operations, the obligation of currencies transferring is not more applicable to non traditional experts while the obligation of currencies retrocession applied to traditional exportations (cotton, tea and coffee), will be reduced fro 70% to 50% by the end of December 2003.
With the support of the Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the government has adopted a transparency policy in its program of modernization of the public finance management and the means of its implementation.
The classification of public expenses per nature has been revised in order to facilitate the move from the expenditures based accounting to the public accounting. The inventory of the state’s arrears and those due to the state have allowed a better allocation of resources affected to the internal and external debt service. The introduction of the new procedures of the budget implementation allowed a better follow-up for all the implementation phases as well as the comparison between the administrative and the general accounting. Finally the execution of the State’s budget will be soon audited by the revenue Court for which the project of its creation is in the National Assembly for adoption.
In order to improve the efficiency of customs’ administration and to increase its output, Burundi has decided to reduce the rates of customs duties at importation. The tariff peaks have been eliminated to favor the moderate rate of 40% which will be the highest rate. In addition, the tariff lines have been reduced to only four (10-12-15-40). Furthermore, taking into account the COMESA environment, Burundi has adopted the COMESA nomenclature based on the Harmonized System (HS) 1996 version and is prepared for the application of tariff zero system in 2004 for all the products from the COMESA Region as well as the application of external common tariffs.
The on-going fiscal reforms aim at the modernization and simplifying of the legislation in order to increase the efficiency of the fiscal administration and to take into account the commitments made in the context of COMESA. For this effect, the revision of the general tax code and duties is in progress and should let come out a reduction of the imposition rates and the replacement of the Transaction Tax by Tax on the value Added. Finally, the setting-up of the unique identification to make an inventory of all the taxpayers should allow a broadening of a tax base by a better imposition up to the informal sector. This action should be accompanied by an elaboration of a fiscal procedures’ box for the taxpayers.
Since 1986, the government has adopted a program of disengagement in the public investment to the advantage of private initiatives. The program continues with the enterprises that remain, and that are, generally, considered as investments with big capitals and therefore difficult to privatize because of the internal weak savings. However, it seems that the sector of services is easier to privatize than the industrial sector, probably because of its profitability which is much higher and without competition. The Interministerial Committee of Privatization (ICP) and the Service in chargé of Public enterprises (SPE) have already established a program of disengagement of the State in all sectors.
The policy of the private sector development has been initiated with the beginning of the structural adjustment program of which it is one of the components. This policy which was backed by the Breton Woods institutions and the UNDP is made of two main elements including the public enterprise privatization policy and the private sector promotion.
Actually many public enterprises have been either privatized or liquidated. They are no more a burden for the public treasury. This policy will continue until the total withdrawal of the government in the profit oriented enterprise management. Concerning the private sector promotion, many structures have been created at this end and many studies have been carried out to promote the sector.
Many research studies have been made by the Policy Coordination Unit for the Development of the private Sector (PCUDPS) and have given prominence to the need of boosting the commercial and industrial activities sin modernizing the production tools and in exploiting some boosting channels for exports. The Government is preparing on the basis of these results an action plan to be integrated in the Strategic Plan for poverty alleviation.
The elaboration process of Interim Strategic Plan of Poverty alleviation (ISPPA) has been started in July 2000. Its implementation has begun in 2003 by the integration of priority axes in the Finances Act of 2003, as well as in the projects and programs supported by sponsors. Again, the weight of social expenses has increased from a GDP (Gross Domestic Products) of 4.3% in 2002 to 5.3% in 2003. Their part will continue to increase for some time in order to achieve the objectives of the Strategic Plan for Poverty alleviation (SPPA).
With the help of the World Bank, the Government has initiated a review exercise of public expenses since 2002. This exercise will be realized periodically in order to constantly rationalize the affection system of the public resources according to the priorities of the SPPA and its Social Program of Urgency (SPU) in order to improve the effectiveness and the expense profit, to the profit of Poverty Alleviation. In this context, the Government is setting up an automatic mechanism to follow up the public expenses in general and the social expenses in particular (tracking). Today, the allocation for foreign aid is based on the priorities of SPPA.
In the short term (2003-2006), Burundi has convened with the IMF an Economic and Financial Program for the Structural economic cooperation which will be financially supported by a Facility for Poverty Alleviation and Growth (FPAG). This program will enable the opening up of more broaden concessionary financings to other donors and to facilitate the mobilization of promised aids during the 2 last table Rounds (Paris, Geneva I and II).
To increase the public expenses reserved to the health and education to the GDP of 5,3% in 2003, of 6% in 2004 and of 7% in 2006;
To maintain the change reserves at around 4 months of importations of none factor goods and services;
To maintain the deficit of the external current account to a level that can be financed by high confessionals donations and loans;
Find a consensual arrangement on the outstanding and the African Bank for the Development (ABD) and the African Fund for the Development (AFD) current expiration date; this arrangement will include the implementation of payments when due and the discussions with the ABD the restructuring of pocketbook and the programming of the outstanding so as the financial flux become again positive in favor to Burundi;
To make a preparatory technical work on the necessary debt data at the initiative of Poor Countries Heavily in Debt (PCHD) and negotiate nearby the partners so that Burundi gets to the decision point since the adoption of Facility for Poverty alleviation and Growth (FPAG) by the IMF Board.

The burundian economy is mainly grounded on agriculture. Statistic estimates indicate that 90% of the population relies on agriculture combined with livestock for the livelihood. There are two types of crops cultivated: Food crops (beans, bananas, sweet potatoes, cassava, maize and sorghum) and cash crops (coffee, tea, cotton and quinquina). Agriculture generates value-added estimated at about 58% of gross domestic product and produces most the foreign exchange coming into the country. It should be noted that coffee (Arabica and Robusta accounts for nearly 90% of the country’s export earnings and that plantations remain, for the most part village enterprises. The tea produced in Burundi is high quality. The tea crop contributes to poverty alleviation in Burundi because 95% of its production is exported. Burundi plans to increase the tea production by privatizing some complexes of production and by increasing the area of cultivation. Cotton constitutes the third traditional produce for export. Burundi cotton is a highly appreciated produce because of its quality. Burundi plans to increase the export offer by extending its growing area to the Imbo and Moso regions. The main food crops are: maize, sorghum, sweet potatoes, banana, beans, cassava, taro, palm oil, meat, etc.
Burundi is boarding the Lake Tanganyika which is known in the world to be a lake containing a lot of fish of different varieties. The national production is estimated to 15,000 tones. The artisan fishing contributes to 90% and the development of the industrial fishing should enable the country to have an exportable surplus. The identified products for export are the frozen and smoked fishes, the ornamental alive fishes and the crabs. The fishes know as “INDAGALA” are the unique species found only in the Lake Tanganyika, and this offers a considerable advantage for export.
In the past, the cow was less an animal than an institution; cattle were not regarded from the utilitarian angle, as a factor in the economy but as status symbol. The size of the herd was an index of the individual’s wealth and social status. Livestock rearing is not well integrated into farming and remains essentially extensive in nature. At the present time, research is proceeding with strategies for reconstituting livestock herbs and the genetic improvement of animal breeds.
An integrated herd reconstitution program will be established, and will include highly prolific, short-cycle small livestock that will yield a quick improvement in rural family incomes. This kind of livestock is also more suitable to agro-sylvo-pastoral integration. Improving rural incomes will also require the promotion of cottage industries and handicrafts that will create non-farm employment and will also help to reduce imports. This subsector is currently very underdeveloped, from all points of view, and will require efforts involving training, extension work and financing. As a first step, handicrafts associations will be organized and established through the provision of credits; productive units that were destroyed during the crisis will be rehabilitated; and a handicrafts support fund will be established.
The quality of the cattle herd will be improved by crossbreeding with highly productive stock. This will be done primarily through semen imports followed by an artificial insemination program, which is likely to produce better results than importing animals that are not adapted to local climatic conditions. Veterinarians from the extension services will train communities to install and manage insemination centers.
Herd management techniques will be improved, particularly through permanent stabling for heavy livestock, swine and poultry, so as to make better use of harvest residues and enhance animal productivity in terms of livestock products and organic fertilizer.
Efforts to intensify livestock productivity will not be successful without proper feeding conditions, in terms of forage and concentrates. Forage crops will therefore be encouraged. In particular, attention will be given to herbaceous and woody legumes, which will not only provide high-quality forage but will enhance soil fertility as well. In the short term, seeds will have to be imported for species that have already been tested by ISABU. The emerging seed industry will also have to produce forage seeds that can be multiplied, in due course, by farmers’ associations and cooperatives. These associations will also have to see to the growing of legumes and cereals for producing concentrates.
In order to take full advantage of intensive livestock grazing, a sustained effort will be required to prevent and treat the most frequent and serious diseases. In the short run, purchase of the required inputs will have to depend on government agencies and donors. Responsibility can then be transferred gradually to communities and private operators, as associations and producers receive the required training.
Mining deposit of Nickel of which the considerable reserves contain also very interesting associated metals by their content (copper, cobalt, platinum metal group)
Deposit of Iron-Titan-Vanadium — this is the best mining deposit in world considering its reserves and high content
The actual mining exports include: gold, cassiterite, the Colombo-tantalite and the wolframite. There are also in Burundi some interesting deposits of non metallic mines such as phosphate, carbonate, kaolin, feldspaths, peat and limestone. Burundi has also some deposits of precious and half precious stones which can be interesting for the international market.
Recent seismic and magnetic surveys have indicated that there may be Oil under Lake Tanganyika and the Rusizi river plam.

Customers have come from as far as France, London, Israel, Massachusetts, and Las Vegas as well as from within California. It is not as if these invitations could not be purchased in these places, but the knowledge and the patience that Shirley exhibits, is what has made her successful.

I used the EH sentiment from the Mondo Hydrangea set and the flowers are from Alternew Fantasy Florals. Paint chips (Glidden Panetone colors) were used for my florals - so really authentic colors. There's some Spectrum Noir on the flowers - it didn't go on very well cause the paper has a slight sheen to it, but in the right light, it's really quite pretty.
What a beauty--love the colors & design, Betty! I have paint chips, but never actually used them. Maybe I should dig them out.
Clever use of the paint chips for your die cut flowers. And what beautiful colours. As well as a beautiful design
These are beautiful. I need to dig out my box of paint chips! LOL! I'm just finishing two birthday cards using the Fantasy Floral Dies and I love using them!
CASology's challenge this week (squiggle) made me think outside my "flower box" and finally came up with something. Had a small alcohol inked piece on my desk, so die cut the PTI butterfly as my starting point.
The gold embossed flourish is also from PTI. I cut out three more butterflies to give my butterfly a little weight and backed it with some more gold as there was gold foiling on the AI piece. Sponged on some broken china DO, spattered with water, added a few Nuvo drops and done! The CAS in my card is mostly monochromatic with lots of white space. Definitely an easy card to reproduce and great for using up scraps.
Betty, this is a stunner! So much depth and movement in the inks but still CAS perfection. Thanks for playing along with CASology this week!
Gorgeous card Betty! Love the pretty colours of your AI butterfly lined with gold. The pretty flourish is the perfect "squiggle"! xx
Beautiful card, Betty. The AI butterfly is gorgeous and great inking on the background. Love the colour combo too x
Beautiful card! Love the paper you used for the butterfly - and pairing with the gold flourish is perfect! Thanks for joining us at CASology!
Oh my goodness--CAS perfection, Betty! I love how you sponged on the blue & the AI with gold is gorgeous!
Gorgeous butterfly, Betty! I love how you added the flourish to create movement and how you highlighted it with your blue sponging...so elegant!

i feel like a loser. i expect more from myself, but i always end up somewhat stalling, hesitating, and just losing momentum. 7 months of bumming! i’d be glad if i were doing something rad, like travelling and what not. but i dunno. grass is always greener i guess.
anyway. i wokeup at 4am, and couldn’t go back to sleep. personal issues. 3 hours of sleep, and i have another interview in a couple of hours. i’m off to get breakfast for a change, in my frikkin cute yellow necktie. haha!
get back to work, monkeys! i put up new pictures from tali beach today. also, there’s a new compilation of old blog pictures. i thought it was cool cos you can click on a picture and it’ll take you to the blog entry. random random trivia. ah shit i’m so sleepy. stay tuned this week for more updates! until then.. sayonara, bis bald!
i watched la communidad last night (spanish filmfest), and the ticket lady asked me how old i was. “i’m 14” i said, with a smirk of sarcasm. you know what, its alright that i get carded in the states, because in fairness i do look young compared to everyone else. but here in manila? come on man, give me a break. all for a spanish b-movie too. hooray.
i got drunk on gin pomelo afterwards, because there were a lot of hot girls around makati. i’m kinda annoyed that i’m single. not that i’d want any random relationship to just plop down on my lap, but its just annoying sometimes.
just got back from tali beach last night with the boys. for the short amount of time that we were out of the city, i sure did eat a lot. boy, for someone very small, i have to admit that i even surprise myself with how much i can devour. my eating habits are so sporadic!
it was nice to get out of the city and wade in the warm pacific ocean. its nice to be with my old friends and piss everyone off by having annoying side comments to everything they say. its nice to just eat like there’s no tomorrow and fall asleep into a pig.. its nice to just have fun, without having the need to be intoxicated. and…. its nice not to have any work! shit, i’m a mega-bum extraordinaire. i think fungus will soon start to sprout from the crevices of my vegetating brain.
fear factor for dinner! can you see it? go ahead. click on the picture for an extreme closeup of what i ate tonight (that’s if you really want to know. you’ve been warned!). it tastes weird, cooked a bit bitter/sour.. it wasn’t that bad. the texture is a mixture of slightly crunchy body parts and a somewhat juicy body. its called camaro, which are actually crickets. its important to have an open mind, but i think its more essential that you have an open stomach. well, i guess they go hand in hand..
in a few hours i’m leaving for tali beach in batangas with the boys for a few days. its about time we went to the beach! hopefully there are a shitload of pretty college girls on semester break. and then they can all pat my beer belly. yeah, sure. :)
haha, i love the contrast in their replies. i was surprised that there were choppers flying outside my home and people lined up on the street, while a convoy of vehicles cruised on through quezon ave. apparently, its just the president of the united states passing by outside my house. yay.
During a demonstration in front of the US embassy, a Filipino held up a most unusual placard. It said,
i have a slight crush on my dentist. she always kids around that instead of wiring the brackets of my braces, they should just wire my neck instead (i was late today and they ended up till 7pm). its funny how they try talking to me when their hands are in my mouth. well aside from the fact that the three of them (lovely ladies) are quite endearing, one of them has a really nice ass too. ahh, the perils of being a small boy. why does this happen? i wish i could invite them out for some ice cream.
there’s something terribly wrong with my sleeping and eating habits. i wakeup for a few hours in the morning, take a nap the whole afternoon, and stay awake until sunrise. i end up eating once or twice a day, cos i only regain consciousness after lunch but closer to dinner.. so i just wait for dinner. baad. i’m scrawny enough as it is, and i need to get out of this rut. i think its time to get a day job, and go to the gym to normalize like everyone else. and when i start doing things like these, i know i have a lot of time on my hands: click here. by the way, i might start working for DTI- department of trade and industry. let’s see what will happen.. sorry friends in america, i’ll be delayed until further notice :’c
holey moley! my site is a semi-finalist to this year’s philippine web awards! i was wondering what was up with the sudden spike in hits (almost 4x the normal daily!). puh, and i thought all my friends just love and miss me! haha just kidding guys!:* i’d ask all of you to vote for me, for people’s choice.. but yeah right.. lets be realistic here. with my string of badluck, i don’t even want to know what will happen next! i’m enjoying the random good things that come along my way though. :) i’m gathering stuff for therese’s birthday on friday, hopefully everything comes out well! will post pictures if all is well! oops i forgot- my camera is busted. anyway.. cheers guys, and.. thank you :)
i was pulled over by kotong cops for allegedly beating the red last night on a small t-intersection along e. rodriguez. i just scratched my head at what a lousy day it had been, considering that ateneo lost to FEU a few hours before. and it didn’t help that the guy was fugly cos he only had one tooth left on his lower jaw which was already rotting as well. i was too numb to feel like bashing his face in while he stood there explaining how much of a hassle it would be for me to have my license suspended for 15 days, go through a whole-day seminar, and pay 1000php in fees for reckless driving. and so i lost 200php to grease money.. i should’ve shown him what reckless driving is, by running over his ugly ass when i had the chance.
the bad luck never runs out eh? so i went out to the living room to watch the big lasalle-ateneo game the other day. apparently, i managed to lock myself out of my room. even though the door was unlocked and turning, the mechanism inside the door decided to get fucked over, and nothing would budge. we had to kick the door open. i wonder what would’ve happened if i locked myself inside my room. but then again, there’s always the fire escape through the window. my feelings are already immune to bad luck, i’m too happy-go-lucky for it to bother me. besides, i think i have good karma anyway.
went out and saw some old friends today. paolo bugayong and ej solis, i miss those bastards. its high time we had a beer. good times, but i need to see those guys (and everyone else) more often. if you haven’t seen me in awhile, chances are, i miss your sorry little ass too- so call or text me, and lets go out. where the hell is everyone?!
The weather was incredible today, so Kat and I celebrated by taking the Vespa out on errands and caught 10,000 miles on the odometer en route to Topanga. We headed out to Lowes to pickup various stainless metric nuts and bolts for the exhaust re-install. I am still missing a few pieces, but hopefully it will come together nicely. Hopefully.
While crawling underneath the bus this afternoon, I realized that there’s something wrong with the thermostat. The cable that connects it to the air control flaps is cut, and the thermostat is expanded, which I would have never known had I not spent a bazillion hours on the vee-dub forums and 16 tabs open simultaneously on Google Chrome at any given moment. Also, I have a very uneasy feeling that the air control flaps are missing. I might have to take more apart to verify it, but I think I need to take things one step at a time before I get ahead of myself. Tomorrow I am going to dremel out a frozen bolt on the muffler strap. All of this is making me nervous.
Though he teased us that we could someday need the skill of oral storytelling in order to save our lives, the fact remains that our lives are our stories, and, if we are willing to take a moment to listen, we can understand each other, and our selves.
It’s been almost two months since Kat moved out of her old apartment. After weeks and weeks of searching, Kat and I found the winning couch this afternoon at a store called Denmark 50 along Melrose. There were a lot of close calls the past few weeks in choosing the right couch, but it eventually dawned on us that choosing a couch is a serious commitment that warrants extensive soul searching, sort of like scoping out a potential long-term relationship and not like haphazardly choosing a drunken one-night-stand at the local pub. It’s easy to fall in love, but it definitely makes more sense to do your homework in order to keep the love everlasting.
And so (just like the 4 other couches that came before it, hehe) we knew at once that the mustard mid-century modern piece from Denmark was the one. Pictures when we get her home next weekend :)
Right before I leave the house, the dog decides to piss all over his leg. Must be a sign of things to come.
When I get to the office, one of the guys tells me that a jackass customer ran off with a box of paint and other tidbits from the shop.
Fortunately, we setup surveillance cameras throughout the showroom floor, and caught the bastard on video. So I’ve spent the past couple of hours trying to figure out how to export the damn video, or even just screenshots of the schmuck into a USB key, and it ain’t working. Trying to access it through the network isn’t happening either, looks like it would only work with an old version of IE. Why am I always stuck with crap software? Nothing ever f cking works the way it should.
So I decide to take a break and pickup my freshly coated exhaust parts from Pyramid Powdercoaters down the street. I take the dog out with me, and he decides to piss on his leg. Again.
Just got back into the west coast from almost a week in New York. Spent the week with plenty of cool refreshments and met up with the usual cool cats of the East Coast, sponsored by Casa de Gatchalian. In a few hours I still have to take the Bart, make the OAK – LAX leg, and ride the Vespa up the 405 straight to work. It was a good run, and excited to see how the pictures will turn out. The weather was perfect while we were there, with the exception of one wet day. I took a lot of TTV shots, and got a lot of stares because of my ghetto cardboard tube light blocker thingamajig.
The weirdest part, was randomly running into people. First, was Jaime and Nic spotting us in the outskirts of Central Park. I mean, how the hell do you run into people you know in a sea of billions of people? And second was running into my old coworker OJ right by his bus stop. The funny thing is, the exact same thing happened the last time we were in the city and ran into Donna, my neighbor who I haven’t seen in forever. Nuts.
With so many of them happening around the world in rapid succession, I wouldn’t be surprised if we’re up next!
We as consumers have expectations on how things should work. A microwave should heat up my food. A brake pedal is designed to stop the car. We buy things because they’re meant to do something in particular. Manufacturers/service providers thrive in this capitalist market, and owe their existence to generating value through their ability to address a need and fulfill it. Of course there is that delicate balance between money and value, both horizontally and vertically through the supply chain. Doesn’t matter if you’re a consumer buying from a retailer, or a wholesaler buying from a manufacturer. Spend less, get less. Spend more, get more. Or that’s how it’s supposed to be.
Technology needs to become more transparent. The last thing anyone in the cube wants to worry about, is a supposed solution that only causes more problems. Sometimes I feel like I’m stuck with 1988-era answers to 2010-era problems.
For the first time, I found it a bit disturbing that the frequency and depth of my writing is somewhat affected by my alcohol intake. Even though I am naturally inquisitive and spend many a minute pondering the grandeur of nonsense, I usually find myself uninspired to place it in writing until a cohesive string of ideas are conjured up and ready for baking.
I have to admit that it’s a lot more enjoyable to sit down and sort things out when you’re carrying a little head buzz. Also, the world makes more sense with beer in hand. And as Batman may have it, I am sitting sober as a stone on a Friday night pecking away at the keyboard. Le sigh.
I was going through my old files when I came across the following printout. It was for an art class in my junior year, when I was in the throes of attempting to get a Studio Arts minor under my belt (short lived, and was blown out of the water once I started taking upper division Finance classes). Prof. Holman asked each of us to bring a little snippet, story, picture, whatever that speaks about art and design, make a copy for everyone and take a few minutes at the beginning of each class to talk about it. Here’s what I brought:
Wow. Last week, my credit card company called to inform me of potential fraudulent activity on my card. I occasionally get these calls since I traverse frequently between SF and LA, and the agent usually explains that the nature of multiple gas transactions are flags for dubious activity.
This time, the agent tries to verify with me a $400 charge at a supermarket around Bell in East LA, and then another $500 charge at a different supermarket, and then another $500 charge. I don’t have a huge family to feed and spending $1,800 in a single day on groceries located an hour away from my house don’t float, yo.
And then I come across this today: http://laist.com/2010/03/08/sheriffs_deputies_bust_id_theft_rin.php
Took the Vespa to work today. Just my luck, that it started pouring as soon as I got out of dinner. I was still a ways off, and had to ride the entire stretch in a pour. I’m happy with my jacket, which rolled off all the water. It wasn’t too bad except that I wish I had some RainX on my face shield and my butt was super cold and wet by the time I got home. Felt like wearing an old soggy diaper.
I’ve only ridden in the rain once before, when Ms. Kat brushed off the thunderstorm and lightning and insisted we ride up to SF from the Easy Bay to meet up with other scooterists (SFSG) for a rally. What a gangsta.
Anyway, not the first time that the lack of weather knowledge has gotten me into a wet situation. :)
Yesterday was my first time up to Squaw Valley where we spent the Sunday snowboarding. There was a storm that rolled in on Saturday so we were expecting a fresh dump of snow and clear conditions on the slopes. It was also Kat’s first time to ski, and she took her first classes. It was actually really hot since the sun was out full force, and I was roasting under the jacket with just a base layer and t-shirt.
I ditched my butt-pads in the interest of time and for the sake of any unfortunate onlookers who may happen to see me squirm my way into a tight pair of shorts. Whenever I would strap on the board, I would notice that my ass is soaking up a lot more moisture from the snow and attributed it to the missing ass-pads. At some point during the morning though, I kept noticing that my bib was several inches shorter than how I remember it to be. And how it was riding high up into my butt. Out of curiosity, I ask Kat if her bib is loose. And she replies in the affirmative. Apparently, we somehow switched our gear. Nice.
Drove down from SF this morning, and went straight to work. Since we are leaving the dog up north with Kat for the week, I kept getting hallucinations of a white fluffy ball roaming near my feet around the house. Oh, Mondays.

Hybrid laptops are always trending and options in the market grow with every new launch. They&apos;re light, easy to travel with and compact.
Most of the 2-in-1 laptops available come equipped with Windows 10. There are exceptions like the Cube iWork 1X which functions on Windows as well as Android, but they aren&apos;t easy to come by conventionally. The trend in the market, for now anyway, shows that the common convertible laptops are those from Microsoft .
However, not all 2-in-1 laptops are the same. Some are bundled with styluses as neat little designer-centric embellishments, while others are free of bells and whistles.
At the same time, you’ll notice that certain 2-in-1 laptops make use of 360-degree hinges while the rest take advantage of detachable screens, independent of their physical keyboards.
With Kaby Lake (a fancy code name for Intel&apos;s processor micro-architecture) now ruling the roost in terms of CPUs, HP decided it’s high time to flip the switch on its Spectre 2-in-1. With an overhauled keyboard and suave new logo, the HP Spectre x360 holds its own against anything Apple can show. In fact, some of the features have even drawn their inspiration from Apple&apos;s design.
The four-speaker arrangement, reminiscent of the iPad Pro, ensures user-facing sound regardless of its orientation. Meanwhile, the new x360 dual-wields USB-C ports for faster charging and data transfers. Sound familiar? At the same time, none of this stifles the battery life, which manages to exceed eight hours of straight use.
What’s more, the HP Spectre x360 can now be configured with a 4K screen and 1TB of SSD storage at a reasonable premium, making it even more deserving of the top spot on our list.
Unlike the Asus ZenBook Flip UX305 before it, the ZenBook Flip UX360 ditches the MacBook Air doppelganger approach in favor of a hybrid design with a whole array of ports. Everything from USB-A to USB-C is present, along with micro HDMI and a micro SD card reader. At the same time, it doesn&apos;t neglect the wholly aluminum chassis of the yesteryears.
Although it’s still strikingly thin, the Asus ZenBook Flip UX360 still manages to bear more weight than many other laptops in its class due in part to its reversible display. On the upside, the keyboard and trackpad, which are notably large and comfortable, also contribute to the laptop’s heft.
While we’re still not sold on the practicality of Windows 10 in tablet mode, the ZenBook Flip UX360 is ultimately an excellent value.
Somewhat inevitably, the hybrid nature of the Pavilion x360 leads to its undoing. It&apos;s underpowered compared to similarly priced laptops, and lacks the responsiveness and lightness of dedicated tablets. It doesn&apos;t do a great job of being a truly compelling example of either of these things.
But its usability, attractive and sturdy design, along with the impressive price tag means that it shouldn&apos;t be completely dismissed – especially if you really want a machine that offers both laptop and tablet use modes.
Like every 2-in-1 on this list, the Dell Inspiron 13 7000 does it all. During the day it can be a laptop used for work or study, but flip that sucker inside out and it’s equally proficient as a tablet, optimal for watching movies or serving up a fresh dose of memes to your friends on Facebook.
The Inspiron 13 7000 is not unwieldy nor is it overwhelmingly loud and sultry. Rather, it manages to pull of an exquisite design without any of the pitfalls that usually afflict notebooks like this one.
It’s not perfect, seeing as the Inspiron 13 7000 2-in-1 is a tad weak in the audio department. There’s a bit of a muffled sound dispelled from its middling speakers. This makes for a case where you’ll almost definitely want to shell out for a pair of nice headphones to go with it.
Despite this, the keyboard feels great, the screen looks great and the tablet mode leaves plenty of room for procrastination. There’s nothing that particularly stands out with the Dell Inspiron 7000, but if it ain’t broke…
The Lenovo Yoga 720 is a rare instance of a hybrid that feels just as homely as a laptop as it does a tablet. Although it’s the kind that flips 360 degrees rather than toting a detachable hinge, the modest pricing and formidable design choices more than make up for a slight deficiency in versatility. What’s more, the Lenovo Yoga 720 shows off the pristine capabilities of Windows Hello by means of a neatly placed fingerprint scanner.
For the price, the Yoga 720 gives you a nice, crisp screen (even if the 1080p starting model isn’t ideal) as well as a nice and comfy keyboard and trackpad.
The only caveat is the ports, which are limited to two USB 3.1 Type-C’s and one very pertinent USB 3.0 slot. Everything else, such as HDMI output and SD card fidgeting will have to be done using pricey adapters. Then again, if you’re living in the future and handling everything through the cloud, there’s a lot to love about the Lenovo Yoga 720.
Snapchat is launching its first Mac and Windows software that takes over your webcam and brings its augmented reality effects to other video streaming and calling services. Snap Camera can be selected as a camera output in OBS Skype, YouTube, Google Hangouts, Skype, Zoom, and more plus browser-based apps like Facebook Live so you can browse through Snapchat’s Lens Explorer to try on AR face filters. And through its easily-equipped new Twitch extension. streamers can trigger different masks with hotkeys.
Despite Snap Inc’s troubles following yesterday’s Q3 earnings announcement that revealed it’d lost 2 million users causing its share price to hit a new low, Snapchat Camera isn’t about stoking growth. You won’t even have to login to Snapchat to use it. Instead the goal is to drive more attention to its community AR Lens platform so more developers and creators will make their own effects. “We’re going down the path of providing more distribution channels [for Community Lens creators] and surfacing their work” Snap’s head of AR Eitan Pilipski tells me. The desktop camera could win Lens creators more attention, and Snapchat connects top the most talented ones to brands for sponsorship deals.
Strangely, Snap Camera has no interface of its own. Really, it should have a Photo Booth-style app so you can record photos and videos of yourself with your webcam and share them wherever. “We don’t want to compete in that space. We just want to bring Community Lenses to whatever apps people are using” Pilipski explains. One major app that won’t support Snap Camera is Apple’s FaceTime. Why? “I don’t know. Apple didn’t comment on that. Believe me we tried” says Pilipski.
Since there’s “not even a facility to collect the impressions” and users don’t have to login, Snap won’t be able to add Camera users to its daily active user count. With that number falling from 191 million in Q1 to 188 million in Q2 to 186 million in Q3 as it announced yesterday, Snap really does need more ways to keep people straying to Instagram Stories. It will have to hope that when video chat users see their friends or family using Snap Camera’s lenses, it will remind them to fire up Snapchat more often. And Lenses could go viral if they show in a Twitch celebrity’s stream.
The Twitch extension comes amidst more announcements at today’s TwitchCon event including the reveal of Squad Streaming and a karaoke Twitch Sings game for the service’s average of 1 million concurrent viewers and half-million daily streamers.
The Snap camera equips Twitch broadcasters with extra features. They’ll have access to game-themed lenses for League of Legends, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch. Viewers will see the QR Snapcode for the Lens on the screen which they can scan with Snapchat to try the mask on themselves for virality. Streamers get a button that lets viewers subscribe to them, and can set up a “bonus” lens that shows up as a thank you when someone follows them. And with hotkeys, streamers can trigger different lenses, like an angry one for when they lose a game or victory lenses for if they manage to beat all the other Fortnite addicts.
Over 250,000 Community Lenses have been submitted through Snapchat’s Lens Studio since it launched in December, and they’ve been viewed over 1 billion times. Snapchat realized it couldn’t dream up every crazy way people could use AR just in-house. Out-Lensing Instagram is critical to Snapchat’s business strategy. The more people that use Snapchat’s AR features, the more the company can charge businesses to promote Sponsored Lenses. With the user count shrinking, Snap needs to show its business is growing to salvage its share price and pull in the outside investment or acquisition it will likely need to make it to profitability. A desktop presence could not only make Snapchat more ubiquitious, but get it in front of older users and advertisers who might be a little scared of its mobile app.
Does your child’s nightly story time need some spicing up? Google is here to help with a new, genuinely adorable feature called Read Along with Disney that adds sound effects to a select handful of Disney-published children&apos;s books.
So far, that line-up of books includes Moana, Toy Story 3, Coco and Jack Jack Attack, Peter Pan, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, The Three Little Pigs and Mickey Mouse and his Spaceship, plus one holiday title – Mickey’s Christmas Carol – that will arrive in time for the holidays.
You can activate the skill by saying “Hey Google, let’s read along with Disney” and reading along in one of the aforementioned books. Once your Google Home Mini hears a key phrase, like “…and he gave the Legends Guitar a strum”, a line from Coco, the Home Mini will make a strumming sound.
Right now, the feature is only available on the Google Home Mini, but Google says it will add the feature to more devices, including the newly released Google Home Hub, by the end of the year.
To us, the storybook feature feels very reminiscent of the old children&apos;s books with small speakers built-in, but modernized for the smart home era and could be a really useful tool for parents trying to compete with YouTube videos.
And yes, while you could make the case that it&apos;s a little creepy for a device to listen to you read a story to your child, there doesn&apos;t seem to be any ill intentions (or data collection) going on here.
The partnership between Google and Disney is nothing new (the pair released a trio of Google Home-enabled Disney games back in September), but this is the first time Disney has released a physical product that interfaces directly with a Google Home device – potentially setting the foundation for something bigger down the road.
I grew up being told, "No one understands God. That is what faith is for." I thought life was a never ending quest for understanding; of people, of experiences, of what life means. It was only after I was saved that through The Holy Spirit not only is understanding possible, it's what God wants for us all.
It's not that we are to have faith in what we do not understand, it's to have faith in what can not be proven and gain understanding!
Now you know I'm not an empathetic person. That is why God brought my wife into my life. She has all that I lack. But through The Holy Spirit, I have understanding. I know the meaning of life. And I can understand people. Anyone can be understood. You don't have to like a person in order to understand that person. You don't have to like every bit of a person in order to find parts of that person you really love.
Wait, you say? Never mind liking or loving anyone, how in the heck to you understand anyone? That all comes down to the image of God that we were all made in. You've heard the expression "we are all the same" well why do you think that is? Get to know things about yourself that are universal. Things like the yearning to be loved and accepted, the desire share that love with others, the desire to create and make things better. These are things built into all of us by God. Get to know these beautiful things about yourself and not only do have better insight into everyone you meet, but you better know God as well.
“Imagine being paid to take people out into the wilds of Africa! To sit around the warm flickering flames of a campfire each evening, savoring the smell of wood smoke, while friendships are formed. Your safari guests have great expectations of their brief interval in Africa’s wilderness. You hold in your hands the realisation of their dreams of Africa.”
As a safari guide you get to walk or drive safari guests into the game reserve and interpret, in a meaningful and inspirational way, the large or microscopic elements of nature, all the while instilling in them a deep appreciation of nature and conservation.
You will be responsible for managing close encounters with Africa’s big five on foot or in the vehicle, ensuring the guests enjoy closeness to the animals yet with a healthy dose of caution taken. You will become a guide, teacher, friend, game warden, doctor, storyteller and sometimes even a cook for the guests! Each day in the bush is different as the interactions between species provide unique experiences that both guides and guests learn from. To top it all off, meeting interesting people from all over the globe provides a worldly element to the life of a safari guide.
Step 2: Complete the five to six months practical training at four of the unfenced tented camps in big game wilderness areas.
Step 3: Complete a five to six month internship at a lodge at which the course participants are placed.
I colleague recommended that I install htop the other day. It's an alternative to top which offers colour (ooh), a tree sort view (aah), and the ability to kill off processes within htop itself (very cool).

It was generally another positive week for the financial markets. For the week, the Dow and S&P500 gained 2%, while the Transports, Utilities, and Morgan Stanley Consumer indices added 1%. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical index rose 3%. The broader market continues to perform well, with the small cap Russell 2000 adding almost 2% and the S&P400 Mid-Cap index increasing 1%. The technology sector has gained a head of steam. For the week, the NASDAQ100 added 5% and the Morgan Stanley Technology index jumped 7%. The Semiconductors and The Street.com Internet indices surged 8%, while the NASDAQ Telecommunications index jumped 9%. The Biotechs added 3%. The financial stocks continue to rally, with the Securities Broker/Dealer index gaining 4% and the Banks 3%. And while bullion gained $3.30, the HUI gold index slipped 2%.
The Treasury market suffered. For the week, two-year yields actually rose only one basis point to 1.77%, while the implied yield on March 3-month Eurodollars declined one basis point to 1.36%. The five-year was a different story, with yields jumping 15 basis points to 3.12% (up almost 40 basis points in 2003’s seven trading sessions). The 10-year Treasury note saw its yield rise 11 basis points to 4.13%. The long-bond yield increased eight basis points to 5.04%. Mortgages performed quite well, with benchmark Fannie Mae mortgage-back spreads narrowing eight basis points. The implied yield on agency futures rose 12 basis points, about in line with Treasuries. The spread on Fannie’s 5 3/8 2011 notes narrowed one to 39, while the benchmark 10-year dollar swap spread was unchanged at 45.5. The S&P investment grade Credit spread index narrowed six to 228 (down from October’s high of 279). The S&P speculative grade Credit spread index narrowed 61 to 1209 (down from October’s 1570). Emerging market spreads narrowed as well, in what was a noteworthy narrowing of spreads throughout. The dollar index declined another one percent this week, dropping to a three-year low against the euro while losing ground to a widening list of currencies globally. It is also worth noting the recent weakness of the Mexican peso.
Broad money supply (M3) declined $4.3 billion last week. Savings Deposits declined $5.3 billion, and Retail Money Fund assets were down $2.8 billion. Institutional Money Fund assets dropped $7.1 billion, while Large Denominated Deposits added $2.2 billion. Repurchase Agreements jumped $10 billion, with six-week gains of $54.6 billion. While one week does not make a trend, the commercial paper (CP) market came to life last week. Total CP issuance jumped $17.2 billion, with financial CP borrowings increasing $11 billion to $1.180 Trillion. Non-financial CP was even up $6.2 billion (to $161.4 billion), the largest increase in about one year. By category, Asset-backed CP increased $14.8 billion to $740.5 billion, the highest level in 11 months (four-week gains of $26.9 billion). Asset-backed security issuance is said to be off to a “quick start,” with $7.2 billion sold this week.
Today’s dismal jobs report is further proof of economic weakness going into year-end, but it is arguably more valuable in providing clear evidence of an imbalanced economy becoming even more so. Over the past five months (August to December), the U.S. economy shed 81,000 jobs. The atrophying manufacturing sector lost an alarming 272,000 jobs. The overbuilt Retail sector has seen 101,000 positions lost since August, while the prospering Finance and Insurance sector has added 81,000. The economy has been supported by the continued expansion of “Services,” which added 258,000 jobs since August. Within “Services,” Health Services added 100,000 jobs, while employment increased 56,000 in Education in five months. The economy is also supported by continued growth in the government sector, where 151,000 jobs were added over five months. Since its peak in March 2000, Goods Producing jobs have declined 2.1 million to 23.6 million.
There is growing talk of the benefits the U.S. economy would receive from a weaker dollar (and its inflationary effect). Traditionally, one would expect a meaningful boost from the export sector. We instead see minimal help to a manufacturing base that has come to be a minor player in the maladjusted U.S. economy. In this regard, it is worth noting that the poor Argentine consumer saw prices jump 42% last year, after its currency (and economy) collapsed. Yes, the manufacturing-led economies of SE Asia recovered quickly on the basis of weak currencies and booming exports. But Argentina’s lack of a strong export sector is proving that benefits from currency weakness/crisis depend very much on the structure of the underlying economy.
Here at home, bond market issuance is on fire. According to Bloomberg, $27.8 billion of corporate bonds were issued this week, the strongest sales in 15 months. Combined U.S. corporate and agency debt surged to almost $65 billion this week (year-to-date issuance has already reached $81 billon). And, importantly, as money returns to junk bond funds - and as the crowd rushes back to higher yielding debt instruments - it’s not just top-tier borrowers now enjoying easy access to finance.
We’ll take Tyco’s $4.5 billion issue (raised from $3.75 billion) as a sign that life is returning to the convertible bond market. 2002 issuance was down 49% to $54.5 billion. Elsewhere, Household International sold $1.75 billion of notes (raised from $1.5 billion). The company’s 10-year notes were sold at 175 basis points above Treasuries. This compares to a spread of 250 necessary to sell 10-year notes in late November, and an almost 500 basis point spread on 10-year notes during the scary days of October. The spread is now at about 160. Elsewhere, Cendant doubled the size of its deal to $1.5 billion, Comcast raised $900 million, the Inter-American Development Bank sold $2 billion, DaimlerChrysler $2 billion, ASIF Global Financing (“a special-purpose entity with ties” to AIG) $1.1 billion, and Mexico $2 billion.
Today from Bloomberg: “Shares of Allegheny Energy Inc. rose as much as 18 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the utility owner is near an agreement with creditors to restructure its debt and avoid bankruptcy.”
January 7 – Bloomberg: “Federal regulators dropped a proposal to require additional quarterly data from lenders that target people with histories of unpaid bills after agreeing with banks that there's no standard definition for such lenders. The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision said current bank examinations are adequate to monitor the risks taken by so-called subprime lenders.”
On many fronts, things seem to be easing up. It is worth noting that the NASDAQ Telecommunications and Morgan Stanley Technology indices have year-to-date gains of 14%, The Street.com Internet index 15%, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor index 17%. Nextel is up 22% already, Capital One 31%. The weak, financially vulnerable companies are significantly outperforming.
Mixing “macro” analysis with playing the markets can be both fascinating and profitable. It can also be especially dangerous, as the more parlous the macro environment the more likely that inflationary efforts will be undertaken to “reliquefy” the system and stimulate lending and speculating. We reached another of these key inflection points during the fourth quarter and it is becoming increasingly clear that this latest inflationary “reliquefication” is today beginning to take hold. It may not last; it could easily be derailed by a faltering dollar, rising yields, or a myriad of other risks; and it will inevitably prove unsuccessful. But for now, importantly, financing conditions are improving markedly, and this is a major development with respect to company and industry analysis. Such a circumstance has, potentially, the greatest ramifications for the weakest, most leveraged companies and sectors – the marginal borrowers. That many of these marginal companies’ stocks, bonds, and Credit default swaps have attracted over-sized short positions is a dynamic of the current speculative marketplace that makes things all the more volatile and uncertain. And with the market appearing happy to ignore poor earnings releases – while completely dismissing today’s dismal jobs report – we see further evidence the market wants to believe in the unfolding “reflation.”
Yet, unrelenting inflation are the watchwords for the Mortgage Finance Bubble. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) weekly Refi application index jumped 29.1% to the highest level in seven weeks (up 245% from the year ago level). Amazingly, this historic refi boom is now in its 29th week and shows little sign of waning. For comparison, both the major refi booms from ‘98 and ’99 lasted about three months. The MBA’s Purchase index remains strong as well, increasing 13% to about equal the year ago elevated level.
Today from Countrywide: “Total fundings of $35.2 billion in December marked another monthly record for Countrywide. Total fundings of $102.1 billion in the fourth quarter produced the first $100 billion quarter in the history of the company. More importantly, year-to-date fundings eclipsed the $250 billion level, 82 percent higher than the $138.2 billion produced in 2001. Total purchase fundings in December grew 71 percent over last year to $8.8 billion, our second best month for purchase mortgages ever. For the full year, purchase fundings reached $86.4 billion, rising 65 percent over last year…Average daily applications remained brisk at $1.9 billion and maintained the pipeline of applications at $49.1 billion. It is noteworthy that these strong operational results were achieved during December, which was affected by the holidays and other seasonal Factors.” Year over year, December e-Commerce fundings were up 79% to $14.7 billion, home equity fundings jumped 64% to $1.2 billion and subprime funds rose 46% to $1.2 billion.
New Age subprime mortgage lender New Century originated a record $1.74 billion of mortgages during December, up 132% y-o-y. Fourth-quarter fundings of $4.47 billion were up 123% y-o-y. The company also stated that it “sees meeting 2003 production estimate of $16 billion,” while also announcing that its credit facilities had been raised to $3.47 billion.
Tuesday the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) released their third-quarter National Delinquency Survey. As was widely reported, the number of loans in foreclosure rose from 1.13% to a record 1.15%. “Total Past Due” declined 11 basis points nationally to 4.66%, although “90 days or more” delinquencies added four basis points to an elevated 0.82%. From the MBA: “There’s some good news in this survey. We believe that delinquencies have peaked and, as the economy continues its recovery, the housing market will continue to make its contribution. We believe going forward there will be fewer households facing the harsh economic reality of unemployment that helped to drive up delinquencies and foreclosures in the first two quarters of 2002. Certainly, that could change with any unforeseen circumstances, but all indicators are pointing toward a growing economy and ultimately an improving job market.”
The MBA is almost surely too optimistic. We’ll continue to aver that the data is especially unimpressive considering the record lending volumes and attendant housing inflation. We fully expect things to only get worse going forward. Keep in mind that Home Mortgage debt increased at an annualized rate of $786 billion during the third quarter. This compares to an average of $165 billion annually during the recessionary years 1991 to 1993. When today’s period of extreme Credit profligacy eventually subsides, expect unprecedented foreclosures and losses commensurate with boom-time lending excesses. The real trouble commences when the lending spigot turns from the current gusher to even a previously normal Credit flow.
In a clear sign of serious unfolding problems, the MBA survey reports that 12% of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans are either in foreclosure or delinquent. And for the first time, the MBA broke out subprime data, although warning that the 1.2 million unit universe should “not be considered representative of the total subprime market.” All the same, the delinquency and foreclosure numbers are quite alarming and indicative (along with FHA data) of fundamental systemic lending shortcomings. For the nation overall, 14.78% of conventional subprime mortgages were past due, with 8.58% in foreclosure. Some of the worst performing states in terms of total delinquencies include Pennsylvania (17.19%), Indiana (17.16%), Michigan (16.84%), Ohio (16.52%), Iowa (17.3%), Missouri (17.09%), Georgia (16.45%), North Carolina (19.54%), South Carolina (23.12%), West Virginia (17.36%), Alabama (19.76%), Mississippi (23.66%), Arkansas (17.21%), Louisiana (20.64%), Oklahoma (17.04%), Texas (16.45%), and New Mexico (19.05%). Wow…
We continue to be surprised by the degree of deterioration in the face of continued housing inflation and unparalleled Credit availability. Major mortgage insurer MGIC this week reported that total Insured Loans Delinquent increase 41 basis points during the quarter to 4.45%. This compares to 3.46% for 4th quarter 2001 and 2.58% for 4th quarter 2000. Subprime delinquencies increased 30 basis points to 12.68%, compared to 4th Q 2001’s 11.60% and 4th Q 2000’s 9.34%. Year-over-year, Total Loans Delinquent jumped 35%, while Losses Incurred surged from $51.7 million to $140.5 million. The stock surged on what was a dismal earnings report.
And while mortgage Credit inflation runs unabated, the structural nature of the dilemma posed by previous general Credit inflation is becoming more conspicuous.
January 7 – Bloomberg: “Texas, with a budget deficit of $12 billion, has surpassed New York’s $10 billion shortfall to have the second-largest budget gap among U.S. states behind California… State deficits nationwide now total almost $90 billion, the American Legislative Council reported. The council, a bipartisan group of more than 2,400 legislators from all states, predicted two years ago that states would have huge shortfalls, said Bob Adams, council spokesman. ‘The states boosted spending at unsustainable rates during the 1990s,’ Adams said. ‘Budgets increased faster than inflation and faster than the rate of population growth.’ The end of the '90s economic boom left states unable to finance government, he said.”
New York Governor George Patake from his “State of the State” address: “We face a fiscal crisis today of a magnitude that we have not faced in our lifetime.” With personal income tax receipts sinking 14.8% between last April and October, forecasts now call for a state deficit as high as $10 billion over the next 15 months (according to Bloomberg). New York City is facing a $3 billion deficit for the next year.
California Governor Gray Davis from his State of the State Address: “Tonight, I come before you with a challenge as great as any in our state’s history – and a real plan to meet that challenge… On Friday, I will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented. It will be balanced. It will be responsible. It will make significant cuts in nearly every program. And it will return this state to sound financial footing…my budget will erase the $35-billion shortfall and eliminate the structural deficit… Our current fiscal structure has not been updated in 25 years to reflect either our changing economy or demographics. Our budgets have become painfully dependent upon extremely volatile sources of revenue, constraining our ability to make long-term vital public investments. It’s high time to shake free of this boom-bust syndrome… State government will need to do more with less – and we will. But we also need to do more to create new jobs now and to stimulate our economy… My goal is to help create 500,000 new jobs over the next four years. I’m proposing a new California Jobs plan that will put more Californians to work – not in years, but in weeks. We’ll begin with “Build California” – a new initiative to accelerate the flow of billions of dollars into our economy. Last November, the voters of this state did their part by approving $18 billion in bond measures for better schools, affordable housing and new water projects. In December, I asked the State Allocation Board to expedite $5.5 billion from our new School bond… These funds will finance 1,000 new schools… We will also fast-track our $2.1 billion housing bond… I will also direct my agencies to accelerate freeway and public transit projects by one full year… Moreover, I will recommend that the UC Board of Regents Pension Fund invest in California housing…” (Perhaps this CA deficit problem is not as restrictive on spending as I first imagined…)
Today from Bloomberg: “California, confronting a record $35 billion budget deficit, may borrow for the first time to cover obligations to employee pension funds. Governor Gray Davis and Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson are considering selling pension bonds to raise about $800 million owed to retirement funds for state teachers and other employees, said spokeswomen for Davis and Wesson. States such as New Jersey have used pension bonds to raise money pledged to worker retirement accounts without raising taxes. The borrowers are betting returns achieved by the funds will exceed the cost of the debt and reduce the need to contribute more to the plans later. The risk is that returns lag, leaving the states paying interest on the debt while still having to pump money into the funds.”
Well, the much-coveted “reflation” elixir appears to be off to a gangbusters start. And with the corporate bond market coming to life, the mortgage Credit system continuing to fire on all cylinders, and government borrowing poised for a record year, Team Reflation should be careful for what they wish for. Indeed, the Economic Cycle Research Institute's future inflation gauge monthly index rose to 116.6 in December (up from Dec. 2001's 96.4), the highest level since October 2000.
Recent historic speeches by Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan have paid tribute to Milton Friedman’s revisionist analysis that the Fed’s derelict failure to create adequate money supply was a major cause of the Great Depression. Dr. Bernanke noted Friedman’s premise that if (Governor of the New York Federal Reserve Bank) Benjamin Strong would not have died in 1928, it is quite likely that he would have held the “bubble poppers” at bay, while adding sufficient liquidity to thwart deflationary forces: “Friedman and Schwartz argues in their book that if Strong had lived, many of the mistakes of the Great Depression would have been avoided.” I have argued that such post-Bubble policy analysis is generally misdirected, and there’s no need to rehash yet again this week. But I would like to share some interesting (and hopefully pertinent) material found reading through Lester V. Chandler’s 1958 biography – Benjamin Strong Central Banker.
“Never forget that (the Federal Reserve) was created to serve the employer and the working man, the producer and the consumer, the importer and the exporter, the creditor and the debtor; all in the interest of the country as a whole.” (“A reminder written by Benjamin Strong and always kept in the top drawer of his desk.) (page 1)
“The original theory of the Federal Reserve was that it would make money available primarily by rediscounting for its members ‘short-term, self-liquidating commercial paper arising out of the production, distribution, and sale of goods and services.’ …Thus the emphasis was often placed on the quality of paper discounted rather than its quantity… Emphasis shifted inevitably, though slowly, from the quality of paper discounted to its quantity, and from passive accommodation to positive regulation.”
“What no one could foresee, and what would have displeased the Democrats who sponsored the (Federal Reserve) act and so greatly distrusted 'Wall Street,' was that leadership in the System would soon be exercised by an official not even mentioned by title in the act – the Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who was a former Wall Street banker.” (page 12)
Reading through Chandler’s detailed account of the creation and early years of the Federal Reserve, I was reminded of the major influence the rampant inflation of 1917-1920 and subsequent deflationary bust had on the young Federal Reserve System. It clearly had a profound effect on Benjamin Strong. I found it fascinating to follow the transformation of a cautious, prudent Strong to that of revolutionary and activist central banker (to the world). It was actually quite similar to the transformation we have witnessed of Alan Greenspan. Financial and economic innovation, rampant financial speculation, and truly extraordinary domestic and international developments made for sweeping, complex changes and issues. Experimental, activist central banking was thought by those in power as the answer. Businessmen, investors and, importantly, the speculators wanted to believe. But in the end the activists absolutely lost control of their experiment and it all ended in disaster.
Interestingly, the young Ben Strong used language such as “the heresies of Greenbackism and fiat money” and stated that “if the United States Government embarks once more upon the expedient or experiment of issuing fiat paper…the day will come when we will deeply regret it.” Strong, along with other founding members of the Fed, saw inflation as an evil that must be fought at considerable cost if necessary. The history of repeated inflationary booms and busts left little room for any other view. I found the following quotes regarding efforts to deal with an inflationary Bubble early after the Fed’s formation especially interesting considering current views on such matters.
During 1919, “everyone was talking about the speculative mania. Speculation there certainly was – speculation in the stock market and in commodities. But this was no mere speculative bubble confined to the surface of the economy. It was a rapid and insistent rise of spendings that penetrated almost every market for goods and services, raising not only prices for output but wages and other costs as well.” (page 136)
Federal Reserve inflation had played a key role in helping finance the war effort, but this inflation had taken on a life of its own. Fed leadership was resolved to conquer the beast.
Adolph C. Miller, economist and founding Federal Reserve Board Governor (served 22 years) in a letter dated February 26, 1919: “The most serious part of inflation is, after all, the aftermath. We sow the wind to reap the whirlwind. Somehow or other we have got to come down off the perch. But this is an uncomfortable process for nearly everybody and, for some, a very costly and ruinous one. We shall be fortunate in this country if we get off without some very serious financial trouble and some very serious political troubles growing out of the currency and credit disorders. That has always been true in the past and I am terribly afraid will be true in the present instance…I am satisfied that the expansion that has gone on throughout the year 1918 and that we shall undoubtedly have during the year 1919, is pretty nearly all pure inflation. On every side the evidence of the demoralization and the serious disturbance of established relationships that this unsettling of prices has brought is at hand… There has got to be liquidation, there can be no question of that.”
Benjamin Strong (letter dated February 6, 1919): “The day of deflation approaches. The process of deflation is a painful one, involving loss, unemployment, bankruptcy and social and political disorders, whereas the process of inflation brings in its train prosperity, employment, rising prices, a happy absence of bankruptcies and general state of contentment, all of which leads me to the point of this letter, namely, that mistakes by the present Treasury Administration from now on will bring retribution of a very certain and definite character which was not likely during the days of war excitement and expansion, but which is now beginning to loom up most definitely during the distasteful days of paying the damages… If inflation is arrested at its present level the readjustment of prices and the losses resulting will be no greater than that now fixed by the existing price level. If inflation continues…the liquidation will be arrested and our later troubles will be the greater. Notwithstanding the hardships and losses resulting, I believe you will agree that it is inevitably necessary that our banking position must be gradually deflated… Our policy in this country has so far been the soundest of any, we have avoided a debasement of our circulating media…”
“…In 1920-21 the Federal Reserve had not yet developed this concept of its functions – to use its powers continuously and positively to promote maximum employment, the highest sustainable rate of economy growth, and stable price levels. Almost unquestionably, it was still operating under a prewar theory of central banking in which the dominant guides to policy were financial rather than economic. The Federal Reserve Act, much influenced by foreign experience and assuming the continued function of an international gold standard, had not intended that a new System should manage money positively and continuously with the prime purpose of achieving some desired behavior of employment, business activity, and prices. Any such suggestion would have been considered heretical. Rather, its dominant purpose should be to assure ‘sound’ financial conditions, which meant first of all maintaining gold payments and avoiding financial crises. A central banker accepting this set of priorities naturally feared inflation more than deflation and insisted that on some occasions deflation was necessary for the attainment of primary financial objectives.” (page 183)
“In May, 1920, inflation gave way to deflation and depression.” It was, indeed, a painful experience and the young Fed came under intense criticism. “…The depression experience had a great influence on (Strong’s) thinking and on future Federal Reserve policies.” “Like most other Federal Reserve officials, he believed that some deflation of bank credit was essential and that some price reductions were inevitable and desirable. Within three years, Strong himself had rejected many of these ideas.” “All this (cautious, passive central banking) was soon to change when Strong and other Federal Reserve officials came to understand and use open-market operations as an instrument of policy… the old standards were soon to be rejected, partly because of the painful experience.”
“No other peacetime period in the history of the System has witnessed a faster development of both Federal Reserve thinking and policies than that starting around the end of 1921 and culminating in 1924… Theirs had now become a philosophy of positive regulation, and they were consciously using their powers to promote high and stable levels of business activity and employment, stability of price levels, and “European monetary reconstruction.” (page 189) “The year 1922 witnessed the first large-scale purchases (open-market purchases of government securities) and the beginning of the use of this instrument for policy purposes.”
From Ben Strong, November 1922: “Since the Federal Reserve System has found its position as a large lender it becomes one of the most important factors in the economic machine because it must, whether it wishes to or not, exercise control over the volume of credit, which in turn has such a far reaching effect upon prices, wages, etc… the Federal Reserve, as the central factor in the control of credit, must rely upon the application of wisdom and intelligence of the first order. There are no automatic penalties which would apply as in ordinary times to an orgy. In view of that, students of the System should watch it, criticize its affairs, protect it against invasion from political or other sources…” (page 199)
“From Ben Strong, July 1923: “Our job is credit. It makes no difference if it’s a deposit or a bank note. If we regulate and keep fairly constant the volume of this credit, - always with due regard to gold imports and exports…- we are doing our whole duty.” (page 202)
It would appear that Benjamin Strong’s heart was in the right place, but also fair to say he had no idea at the time how this powerful new mechanism would fuel asset inflation and foster a dangerous Wall Street speculative Bubble. How financial Credit, once unleashed, would prove impossible to contain. “The easy-money policy of 1924 was of historic importance. It was the first large and aggressive easing action deliberately taken by the Federal Reserve for the purposes of combating a decline of price levels and business activity and of encouraging international capital flows.” (page 241) Repeated interventions were deemed necessary, including the historic aggressive easing of monetary conditions to assist the Bank of England during 1927. With each liquidity injection, the flood of finance to New York only quickened. Each year the speculators become more emboldened and the maladjusted economy more distorted. By the arrival of 1929, the Fed was faced with a radically imbalanced system, with goods and commodity prices moving in one direction and asset prices in another; some sectors of the economy overheated, many turning very weak. The Fed attempted to manage systemic liquidity and the quantity of credit creation, but it had become hopelessly impotent in directing finance to productive purposes. Speculative finance had come to dominate. Benjamin Strong and the Fed, in their effort to do too much, had completely lost control.
Adolph Miller, in 1931, regarding the Fed's aggressive 1927 operations: “…it was the greatest and boldest operation ever undertaken by the Federal Reserve system, and, in my judgment, resulted in one of the most costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years. I am inclined to think that a different policy at that time would have left us with a different condition at this time.” (page 438)
Most Depression era economists and analysts held similar views to Miller: Fed operations had fueled a most dangerous strain of inflation and precarious speculative Bubble. Even Alan Greenspan in the sixties spoke of the Depression as a result of the Fed repeatedly putting “coins in the fuse box.” (The Transformation of Alan Greenspan.) Yet, Milton Friedman’s revisionist analysis pinning the blame on the post-Bubble Fed for not creating sufficient money supply was what people wanted to hear in the early sixties. It, today, clearly suits Greenspan, the Fed and Wall Street just fine.
“The philosophy of the American government of (Strong’s) day was not, of course, the classical one of laissez-faire, but it was certainly one of limited objectives and limited intervention in economic affairs. No government during the period would have seriously considered assuming the heavy responsibilities that have now become commonplace. Nor would it have expected the central bank to do so. Such ideas were alien to those responsible for the establishment of the Federal Reserve System. They assumed that the new System, like the government, would be one of limited objectives and limited intervention. Of course they expected it to prevent crises and panics and to reform the banking system in several other respects. But they foresaw neither the need nor the opportunity for any basic modification of the functioning of the international gold standard. They saw no need because they were pleased with the gold standard… Strong was among the first to recognize that the old rules of central banking, which implicitly assumed a smoothly functioning international gold standard, were obsolete and that radically new concepts of central banking would have to be developed.” (page 477)

Im not sure if either Jane or Phil have ever seen a Braille display or listen to the synthetic speech of a screen reader used by a blind person before, but they sure are willing to do what it takes to get around any glitches I might make as a result of not seeing the screen.
I know, first hand, that as long as you, the customer, do your part, a program like Build Referrals, headed by such a dedicated team, will give both you and your programs the very best there is to offer. Thank you both so much.
I want to thank you for Build Referrals. I haven't made a lot of money yet with any of my online things, a few bucks here and there. This system of your's will make me focus. I have bought so much garbage, I can't believe what I have done :-) This system looks like a ray of hope. When I saw who was behind BR I knew it would be well planned and thought out. Thank you for this wonderful opportunity.
The old buildreferrals was the very first referral site I joined long before Mike took over, and then you arrived on the scene. I must say that the newly launched buildreferrals site is absolutely fantastic, and is going to be a perfect vehicle for both newbies and seasoned professionals to skyrocket their business to a level never seen before. You really need to upgrade to take full advantage. Well done Jane and Phil,you deserve all the praise!
English is not my native language and I cannot express all my feelings properly. But when I saw my first commissions at my back office. I was so excited! These were the FIRST money I earned online for the 6 months working there...
I just want to thank you all for helping me to setup my site. So far it seems pretty simple which is great because I'm a newbie. Thank You, Thank You, Thank you.
I joined as a platinum member and shortly received 5 members in my downline. I highly recommend platinum membership because there is so much on offer. I know I made a good choice with Build Referrals.

Tucker would really like FMCSA to state which CSA scores are negative sufficient to help make shippers shun individual carriers. But, he states, the company will not likely do this. "That's why it really is not possible for shippers or brokers to utilize the basic principles for just about anything sensible," he clarifies.
Intercontinental ocean freight forwarders arranging for shipments to and from the US should be licensed from the Federal Maritime Commission as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries.[8] An Ocean Transportation Middleman is possibly an ocean freight forwarder or simply a non-vessel-working common provider (NVOCC). An ocean freight forwarder is "a person or business in The usa that dispatches shipments from the United States by using common carriers and books or or else arranges space for those shipments on behalf of shippers; ocean freight forwarders prepare and approach documentation and conduct related routines pertaining to shipments."[nine] An NVOCC is "a standard carrier that holds itself out to the general public to deliver ocean transportation, challenges its individual costs of lading or equal paperwork, but does not work the vessels that transportation cargo"; or, "a shipper in its partnership with the vessel-running widespread provider linked to the motion of cargo."[nine] Organizations could obtain the two licenses and could act in the two capacities. The U.S. legal distinction concerning The 2 is the fact a freight forwarder acts as the agent of a principal (typically a shipper or consignee) whereas the NVOCC can be a transportation firm (provider) that may be bodily answerable for the carriage of goods and acts as its personal principal.

1 purpose shippers won't need to use CSA scores to inform unsafe carriers from Harmless types is that many carriers usually are not during the databases. "Some hundred thousand carriers are in operation today, but just a percentage of these have scores beneath the CSA program," suggests Mike Regan, president of Tranzact Systems in Elmhurst, Sick., and chair on the National Shippers Strategic Transportation Council (NASSTRAC) advocacy committee.

International freight forwarders, NVOCCs and customs brokers generally cost for transferring documents to a different transportation organization at vacation spot.

Hosting a webinar is a project that should take careful thought, deliberation and focus – all of which involve time. You’re not doing your company a favor by haphazardly throwing together a webinar presentation and hoping it all goes well. Taking the time to prepare for a first webinar that you can be proud of, and leaves your audience engaged and excited should be your end-game. It’s important to remember that a webinar is not for you, it is for people watching the webinar.
We put together a list of 5 things you must do before hosting your first webinar. Each of these steps will help you focus on the people attending the webinar and ensures you meet your own business objectives. These 5 things don’t even cover the meat of the webinar and how to put it together – these are just the things you need to do first before beginning that process! Building a great webinar is an art form, and we can help you do it the right way.
Ask yourself, ‘what are my webinar goals?’ When you are putting on a webinar, it should not be for your benefit only. The webinar should also be for those attending. Your first thought should always be, what topic would be useful for registrants, and help achieve my goals? For each webinar, you should come up with 1-3 goal statements.
To help with your goal of lead generation, for example, webinars are a great way to do this and use as a means of communication with prospects and customers. It is very common for an organization to build webinars that touch on pain points their audience is experiencing and in these webinars, they will then provide ways to alleviate this pain. Typically, this pain is solved through their product and service offerings.
When putting on a webinar, your goal should always be top of mind, but you don’t want a sales-y webinar or product-demo based webinar. Those are incredibly annoying AND boring for all participants involved.
Now that you have selected your goal(s), you need to pick what objectives will help you to achieve your goal. If your goal is to generate new leads and build brand awareness, the way to do that is to not present your audience with just the features and benefits of a product. Instead, you want to provide webinar attendees with useful information that they can bring back to their job, all the while showing how to do that using your product. Even if you don’t bring in new leads, you are still providing your existing clientele with awesome information – which is a win/win!
When you are promoting a webinar, knowing the webinar objectives will go a long way in your messaging and you can better tailor your webinar invites, landing pages to these objectives and thus your target audience, which we will discuss below.
During this planning stage, you should also write a few objectives statements for why someone should attend your webinar and what they can expect to get out of it. This content will also help with the event registration write-up portion!
Selecting your target market for the webinar is key. You must figure out what audience you want to speak to. Going back to your goals and objectives, if your goal is to generate 50 new leads then getting your webinar invite and registration page in front of the people who are more likely to be interested in your product and actually buy, will be crucial. If your organization has done the work to determine your buyer personas, this is exactly who your target audience is.
If you have not developed buyer personas, make that a to-do, as it will be highly beneficial for all marketing initiatives. Click on this link for more information on buyer personas and helping in your building yours!
Your target audience could be titles like Chief Marketing Officer or Director of IT, but your target market could also go by industry, such as education or government. If your goal is to generate new leads for the sales team, narrowing down your target audience will go a long way in ensuring the right people are attending your webinar and that the sales team is not wasting time in following up with unqualified leads.
When building your first webinar (or really any webinar!) picking a relevant topic is very important. The topic and title alone will be the deciding factor on if someone is interested in your webinar content and if it even applies to them. Go back to your target audience, and who the best fit for your webinar is… what topic is meaningful to them? How can you help them excel at their job or make their lives easier? If your audience can get a tangible takeaway from attending your webinar, you’ve done your job.
Picking a topic should be well researched and thought-out. If your topic and content come from just one to two people, you are doing it all wrong. The best way to ensure a webinar is successful is to understand what is important to your target audience.
Survey your customer support & sales team. Do they notice any trends or top questions being asked? What are the biggest pain points they hear on sales calls?
Survey your existing customers on pain points. Why did they pick your product and solution? How did your product solve that pain? And even just ask what topics they are interested in and likely to register for.
Survey existing sales prospects to ask questions on why they had an interest in your products. From their answers, you can find trends that you may need to speak to help prospects learn more about how your product/business will be beneficial for them and lead them down the buyer’s journey from a prospect to a customer.
As a follow-up after your first webinar, it’s a good time to also survey your webinar registrants what next webinar topic they are likely to attend – this will help in planning a series of webinars and building a consistent schedule. Your best content will come from your prospects and customers – make sure you keep those ears open and listen!
With all of this surveying and research complete, you should then have a list of potential topics or pain points to select from. Take a step back, and review this list and see:
Now that you’ve determined the goals, objectives, target audience and potential topics for your very first webinar you need to figure out how you’re going to actually deliver your webinar! There are tons of web conferencing, webinar hosting and video conferencing solutions out there to choose from. Knowing the goal of your webinar will help you to pick the best webinar hosting platform for your organization.
Far too often webinars are a simple screen share with little to no engagement with your audience outside of a chat box. This is not the route you want to go if you really want to develop a relationship with your audience and encourage further interactions.
When picking a software to host your first webinar pay special attention to the experience your registrants will have.
What engagement tools is included in the webinar software? Chat, polling, Q&A options? Social media engagement opportunities?
Remember: A webinar is about your audience, it isn’t about you. When picking a webinar solution, keep your audience top of mind, always!
Additionally, what additional webinar services does the potential solution have? Are you on your own if should you run into an issue with the platform? How can you get help when you need it? There is nothing more embarrassing than being unable to manage your webinar live. Make sure your webinar provider has your back. This can be the difference between a good experience or a bad one that hurts your business’ reputation.
Once you’ve decided on the above #1-4 things, one of the biggest deciding factors in a successful webinar is your webinar speaker!
Your speaker or speakers should identify to the target audience you picked. They should be relatable, speak their language (meaning, has similar experiences to those attending the webinar) and have a strong, confident presence both in the tone of voice and how they look on the screen should they turn on their webcam.
Another important thing on selecting the right webinar speaker is deciding if they are tech savvy! Your speaker might have to run the webinar software, do they have the skills to be able to manage this platform AND present? Some web conferencing providers offer webinar services that can help you manage the platform during the live event, but what if your budget doesn’t allow for this? Ensuring the speaker is well prepared in managing the conferencing software in and out is imperative for the success of the webinar.
Another final note on selecting a webinar speaker is making sure the speaker is a professional. Do you know if your webinar speaker will show up on time for dry-runs and even the day of the live event? The webinar speaker can’t show up late! When preparing for your webinar dry-runs (which you should do at least 3-5 dry-runs per webinar to work out all the kinks), does the speaker have their content ready, are they prepared to run through the entire presentation? Having the answer to these questions before picking your speaker will go a long way in ensuring your webinar is a smooth process and that they are prepared for your audience and leave a positive, lasting impression.
Now that you’ve read through our top 5 things you must do before your first webinar you are ready to begin this new, exciting initiative. Putting on a webinar is a great experience, especially if you’re prepared. Think of your webinar as a show – preparation for any show is key, and should you do this prep work you’ll be sure to get a standing ovation from your audience.

What a wonderful spirit filled the church this Sunday. Matt and Tami offered ministry on the topic “Jesus Calls”. Matt talked about Jesus calling his disciples, Samuel’s call and his own calling. As promised I will share a story from Paul Bear’s book. In 1944 Paul Bear was working for the Chandler Improvement Company when he received this call from God.
I was on my way to this meeting, going north on Central Avenue in Phoenix, when, out of nowhere a voice spoke to me and said, “Go see Mr. Mans.” (I don’t remember this man’s name but this will suffice.) I was pastor of the Phoenix Church at the time. This voice, I heard it as plain as though someone was sitting next to me, but there was no one around. I thought to myself, yes, I will go see him after the meeting I am going to. But the voice continued by saying, “No, go now!” Again I thought, that is pretty insistent, but what about the meeting I must go to? The voice came again and said, “Go now!”
So I obeyed the voice and went, forgetting about the meeting in the attorney’s office. I turned west on the first street. I said to myself, I’ll go but I don’t know where he lives. I went west on this street, across the railroad tracks to the western part of Phoenix, turned north one block and west again for about one block. All this time it seemed as though I was directed by an external force. I stopped in front of a small white frame house. I got out and knocked on the door. The door was open and a man said, “Come in.” I went in, through the living room and into a bedroom, and there was Mr. Mans lying in bed.
I looked at him, he had tears on his face as though he had been crying for some time. He looked at me and said, “Am I glad to see you!” I asked him what the matter was, and he told me this story. He had had trouble with his left eye and it went blind. The doctor had to take it out. He had gotten back from the hospital the day before and that morning the doctor told him that his other eye was also going out, as the trouble he had with the left eye had spread to his right eye. The doctor had told him he would be totally blind for the rest of his life. He said he had been praying all day that this would not happen. His wife was away and did not know about this as yet.
I talked with him for a time and then administered to him according to our faith in God. I had a small bottle of consecrated oil with me. This bottle was small, about an inch long and half an inch in diameter with a small amount of oil in the bottom. I put a small amount of the oil on my finger tips and anointed his eyes with it, then put a drop on his head, put my hands on his head and prayed to God in his behalf. After I finished praying we both felt better, but that voice was still with me and said to me, “Leave the bottle of oil with him and tell him to bathe his eyes with the oil each morning until the oil is all gone, then bring the empty bottle back to you.” This I did. I stayed with him almost an hour and a half. Then I left.
After I left Mr. Mans, I suddenly remembered this meeting I was to have gone to. I began to think, boy, I will certainly get fired now for I not being at that meeting, as they could do nothing without the papers I had in my car. I decided to go to the attorney’s office anyway even though it was by now after five o’clock, and I knew everyone would be gone. Anyway, I went into the building and opened the door to Mr. Gust’s office. The attorney was sitting there reading. He was alone. He looked up and saw me and smiled. “Oh, it’s you.” I said, “Yes, I’m late!” Then he looked at me a little surprised and said, “You did not hear? The meeting was called off. The men could not come from Los Angeles, so the meeting was rescheduled.”
Was I relieved. I went home feeling much better about everything. About a month later this Mr. Mans met me in the church and gave back the empty bottle. He told me the doctor said the eye was much better and would not have to come out. A few months later, this Mr. Mans moved back to his home in Virginia. He still had one good eye.
Hi my lovelies I've got another nerdy monthly subscription box to share with you all and this times it's our Lootcrate. Lootcrate is an Australian geek and gaming monthly subscription box that costs $29.95 (including P&P) a month (roughly £17.00). Every month Lootcrate's staff handpick 6-8 of the newest geeky/gaming goodies for you to enjoy.
Following on from last months Villains themed box Augusts boxes focused current and pass Heroes and it certainly packs a punch (pun intended).
How awesome is this Guardians of the Galaxy Funko POP! Lootcrate Exclusive Glow in the Dark Groot Bobble-Head. I recently saw GOTG and Groot and Rockets partnerships really stole the show for me and every time my mini Groot bobs his head brings a smile to my face. As he's a Lootcrate exclusive I've not been able to find an exact RRP but the ordinary Groot has an RRP of £10.99.
And with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles release just round the corner I would have been disappointed not to find some TMNT goodies and I wasn't disappointed with not one but two!
First up is a TMNT Ooze Action Leonardo Figure (RRP £10). This 2.6" figure has a moveable head and arms and comes with 2 swords covered the green goo that was the mutagen that have them their superpowers. As a kid I loved the TMNTs and now I love that I can share them with my own daughters. T my youngest loves them and couldn't wait to rip this open and start playing.
The second TMNT goodie is a Leonardo Bandana Glasses. My eldest K loves these, they fit for perfectly even though they are meant to be adult-sized and they have gone straight into her fancy dress box.
One of my favourite MegaDrive games growing up was Sonic The Hedgehog and I still love playing the game now on our Xbox360. So this novelty Sonic Breeze Air Freshener is a great fun item that will soon be hanging in our car.
These lightening bolt Shwings are awesome (they totally channel the Flash), it just a shame we won't get any use from them having only one pack but 2 daughter. I do however I know a little boy who will love them so I'll be passing them to his mum soon.
I'm a huge Dr Who fan so the inclusion of this Lootcrate exclusive bonus digital loot has me intrigued. I look forward to checking out the Doctor Who: Legacy game as well as finding out more about the other 2 games, Defense Grid: The Awakening and Gauntlet.
I'm so glad to find another fab magnet to add to my collection, this months is for Deadpool's favourite cereal Willson's Chimichang'os (The Breakfast Of Anti-Heroes), which funnily enough look a lot like chocolate weetabix. This months badge rocks as well, I love that it features 2 of my favourite superheroes Captain America and Batman. As always there is a monthly magazine included and packed full of geeky goodness.
I thought last months internal graphics was awesome but the artists have gone all out this month and recreated the TMNTs sewer home which my girls are having great fun playing with it as its perfectly sized to for this months Leonardo action figure.
As a family we loved this box it was full of stuff to interest us all and we're as excited as usual to see what goodies will be in our September box.
If your interested in finding out more about Lootcrate every think you need to know can be found here.

DALLAS (AP) - A pregnant Texas actress who told FBI agents that her husband had sent ricin-tainted letters to the president and New York City's mayor has been arrested.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in the eastern district of Texas says Shannon Richardson of New Boston, Texas, was arrested Friday.
Spokeswoman Davilyn Walston says the arrest comes in connection to ricin-laced letters that were sent to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Walston tells The Associated Press that Richardson was arrested around noon. Walston declined further comment, saying she wasn't in position to provide details.
FBI agents wearing hazardous material suits were seen going in and out of Richardson's house on Wednesday in New Boston, about 150 miles northeast of Dallas near the Oklahoma and Arkansas borders.

This blog is all about Conveyancing in England and Wales. Including topics like the Conveyancing process and Conveyancing case law. As it contains everything about conveyancing and conveyancers it should be of particular interest to property lawyers and property solicitors, as well as COLP and Compliance Managers.
The Bank of England's governor has recently warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices.
Lenders will not swallow their losses happily. For conveyancers, that means a tsunami of file reviews because lawyers are an easy target for a lender looking to offset a loss – or pass it on altogether. Any failure by the lawyer to comply with the letter of their mortgage instructions – typically based on the lenders’ handbook – will be pounced upon.
Many firms will be removed from lender panels or fail to find a PI insurer, which amounts to the same thing. There will be fewer conveyancing law firms. Strong risk assurance embedded in your firm’s everyday practice can put those worries to rest.
Ask yourself whether you have ever considered a pre-lender compliance audit. Many firms make enormous efforts to ensure their client Ts and Cs and website copy are compliant, but don’t take the trouble to check on lender compliance. Yet the consequences for a firm tripping up on lender Handbook requirements can be fatal to a law firm.
It’s not just about peace of mind. A lender compliance audit can bring real value to your firm. A third-party firm acting in the same way a lender would can uncover issues and knowledge gaps that you can address to make your conveyancing processes more rigorous.
In this day and age of increased accountability and regulatory requirements, audits should be welcomed, not feared. If you’d like to find out more about how Lexsure’s lender compliance audit can assist your firm please contact support@lexure.com
A silt fence is a temporary sediment (loose soil) control fence used primarily on construction sites to protect the water quality in nearby bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, streams, ponds and oceans.
They are most commonly constructed of a geotextile fabric with embedded wood stakes spaced every couple feet. The wood stakes are commonly made from lower grades of domestic lumber that do not meet the strict grades for cabinet grade lumber.
Some manufacturers of silt fences have reached out to us in search for a strong wood that can withstand tough soil conditions. Soil that contains a lot of clay or rocks will often snap the standard wood stakes that you standard silt fences are constructed with.
We have supplied silt fence stakes made from sustainable South American hardwoods to a silt fence manufacturer who was in search of stronger wood stakes.
South American hardwood stakes do not contain any chemicals, are naturally rot resistant and up to 3 times harder than oak which make them the perfect choice for a silt fence stake that is intended to keep our water ways clean.
In addition sometimes a “super” silt fence is required by agencies such as the EPA on certain projects.
Super silt fences are commonly constructed with a chain link fence embedded into the ground and a standard silt fence placed in front of the chain link fence to control the sediment run off.
Some manufacturers are testing our South American hardwood stakes to make a “super” silt fence that does not require the added chain link fencing. The chain link adds extra strength to the silt fence.
Since our hardwoods are 3 times harder than oak a super silt fence made with our hardwoods may not require the added labor and costs of the chain link method.

Ipe wood is well known among builders, contractors, architects and even homeowners because its proven to last 70+ years outdoors with no maintenance.
Due to the proven longevity of Ipe Wood many professionals specify it for their jobs. As a result this drives up the price. Over the last 10 years we have seen the price of Ipe wood increase over 20 percent.
During the same time frame we have other species that have slightly decreased in price such as Cumaru which is very comparable to Ipe.
Currently for 1 x 6 Ipe wood decking our price is $3.09 per linear foot and for 5/4 x 6 Ipe wood our price is $4.46 per linear foot. Check out our webpage for the most current Ipe Prices
Hardwood decking like Ipe is priced by the linear foot and most deck projects are calculated by the square foot. This makes estimating and pricing the amount of Ipe wood you will need a little challenging.
We have linear feet to square feet calculators built into our decking pages that will help you convert linear feet to square feet.
As a general rule of thumb if you are using a 6 inch wide deck board and you have a 500 square foot deck you need a little more than double in linear feet since a 6 inch wide board has a net finished width of 5.5 inches.
To be exact you would need 1091 linear feet for a 500 square foot deck if you use 6 inch wide deck boards. Don’t forget to add in some boards for waste and cuts that you may incur when building your deck.
Following this information will help you get an accurate price for an Ipe wood deck. If you find the price of Ipe wood a little higher than you were hoping please contact us. We have other species that are similar to Ipe but cost less.
We speculate that in the future the prices of Ipe will continue to rise as they have. This is one reason we have stocked a steady supply of other species that are nearly identical to Ipe such as Cumaru.

This week at our mill in Brazil they are finishing up some ship lap hardwood trailer decking. This hardwood trailer decking is made from Angelim Pedra which is commonly called Brazilian Apitong. Brazilian Apitong is used for most of the high quality flatbed trailers and lowboy trailers in North America. This wood can withstand years and years of excavators, bulldozers and all the harsh muddy and wet elements that heavy equipment trailers see in day to day operation. Brazilian Apitong can far outlast North American hardwood trailer decking which gives trailer owners more time to using their trailers to haul heavy equipment than ripping up old worn down and rotted trailer decking. If you are looking for the best wood for a trailer deck whether you have a small utility trailer or a fleet of flatbeds give us a call for some deals on trailer decking. 1-877-232-3915

Our Brazil plant started manufacturing Brazilian Cherry deck tiles to add to our existing deck tile line. Brazilian Cherry is an extremely dense and durable wood that will last for many years and offer low maintenance just like all our other exotic hardwood species.
Like many of the Brazilian species Brazilian Cherry will start out lighter in color and after a short amount of time in the sun the wood will darken to a rich red cherry color. Our deck tiles are constructed with solid wood backing which is stronger than most of the plastic backed tiles on the market and we only use stainless steel screws in all of our tiles. Our deck tiles are so durable you can place them directly over an old concrete patio or on a rooftop deck.
These will be shipped from our Brazil manufacturing plant to our four factories located throughout the US for shipment direct to our customers homes and job sites. No job is too big or small. Call us today 1-877-232-3915 or buy deck tiles online

Bucking some big logs at our sawmill in Brazil. “Bucking” refers to cutting the log to length after it has been delimbed. Some of these logs arrived to our mill in 40’ lengths, so bucking we go:) A simple yet complicated process as choosing the wrong lengths can have a negative effect on the yield of the final product. Luckily these are nice clear logs with little defects, so the yield is easier to maximize. Controlling the entire process helps us ensure that the logs are selectively harvested and that the quality is controlled as tight as possible along every step of the journey. Still buying your hardwood from middle men? Call our Sawmill 941-388-9299 for all your exotic decking, flooring, beams, deck tiles, live edge slabs, Urban reclaimed, FSC certified, and hardwood flooring needs.
Our mill workers at one of our Brazil mills are wrapping up their daily production tally of rough sawn blanks. This Angelim Pedra hardwood is mostly used for heavy duty trailer decking after we kiln dry and shiplap the boards at our finishing mill. It’s an economical specie, also known as Brazilian Apitong, and is more ecologically harvested than the Malaysian Apitong used on tractor trailer decking throughout the US. Angelim Pedra is also used for flooring, decking, furniture and a variety of industrial products. Whether you need to deck a small utility trailer or a whole fleet of flatbed trailers we are your direct source for hardwood lumber.
This is an Angelim Pedra which is also know as Brazilian Apitong. This is one massive log and it’s a good example of the perfect time to harvest a large tree that’s no longer producing seeds and is starting to center rot and die. The selective extraction allows for smaller seed bearing trees in the forest to thrive and let’s us utilize good lumber before rot/disease set in. If this tree were to sit too long rotting away it would stop producing oxygen and start putting out carbon dioxide. Some awesome slabs came off this Log at our sawmill this week. Give us a call for all your live Edge slabs, hardwood flooring, deck tiles, beams, decking, and cabinet grade lumber needs.

Aivan ihania nämä! En tiennytkään, että olet taitava virkkauksessakin:)Tai oishan mun pitänyt sekin tietää!
I take Spanish language course starting this week at LBI UI – Salemba. Yay! I’m so excited! The class is twice a week every Tuesday and Thursday. Carlos is my teacher. He comes from Granada, Spain and has been living in Indonesia for 10 years. He always speaks Spanish in our class whether we understand it or not (he speaks Bahasa fluently, tho). He said it will make our ears familiar with the language. I do like the way we’re guessing what he’s saying by listening to the intonation and some familiar words. Sometime we quite understood what he meant, yet unable to reply back because we didn’t know how to answer in Spanish.
Years ago, I have learned Spanish for only 1 term (3 months). All I got from the previous course is I’m familiar with the language and understand a little but couldn’t speak it, haha… Now, I want to learn it from scratch the way I learned English. I remember the first time learning English back in my junior high days. I was so excited and enthusiastic about it. I still do now and it feels good. This time I will make myself able to speak or write Spanish fluently. Hasta pronto!
Welcome to my new ‘blog’ home. After having this domain for 2 years (and haven’t done anything about it), I finally decided to get a webhost. Supported and assisted by my dear friend, Avianto, I finally set up this website. Though some updating still be needed for finishing touch, now I present it to the world.
With the coming year 2009, I put forward the hopes and positivies in life. Life has been good providing us chances. It’s time to grab those chances and make them meaningful. Beside the regular, I will post my film reviews and other writings. These writings might have been published in magazine or solely mean for review. They are possibly done in Bahasa because I don’t want to ruin the exact meaning of the languange when I wrote them. So, from now on, you will see my blog will have postings in bilingual.
We do appreciate your good comments about your stay at BlueBay Hotels & Resorts! Which hotel did you stay in?
Thank you for answering our survey. Hopefully we will welcome you soon at any of our hotels & resorts.
We have stayed at the Blue Bay Lanzarote now three times.So from that you can ascertain that we like it!
One of the most important things that makes one hotel stand out from another is the welcome you get on arrival and the attitude of staff during your stay. The staff at the Blue Bay are excellent and remember you from one year to the next. That’s pretty amazing when you think of the number of guests that they see each year.
The location is ideal for us. We are able to travel to all of the main sites that we wish to visit easily and if we don’t want to go out then there is plenty to do at the hotel besides eating and drinking!
My husband and I spent our 20th wedding anniversary at BlueBay Lanzarote, thr staff are lovely, the atmosphere is perfect, we plan to go back with our children. It is our favourite holiday destination so far and would recommended BlueBay to everyone.
Thank you for great time in your Bellvue resort in Alcudia. Me and my husband had a great honeymoon there.
Our stay in Blue bay Lanza was a very enjoyable experience, which we’re sure to repeat ,We love Lanzarote its people are the most welcoming its beaches the best the weather is glorious what more can you ask for in a holiday destination. The Blue Bay Was the icing on the cake .
Blue Bay Esmerelda was an awesome place to stay ! From the second we walked up for our 10 night vacation to the time we finished our vacation was superb.. Couldn’t ask for better service. The food the housekeepers everything was excellent!
The blue bay gran Esmeralda is beautiful and elegant. The service is gracious and the food is superb. The pools are relaxing and the activities are fun.
I spent 4 days at Blue Bays, Playa Doradas in Puerto Plata and had a great time. I will go again to that place, the people are nice and make the time very pleasent , I will go back to this resort to experience all that great time again.
Loved the Bluebay Hotel in Lanzarote. The staff and entertainers were brilliant. If I had a query they saw to it straight away.. We did have a problem with our door lock but one of the maids got someone immediately. This was going beyond her duties and she couldn’t speak much English, but she did the best she could as well as us. Would have love more entertainment but hey you cant have everything,, Hope the pool tiles are fixed.
We love the Bluebay Hotel at Lanzarote, this has been our family holiday destination for 12 years whilst the children have been growing up. It never fails to meet our expectations & we are happy to see that many staff at Bluebay Lanzarote are still employed there after all this time, from chefs to waiters, receptionists & maids. We are booked to stay again in 2014
This will be our 21st. year in a row that we will be returning to Blue Bay Villas Doradas in the Dominican republic. We will be there for 4+ weeks this year. We have also been to other islands but years ago, we settled on Blue Bay Villas Doradas, not because it is the poshest, cheapest, closesest, etc. but because of the staff . They are our Dominican family. They make us feel at home. Some of whom, started waiting on tables and worked their way to assistant managers. In fact Ines, the current General Manager, started at the guest service desk. She does a marvelous job and deserved the promotion. .
My wife teaches figure skating all winter in the north country, so going to a resort without children is a plus.
We booked in August for out vaction in March, My wife is already counting the day till we leave. We love it there.
We went with 20 people and we had a great time! The hospitality was amazing! I haven’t been there for 2 years now and I still answer my phone with “Hola”! I would go back in a second!
Staying at the Bluebay was the most wonderful trip I have ever had and I can’t wait till I can bring my daughter and my grandchildren.
I had a marvelous stay at our Cancun Mexico stay for 1week. Nice clean rooms great services wonderful programs for all to enjoy . My girlfriend , her two daughters and their friend were with me for the one week . I met many other guests there and all seemed quite pleased with everthing that Bluebay had to offer
During the years when the recesion hit the torist trade it has been hard for resorts to maintain both the structure of the resorts and the standard of the staff. It was a great plesure to return to the Blue Bay Beach Club in Grand Canaria and find that this is exactly what has happened. The overall standard of the accommodation and the helpfullness of the staff made our week stay one of the most enjoyable. Thank you.
i just came back from a vacation at bluebay villas doradas and received a survey in spanish , i would appreciate an english version of the survey so i could gladly fill it out . thanks ………….pierre

Starting your own tattoo shop entails great knowledge when it comes to tattoo supply. Whether you’re a budding tattoo artist or a professional who wants to enhance his or her skills, having the right tattoo supply can make a huge difference to your work.
Now, before you proceed to buying all the most expensive brands out there, here is a guide or a refresher on what every tattoo artist needs in his workshop. Here are the basics when it comes to tattoo supply:
Obviously, all artists need a good tattoo gun and sterile tattoo needles. This is definitely the most essential of all tattoo supplies that you should be spending your money on.
Needles should be the tattoo supply that is the cleanest of the bunch. Also, if you want to get as much tattoo supply as you can, you can purchase different needles for different tattoo necessities and styles such as shading and lining.
Aside from the machine itself, your tattoo ink should be of top notch quality to ensure the beauty and color of your tattoos. After all, among all tattoo supplies, the ink is the most important component as it is the material that permanently stays.
There are many shops that sell tattoo supply and you can definitely find many colors with the best brands. You should invest a lot of money on ink when purchasing tattoo supply.
These tools are necessary for creating the design before actually applying it. These instruments help a lot in conceptualizing new designs and you can also use the designs found here as your portfolio for clients to look at.
Tattoo machines are not battery-powered and need external power sources but getting the supply attached to the machine won’t really be much of a chore. The power supply is often connected to a foot pedal like the ones you usually see on sewing machines.
At Chesapeake Bank, we want to help every person reach his or her dreams. So as part of a new customer outreach program, we are asking customers, “What are your hopes for the future?” We are also launching this effort with six profiles of customers whose amazing stories will inspire and enlighten.

The rising cost of education is an expense that is difficult for most people considering a college education. The good news is that there are often scholarships and grants available to students that can ease the burden of payment. At Chesapeake Wealth Management, we’re big supporters of continuing education and we love to share community resources with our neighbors. That’s why we’re proud to be a part of The Ben D. Conley Charitable and Educational Foundation scholarship!
Wicomico Church native Benjamin Delano Conley was always interested in the well-being of others. As a result, in 1986, he and his wife Virginia created The Ben D. Conley Charitable and Educational Foundation to assist students in the Northern Neck communities.
Each year a specified amount of funds is issued to distribute among eligible students. Applicants are selected based on need, academics and level of extracurricular activities.
The late couple entrusted Chesapeake Wealth Management to serve as trustee for the foundation following their death. Jean Light, Senior Vice President for Chesapeake Wealth Management, currently serves as the president of the foundation.
It is our honor to continue to pass down the Conleys’ legacy and be a part of their long-term impact on our community. The original mission of the Conley Foundation remains the same:
“To provide support and assistance to students and the organizations which enhance and improve the health, education and community welfare for citizens of Lancaster and Northumberland Counties, Virginia.”
Interested students can apply for a scholarship via mail to the Conley Foundation. Applications are accepted through June 15th. Applicants must provide a copy of their SAT scores, a high school or most recent college transcript, as well as two written personal recommendations. The completed package should be mailed to:
This year we would like to be able to give even more! If you are interested in learning more about The Ben D. Conley Charitable and Educational Foundation, please visit their website at www.conleyfoundation.org. As for leaving your own legacy, our team at Chesapeake Wealth Management is always available to help however we can. Call them today 800-434-1181.
If you call Richmond home, the name Maggie L. Walker should sound familiar. Her legacy lives on all around the city, and late this year there will be a new addition to the landmarks in her honor. Here at Chesapeake Bank, we’ve partnered with River City Ventures to finance renovations to the old St. Luke Building located at 900 St. James Street in Richmond.
“The St. Luke Building is an important reminder of the contributions Maggie Walker made both locally and nationally,” said Chesapeake Bank Richmond Regional Executive Frank Bell. “We’re especially excited to see the building renovated in her honor.”
The St. Luke Building is where Walker became the first woman in the country to open and serve as president of a chartered bank.
According to Richmond Biz Sense, the four-story building will be converted into a dozen one- and two-bedroom apartments above a 3,700-square-foot commercial space. Developer Charles Ayers Jr., plans to display an original office chair, personal safe and other items in the building to commemorate Walker.
Walker was a major public figure in her day, advocating for the rights of blacks in Richmond by educating and empowering the community through various organizations and initiatives. In 1902, Walker established The St. Luke Herald newspaper. The following year, she founded the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank which opened at the St. Luke Building in 1903.
Originally a grade school teacher, Walker earned both national and state recognition by serving as the leader of the Independent Order of St. Luke, a national fraternity and burial society. Her leadership increased the organization’s membership and helped it to achieve solvency. Walker was also on the board for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and an active member of the Virginia Interracial Commission. Her impeccable vision, relentless energy and dedication to civil rights was truly unmatched.
Maggie L. Walker’s St. Luke Building will be finished by the end of the year. Its completion will signify new housing for Richmonders and a reminder of the important history within our community.
The Lancaster by the Bay Chamber of Commerce recently announced the selection of our very own Jeff Szyperski, Chesapeake Bank President & CEO as the 2018 Business Person of the Year.
According to Lancaster by the Bay Chamber Executive Director Anne Paparella, Jeff was nominated by his business peers with overwhelming support.
“The nominations for Jeff spoke highly of his business leadership attributes as well as the countless hours and commitment he has given towards our community,” Anne Paparella told the Rappahannock Record.
Jeff is dedicated to supporting local businesses, which work together to strengthen our local economies. Beyond his work at Chesapeake Bank, Jeff was also the founding director of Lead Northern Neck, an initiative designed to strengthen community leadership within the region by equipping citizens to take civic action.
All of us at Chesapeake Bank are excited and humbled to see Jeff recognized for all of his hard work and dedication to the local businesses and nonprofits in the communities we serve.

I’m going to get a nasty reputation for myself out of all this. I just know it. I’m going to get a reputation as a guy who clings sadly to the coat tails of all the successful writers here on Social Media. A puny little rat whose only gratification is this lark of pretending he knows great writers.
But it didn’t start out like this. Oh no. It started years and years ago on Twitter with a brace of naturally creative folk who often chatted to each other, just for shits and giggles. As the years progressed, and the chatting waned somewhat, an impressive proportion of this loose cohort stepped up to the plate to make tangible waves in the wider world of writing and general creativity. I won’t start naming names but you probably know who they are and there’s more of them on the way, just you wait and see.
I sometimes equate it to a ‘Cambridge Footlights’ type of a set-up. A bunch of precociously talented people naturally migrated, for a time, to a casual ‘Bauhaus’ of creativity and then moved onward and upward. Of course I don’t place myself on this team. To continue the analogy, I was lucky enough to be an audience member at the ‘Footlights’ as it was all kicking off.
The latest of this mob to step blinking into the limelight of the Big Game is Jason Arnopp whose novel ‘The Last Days of Jack Sparks’ is currently wooing all comers.
I reckon that Jason never once 'stepped ‘blinking' into anything in his entire life. If he’s coming in, he probably going to boot the door down or, at the very least, push the door open with his bum and ease inside with a quirky smile and a killer line or two.
No, sir. Jason has earned these spurs of his. He’s been putting in the hard yards and filling the sweat buckets with his writing work for many the long year and seeing him righteously ascend with his new book is a joyous thing to behold. Respected commentators and celebs alike have queued up to sing the praises of this tome and, only in the last few days, it has become the current choice for the BBC Radio 2 Book Club. So, while the entire listenership of the BBC is having their eyeholes opened by the book, you can have a go at it too.
‘Jack Sparks’ is a horror novel. This works because Lord Arnopp is literally steeped in horror. He has studied and immersed himself in and rolled about in horror all of his life. He is, for want of a better phrase, a big bucket of horror. And his novel is like a peeled pear, dropped into this big bucket of horror and left overnight and then lifted out and squeezed gently onto some virgin pages. It’s reverential, informed, knowing horror and fans of the genre will lap it all up like one of those post-modernist toothless vampires we see now and again.
But, wait once more, ‘Jack Sparks’ is not a horror novel or, if it is, it is also so much more. Whilst being scary and bloody at times, Jason’s novel also goes much further. It captures the zeitgeist of the social media era like few other writers have managed to do. I was reminded of Jay Mcinerney’s debut novel ‘Bright Lights, Big City’ which tasted the 1980’s in much the same manner as Jason sips at the 2010’s. Jason explores the paradox that sits at the heart of Social Media. Although it is hugely interconnected and vibrant and buzzy and alive, it can also be a wasteland of loneliness and pain and poison and negativity. Jason sees sees both of these sides and, out of this seeing, he creates a character who is effectively lost in the depths of Social Media, who pursues an adventure that is often several steps removed from truth and reality and which is probably, ultimately, a lie. This is a strong metaphor for we the people born of the internet age.
Jack Sparks himself is a wonderfully unreliable witness. His narrative is periodically debunked by his friends and family as he races from event to event. But are the friends and family reliable themselves? No straight horror novel this, it is rather a complex quilt of lies and betrayals and foiled drug-fuelled ambitions.
Jason has pushed far beyond what he needed to do to write a successful horror novel. Like the best of writers, he has mined his own life experiences to try to find the truths which lie there. The ambition of the writing extends well beyond the street-smart japery at which he clearly excels. Knowing the little I know about Jason and his life, I can see traces of Jack Sparks in there. The Heavy Rock, the Journalist, Brighton. It might be hard to know where Jack starts and Jason ends if it weren’t that Jason is such a good guy and Jack such a burk.
Another book I was reminded of, while reading this, was ‘The Third Policeman’ by Flann O’Brien. I’ll bet that Jason doesn’t even know of this book’s existence, it being rather Irish and maybe a bit Niche, but the concerns of life, death and eternity were tackled there too and these are big concerns and it takes a big writer to go after them with this level of humour and with no small measure of sympathy too.
Jason’s book is extremely savvy, sharp, witty, observant, clever and, yes, dammit, good but it is also something a bit more. It is a metaphor, perhaps, for how we can become lost in ourselves and, if we allow that to happen, how hard it can be to follow the breadcrumbs back to safe ground.
The story of ‘Swallows and Amazons’ occupies a small place in my heart. To be perfectly honest, it occupies several small places in my heart.
So, this afternoon, I set off, all by myself, to see the brand new film that’s just been released in cinemas. I’m glad to report that those places in my heart are safe and sound and, if anything, have been made just a little bit bigger.
This might be a better story if I could trace my relationship to the book all the way back to my own childhood but I can’t. I read a lot of things but I didn’t read that. The book actually came to me as an adult but there were some kids involved and those kids were my own.
Every night, I used to read a little bit of a book to my kids when they were tucked up in bed. In this tiny ‘bit-by-bit’ fashion, huge swathes of literature was read aloud and sleepily consumed. Things like ‘Watership Down’, ‘The Hobbit’, the entire ‘Lord of the Rings’ trilogy, all of the Harry Potter books (except the last one… the reading was finished by then) volumes and volumes of reading in tiny bits, every evening, over years and years. And one of these books was ‘Swallows and Amazons’ by Arthur Ransome. It was part of a children’s’ treasury collection that I got from somewhere. Little hardback books like ‘Treasure Island’ and such. I thought it might be a nice read and so we launched into it.
I think my son liked it, how could he not? But it was me who fell hardest for it. Here, you see, give or take a few elements, was my own childhood transcribed into a book. The lake, the boats, the island, the camp fire, the fish, the adventure. The little story transposed itself effortlessly into the vivid geography of my own memories and validated the adventures of my youth.
Fast forward then to an entirely separate thing. A friend tentatively made on Twitter. We frequently hesitate to use that word 'friend' when it comes to social media interactions. It can be fraught with misinterpretation and one sided expectations between people who will, most likely, never meet in person. But, sod it, here was a friendship made. At first, a simple exchange about a favourite musical. Later a beautifully written radio play listened to while decorating the kitchen. I know it sounds tenuous and hard to conceive but friendships can be forged with little things such as these at their root. Add in a tight network of mutual online acquaintances – people of the highest quality - and suddenly one cares how things go with people. How things work out.
When I heard that Andrea Gibb was commissioned to write the screenplay for Swallows and Amazons, it was, for me, a moment of great serendipity. A valued pal and a treasured story, thrown together. It was exciting and it was nervy too. It became important that it would all work out.
Speaking as such a fan of the source material, the brand new film which Andrea Gibb has written and which Philippa Lowthorpe had directed is a lovely thing.
There are additional story elements here, necessary to enable the transfer from page to screen in a completely engaging way, and these work admirably well. But it is the very 'outdoors'ey, adventuring nature of the book that weaves the main magic here. Is that just me? Because I have been out in that breeze and skidded across those grey-blue waves? I don’t think so. I think we all crave a little real adventure. And that’s the thing with Swallows and Amazons, it is a real accessible adventure. You don’t need to be able to fly or leap tall buildings in a single bound to have an adventure. All you really need is a back garden, some conspirators, and a will to venture out.
That’s why the kids at this afternoon’s show remained enraptured. The parents might have been nervous on their behalf, for where was the million pixel animation and where was the primary-coloured super hero? These heroes point their bow to the centre of the deep lake and, before they are done, will hold real fire in their hands. These are adventures that can be carried out from the cinema and into the real world. Children can see all that. Children know.
In my own childhood adventures, I was definitely Roger. My elder brothers kept the knives, real and metaphorical, for themselves and always stood a little in defence between me and the world. You could see it clearly in young Bobby McCulloch’s eyes, on screen. The burning need for acknowledgement, to be a bona fide big boy. I was Roger and he was me but each of the Walker children will find a soul mate in each darkened theatre where the film plays. Tatty is so wonderful, literate and feisty and the elder children carry the pressures and responsibilities that come with their station.
Knowing a little of the screenwriter, it is interesting to see a taste of that strong social and moral sense seep neatly into the writing. Even the villains, for all their cocked hats and ironic smiles, even they have their own code, their own subtle doubts about what they do, their own respect for genuine strength and bravery.
It is, at the end of the day, a story for children and there must be an element of gentle threat and conspiracy and ultimately a general ‘winning of the day’. But lots of adults, like myself, will come to the picture house alone with their furtive popcorn and they, too, will find what they seek. A sense of the outdoor childhood that we all remember a little better than it actually was. A time of freedom and adventure. A sense of home.
So these are the small places in my heart. A children’s book which moved me as an adult and a friend entrusted with the responsibility of keeping it safe in its transition to the screen and doing an absolutely wondrous job.
I had a little hunt for which of the Agatha Christie novels people liked most of all. In the list, which took in a lot of titles, there were two books which were name-checked over and over again. It turned out that I had not read either of them (nor seen them on telly, nor been told ‘whodunnit’). It seemed like an opportunity too good to miss so I got hold of them and I read them.
In this piece of half-assed research, I was also a little surprised to read how people first came to Agatha Christie’s books and how closely their experiences mirrored my own. Almost invariably, people came to the murder mysteries very early on in their reading lives. Many graduated directly from Enid Blyton and the like.
I don’t think this is terribly surprising. Christie write a rather uncomplicated world, in the sense that the goals of the protagonist were not hard to discern and follow. Reading that bit back though, it sounds a bit pretentious. These were simply rattling good mystery puzzles and it was fun to try to solve them along with the little detective, sometimes to fail, sometimes to rather gloriously succeed.
For me, for better or worse, it was always Poirot never Marple or any of the others. I’ve written here about my immersive nature of my reading of ‘Orient Express’ as a young kid. Studying the plan of the train, interrogating the suspects along with Hercule, never for a moment imagining the audacious solution until it was too late to claim it as my own.
But I digress. On to those two unread favourite books. There was lots of general favourites that I had read. The unavoidable ‘Orient Express’, the very first ‘Mysterious Affair at Styles’ and the very last ‘Curtain’ which I also love. In among these, though, were the two unread ones which had jumped out at me. They were a) The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and b) Five Little Pigs. I got hold of them, one from the Library (it was filed away in the back-of-house area) and the other from the Charity Shop in a nice compendium of four Poirot novels, including my own favourite (see below).
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd: Okay. I loved this book. I read it as if I was twelve again, seeking to solve the mystery right along with the inestimable M. Poirot. When I came to three chapters from the end, I stopped and assessed everything I knew and, yes damn it, I came up with the correct culprit. No spoilers here. I can see why this book is greatly favoured and admired. It is archetypal Christie with all the required elements beautifully intact. In reading more about it afterward, I noted that it is often in the running for critic’s choice as the best murder mystery ever written. I also noted, with interest, that Lord Mountbatten played a considerable part in the conception of the very interesting solution. Granted there is an awful lot of stuff happening around the old Manor on the evening that poor Roger gets dispatched and the suspects are, at the end of the day, a familiar enough motley crew of gentlemen and ladies. Nonetheless, it is a wickedly clever example of what Agatha Christie did when she was at her very best and you could do a lot worse that getting it and reading it and seeing if you, too, can find the killer... before it's too late.
Five Little Pigs: for me, was a surprise entry into the list of favourite books but only because I knew nothing of it. In looking into it, I saw that Christie here took the ‘Moonstone/Rashomon’ approach of having a number of diverse witnesses give their account of a crime from their own particular bias and through the mists of elapsed time. I found it to be a slightly frustrating read because each of the five protagonists must be revisited several times to go over and over their testament. Setting that aside though, it is the solution here that made my sit back and mentally applaud the technical dexterity of Agatha Christie. She really knew people’s minds and, if that was not always evident in the writing, it was certainly evident in the way she could play her audience, the readership, and lead them by the nose to wherever she needed them to go.
Without wishing to give too much away, I had this one ‘cracked’ quite early on. Even though I had cleverly worked it all out, I also clearly saw how Christie was leading me away from my conclusions . Further, I saw how she was laying the groundwork for the reveal which I knew had to be right and which would also prove to be satisfying in every respect. It was lovely but, this time, I had beaten her.
But Agatha Christie played the Three Card Trick on me and she won and I lost and I absolutely loved the losing. I loved it.
To understand the Three Card Trick fully, I think you have to fall for it yourself and I did, once, in Lisdoonvarna in 1980. I was at my first music festival, ragged and wet, with one last five pound note in my pocket to last me for two days. I happened upon a group of rough looking men gathered around another man who was crouched on the ground. He had three cards on an upturned cardboard box and one of them was a Queen of Hearts. The game was simple, as we all know. He shows the Queen, turns the cards over then moves them around face down and, if you find the Queen, you win. If you don’t you lose.
I would never play this game. I knew it was a con and that I would get ripped off. I knew all this but, gradually, I knew something else too. I knew how to beat it.
There was a small triangular crimp in the corner of the Queen card. The dealer hadn’t seen it but I had. I didn’t need to follow the juggling and slight of hand of the dexterous dealer. I just needed to watch the crimp and note where it went for there lay the Queen. I watched the cards and watched the cards and I had scant regard for where the cards went or how they went there. I knew all I needed to know. When the cards stopped, there it was, the crimped card, there on the right, as plain as day.
It wasn’t, of course, for that is the essence of The Three Card Trick. Not that you are enticed to gamble but, rather, than you are convinced that a secret solution is yours and yours alone. The dealer had placed a crimp on the Queen Card long enough to entice me in, then he had expertly taken the crimp out as he juggled and he had put it in one of the other cards.
Two days of hunger at a festival teaches you something and I won’t ever be fooled so easily again. Or so I thought. In this book, 'Five Little Pigs', gleefully, rather magically, Agatha Christie, undisputed Mistress of Crime Fiction, played the Three Card Trick on me one more time and took my fiver as easily as if I was sixteen years old once again. I love her for it. If you have a fancy, try ‘Five Little Pigs’ and, even though I’ve warned you of the misdirection, see if you don’t fall for it too.
One final point. If someone had asked me, as they asked so many others, what my own favourite Christie mystery book was, I would have said, “Hercule Poirot’s Christmas’. I just thought it was the perfect blend of bloody mystery, privileged suspects and completely left-field solution.
For various reasons, I’ve been spending a couple-or-three days at Downpatrick Head this month. I’m actually just providing a bit of transport and backup to my son, who’s doing something there so, although I’m there for seven or eight hours, I have absolutely nothing to do. I am left to my own devices… without any devices. In many respects, it's my summer holiday for this year and I'm treating it as such.
Downpatrick Head is a coastal headland here in County Mayo and right on the western edge of Ireland. The next stop is New York. It’s basically a field or two that runs right to the edge of the Wild Atlantic Ocean which terminates, without fence or barrier, in a series of sheer rocky cliffs with rocks and crashing water below. Most notably, there is also a highly photogenic sea stack called ‘Dun Briste’ and a deep, dangerous, and remarkable blow hole.
I’d never been there before. When I first arrived, I walked up the field from the car park and I looked down the blow hole and had a look at the highly impressive sea stack and then came back down to the car park and read my book.
As the hours shuffled on and having finished my book, I went back up the walkway for another look. This time, I took it slow. As I walked further along the precarious edge of the cliffs, I found there was so much more to see. Stuff I hadn’t even been aware of during my first glance.
The cliffs, for instance. The cliffs went on and on, much more then they appeared to at first glance. What seemed like boring fields broke away into amazing precarious sheer faces. To go too close was to feel an actual vertigo and the pull of the wide world on your feet.
The birds were not there the first time I looked. The cliffs where they congregate are further along and are not the ones you see if you only run up and glance and then run away again.
The days I was there, it was all Gulls. Lots of them, soaring around and protecting their cliff-embedded nests, each of which contained a single plump chick.
It was the gulls that really made me stop. I became a bit hypnotised by them I think. I watched a lone chick for God knows how long, waiting for a parent to return from the ocean with food. I watched another pair defend their nook as gull after gull swept in and tried to land on their patch. I spend literally hours on the edge of the cliff, watching the birds and the sea and the sky, breathing the air, feeling the breeze.
Because I had a little time, I stopped and the place seeped into me in a way that no momentary visit could have ever achieved. A place where one could easily stop and take a photo and run away again became, for me, a total sensory experience that I think has been embedded in memory for life.
The moral of this piece is therefore the simple Ferris Bueller one, made real for me on the edge of an Atlantic precipice.

The themes for this week’s 52 Week Pick n Mix Challenge are orange and outlines. I chose to create some orange watermarble stripes, using decals.
These have been watermarbled without dragging through the image. I have wanted to use this technique for ages, to make (slightly curved) wide stripes on my nails. I’ve tried it a couple of times and it’s been disastrous. Previously, when I have dipped my nail in the water, it’s ended up a slushy mess.
It was still a bit messy. I let it dry in the water for over an hour, nearly two, but it was very pliable when I took it out and you can see a resulting slight stretch in the pattern on my ring finger. I would have preferred to cut it for the cuticles edge, but it was too soft, so I had to use acetone and a clean up brush, meaning it’s not as sharp and clean as I would like.
I used OPI A Roll In The Hague, Calvin Klein Ebony Hates Chris – Black, and OPI My Boyfriend Scales Walls. They all marbled well. However, it’s still not entirely the look I was aiming for. I wanted mainly white, with different widths of black and orange stripes. I didn’t pay attention enough to what I was doing though.
I’ve never read before about making decals out of a watermarbles by letting the polish dry on the surface of the water. How cool! I’m excited to try this as I have only once done a passable watermarble…on one finger. I’ve managed to pull off doing a decal though so maybe, just maybe, I could do this. You are so funny in your analyzing of technique and your profiency at it. Are you maybe one of those people who are harder on yourself than others are on you? I thought you did an excellent job! Would you mind answering some questions about this technique? Specifically: how did you remove the dried polish from the surface of the water? I imagine that after sitting for that amount of time, the polish was attached to the vessel all the around? Did you take a sharp utensil around the circumference first? Once detached, does the dried polish start to sink if water from below accidentally gets on top? Or do you hold the circle of polish with tweezers while loosening the edges so as to immediately be able to lift it as soon as it’s free? If not tweezers, what do you lift it with? Does the circle have a tendency to “taco,” by folding as it’s lifted from the water, with the bottom of it coming together? If it does that, does it stick to itself and become useless? Or, if it does that, is it easy to pull apart again? Do you transfer it directly to a paper towel or something until it’s completely dry, and then go about trimming it down for nail application? Or do you take it right from the water and lay it across your middle fingers before cutting? Do you apply anything to your nails first (e.g., base coat or color) before placing the watermarbled polish in order to have the nail bed surface be tacky so the decal can attach itself easily? It is it better to have dry and clean nail beds? You see, just a few questions. 😉 Thank you so much in advance if you have time and inclination to answer this!
I removed the polish with my fingers, but you’re right, it was stuck to the sides in places. I happened to have a dotting tool nearby, so used that to release the decal from the edges.
It didn’t sink. I think it could have folded onto itself if I had allowed it, but I sort of had it by one edge when I lifted it out and it came out OK. I had done it in quite a small vessel though. I expect it would be ruined if it stuck to itself.
Even after the nearly two hours, it was very pliable and sticky, so I didn’t put it onto anything. I wasn’t sure that I’d get it off again! So I placed it on my nail straight away.
My nails were completely dry and I’d painted them with a white base colour. But the decal stuck well. I sort of tore off the piece I didn’t need for the first nail and then used it on the adjacent nail. I put both pieces on the nail and smoothed them down and around to the edges before I started on clean up. I couldn’t cut the decal as it was too wet, so I cleaned up using acetone and a brush. It left the cuticle edge a bit raggedy though, so cutting it would probably be better. In which case, I should have left it to dry for longer.
There’s probably a YouTube video or ten on this technique, as it’s been around for a while. I’ve probably even watched one some time ago, as otherwise i don’t think I’d know what to do!
Claire…you’re amazing! Taking the time to write out all that information to answer my questions AND doing a YouTube search for videos with more information…I am so grateful! I can’t wait to try this on my nails. I had never heard of this technique before. You’re the best!
I'm Claire Kerr and I'm a UK nails blogger. I've only been addicted to nail polish since 2012. Some kind of mid-life crisis turned me from a tomboy into a girly girl!
I had been posting pics of my manicures to Facebook, really as a way of documenting them for myself, but I was filling up my timeline with the photos and most of my friends weren't interested. So I started this blog instead!
By day I'm a freelance marketing consultant and marketing trainer, but I make sure I find time to fit in a manicure every few days! I live in South Croydon, UK with my husband and son.

... and the community shield (or whatever they're naming it this year) is the week before the Prem starts... mufc VS Leicester isn't it?
Plans designed to reduce "intolerable behaviour" by players and managers in English football have been announced.
In a statement, the Premier League, English Football League and Football Association said poor conduct has reached "unacceptable levels".
Starting this season, red cards will be issued to players who confront match officials and use offensive language or make gestures towards them.
Apparently Pogba to United is done as per L'Equipe. 120m Euros. Lot of money for someone benched for Moussa Sissoko a month ago.
Do you think it's the referees that bring discipline to Rugby or the players simply having some idea of respect towards authority?
They can use video technology from next season, so it should go well. Managers can get sent off as well, so I think they'll reign it in when Mourinho has a 5 game ban 3 games in.
Sam Alladyce officially the new England manager... & Steve Bruce in talks with Hull over leaving the job (for Sunderland?)
On this, why does the FA not cite players, as they do in rugby, if an offence is seen by the world on video but not acted on by the referee him(her)self? I get so frustrated when I see a replay of someone, say, elbowing another but, because the referee did not take action, there is 'nothing they can do.'
To further that, why shouldn't the match officials watch a replay of the match and decide themselves whether they should have taken action on certain incidents, and pass their recommendations onto a citing committee, or some such thing? These people are human, and will not always make the correct decision on the spot. Give them the benefit of (post-match) replays, such as we viewers have.
That's essentially what the new rule allows them to do. Why the rules have taken so long to be implemented is beyond me. In Serie A they've been handing out retrospective bans for diving since at least 2011 (maybe longer, I've not watched it intensely since Football Italia ended).
I think some of it might be about not questioning referees' judgement so as to not undermine their authority, but that approach hasn't made them officiate better, so it was largely a waste of time.
Man Utd don't have the squad to challenge for the title I don't think. an injury to Pogba or Ibrahimovic and they have real issues of squad depth.
Serie A potentially making a comeback. Juventus are real strong, Inter Milan have done very well this window thanks to their new Chinese owners, and AC Milan is due to finally get a much-needed change in ownership via Chinese owners of their own (if that deal ever gets done!).
Unfortunately, Frank McCourt, former disgraced owner of my hometown Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, just bought Marseille. This guy is good at turning teams into one thing and one thing only: his own personal ATM.
Serie A could come back, but it needs more than team owners. Wealthy owners need to be followed by massive TV deals.
Yeah, but that will come with time. First, they need to attract and create star players, plus do well in European competitions. The wealthy owners will make that a little easier.
You've got a bunch of amped up, competitive sportsmen charging around for an hour or two. They're going to get frustrated at decisions. Referees just throwing more cards around is just more frustration.
And why is 'offensive language' such a big deal? Again this is the typical rulings of sheltered people who don't understand normal people. People swear, big deal. Its a word. Nobody dies.
I suppose where you work, you're used to people questioning your judgement and telling you to "f**k off you're wrong!"? That's what football referees are expected to put up with. It's completely disrespectful and it shouldn't be allowed. It doesn't happen in rugby, where not only do you respect the referee's decision but you also call him "Sir".
Let's not try and compare my US based, multinational company, HR-to-the-eyeballs, office job to high level sports. It's just a silly comparison.
In my work I don't have 50,000 fans booing me if I make a simple mistake, or need to worry about newspapers following me around, or keep getting catfished on Instagram, or get bought and sold at a moment's notice. Poor footballers.
Maybe referees should learn to man manage and not allow games to spiral out of control? Any half decent one can use their man management (& cards, where appropriate) to prevent themselves being swarmed on every foul and keep players out their faces.
While I agree it may not be right to compare mundane jobs 1:1 with high-profile jobs because the pressures are different, what doesn't change is respect. Everyone expects and deserves basic respect at their workplace, no matter what the stakes are, financial or otherwise.
The referee runs around for the same amount of time on the same pitch, having to make decisions that can sometimes decide matches and championships (and the bazillions of cash that goes with it), and is probably more frustrated than any individual player because he has to put up with the lousy antics of TWENTY TWO prima-donnas, and their managers/support staff/teammates on the touchline. I still don't see a ref screaming obscenities at a player or anyone associated with them.
Why should shouting obscenities be assumed a part of a high-performance workplace? Or do you mean to say there are no decent, respectful people in high-performance workplaces?
As for your argument about the uncertainties of a footballer's life, that's got nothing to do with being disrespectful. The quirks of the business (they willingly signed up for) are well-compensated. They get paid more money in a week than a regular Joe would make in 10/20 years, and if they don't like it, they're free to become a nondescript respectable regular Joe themselves.

Nothing to do with the profile of the job, just the energy involved in the job. Someone could be a very high level project manager where things are planned months in advance.. or someone could be running around, amped up on testosterone and bumping chests. Why shouldn't they be allowed to vent when something doesn't go their way? Why are referees beyond reproach from players and managers?
The quirks of the referee business (they willingly signed up for) are well-compensated. They get paid far, far beyond the average wage and if they don't like it they can go back to being lawyers and teachers.
EDIT - btw, the footballers does come down to respect. Dumped in to 2nd strings, told you no longer have a job, told to uproot your family and live in another country because we just bought someone better than you despite teh fact you have 3 years left on your contract...
Funny, how you think swapping a few words and throwing my own argument back at me rudely somehow validates your position. Or do you think that's how football 'fans' should behave too?
They all sign up willingly for their high-pressure jobs and are compensated handsomely (I'll take your word on refs salaries, though I'm willing to bet it's not even in the same universe as a footballer's wage), but that doesn't give them the right to act like savage cavemen when frustrated. If you want players/managers to be allowed to vent, why not the refs? Why does the onus of being professional fall to them, when a bunch of amped-up brats are goading them with obscenities? You think it's justified to abuse a ref because he got a decision wrong, how about players who willingly play-act and generally act like jerks? Why do they get a free pass?
Both sides (players and officials) should be held to the same standards of acceptable behavior, and if they can't handle it, they don't belong where they are. I don't think anyone wants to see a footballing match where it's officially a verbal/physical free-for-all.
P.S. A footballer getting treated badly by his own club has nothing to do with the topic at hand. Their peeve is with the club and they're free to sort it out with them. I wonder why we don't see more instances of players openly abusing their clubs and managers when treated badly? Probably because there are REAL consequences of doing that, as against abusing a ref which usually gets them nothing more than the proverbial slap on the wrist, sometimes not even that?
If you think swapping some words around is really so rude, then maybe we should end this debate here because you're clearly going to be more sensitive than I am.
Referees aren't in the same universe but they are still very well rewards at an elite level. I don't want a verbal or physical free for all - what I believe is good refs prevent this from happening. You have guys like Mark C turning round a few seasons ago because players tried to swarm him when discussing a big issue with his assistant and simply told them to go away until he was done. Again though, a big part of this is the use of 'offensive language'. I still maintain there is a strange fascination with language rather than what is actually being said.
"Aw f*ck off ref and "C'mon ref.." both mean exactly the same thing to people of different backgrounds. Why should one be penalised and one not (if they even are)?
We don't see instances of players lashing out at clubs because its not in the heat of the moment. The players after the game very rarely lash out at the refs either.
I guess we should stop this here, because I clearly believe in respectful behavior in a professional environment under all circumstances, while you believe abuse is justifiable based on perceived performance and people feeling the need to vent. To each his own and you're as entitled to your opinion as I am to mine. I hope you can continue this genuinely interesting argument with someone a bit less 'sensitive'.
The point that seems to have been completely missed is that most of the abuse that referees and linesmen get is not because they got a decision wrong but because they got it right and a player didn't like it. Imagine if staff that you were trying to manage continually challenged every one of your actions/decisions simply based on their dislike of them, even when you're quite obviously right.
Linesmen get that mostly.... but the Ref's, the abuse is mostly down to them getting simple clear cut decisions wrong. Ref's demand respect, but they should also give the players respect by doing their job properly.
train the Refs better, give them the tech they need and you'll see the majority of the player reactions disappear.
Training is an interesting part of it. After the infamous Di Canio shove, referees were trained to not shove a hand/card in someone's face.
I do think, overall, the English referees are an objective and forward thinking bunch who don't just demand respect and also know how to man manage. I wish we could say the same for the Scottish bunch who close ranks and lash out at any criticism, even the constructive and justified type.
the EPL refs just make the decision and if you don't like it, or it's clearly wrong.... tough. That doesn't help build respect between officials and players/teams.
I have to wonder if the FA should make the ref reports public, or at least have the officials publically state why they made certain decisions. (AKA, why Costa got away with the hack on the Keeper in the first Chelsea match of the season). make the officials accountable to the public. That way, even if you don't agree with the decision, you can see WHY they made it.
The referee has to make an on-the-spot decision without the benefit of multiple angles (though I do think the linesman / assistants should step up more in this respect). If he / she does not clearly see an offence it cannot be given (even if the cameras show otherwise).
I do believe that reviewing the match with the benefit of other angles would be useful; perhaps this may give rise to making better use of the assistants.
In any case, it does not warrant the reaction that is has become commonplace with footballers who are paid far more than the referees and make their own mistakes during matches also.
How about players stopped trying to con the refs every chance they get, so the refs could probably have more time and mind-space to focus on the actual incidents? Not saying it will take away any/all refereeing errors but there's just too much going on the pitch these days that has nothing to do with 'playing football'.
Then the refs need to start giving fouls and penalties where players stay on their feet and don't appeal. If the player tries to stay up then the ref will almost certainly ignore the foul.
Mark Halsey's recent comments go some way to explain why they don't make referee reports public (although the PGMOL dispute his claims).
Personally, I think the PL likes having bad/inconsistent referees, because it keeps the brand front and centre of the sports news.
Howard Webb giving you a free kick on edge of the box after you got uppercutted on the six yard line at Old Trafford kept the sport on all the back pages. Mike Dean celebrating a Spurs goal in the North London derby a few years back did the same, as did Andre Marriner sending off Kieran Gibbs for an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handball when Chelsea beat us 6-0.
I don't disagree, I'm just saying there's far too much nonsense going on to distract the ref. A lot of players have got this down to an art so much so most people can't tell in one look if an incident is genuine. FIFA/UEFA and member nations are of course being anal about not providing technical assistance to on-field refs, because the drama brings in the $$$$. The TV folks would hate it if there were no controversies, wouldn't they?
Given what's happened at FIFA and UEFA these past few years, I was expecting something to crop up in the domestic game. And the fact that it was the England manager who was the first exposed, makes it all the sweeter!
Clubs, managers, players, agents, third party companies - they're all at it. Nothing surprises me anymore.
How is Rondon onside for his first against Swansea tonight? His head (the part of him that he scored with) was nearer the goal than any part of any defender except for the goalkeeper.
Bloody hell, don't think I've been so nervous watching a match for a long time.... CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!!

Helloooo! I hope you guys have all had a FANTASTIC week and that you'll have an even FANTASTICER (pretend it's a word) weekend filled with cake and BOOKS!!!
I had quite a good book week! I got a couple of books out at the library, my parents bought me some books (never happens as apparently I have too many, pfft) and I got some to review! Squeeee!
I FINALLY GOT CITY OF HEAVENLY FIRE AND LOOK AT THAT COVER, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL! *strokes book* As you know, I wasn't keen on continuing the series after I read City of Fallen Angels but then I read City of Lost Souls and I just fell in love with the books all over again! So excited to read it :') I'm waiting for a weekend where I'm completely free though, so I can just sit and read CoHF for two days straight. I know, I'm a genius. I also got Lullaby and I am so excited to read it as I LOVED Wake! Thank you parentals :')
I'm currently reading A Murder Most Unladylike and I'm not very far in, but I'm really enjoying it so far! Homeroom Diaries looks interesting and I'm excited to have received The Shadow's Curse, the sequel to The Oathbreaker's Shadow so that I can read them one after the other :)
EEEEK!!! I FINALLY GOT GEEK GIRL! I have heard endless good things about Holly Smale's books from my fellow bloggy buddies and I am SO excited to read it as I think it's right up my alley :) I also got the last two books in the Reinvention of Skylar Hoyt trilogy which I ended up loving! My review is here, if you would like to read it. I also checked out Life As We Knew It by Susan Pfeffer again as it's one of my all-time favourite books and I felt like re-reading it. If you haven't yet read it GO READ IT NOW.
This is my book-haul! Super excited for all of these! Have you read any of these and if so did you enjoy them? Leave the link to your Stacking the Shelves post below! :)
Nice haul. Some of these are new to me. I do like the covers, but some of your pictures are not showing up.
Lullaby by Amaznda Hocking has been sitting on my to-read shelf for a very long time!! I think it's time to pick it up :)
Awesome haul, Kyra! I had forgotten all about City of Heavenly Fire... After the third book, I would have been happy if it ended... the next book didn't really do it for me so I guess that's why.
Nice haul! The only one I've read is Life as We Knew It and it was a really interesting book. I have a copy of City of Heavenly Fire, but I've not read it yet. I'm afraid to see what will happen in it.
Omg, look how big CoHF is. IT COULD BE A WEAPON. I'm only in two books to that series, but I absolutely love it and I always finish the book dying of laughter and crying at the same time. I want more! But the sizes are worrying me.
It is crazy...I have not read any Cassandra Clare novels...yet! Gah! It's on my to-do list! Looks like you had a great week in books...enjoy your new reads!
Some of these books are unfamiliar to me. But I also got City of Heavenly Fire two to three weeks ago. OMG! I really need to start warming up because a book that thick will require many sleepless nights. It should not bother me that much but I don't really enjoy TMI but felt compelled to complete the series because I have already invested so much time on it.
wow many books! One day I'll have to try the Clare series, I heard great things about it. Happy reading!
I've been very curious about A Murder Most Unlady Like. I'm glad to here that you're enjoying it. I need to look more into it. The Shadows Curse looks really good too.
My goodness CoHF looks huge in comparison to the rest of your books haha! I loved that one though! And I have been so curious about The Oathbreaker's Shadow but never got around to reading it. I hope both it and its sequel are really good!
I also really didn't enjoy City of Fallen Angels but I really enjoyed City of Lost Souls and now I'm really excited for City of Heavenly Fire! Thank you! :)
I know! I'm waiting till I have a completely free weekend so that I can just read City of Heavenly Fire the whole day as it's massive! :)
So many pretties! I haven't read the last three books of the Immortal Instruments series, but I do have them all. I've seem really good reviews for Geek, I hope is all you expected. I haven't read any books by Hocking and I keep hearing great things about her books.
I've only read up to #3 in the Mortal Instruments series, not sure whether I want to continue them or not though. LOVE A Murder Most Unladylike, so much fun! :) Happy reading!
Love the cover for Lullaby! It's so pretty :) I hope you enjoy all of your new books and thanks for stopping by!
Nice haul this week, great mix of books. I really want to try Geek Girl, I bought the first two at YALC and am excited to start them. I hope you enjoy them all :)

It is hard taking into the pitch each year, together with the anticipation of enthusiasts weighing more heavily with each new look. Video game franchises consistently ebb and flow of quality, even as new ideas make their advent and then gradually decline in in value till they're replaced with something fresh. That may mean awkward transition years, where matches have been captured between the new and the older... great thoughts and bad.
That is precisely the place FIFA 17 is in this calendar year, and even though it's still a totally entertaining football sim it is also a really flawed one. A good deal of effort was expended in regard to enhancing the graphics and creating a single-player narrative effort value your time, but the sport playing fashion has seen much less in the way of positive influence. Which contrasts with string competitor Pro Evolution Soccer, which is now the best it has been in a generation.
However, the 1 place where FIFA will always control is in the magnitude of its finances, and also the newest 'The Journey' storyline style is something PES is not likely to have any equal to. Taking control of youthful Alex Hunter, in his travel from zero to hero, you are given particular challenges to attempt to compete through a game, tutorial fashion training sequences, and experience sport fashion options on what you do behind the scenes and in the press conferences.
It is cliched and schmaltzy, but at this honest and ardent way it is difficult not to adore. Even though the game's customary '3' era rating implies it is a fairly sanitized view of the game. The Journey is the very best thing to have already messed soccer games in quite a while and a significant triumph for FIFA 17. Especially given the concerns that loom above the on-pitch activity.
In contrast to last year's release that the sport playing varies in FIFA 17 are relatively minor. The most immediately obvious though are the speed of play is quicker, arguably too much so, and it is now easier to guard the ball from defenders. That means, obviously, that it is also more difficult to acquire possession, together with the currently ineffectual sliding tackles with you chase around the pitch like a headless chicken.
Computer-controlled players often appear to suffer similar problems, even though the artificial intellect has seen light improvement when assaulting -- with more number in tactics and also a readiness to initiate a run from nearly everywhere on the pitch. Death is definitely less true than last year however, with the sport often assuming you are attempting to move the ball into the player.

It was 1999 when I went to Dubai for the very first time. This picture of mine also has a special significance to me as I was standing in front of Burj-Al-Arab in Dubai, the world’s only 7-star hotel and also the world’s tallest! This photo was clicked in early 1999 by my one and only paternal Uncle. The hotel was about to open shortly. It was a terribly windy day and while being open to the wind speed, I could hardly keep myself stable by anchoring my feet on the ground!
Once my uncle had asked me to stand in front of this mega structure, I didn’t have any idea as to what it was! I couldn’t disobey him as he had always been my father-figure! I wished the photo session was soon over since the wind was so fierce, I feared it was going to throw me to the nearby sea — just the way many small children pelt stones by playing splash in a puddle, the fierce wind would do exactly that! Though I was a bit terrified, nonetheless I wore a plastic smile on my face lest my Uncle was hurt. Strangely enough, I never realized this pot-belly structure, which actually was representing a billowing sail behind me would be the world’s tallest (seven-star) hotel and an emblem of Dubai. I never understood the significance of posing for this picture until I got to recognize this mega-structure and realized about the uniqueness of this structure from the promotional programs and documentaries on the television!
Ever since 1999, I had been to Dubai at least four times up until now. I had to visit this place for many purposes like friends and family visits, international conference, holiday destination, and last but not the least, stopover on the way to the USA, yet the charm of this mega-structure in Dubai has not waned for me till now.
This is a photo of the helipad of the Burj-Al-Arab that I had clicked from a distance during 2010 from the open-top double-decker bus tour ride I had taken in Dubai.
The helipad is being commercially used for myriad purposes other than the regular take-off or landing of the helicopters there. The management of the hotel has been very innovative in optimizing its usage in various promotional purposes. They have come up with so many different out-of-the box ideas to make Burj-Al-Arab stand out and stand apart. It has been very successful in positioning itself as an epitome of luxury and opulence. Back in 2003, when I visited Dubai for the second time, Burj-Al-Arab used to be an emblem the Emirati people who used to carry the ‘Burj-Al-Arab’ insignia — the seven-star hotel logo etched in the nameplates of their personal sedans.
People have played golf on the helipad yet the tennis match at the helipad of Burj-al-Arab, is the most fascinating! A power-point presentation featuring the helipad of this iconic hotel was disseminated from Dubai, back in the year 2005 when André Agassi and Roger Fédérer played tennis on the hotel’s helipad at 211 meters high! A security mesh was spread around the tennis court on the helipad to prevent any possible falls. This presentation had become viral. Here are the snapshots collected from the online version of the April 2014 report by the Daily Mail (UK) and the July 20, 2011 report by Amusing Planet about this special event:
Here is the thrilling video posted by Dubai Film YouTube channel on the first-ever helipad skydive landing in Dubai.
This video was posted in December 1, 2013 by the Dubai Film YouTube channel. The channel on the video description writes: “H.E. Nasser Al Neyadi of SkydiveDubai becomes the first skydiver to land on Jumeirah‘s prestigious Burj-Al-Arab Helipad, part of the world’s only 7-Star Hotel just off the beaches of Dubai, United Arab Emirates.”

This inexpensive, durable CRL 50-13/16" (1291 mm) Phenolic L-Square really does the job when it comes to making accurate cuts. Because it is made of high impact phenolic, it takes a lot of on-the-job punishment without warping, and last a long time. With this precision instrument, you can make fine calibrations for a true square by adjusting the hex head screws so it can always be at a 90 Degree cutting angle.
HELPFUL HINT: To prevent distortion always store your L-Squares in a flat position, not leaning against a vertical surface.
CRL L-Squares are factory adjusted to be square. If the L-Square somehow gets out of adjustment, it should be sent back to CRL Los Angeles for proper adjustment. The Allen Screws are tightened very securely during manufacturing and cannot be loosened by the user without a high chance of stripping out these screws. Please contact CRL Product Management with questions regarding this notice. All CRL Squares and Rules are checked to be within +/- 1/16". They should always be stored in a flat position, not leaning against a wall, to prevent distortion. You only have 30 days from date of shipment to notify CRL of any manufacturing defects to qualify for any warranty replacement or credit.

Driven by circumstances regrettably shameful, I address you by this mean to publicly denounce attacks by a certain little group of people through the Internet. Attacks directed toward me, toward the technology which I created and toward some persons around me.
The lack of ethics, responsibility and respect for human life shown by these few individuals, needs to be highlighted. I remained silent for a long time in the hope that they might reflect and correct their wrong behavior. But that has not happened and instead of it, over the time, their distortion and evilness is growing.
These people call themselves protectors of the planet, but they are just the opposite. They are criminals who have sought to destroy me together with all hope that my technology represents and offers to the planet.
Fortunately, they are only few and well known in the Internet. Their only interest is and has been trying to discredit and destroy me and with it trying to stop my technology.
It is very sad to contemplate how these people with clear bad intentions but not very clear purposes, having a total lack of respect for themselves and others, hold a campaign against me and against people around me, repeating year after year the same incoherent lies rife of turbulent interpretations, trying to sell false images and distortions of the truth.
But the true reality, which concerns so much to me as to those who accompany me always with loyalty and selflessness, is held by itself with the consistent effort we devote to our work, which is translated into concrete and good actions that are seen by all.
The policy of this little group and its leader is that who is not with them or does not serve their narrow interests accepting their malevolent conditions, is destroyed without contemplations. To do this, they use a lot of Blogs on the Internet that plague the Web, copying once and again the same rhetoric twisted and incoherent.
They have reached the nerve to use my name, registering it as their domain on the Web. They have been trying to associate my name with their names and malevolent actions. They sell products using my name which I neither recognize nor approve nor know what they are.
Even recently they there have dared to put my trademark AyDo on one of their indecent blogs, linking it with their stuff, which sell at excessive prices.
From here I also warn to these criminals that for the unauthorized use of my trademark, they face now legal actions.
I had been recently informed that these people promote conferences in the USA with my alleged presence to ensure attendance, thus asking large sums. They do it without my knowledge or approval. Then at the opening of the conference announce that I cancelled my presence. Are the height of shamelessness, of deception, of evil and lack of respect towards me, towards you all... towards life. Not even respect themselves.
To me respect is a cornerstone that must exist in every human being who wishes to be recognized as such.
I inform to you all that all my lectures are free, not charging anything for it and when I attend them, it is publicly announced in media with interviews done to me. Or, are governmental conferences where each government is responsible for the logistics and so are strictly with official invitation. I also inform you that all my teaching programs are free of charge for all my students.
I advise you that the only trade mark I have is AyDo which is present in all my productions, and my official information site is www.adperfectsystems.com.
I publicly denounce that everything they published today under the name of Perfect Science and its associated links are only simple manipulations and that I have absolutely nothing to do with those people involved in it either, nor with some kind of stuff they say to produce, nor with their conspirative associations.
I denounce that what they publish are: distortions of true stories, photos stolen from magazines in interviews done to me, some other pictures manipulated by them, events changed from its original context and true reality, in a way that all this fits with the selfish ends they pursue.
Please pay attention to all this information given today and not be fooled. Only with your help of individual awareness, consciously, this farce can be disassembled.
As you all know, is not and never has been my policy attacking anyone in particular, nor to invest energy and time in the darkness. And this time I am speaking to you only to warn you about what is happening and has been happening for several years, to alert you and do not be fooled. But, I will not fall in the temptation to mention specific names as this would be against my principles of life.
My energy and my life are dedicated to creating positive and good things for this planet ...not to destroy.
I have developed a technology whose aim and purpose is: to help this planet and this present civilization to correct the environment errors done; to surpass the difficult times we live in; to develop awareness about the responsibility and duty that we all have for loving and caring this common home; to restore the lost harmony and balance between nature and man. That is my truth.
This message had been a response to the thousands who through e-mails, personal interviews, telephone contacts, contacts in one of my many conferences and symposia, all of them have asked me, they have urged me to denounce publicly this embarrassing fact which for years has tried to confuse and destroy.
In closing ...to all of you who have managed to see through the veil of deceit woven against me, I wish to convey my respect and consideration.
To all of you ...scientists, professors of universities, worldwide governmental representatives with whom I am in close contact, to the users of my technology and its products, to the entire team involved in the production, distribution, or projects, who are my colleagues, friends, companions, ...my gratitude for your constant effort and positive attitude.
And ...to whom with their steadfastness, loyalty and enthusiasm have been able to support me and give me good reasons to pursue this difficult task that I have imposed onto myself, despite of the many obstacles faced, just ...thanks.
And to all of you, my renewed commitment and dedication to see fulfilled the desire of many to live on a planet evolved in every way, in peace and harmony.
This week's post is about last week too. Last Tuesday, after my 1 o'clock Chicks went home, I started feeling under the weather and didn't get to post the pictures of our labeling assembly line. But we did get to label and inventory all the items that went out for delivery today.
Our donation recipients were the residents of St. Anne Institute in Albany, NY where we were warmly greeted and thanked by Pat Leonard, Director of Volunteer Services. With this donation today, the Chicks have passed the 2,000 mark of items donated since we started in 2005!
For this week, Barbara's feather and fan baby blanket is chugging along for our upcoming charity work.
And we haven't seen Kathleen in a few weeks since the weather turned so frigid. It was good to catch up with her today and see all the knitting she accomplished while being snowed in the last few weeks.
Here is Kathleen's favorite Cabin Fever jacket pattern. It is a top down, seamless pattern that works up in a jiffy. And she had enough yarn for ...
We thought the last of this yarn had been used up but Kathleen found just enough to make another pair of mittens.
Hubby came home from work early and tempted us with chocolate treats from the Berkshire Mountain Bakery in Housatonic, Massachusetts. If you ever find yourself in their neck of the woods it's worth the extra few miles off the main road to check out their goodies. For Christmas breakfast this year I made their Pannetone into a baked French toast with a layer of their Pecan/Cherry bread. Wow! It was good! And you have to try a little chocolate treat they make called a boucheron. It's a mouthful of chocolate heaven!
Tonight Dorah and I knitted together while everyone else had conflicts with the schedule. Dorah started this darling hoodie. I think we were both attracted to the pattern more because of the cute baby cheeks than the pattern itself.
I started a pair of baby socks the other day and feel like it's taking forever to reach the 3 inch cuff length. They aren't that big! Why is it taking so long?
Probably because I've also been working on my son's sock blanket. Size 3 needles and fingering weight yarn takes a lot of patience to say the least. But I love the way it's coming along. The finished size will fit the top of a queen size bed so I'm only about 1/3 of the way through. Considering I started it June 14, 2014, I have made quite a bit of progress.
Let me say thank you to my team of dedicated knitters for again making a successful delivery day! You ladies are the best!!!
To knit for causes such as homeless shelters, hospitals, charities, and hospices near or far being limited only by the needs made known to us.

Instead, I will be speaking about the overall concept that will aid your organisation succeed.
You’ll find that the home business is just one more multi level marketing or business chance. Just what’s important is that from what I have actually seen there are individuals doing very well with it. I can see that doing business have lots of methods, it depends on the business owner ways to do it.

This is key! Step four will essentially separate you from the majority of people out there in the market that just merely want to start selling right after fulfilling people!
Let individuals know that you are different! Make your major emphasis to build your e-mail checklist since it’s YOUR electronic property. You could send out an email to your listing and also generate income anytime.

They will certainly start to appreciate that you are trying to help them with the excellent content you created. And also since they trust you they will certainly follow your every word, get whatever you’re.
Simply think of any person or company that you consider as effective. I’m talking below of individuals or organizations which have actually made a huge influence on ordinary people’s lives in a favorable method.
Looking closely, you will certainly understand that offering others was probably on top of your goal listing. Not only did giving good service to others. Yet a number of them worked as your fellow people without expecting anything in return.
The word utilize is widely made use of in financial circles compared to it remains in internet marketing. When a company obtains money to fund its operations or get some assets it’s called financial leverage. This can be called utilizing other individuals’s money to develop your personal service.
In multi level marketing circles leverage can be described as using other people’s initiatives to build your company. It is nearly impossible for anyone to do well in a network marketing service unless they harness the power of utilize right into their services.
Primarily, when you are simply a newbie business owner you have to learn to pay attention and also research some method to those specialists. Listening and research study is the crucial to successful service. It will certainly not simply lead your service in good hands it will also offer to have a strong business.

Fusion 2009: The Sixth Annual Los Angeles LGBT People of Color Film Festival will feature the Los Angeles premere of “Pedro,” a biographical film that tells the moving true story of the late Pedro Zamora who we got to know during one of the early seasons of “The Real World.”
Out director Paris Barclay (“In Treatment”) is one of the writers on the film along with Dustin Lance Black (“Milk”). The film was directed by Nick Oceano and stars Alex Loynaz as Pedro.
“I always thought it would be great to do a movie that told Pedro’s story, including his story in Cuba and his family coming from in the Mariel boat lift,” Paris said. “It’s a fantastic story. Why he chose “The Real World” to be sort of his soapbox which people aren’t doing anymore. They aren’t going on “American Idol” to talk about AIDS the way Pedro did.”
“There’s the tragic ending where he’s near death and Bill Clinton calls him on the telephone and says, ‘Anything that you want, I’ll do’ and helps get his family out of Cuba and then he dies,” Paris said.. “It has all those great story elements and by telling it again, I think we’re going to remind people that AIDS isn’t over. AIDS in the minority community has always been overlooked and in a very emotional compelling way. I’m really proud of it.”
On a lighter note, other cast members from “Real World: San Francisco” will be represented in the movie: “An actor will play Buck but the real Buck will not be seen,” Paris said. “(The real) Judd and Pam will appear in one shot in the movie…(Pedro) and Sean, his partner at the time, get married not once, not twice but three times.”
Outfest Fusion is a program of films, panels, workshops, and parties featured during a three-day event that takes place March 6 through 8.

Firefighter does good deed for 10-year-old whose bike was stolen - Spokane, North Idaho News & Weather KHQ.com
A Pasco firefighter who lives in the Spokane Valley saw a local kid had his bike stolen last week. Knowing how it feels to have things stolen, he decided to help because he says it was the right thing to do.
After getting an ATV and generator stolen from his Spokane Valley home over the last few months, Grant Williams joined a Facebook group hoping to find them. That's when he saw a post about a 10-year-old boy named Brandon that had his bike stolen.
"I don't even really know what it was about it. Those pictures just got to me and I wanted to help," Grant said.
Online, Grant was able to find and order a bike just like the one that was stolen, surprising Brandon with it last week.
"Thank you Grant for helping me remember that there are still amazing people out there who care about making kiddos smile. This is Brandon, with his new bike just now, happiest kid around."

There are so many reasons why Jesus is of the greatest importance to each of us, to our families and parish, to the entire Church and to all humanity!
Jesus is the Divine Light who shows us who God is, who we are as God’s people, and how we are to live in order to have the best life, the best society, and the best world!
Jesus is our Savior who protects and saves us from darkness, sin, evil, and death. Likewise, Jesus is the founder of God’s Kingdom who has transformed the world already by his way of love and compassion and mercy.
As we hear in today’s Gospel passage, Jesus is also the Divine Lamb who takes our sins upon himself and who, by his sacrifice on the Cross, takes away our sins.
Every day of this new year, may we appreciate all that Jesus does for us and all that he means to us. May we profess our faith in him, and may we give thanks for the life and blessings and salvation that Jesus alone offers to us all. God bless!
May your 2017 be blessed and filled with goodness and peace and love both in your personal life and in your family life! May you be close to Jesus and walk with the Lord every day of 2017! May you also join us every Sunday and Holy Day and Holy Season as we dedicate another year to God and celebrate the Gospel and all that our faith holds for us all! God bless!
We’re now closer to the reorganization of all parishes here in the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. For all of us, this project will be a challenge. It will require a good deal of work and patience and understanding.
However, to keep the Church alive and present here in Southwestern Pennsylvania, it is a project that’s absolutely necessary given the real decline of our region and population and participation of our membership. May the Lord be with us in this work!
Our parish music director and bereavement coordinator, Sister Pat Baker, CDP, is very grateful for your support and prayers in these weeks! Sister Pat had surgery recently to repair two internal hernias which were causing prolonged coughing. At this time, Sister Pat is recuperating at the Divine Providence motherhouse near North Park. Next, she will return to her residence in the North Hills and continue her physical therapy and rest. Her healing and health are coming along well, and she hopes to return to us by February.
Meanwhile, we’re glad that Mrs. Doris Weir and Mr. Kevin Bilicke are able to substitute as organists and choir directors and that Mrs. Jamie Dillon and our youth are helping with our liturgical music as well. Again, thanks for your prayers, support, and understanding!
Every year for the past century, Catholic Christians have joined Christians of other communities in the effort to restore our Christian unity that has been important and essential in the plan of the Lord Jesus! Each January 18-25, we observe a Week of Prayer for Christian Unity. We are asked to pray each day for true unity among all Christians. This week concludes with our celebration of the Conversion of Saint Paul on January 25 in the hope that we too will experience conversion and new life in Christ Jesus!
This Monday, our nation will once again observe the Federal Holiday which is a memorial of the birth of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — the leading figure in the 1960’s effort for racial equality in the United States. Of course, this holiday is more than a day off from school and work. It is meant to recall this important leader, to honor the effort to increase equality among all Americans, and the call to all of us to humbly serve one another and our communities. May all of us take part in this National Day of Service, and may we cherish the equality promised to all citizens of this land!

The Gospels announce that Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world! In Jewish tradition, personal sins were transferred to a lamb, and then once the lamb was sacrificed, sins were eliminated. With all the pain and damage caused by sin, we should rejoice that Jesus frees us from sin by his own sacrifice!
After opening an automatic gate to underground parking, watch out for thieves waiting to slip inside. Wait for the gate to close behind you.
If you have an expensive stereo or other component purchase the type that has a removable take with panel.
Replace license plate screws with special star or allen head screws to make it more difficult for thieves to steal your plates. Also consider buying a clear cover to prevent the theft of your license plate sticker. Another option is, taking a razor blade and make several cuts through the decal sticker. This will prevent thieves from removing the sticker in one piece.
When stopping at red lights and stop signs, do not pull up close to the car in front of you. Allow space for an exit if needed in case of car-jacking robbery etc. Also, it is a common insurance scam for a person to back up into you and claim that you rear ended them. Their “witness” will be the person in the car right behind you who is there partner in crime. By allowing space, this will cause the person to have to back up a greater distance, allowing you time to react and possibly deter them trying their act in the first place.

Employment, Interest, and Money: Stochastic Dynamic Inefficiency, Secular Stagnation, and the Natural Discounted Growth Rate
Let's start with the concept of the natural real interest rate, which is already ubiquitous. The real interest-rate is the interest rate corrected for expected inflation, and the natural real interest rate is the real interest rate consistent with price stability. (I leave the definition of price stability ambiguous because it depends on your theory of the price level and inflation, which is a whole 'nother blog post.)
Now market monetarists like Scott Sumner and Nick Rowe point to a deficiency in the natural real interest rate concept: the natural real interest rate depends on the expected real growth rate. And monetary policy affects the expected real growth rate, so if policymakers try to set the actual interest rate equal to the natural rate, they are chasing a moving target. To me, this criticism suggests that the appropriate approach is to adjust the nominal interest rate not for expected inflation but for expected nominal growth. (While we're at it, we can also replace "price stability" with "nominal growth stability" and be done with our futile attempts to measure the aggregate price level.)
Most economists think that the natural real interest rate is normally positive. I have my doubts, but never mind, because I'm ditching the whole concept. Once we start correcting for expected normal growth rather than expected inflation, we are clearly not dealing with a natural rate concept that can be presumed to be normally positive. If we are talking about a risk-free interest rate, then the need for physical capital returns to compensate for risk would make it very hard to achieve a long-run growth rate [an equilibrium with the interest rate] as high as the [growth] interest rate, let alone higher. To come up with a number that's usually positive, I suggest that we reverse the sign. Instead of talking about a "natural growth-adjusted interest rate," let's talk about a "natural discounted growth rate."
We can also talk about an "actual discounted expected growth rate." (The discount is "actual," determined by the observable interest rate, but the associated growth rate is only "expected" because it is not known with any confidence when the interest rate is set.) If the actual rate equals the natural rate, you get a normal employment level and nominal income growth stability (or price stability, if you insist). If the actual rate is higher, you get accelerating inflation. If the natural rate is higher, you get depressed economic conditions, with excess unemployment and deflationary pressure, if not actual deflation. (Wicksellians, please recall that I have reversed the signs compared to the usual natural rate theory.)
Now that I've defined the natural discounted growth rate, I can define "secular stagnation" in the context of an NGDP target. Secular stagnation means that the natural discounted growth rate exceeds the growth rate of the NGDP target path. In other words, the target path would require a negative nominal interest rate. Under a level targeting regime, an attempt to pursue such a path will result in either monetary instrument instability or a "zigzag" growth pattern in which recessions alternate with inflationary catch-up periods. Under a growth rate targeting regime, you'll just keep missing the target from below, much like most of the developed world's central banks today.
But if you play with the numbers, you can probably convince yourself that secular stagnation, by my definition, seems unlikely. A reasonable NGDP target path growth rate is maybe 5%. Do we really think that the potential growth rate exceeds the natural interest rate by more than five percentage points? It's remotely conceivable, but my guess would be that our problem today is not secular stagnation (in this sense) but a flawed monetary policy regime.
Now if the target nominal growth rate (and the associated possibility of secular stagnation) is one of our bookends for the natural discounted growth rate, the other bookend is pretty clear: it's zero. Some readers will immediately recognize zero as the criterion for dynamic efficiency. Ignoring the issue of risk for a moment, an economy with a strictly positive natural discounted growth rate would be dynamically inefficient. Overall welfare could be improved by instituting a stable Ponzi scheme that transfers consumption backward across generations.
Does my assertion that the natural discounted growth rate is almost certainly strictly positive imply that we actually live in a dynamically inefficient economy? In an important sense, I think it does. The thorny issue here is risk, and some will argue that the relevant interest rate for dynamic inefficiency is not the risk-free rate. But I disagree. The US government can produce assets that are considered virtually risk free, and a stable Ponzi scheme operated by the US government could presumably produce such assets yielding any amount up to the growth rate. At today’s Treasury interest rates, which are clearly less than expected growth rates, marginal investors are (we can presume, since the assets are freely traded) indifferent between these low-yielding Treasury securities and investments that represent newly created capital. So, given the risk preferences of the marginal investor, the government could, by operating a stable Ponzi scheme, be producing assets that have a higher risk-adjusted return than newly created capital. Given the risk preferences of the marginal investor, it’s inefficient for the government not to be producing such assets.
It’s important to recognize that, under a typical scenario, the marginal investor will end up worse off, in a material sense, from earning the growth rate, compared to earning the actual return on capital. In a material sense, the economy is dynamically efficient. But the concept of risk preferences models a subjective good – call it “security” – and we’re not producing enough of this good. The history of interest rates and growth rates suggests that we have seldom produced enough security, but the deficiency today is clearly worse than usual.

Andy: I think we are thinking along very similar lines. By coincidence, I've just done a closely-related post!
I think you are onto something. But there's something I'm not sure about. Is it costly for the government to produce a safe asset?
Gary Gorton argues that only government can produce a genuinely safe asset. Therefore you could argue that for government NOT to produce safe assets is costly, since it forces marginal investors to take risk they neither want nor can afford.
However, we have had some recent horror stories where government debt has been regarded as a safe asset but turned out not to be. Not all governments can produce safe assets. Indeed that is why I think the US government should accept its role as savings bank for the world. As Andy suggests, a sufficient quantity of safe assets is essential for economic stability. While we don't have enough, we will continue to see bubbles in other assets that are temporarily regarded as "safe" until it becomes apparent that they are not - property, for example.
I think the "cost" depends on what you do with the money. There is a risk of accelerating inflation if it all goes into consumption spending. So I think we should be regarding government-produced safe assets as a long-term investment scheme, partly replacing (or enhancing) private sector investment. Clearly there will be crowding-out concerns.
Frances: I think the risk might be the risk of the amount of taxes paid by future generations. If we start with Samuelson 58 (whch is where Andy is coming from), and then introduce uncertainty in (say) population size for future cohorts, the government might need to vary future taxes/transfers to make government debt a perfectly safe asset.
The Bank of International Settlements looked at this a while ago and concluded that the way to make government debt reliably safe was to commit to running a primary surplus for all future time periods to ensure that the debt can always be serviced. But that assumes that returns on debt are positive. BIS link is here: http://www.bis.org/publ/work399.pdf
As I understand it, what Andy is saying is that there is no reason to assume that the return on safe assets should necessarily be positive. Safety itself has a value, so the returns on genuinely safe assets should be lower than the long-run growth rate of the economy, the difference being the "safety discount" (if we can call it that). When growth is persistently low - as might be the case with a declining and/or ageing population - returns on safe assets would be negative. Under this scenario, there would be no need for taxes to rise to pay returns on safe assets. But there might be a problem convincing savers that it is reasonable for them to pay for safety through capital erosion.
Nick has a point, but I would argue that government debt doesn't need to be perfectly safe to be a reasonable empirical counterpart of the theoretical safe asset. Anyone who has heard of the 1970's should know that nominal US government debt is not perfectly safe, and yet it still yields far less than any reasonable estimate of the nominal growth rate. So I would argue that the product demanded by the market is one that can be produced at very little cost, if not completely costlessly. I would argue for a system where the central bank targets NGDP, and government bondholders bear the risk that a greater than expected fraction of NGDP growth will be in the form of higher prices. That system is quite safe from the government's point of view (assuming it retains the ability to tax output at the same effective rate) and, I would argue, safe enough to satisfy the market from the private sector's point of view.
In the 1970s the UCLA School of Management hosted a monthly seminar series featuring talks by economists and theoretical economists. I attended because I was interested in theoretical ecology, and because my department (Geography) was in the building next door. The economists and theoretical ecologists used similar models, so the joint seminars made sense, but it seemed to me that the economists and theoretical ecologists had different relationships to data. I knew enough about ecology to know that theoretical ecologists had to deal with pesky field ecologists who collected actual data with which at least some of the theories could be tested, and these field ecologists could publish such tests in leading journals, but I wondered who the field eonomists were, and whether, if they existed, part of their job was publishing in academic journals.
I bring this up because Andy Harless's comment about government debt being a "reasonable empirical counterpart to the theoretical safe asset" reminds me of the economists' attitude toward data;
if something is sort of like the theoretical construct, that is good enough. Back in the 1950s, the Polish polymath J Bronowski wrote something about the "fatal reasonableness" of Adam Smith keeping economics from ever becoming a truly empirical science, and that seems still to be true.
Andy: OK. Maybe all you need is that the government has an advantage in diversifying risk, because it can operate over longer horizons.
Frances: Yep. If the economy is dynamically inefficient, so government bonds pay a rate of interest lower than the growth rate of the economy, you want the government to run a primary deficit. You actually need a primary deficit, so the debt/GDP ratio doesn't fall over time.
Andy, Am I correct in assuming that your claim is not just that the one year T-bill yield is less than the one year expected NGDP growth rate (which is obvious) but also that the 30 year T-bond rate is less than the 30 year expected NGDP growth rate (which may be true, but is far from obvious.)
What’s your definition of the “natural rate of interest”? I don’t see a definition in your opening paragraphs. There are actually any number of definitions. As Michael Sankowski put it, “There are lots of different meanings for the words natural rate of interest.” See:
I guess my response to Nick doesn't make sense unless one takes it to refer to long-term bonds (although, when I wrote the post itself, I was thinking more of T-bills). I don't think it's very far from obvious that the 30 year yield is less than the 30 year expected NGDP growth rate, though I did overstate the case in the earlier comment. It's plausible that the ex post growth rate will turn out to be less than the 30 year yield, and it's also plausible that there are some people whose mean expectation for the growth rate is less than the 30 year yield, but it's just not plausible that the market's current best guess for the 30 year growth rate is less than the 30 year yield. It's also true historically that long-term yields tend to be less than the growth rate. See, for example, Darby (pdf)."
I defined it right at the top: "...the natural real interest rate is the real interest rate consistent with price stability." Certainly there are other ways to define it, and there are a lot of subtleties about this definition which I have swept under the rug, but I'm just trying to make some general points in this post.
The "secular stagnation" can be economically described as a time period when all the existing markets are so competitive that marginal efficiency of capital is equal to zero. An investor has either to create a new market or bite a competitor's share.
This real economic environment has direct impact onto the financial world: investors cannot share average yields of capital with rentiers because the yields do not exist.
The dispute over "natural" interest rate does not make economic sense because it is merely political, it's about a "fair share" of financial elite in the real growth.
Whilst safe assets are nothing but insurance from risks provided by government and therefore these assets should bear premium rather than generate interest. The natural level of the premium would be voluntarily determined by the market if risk assets like bank deposits were not be implicitly or explicitly insured by government.
This is the solution - consistent delimitation of safe assets produced by government (risk free and always cost bearing) and real investments (risky but potentially yielding).
After reading all this and many other economic books / theories, I'm quite sure that the economic system will have to change in the next years.

The church of St. Mary Magdalene, one of the largest parish churches of England, is located at Newark, Nottinghamshire. The tower and the octagonal spire is 223 ft. high. The central piers remain from the previous church, dating from the 11th or 12th century. The upper parts of the tower and spire were completed about 1350 and the nave dates from between 1384 and 1393, the chancel from 1489.
The sanctuary is bounded on the south and north by two chantry chapels, the former of which has on one of its panels a remarkable painting from the Dance of Death. There are a few old monuments, and an exceedingly fine brass of the 14th century.
In the seventeenth century the church tower served as a look-out point for the Newark garrison during the Civil War sieges and the spire still bears a cannon-ball hole. This hole is visible from some parts of the town centre. The Church was badly damaged in the siege and extensively repaired in the 1650’s & 1660’s. An inscription on a pillar near to the restored font bowl says ‘demolished by rebels May 9th 1646’ After the capitulation of the town, on the orders of Charles I himself, Parliamentarian soldiers are said to have stabled their horses in the church and the font was certainly damaged, later to be re-built by the charity of Nicholas Ridley. Most of the stained glass windows which had survived the Reformation were destroyed at this time, though fragments were gathered together and can now be seen in the east window of the south choir aisle, re-arranged by Miss Joan Howson of Oxford University in 1957.

There’s a long custom of awesome “husky fellow” entertainers. Indeed, customarily the enormous men of satire are a portion of the most clever and most mainstream funnies of their time. The best aptitudes of these entertainers have fluctuated. Whether it was stand up, portrayal, or film parody, however, these gentlemen have joined to make a large number of fans chuckle. So this raises an extraordinary inquiry: who are the ten biggest interesting chubby fellows ever?
This is a hard rundown to make on the grounds that some were motion picture stars, some droll, some stand up funnies – so a great deal will rely on upon individual tastes, however here’s a rundown for ten of the most interesting “enormous gentleman” funnies ever.
It’s long past time this man gets the appreciation he merits. A standout amongst the most surely understood stand up entertainers ever, Dangerfield likewise had a genuinely noteworthy film list. Obviously above everything else, Dangerfield was known for never having the capacity to get admiration and he assembled a stunning profession off of self censuring amusing. At the highest priority on the rundown is the best chubby gentleman comic of all of them, the extremely regarded Rodney Dangerfield.
By what method would you be able to have a top interesting husky gentlemen list without maybe the most well known of the chumps? The Three Stooges were the exemplification of droll comic drama with three nitwits who could never take care of business. Unfortunately, achievement obliterated Curly. He started to drink, smoke, and eat unreasonably, feeling that his shaven head denied him of his sex bid.
Before Abbott & Costello, before Chris Farley & David Spade, there was the unsurpassed twosome of Laurel & Hardy. The splendid couple featured in many movies, the most enduring being “Angelfaces in Toyland.” The well known catchphrase” “Well, here’s another pleasant wreckage you’ve gotten me into!” originates from their demonstrations, in spite of the fact that the catchphrase is regularly misquoted.
Iglesias is a youthful stand up comic who is fiercely prominent and whose specials have made him acclaimed. He is known for having a staggering scope of voice impersonations, and in addition for the expression “cushy,” alluding to the second most abnormal amount of being fat you can get, just before “damn!” So far Iglesias is just a phenomenal comic, yet his demonstration is fabulous, and given the right circumstance he may have a shot at all the more later on.
John Belushi was an outright star when Saturday Night Live was simply starting, and was the motivation for later funnies, for example, Chris Farley. His capacity to play straight man or insane droll made him an unbelievable entertainer, and truly a living legend among film funnies and portrayal entertainers alike. Renowned from Saturday Night Live and a funny unrehearsed impersonation of Joe Cocker established Belushi as one of the colossal amusing men ever. So which celebrated Belushi part do you favor: “Joliet” Jake Blues of the Blues Brothers, or Bluto from “Creature House?”
Ralphie is the encapsulation of a “husky fellow comic.” An awesome stand up humorist, at one point Ralphie measured about 800 pounds. He was first runner up in the truth show “Last Comic Standing,” furthermore took part in “Superstar Fit Club.” Ralphie has subsequent to had two unique specials on Comedy Central and a platinum offering DVD. He’s still a major man, however keeps on shedding pounds to attempt and get into shape, frequently kidding, “Don’t commend, I lost a whole hefty man despite everything i’m fat as h–l!” Only in his mid thirties, this is a comic who may have numerous great years left in front of him.
Any individual who grew up without seeing “Uncle Buck” or “Trains, Planes, & Automobiles” is a poor denied kid who needs to offer some kind of reparation by leasing the exemplary Candy films. John Candy was an incredible huge man comic, who likewise had a noteworthy part in “Space Balls” and numerous other to a great degree mainstream motion pictures that made him a comic legend on the extra large screen.
Cedric the Entertainer is an awesome enormous man, as well as a standout amongst the most prominent African-American funnies around. Beside a mind blowing stand up profession that incorporates a few noteworthy shows at the broadly whimsical Apollo Theater, and a few HBO specials, Cedric likewise has some incredible film parts. A standout amongst the most eminent characters is the senior hairdresser Eddie from “Barbershop.”
One of the exemplary enormous man funnies, straight man Costello would dependably be combined with flimsy kidding Abbott, and the blending made comic gold. They were uncontrollably famous, and their most acclaimed verbal stifler, “Who’s on First?” with respect to a baseball group loaded with an infield of strangely named players, is celebrated right up ’til today and utilized as a case of miscommunication through extravagant word play.
Chris Farley shot up through the universe of improvisational satire, and wound up turning into a tremendous star on Saturday Night Live. This was trailed by a short yet effective film profession before his heartbreaking demise. Farley was known for boisterous extreme characters with a considerable measure of physical parody, harkening back to the old droll days.
Revision rhinoplasty refers to nasal surgical procedure executed on anyone who has earlier experienced nasal surgical procedure. Motives for this style of repeat surgical procedure could be several.

Appropriately, Dr. Vartanian has designed and adopted a variety of techniques and grafting approaches to reverse frequently observed issues in several Glendale Rhinoplasties. These revision instances can be finished using the open technique or shut. He takes advantage of the shut technique in 70% of the instances.
Often, if the septum has been earlier excised, Dr. Vartanian can use ear cartilage or rib cartilage to successfully reconstruct the nose.
In addition, several times he may well use momentary inside silastic (plastic) splints to manage airway patency in the course of the crucial intial four-week therapeutic time period.
In summary, Dr. Vartanian makes an attempt to provide the ideal rhinoplasty success by utilizing a variety of well-established techiques made to address both form and perform.

Edition information: Geneva World Economic Forum September 2018Description: 133 p. gráf. tabl. 1 fichero pdf.ISBN: 978-1-944835-18-7.Subject(s): Sociedad de la información | Industrias | Fourth Industrial Revolution | jobs | workforce | new business models | Transformación digital Online resources: acceso al documento | Más información Summary: The Fourth Industrial Revolution is interacting with other socio-economic and demographic factors to create a perfect storm of business model change in all industries, resulting in major disruptions to labour markets. New categories of jobs will emerge, partly or wholly displacing others. The skill sets required in both old and new occupations will change in most industries and transform how and where people work. It may also affect female and male workers differently and transform the dynamics of the industry gender gap. The Future of Jobs Report aims to unpack and provide specific information on the relative magnitude of these trends by industry and geography, and on the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job functions, employment levels and skills.

August was THE month of travel. So many trip pictures I might have to break this month up into multiple posts.
That same day, Soren and Tim went on a boat tour for Tim’s work, so Shaw and I hopped on the train and met them at the Frog Pond after.
Stopped at Area Four on the way home for dinner, and Soren was pleased to find a nice scootering path right next to our outdoor table.
And then, I headed off for my very first kid-free trip! It could not have been more amazing. We kicked off our first morning with a little capitol-building workout.
Sunday morning brought us to Music and the Spoken Word at the conference center. My first time attending (or listening/watching at all), and it was amazing!

On Tuesday, September 9, 2014, BCGL Attorneys Theresa Mongiovi and Angela Sanders will present "An Employer's Guide to Unemployment Compensation" at the York Society for Human Resource Management (York SHRM) monthly meeting.
Theresa is the Chair of BCGL's Employment and Labor Law Group and Angela is a member of the firm's Litigation and Employment Groups. They concentrate their practice in representing businesses, municipalities, non-profits and executives in all aspects of the employment relationship. Theresa and Angela also provide customized management-level and employee training for clients, organizations and industry groups.
The Attorneys at BCGL were nominated by the firm's staff to participate in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease after it ended The Iron Horse's baseball career in 1939, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. ALS typically strikes people between the ages of 40 and 70, and as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time.
In the past month, the Ice Bucket Challenge has swept throughout the country as a way to raise awareness and funding for ALS. Challenge participants have 24 hours from being nominated to dump a bucket of ice water over their heads, or make a charitable donation to the ALS Association. In the spirit of the challenge, many participants are happy to get soaked and make a donation.
BCGL is proud to support this worthy cause by subjecting partners Rory Connaughton, John Mateyak, Mark Lovett and Tim Shawaryn to the Ice Bucket Challenge. In connection with the Challenge, BCGL staff members bid for the opportunity to soak their favorite participate. The money raised by the bidding process, coupled with donations by BCGL attorneys and the firm, will be sent to the ALS Association to help support ALS research and programs to assist individuals living with ALS.
You can watch a video of BCGL's participation in the Ice Bucket Challenge, and the firm's nomination of new participants, by clicking here.
BCGL has officially nominated the following organizations and businesses to participate in the Ice Bucket Challenge:
Dealing with banks is never fun anywhere. Dealing with a Chinese bank however is usually even tougher. So it is no surprise that Alibaba has had a huge hit with Yu’E Bao, a money market product that is causing all sorts of consternation with the banks whilst sucking in billions of RMB in deposits for Alibaba each month. But what is Yu’E Bao? Is it worth using? Why are the banks worried? And what will likely happen?
Yu’E Bao is a money market fund sold by Alibaba and managed by Tianhong Asset Management. Yu’E Bao is simple to use and simple to get. You can buy Yu’E Bao on your smartphone. And it offers an annual interest rate of around 6 percent, but with daily access. Yu’E Bao’s money market funds invest for up to three weeks in “cash-like” things such as cash deposits. They also buy things called repurchase agreements, which are cash-like investments, and can use up to 10% of the fund to buy short term corporate bonds.
Yu’E Bao’s speed and ease of use far surpass that of banks. This, combined with an interest rate far higher than what banks can offer, has made Yu’E Bao a massive success. Within 9 months it is has come from zero to 250 billion RMB in assets under management and is already one of the 15th largest money market funds in the world. Though Yu’E Bao’s is exploding in size, this new money market fund only has 1 percent of the cash deposits the Chinese banks have.
Chinese banks are protected petals, guarded from foreign and domestic competition by a never-ending labyrinth of red tape. These large financial institutions aren’t used to competition. But Chinese banks have recently faced growing pressure from the central government to make lending more “market based.” This is code for: base loans on the business case rather than personal influence. Banks and products shouldn’t be guaranteed to ensure that fewer, wasteful or corrupt loans are made. A noble aim although a difficult one. Alibaba and Yu’E Bao’s success is just rubbing a hand-full of salt into this opening wound. Needless to say the Chinese banks are fighting back.
To be fair, the banks have some worthy points. Their claim that Yu’E Bao’s growing market power could lead to Tianhong and Alibaba making investment decisions that bankrupt a regional bank has validity. There is also a morsel of fact in the speculation that Yu’E Bao could be withholding cash before certain dates (like Chinese New Year and quarter end), leading to spikes in interest rates to increase its returns. These spikes are de-stabilizing to the whole financial system. Yu’E Bao’s response that it still only has 1 percent of cash deposits isn’t that strong either, since many banks often stand only a few percent of deposits away from illiquidity.
Yu’E Bao also has risks for its investors. It offers daily liquidity yet invests for 2-4 weeks, thus being vulnerable to the fund-equivalent of a bank run. Yu’E Bao isn’t a bad product, but this mismatch could lead to problems one day, so this product is for smaller sums and not for life savings, despite its decent returns and ease of use.
In this environment, there are two main potential outcomes. The first is that the government finds a way to hobble or cap the success of Yu’E Bao (the government doesn’t’ like power bases outside of state control). The second likely outcome is that Yu’E Bao has liquidity problems and leads to a collapse of a small regional bank in China, probably leading to a bail-out. Either outcome could mean the fund’s death.
We like Alibaba and the fact they have stuck it to the banks. These easy-to-use financial products are highly needed in China. The Chinese government would do better to fix the Yu’E Bao product and change the terms to access available after 7 days notice, rather than daily liquidity. Liberalization of the bank’s interest rate would also help.

Are you looking to improve your MLM and Network Marketing sales skills? You're either Making Sales or you're making Excuses, not making any sales. Peter Mingils teaches the Making Sales or Excuses Training Course. To get the right kind of MLM training, you can take the Mini Course or the Full Course and increase your sales and sales management skills!
"We have been using National-Leads.com since the end of March, 2007 and recommending them to our team. We are very pleased with the conversion from the 1-7 day old email leads and the price is affordable for everyone. We use them with an autoresponder and once they sign up for our free offer, follow up with them. We are delighted to discover they are very qualified MLM leads with people eager to get their business started. The support with National Leads is phenomenal. They offer training and tips for good tools we can use with our businesses. The owner is funny, very personable and has a great heart for people. Take our word for it, this is the kind of home business leads company you want to make a part of your advertising budget."
Below is a screen shot of a program called Zennoa which l reviewed and was in the pre-launch stage. Google did not even know that program exists and ANY website could have ranked for that search term. There is really no point in wasting valuable time flogging dead horses. There is no need for another review of Empower Network, Vemma or those MLM ancestors … LOL.
Elite MLM Leads views MLM lead generation and conversion from a prospect's point of view. While other home based business leads companies claim they have the ability to generate quality network marketing leads that convert, it is usually because they have highly-specialized expertise that, at best, improves your overall recruiting efforts incrementally.
Hiring an expert is the way to go if you want to do this fast and effectively. In the long run, new clients are worth more than what you have to pay to get help finding them. You’ll make far more money on one turned lead than you will spend on getting someone to help you get that lead. If that’s not the case for you, however, then things may need to change a little. You’ll want to go do some looking at reviews for various lead generation companies to see what they can help you with and if they are worth your time to work with.
A: This is a challenge for most MLM distributors. When it come to products, it sounds like you've made a wise choice in your company selection. This will provide a good foundation for sponsoring satisfied customers and is the "back door" approach to a building downline. A satisfied customer will tell others, and the retailing and sponsoring cycle starts again.
When purchasing leads, you need to know what type of information the person was looking at and where they came from. Nowadays most business opportunity leads are generated online.

No matter what you are selling online, your chances are much higher that these business opportunity buyers will actually take action, than with a list of bizopp seekers. Bizopp buyers are actively looking, researching and buying the things they feel they need to increase their income. And when it comes to increasing their income, people can become locked-into a product that is appealing.
It's a numbers game. Don't expect to get results working leads unless you are ready to work through plenty of them. That means buying a list and working through 100 leads and then deciding whether or not they were any good isn't a big enough sample size to make your final determination. Results with MLM Leads requires not only patience with your expectations, but also coming to the full realization that QUANTITY is what is going to bring you the result you are looking for in your recruiting efforts. Don't even commit unless you're willing to commit.
MyAutoPilot Traffic sends traffic to you on a pay per click basis. Each click we send to fill your order acts to send a business opportunity seeker to your lead capture page. Each time we send a visitor to your lead capture page, we send you an email notification so that you have an indication of when traffic is being directed to your lead capture page.
Leads should come in the form of people that are likely to work with you. When you get leads for free, they may not be targeted. That’s okay though, you can target these people yourself, and it’s free to do if you’re willing to put some time into learning marketing. Don’t just get a logo slapped together and act like you’re an awesome company with all kinds of things you don’t really have in place. However, you can work with leads that you target by learning to make a splash in places like review websites and other places people read more about companies.
Facebook used to be an easy source to tap into, but since they have formed a public company with shareholders who need to be kept happy, Facebook have changed their Terms of Service several times recently and have clamped down on a number of things that used to make lead generation relatively easy. They have discouraged siphoning off clients to external web sites and CPA offers, and have raised the cost of advertisements that do this. It remains a viable lead source however.
Perhaps the only real way to reach free leads is to network with other, more experienced marketers, and perhaps get them to share their lists as a way to get you off the ground. With this, you aren’t really getting free leads as such – more leads at no up-front cost. The other marketers will usually expect that you will send commission to them for the sales that you make.
Then figure out where your target customers can be found—both physically and virtually. College students who need more income can be found on campus or on online forums or websites about learning to manage your money. Athletes and people who lead healthy lifestyles can be found at gyms and online groups or websites about running, yoga, healthy eating, and more.

Joule, which electrified its original Wallingford neighborhood with its eclectic French-accented Korean menu (or was it Korean-accented French? — or modern Korean-American? — but what about the Sunday urban barbecues?) was the first Seattle restaurant owned by the team of Rachel Yang and Seif Chirchi. After winning acclaim for Joule, they went on to perhaps greater accolades for creative fusion (and delightful dumplings) at Revel in Fremont.
Yang and Chirchi closed the Wallingford Joule in the spring, and have spent the months since then spiffing up a new space in the Fremont Collective building at 3506 Stone Way N., right by Renee Erickson’s (also hotly awaited) new restaurant, The Whale Wins. Joule’s opening date is tentatively set for Oct. 24, though I’d watch this space for the final word.
When the doors do open, Joule will keep its modern spin on Korean flavors, but this time it will be Yang and Chirchi’s take on a Korean steakhouse. Look for opening dishes from the Iron Chef contestants that include “beef tartar with spicy cod roe and Asian pear; brisket steak with sweet chili rub and pickled pearl onion; short rib steak with kalbi with grilled kimchi; and a petit tender steak with fermented tofu and crispy shallot.” Beef-free sides include “smoked tofu with honshimeji confit and soy truffle vinaigrette (a holdover from the old Joule — Yang makes her own tofu); mackerel with green curry cilantro crust and black currant; and rice noodles with shitake and watercress. Joule will be open daily, with weekend brunch planned as “a buffet spread of salads, fruit and pastries alongside entree choices like breakfast porchetta with oatmeal stuffing and sweet chili rub.”
Moving the restaurant gave the couple the opportunity to think about what they really wanted to do with the menu, Yang said — to ask “OK, what do we want our focus to be?”
“Joule is a place where we had fun with food,” she said, but she felt the old place had “too much of a flavor spectrum on one plate.” The more she thought about it, the idea that “beef is basically the most prized meat in Korea” seemed a framework they could build from. “There are so many cuts of meat that we serve in Korea, different marinades, cooking techniques.”
The new Joule will have 36 seats, with (like the old one) an open kitchen, and with an 18-seat communal table. There will be seasonal outdoor seating for 20 more.
For the design, they wanted “to take certain elements” from the old Joule but transform them. It’ll still have wallpaper, for instance, but this time it’s handscreened panels from Justin Kane Elder (who did the paintings at Revel) and Patrick “Duffy” De Armas of the Electric Coffin Creative Supply Co.; “they came up with the idea of having a classic design but having fun details in them.”
The new Joule is just a few minutes from Revel (and its adjacent bar, Quoin), making it easier for Yang and Chirchi to go between them — but also not stray far from their original customers. “We knew we wanted to stay nearby. We didn’t want to leave Wallingford, we loved that area.”
Now, though, Yang feels they’ve found their niche. “After a lot of playing around, we really know what we want to cook, and we feel like we know how to deliver.”
“Right now we are really happy where we are,” she said, with Chirchi taking the lead on Revel and her doing the same at Joule. (Also, with a two-year-old and a four-month-old to raise at home, ‘we have sort of full plates.”)
“We would love to have a third place some day, but I don’t know how to do that yet” — how to get to the point where they’re outnumbered by their restaurants.
Piroshkis? Strawberry shortcake? There was none of that on the private end of the Bite of Seattle we saw on Wednesday night’s ‘Top Chef Seattle.’ The show, filmed in July, called for the eight remaining contestants to come up with a restaurant concept and a signature dish to serve in a booth at the Bite, which Padma Lakshmi called “one of the city’s premiere restaurant showcases.” (Well…) With no apparent price constraints, cheftestants turned out dishes like Thai lobster bisque and seared ribeyes and plates loaded with slices of raw fish. Here’s our weekly roundup of the highlights and lowlights:
“The biggest restaurant guy in the world”: According to Stefan, that would be celeb judge Wolfgang Puck.
But once again, isn’t this a Seattle show?: We did get credited cameos by Maria Hines, Jason Franey, Thierry Rautureau, Tom Douglas, and Jerry and Kathy Klingen (owners of Salty’s.) Brian Canlis told Stefan how much he loved the lobster broth, which Stefan then promptly sprayed all over him in a blender disaster.
“One of the most versatile and refreshing ingredients in the world”: Ginger, said Lakshmi. Sadly, when the producers went on to assign it for the quickfire challenge, it was via the product placement of the soda that appears to only include ginger as a “natural flavor.”
Quickfire winner: Brooke, who heard from Puck that her ginger caramel squid could have been on one of his menus. Good thing she won immunity, because her “Unkosher” restaurant concept for the elimination challenge — “Jewish food gone awry,” like perhaps ham sandwiches on challah bread — was hard to swallow.
What we thought was foreshadowing, but wasn’t: Josie saying “I really think I’m going home this time.” Judge Tom Colicchio pointed out that Josie forgets the same basics again and again. Her time-management was once again poor, her Cuban pork was greasy, and Meyer told her that “the minute I tried to put my fork into that pork and the pork fought back, I said, this is going to be a problem.” But Josie survived.
Did he really say that? Contestants got to pick assistants from among their former colleagues, and Stefan chose Carla. As many times as I re-ran the DVR, he still seemed to be saying “I had moments when I wanted to strangle Carla or just shank her, but she is super fast and her butt is always cute.”
Dis on raw food: When Micah decided his restaurant would feature raw food, Josh said it seemed like a watered-down idea that “is not really showcasing your talents as a chef.” You going to say that to the faces of these folks?
On the other hand: Micah was asked to pack his knives and go home. The judges felt his dish lacked passion and risk, and didn’t like that he sliced his fish ahead of time. “If this is not adding something to the dialogue on really good sushi, who needs it?” said Meyer. (Micah had hoped for raw “surf and turf,” but couldn’t find any suitable meats, so stuck to fish and veggies.)
Winners: Sheldon, for his modern Filipino restaurant featuring sour tamarind soup, and Kristen (now at $45,000 in winnings, I believe) for her French, formal-leaning slow-cooked egg with Camembert mustard sauce and buttered radishes. They’ll fight against each other next week in the second part of the “Restaurant Wars” concept.

From the golden age of Hungarian Jewish culture to inter-war anti-semitism, Budapest is constantly being rewritten, finds Gwen Jones.
Writing in 1910, a good decade before Al Capone and associates attained international notoriety, the Hungarian critic and arts patron Lajos Hatvany (1880-1961) introduced an imaginary Western European reader to the latest developments in his country’s culture and history. Tracing Hungary’s elevation following the 1867 Compromise with Austria, from ‘a rudimentary agricultural people to a higher rank’, into the era of economic growth and progress, he suggested that the country was not merely Europeanizing, it was Americanizing: ‘Budapest will become the Chicago of the Balkans’.
My book takes its title from Hatvany’s ironic remark, and discusses the ways in which Hungarian intellectuals viewed and wrote about their capital city from the turn of the twentieth century until the outbreak of World War Two. Referring to the speed with which Budapest grew in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and contrasting this with a dusty ‘Balkan’ backwardness on the periphery, Hatvany placed the Hungarian capital within an absurd contradiction. In this, he was far from alone.
While compiling the book’s index, which was by far the most entertaining part of the entire writing process, I began by listing references to ‘Budapest is Hungarian’, and then for ‘Budapest is not Hungarian’. Next, I compiled various images writers had used to describe the city over this forty-year period. Budapest had been compared to, among other things, Babel, Babylon and Sodom. It was a ‘New Jerusalem’ built by Jews, and ‘Judapest’, the latter description attributed to Karl Lueger, who was mayor of Vienna from 1897 to 1910. Budapest was the Hungarian Paris, a muse, a parvenu, a Potemkinopolis, a whore and a volcano. Moreover, the Buda side was stuffy and conservative, much like an elderly uncle, while Pest, the centre of commerce, journalism and cabaret, was a cocotte, a fashionable prostitute. In the words of Rezső Seress’s popular interwar chanson, Hiába van palotád Budán, ‘No point your having a villa in Buda, it’s Pest where you go for fun’. (more…)
With his regime running out of steam, Vladimir Putin is resorting to the rhetoric of the past and traditional values. Marie Mendras sees little future in it.
The moment of truth for a non-democratic leader is when he needs to revive his fading authority and legitimacy. A snatched electoral victory over a year ago brought Vladimir Putin no new popularity, indeed quite the opposite.
Since his return to the Kremlin, his words and actions have reflected entirely negative emotions, such as fear of his own people, distrust of the elites around him, and a desire to avenge himself on those who have dared oppose him. Much of his energy goes on proving himself right and his critics wrong: he even accuses these of working for foreign powers and endangering national security. Putin has not recovered from the humiliation and scare of last year’s political contest, and is now facing tough economic and social challenges. The choice he has made is to try to restore his authority with a combination of targeted repression, doctrinaire ideology and an increase in control over institutions and companies. This is an unlikely recipe for success.
Vladimir Putin was re-elected on a controversial vote in March 2012. He could have won his new mandate more honestly, had he accepted the possibility of a second round runoff, but he was determined to win an absolute majority in the first round. He wanted to humiliate the other ‘authorised’ candidates by raising himself high above them, proving that he was the one and only – and a loyal Central Electoral Commission conferred on him a generous 63% of the vote. A year on, all the voters’ associations and NGOs that investigated election fraud are being harassed and some, like the Golos association, might have to close down. Key figures in the movement for free elections are also being prosecuted.
Putin’s election in 2000 and 2004, and Dmitry Medvedev’s election in 2008, were ‘managed’ ballots as well. This time, however, things turned out less manageable than usual. The widespread and vocal public protest of the winter of 2011-12, news of which flew around the country in a few keystrokes, exposed all of the regime’s rottenness and trickery. And the anger of a revitalized civil society was directed at the leader in person, under the ubiquitous slogan: ‘Putin, ukhodi!’ [Putin – out!]. His party fared badly in the parliamentary elections of December 2011, and in Moscow itself its performance was a complete disaster.
Throughout the 2000s, Vladimir Putin built his power and legitimacy on order, rising living standards and Russia’s growing global status. However, he will have more difficulty delivering in all three of these areas in the months and years to come, and he will be held to account for it. (more…)
Poland has emerged as a major player in EU politics. The question now is what it wants to do with its new found clout, writes guest contributor Roderick Parkes.
There’s much to be learnt about power in the EU just by walking around its capitals. Parisians don’t walk so much as proceed; Berliners stare; Londoners apologize when bumped into, then look resentful. As for Varsovians, they simply don’t make space for others.
Conclusions? The French view power in terms of self-aggrandisement; the Germans, in terms of scrutiny and mutual control; the British, as a furtive game of playing states off against each other. As for the Poles, everyone knows why they don’t budge: they have an inferiority complex and a strong dose of territorial angst.
Except, of course, that these days they do budge. Polish street etiquette is improving markedly, and a stroll from Nowy Świat to Ulica Warecka is no longer a full-body contact sport. That’s good news for visiting Brits, who no longer have to apologize as they are trodden underfoot.
It’s good news, too, for the EU: it speaks of a growing sense of ease among Poles as the country’s weight in the bloc has grown. The question now is what Poland wants to do with its new-found clout. (more…)
Vlad Filat, until recently Liberal Democrat Prime Minister of Moldova, is locked in a power struggle with Vladimir Plahotniuc, the country’s one and only oligarch. This war of attrition threatens the Eastern Partnership’s ‘success story’ and with it Moldova’s reform project says Andrew Wilson.
Not every policy detail may have been perfect in Moldova since 2009, but at least the narrative seemed right. Eastern Europe’s only ruling Communist Party fell from government. The changeover was mythologised as the ‘Twitter Revolution’ – a precursor of the ‘Arab Spring’ and ‘Moscow Winter’ – although in fact it was a prosaic process of elections and parliamentary arithmetic. The Communists were replaced by the smooth-sounding Alliance for European Integration, which was soon getting rave reviews for its reform efforts from the EU. Tiny Moldova leapfrogged the other five states in the Eastern Partnership and seemed to be first in the queue to sign an Association and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement at the Vilnius summit in November 2013.
By 2013, however, reviews were getting more mixed. Since the beginning of the year, Moldova has plunged into the kind of political infighting reminiscent of Orange Ukraine at its worst. After a previous crisis over the presidency was solved in 2012, it had seemed the current parliament would sit out a full term until the next elections are due in 2014. Today, Moldova has to sort out three simultaneous problems: it has no stable government, new elections are threatened and it is limping toward the November summit. It might collapse over the finishing line or just before; it might have a sudden burst of energy in the finishing strait; or it might fail a last-minute dope test.
So what went wrong? In reality, the three-party Alliance for European Integration was badly designed at birth; more exactly, at its rebirth. The first incarnation of the AEI in 2009-2010 struggled with a minimal majority over the Communists. That majority was improved at new elections in November 2010, but the elections also gave Russia the chance to push hard for an alternative alliance between the Communists and the pivotal Democratic Party (which includes many ex-Communists). Vladimir Putin sent his right-hand man, Sergei Naryshkin, to Chisinau to seal the deal. He didn’t succeed but encouraged the Democrats to secure a high price for not defecting back to the Communists, with the signing of a secret agreement in December 2010, leaked in 2012, to partition not just ministries but also supposedly neutral state institutions and revenue streams among the AEI’s three component parties.

With all that experience you would think I had all the answers and didn’t need to use a financial planner. I should by now, know everything I need to know to ensure I have my money under control and a very fat superannuation balance.
However, I am sure you have heard the story of the plumber who has leaking taps, and the painter whose house needs painting.
I knew all the theory. In fact, I can recite the benefits of dollar-cost-averaging and compound interest in my sleep.
But despite knowing the theory, I needed discipline. I needed someone who could guide me and make me accountable for the decisions I wanted to make. Like a sounding board – a counsellor.
I needed someone who could keep me on the straight and narrow, someone who would challenge me when it became necessary, and someone who experienced financial success in their own life. Not ‘in your face’ wealthy, but someone who was financially comfortable and had mastered their own work/life balance.
And they had to be younger than me, or someone who at least had a robust business succession plan in place – as I didn’t want a planner who would be retiring when my wife and I needed them most.
On top of all that, I needed to find someone my wife was comfortable to deal with, and someone who could guide her if there came a time when I was no longer around.
As I work in financial services, I have access to a vast number of financial planners – many of them excellent at what they do and each with their own very loyal clients.
But my search lead me to one particular adviser. Someone I have known and respected for a number of years.
Most of our modest family wealth is held in our family home, and in superannuation. We are typical Australians in that regard.
When looking for a financial planner, I didn’t need someone who could tell me about salary sacrificing into super, making spouse contributions, claiming the government low-income co-contribution, or even the benefits of commencing a transition to retirement pension.
What I needed was someone who could guide me on investment selection. What managed funds should I be using, what shares should I be buying, and the fixed interest and hybrid securities to consider?
At the time I first engaged with my financial planner, I had a self-managed superannuation fund. Why? I am not really sure.
The SMSF has now gone and, on my adviser’s recommendation, I am using a public offer super fund that gives me access to all the same investments I could access through an SMSF but without me having to do a heap of additional compliance work. And the current super fund has ended up being cheaper to run than my SMSF.
Now, we didn’t need to discuss the investment returns as I keep on top of that through my online access to my account. But we did discuss the state of the market and general concerns about the investment decisions that might need to be made in the coming weeks and months. On a more global basis, we discussed the outlook for both the Australian and international sharemarkets.
However, the dominant conversation revolved around what my wife and I wanted to do with our lives, rather than with our finances.
Anyone who knows me well will know that I enjoy my work. But I am often asked when I intend to retire.
When this question comes up, I am really good at ‘kicking the can down the street’. By that, I mean I either brush the question off or say something vague like ‘in a couple of years’. It is quite confronting and frankly, it is something I don’t really want to think about at this stage.
If I enjoy my work and my life, and if I am able to continue to deliver a quality service to my clients, then why should I have a fixed retirement date in mind? After our conversation, I felt liberated.
No doubt there will come a time when I will say ‘I have had enough’, or I feel I am no longer adding value, or I now want to do other ‘stuff’, but until that day comes, I will continue to do exactly what I enjoy doing. The fact I am paid a salary to do it is an added bonus.
Having a financial planner who is willing to have some of the more awkward conversations is, to me, where the value lies in the relationship. They are a counsellor or coach first, and a financial planner second. To me, my financial planner is worth their weight in gold!
I love surprises. I’ve always loved them, even as a small child. Yes, I knew where my mother hid the presents for Christmas, but I didn’t go into the closet looking for them. Not intentionally.
In the natural course of things, however, I did find a few. I remember one gift in particular. It was a doll head mounted on a molded plastic beauty stand. She had long blonde hair, her own make-up collection, and girly hair accessories; my friends and I had great fun “dolling her up,” so to speak. That is, until somebody came along with a magic marker and ruined it all. Why do kids do that? Magic doesn’t wash off!
Sigh, I digress. I’ve recently learned those dolls are called “styling heads,” and they still make them, which makes me feel better, like my doll is somehow redeemed from her ill fate by continued mass production. But here’s my point: I found the doll before Christmas, so when Christmas Day came around, I had to act surprised when I spied her golden locks under the tree. I’m not a great actress, mind you, but I pushed my guilt aside and did a decent job of it.
Now my brother, on the other hand, he was a present peeker. He was always sneaky about stuff. He knew where the presents were, same as I, but unlike me of the reasonably clear conscience, he didn’t think twice about plundering the goods.
As an adult, I’ve taken an informal survey about how folks handle surprises. Some, like me, are big fans of the surprise element, and all the suspenseful steps leading up to it. Other peeps, well, they’re all about peeping. They don’t believe in the sanctity of the “Wrapped Gift.” These offenders readily admit their bad childhood sneakiness – e.g., finding "Santa's" secret stash, unwrapping the gifts, playing with the toys, and rewrapping them with deceitful glee, only to pose as innocent, surprised children, full of wonder Christmas morning.
There are those, however, who still cling to the sneakiness in adulthood. These are the truly shameless, the ones who really deserve to shoot their eye out.
My love of surprises did bite me once. My birthday was coming up, and my erstwhile boyfriend wanted to tell me what he had gotten me. “No, no, no, absolutely not,” I told him with naïve enthusiasm. “I love surprises.” Oh, but not this one. Looking back, I should’ve just let him tell me what the present was – then I could’ve saved two weeks and broken up with him right then.
My son is the same way about surprises, so it must be genetic. We have great fun every year building the suspense to great heights, planting small clues outside the packages, hazy, indiscernible hints as to what’s wrapped inside. It’s delightful torment.
As wonderful as the surprises of Christmas are, I love the openness too – shared greetings with family, well wishes to strangers, the hearty, pine-scented, clean air of winter, and the pure, philanthropic joy of giving.
This year, as always, I’ll send up my heartfelt prayers, and send out my holiday greetings – good tidings I’m cheery to share, with special thanks to my customized, magnetized, CrinkledNose holiday photo card (pictured below). To all who will read this, I wish you a Merry Christmas! And to all who will also get this card in the mail, you can get some practice acting surprised when you open up the envelope. :)
I did pull off a pretty good birthday surprise this year, and I've also got a pretty big sleeve of "wouldn't have suspected for even a minute" suprises.... What girl wouldn't love a newwwww vacumn cleaner? I am the gift man!
I shall act very surprised when my card arrives! Who me, I haven't seen a thing :) Very well written blog

CommentaryAnniversaries of important political events were always lavishly celebrated in the GDR with considerable publicity, and the anniversary of the Russian revolution was one of the most important. That John Heartfield was given the task of designing a poster for the 40th anniversary shows how important it was as, at the time, he was one of the most distinguished and internationally reputed artists living and working in East Germany. He had become known throughout the world in the 1930’s with his political photomontages. For this poster, Heartfield composited different photographs at different levels (of meaning). The raised rifle is the important message; it is like a signal to storm the Palace in St. Petersburg (where the 1917 revolution began). Armed men can be seen in the second level as well, beyond which everything turns into a diffuse black – and over everything flies a red flag, a symbol of the new power.

Wow your shop is amazing. It looks so very real. You have thought of every detail. Stunning work congratulations.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is interacting with other socio-economic and demographic factors to create a perfect storm of business model change in all industries, resulting in major disruptions to labour markets. New categories of jobs will emerge, partly or wholly displacing others. The skill sets required in both old and new occupations will change in most industries and transform how and where people work. It may also affect female and male workers differently and transform the dynamics of the industry gender gap.
The Future of Jobs Report aims to unpack and provide specific information on the relative magnitude of these trends by industry and geography, and on the expected time horizon for their impact to be felt on job functions, employment levels and skills.
Pro Day (Brandt) - Luck had an outstanding workout. He threw very, very well despite heavy, blowing winds. He throws a real tight spiral, which allows the ball to cut through the wind. He has 10-inch hands, which are not overly big but are above average.
Pro Day (Gollin) - Watched it on NFLN. No surprises. Made every throw. You can't gauge football IQ from a Pro Day workolut. Wiz was at the Stanford Pro Day.
Pro Football Draft Guide - There’s no such thing as a can’t miss QB but Luck has a better chance to turn into an All Pro than any prospect in the past decade
PFW Scout's Candid Comment: "Luck is not special. He's missing something, and it's hard to put your finger on it exactly - I've talked to other GM's around the league and there is no one out there who thinks this guy is (Peyton) Manning or (John) Elway. A winner, yes. A game-changer no..."
From nfl.com - If RG III hadn’t hit the scene, Luck likely would have been considered one of the most sure-thing prospects in the past decade. Prototypical pro-style quarterback who can make all the line calls, formation shifts, pass drops, and throws necessary to be successful at the next level. Will likely be the top pick overall and start immediately/ possesses the intangibles to be a franchise stalwart for years to come.
Intangibles set him apart…has all the traits of a franchise quarterback. Tough, durable and willing to step into a throw under pressure. Has a deliberate set-up with no wasted motion /can play from many different looks…learned under Jim Harbaugh and David Shaw. Has the size to take a hit, and the athletic ability to make plays happen with his feet. On the move, he makes his second and third reads with ease. Very compact and quick release…can fire it out to the flats with ease off one-step drops. Makes fewer and fewer mistakes with each succeeding year….rarely forces a ball into tight coverage. Clean off the field, and rarely makes a mistake on it. One would be hard-pressed to find negatives to Luck's game. No glaring weaknesses in his play…not the athlete that RG3 is, but that is simply not his game. There were times when Luck second-guessed passes and didn't see a breaking corner coming from another zone, but generally he’ll identify and improve on this weaknesses
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Better than average mental makeup. Certainly in the upper echelon of college quarterbacks. Tough both mentally and physically. Shoulders a lot of responsibility conducting a pro-style offense. A natural when it comes to checking off the safety. Good at going through progression reads. Protects the football and limits mental errors. Will hang in the pocket and make throws with defenders in his face. Trusts his arm too much. Has a bit of FB mentality. Must learn the value of sliding and protecting his body.
Better than average accuracy. Excellent touch. Knows how to change velocities /throws a very 'catchable' ball. Can drop the ball in-between defenders and make all the necessary throws accurately (has vastly improved his ball placement since 2009 - 2010 season). Inconsistent with his footwork at times. Gets lazy going from one read to the next and will throw off-balance too often. But makes impressive and accurate throws falling away or with defenders all over him. Could improve deep ball accuracy. Sometimes floats and aims throws.
Upper-echelon arm strength. Gets very good zip on deep outs and can fit the ball into tight spots beyond 15 yards.. Good overall mechanics and a smooth, compact and relatively quick release. Comes over the top most of the time but can also change release points. Will pat the ball before delivering it.
Other QB prospects are faster and more dangerous but few have better pocket presence. Does not abort the pocket when unnecessary. Consistently can sidestep or step up to avoid the rush, and will reset within the pocket rather than taking off prematurely. But can extend plays outside of the pocket and keeps eyes downfield. Knows when to tuck the ball and run. Good speed for his size and vision and competitiveness as a runner.
Pro Day - The workout was outstanding. I’m not sure whether he or Andrew Luck should be the No. 1 overall draft pick. Of the 51 passes that he threw, just two weren’t catchable. His arm strength is very, very good; he threw the ball with ease 60 yards down the field. His anticipation was very good; he was able to hit receivers coming across the field.Griffin has excellent feet, and he’s equally good going to his right or his left. Many players are better off going one way or the other, but he was equally impressive both ways.There’s no question in my mind, after seeing him work out today, that he’s going to be a very, very good NFL quarterback in the future. He’s got everything you need in a passing arm, and he’s got speed and quickness of feet. I talked to a linebackers coach after the workout, and he said he hopes he doesn’t have to play against Griffin more than once every three or four years.
Pro Football Draft Guide - Like Cam Newton a year ago, Griffin’s athleticism overshadows the strides he’s made as a passer. That athleticism will allow him to survive until he fully grasps and NFL offense.
From nfl.com - Some say RG3 is not only the most physically gifted quarterback in the 2012 draft, but also the most talented player…overall. Intangibles are making many general managers swoon. Because of his athleticism and ability to extend plays , focus on moving the ball downfield and his hurdling ability, some feel he’s a better prospect than Luck. Either way, RG3 likely will be a top-five pick and is so talented that teams who already young quarterbacks will have a tough time passing up him up.
A talented quarterback built for the position…slightly undersized, but his athletic ability allows him tomake plays with his feet, extend plays, make the deep throw, and lead his team down the field. Same natural talents as Cam Newton sans the size. Simply so athletic that defenders rarely get a shot at him…extremely explosive.. drops back with absolute ease. Unafraid to to step into a throw in traffic, or reset outside the pocket. Uunlike Luck, he can also move the chains with his feet. Senior year reaffirmed that he is an athletic quarterback rather than vice versa (i.e. a guy who can make all the smart throws first, and create later if necessary).
Lacks prototypical size and could have durability issues if he is hit often enough (but should be athletic enough to avoid big hits, even at the pro-level. Some might worry that he will look to run first at the next level. Had only one strong season in college, but performed well on a big stage.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Better than average head for position. Baylor's Offense does not translate to the NFL game, but mobility gives him more room for error than many other QB prospects. Has a lot to learn about identifying coverages and hot reads. Lack of ideal height leads to some problems seeing entire field, but is an intelligent and disciplined individual. Great work ethic / capable of digesting a new system quickly.
Short accuracy is still a work in progress (lacks ideal touch and must learn to take some mustard off his fastball. Can be a bit off-target on underneath throws, which lessens RAC opportunities. Intermediate accuracy is above-average – will miss within the strike zone at times -- but can anticipate passing windows and fit the ball into tight spots. Deep accuracy vastly improved - drop the ball in between defenders. Above average anticipation on deep throws. Very good touch and improvement in trajectory awareness. Can hit target from many different release points"
Smooth delivery. Little bit longer release than ideal but not a wind-up delivery. Very smooth and relaxed. Ball explodes off his hand. Arm strength just a notch below NFL-elite. Can make all the throws and can driving the ball down the field with ease. Can get great velocity on throws even when forced to short-stride or when he can’t drive off back foot. Smaller-than-ideal hands will struggle at times to grip-and-rip on shorter throws. Lacks great control on pump fakes. Some balls batted down at the line of scrimmage.
"Rare athleticism and speed for the position. Will become one of the most dynamic dual-threat QBs in the NFL / in the same class as Michael Vick. Above-average pocket presence. Initial quickness is outstanding. Few college QBs buy more second-chance passing opportunities. Comfortable rolling out and throwing to both sides. Elite foot quickness, elusiveness and burst as a runner.
Pro day - After his performance at the Texas A&M pro day Thursday, I think there’s a very good chance he can be a top pick in the NFL draft in April.. The skill set that he showed was really, really good. He had an outstanding workout. He moves around well, he’s got accuracy and he’s got good velocity on the ball. It’s just going to be how people see him, as to where he’s going to get drafted. He has excellent ability and skills. He put on a show Thursday.
Tannehill threw 68 passes in a scripted workout coordinated by Chris Weinke, a former NFL QB who has been training Tannehill recently. A&M players Jeff Fuller and Cyrus Gray served as Tannehill’s receivers.Fifteen of Tannehill’s passes were on the goal line, and the rest were on the 30-yard line going downfield. He missed one long pass and had two drops; otherwise, he was perfect. He also did the 40-yard dash in 4.62 seconds, running it just once.
As good as Tannehill’s performance was, it did take place “against air,” so to speak. There were no defensive backs there; nobody was engaging receivers coming off the line. But he spins the ball well; it comes out of his hand quickly. He does all of the things you look for on the field. If he works at the off-the-field preparation, like I think he will, I think he has a chance to be a very good NFL quarterback.
He’s a big, strong kid that can rip the ball. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.62 seconds, but we all knew he was athletic already because he’s a former wide receiver. His foot is fine. He threw the ball extremely well on short, intermediate and deep passes. His movement skills in the pocket were excellent; he had good feet and good accuracy on the run. Everything checks out.
I expected to see all that. This was a scripted workout and it confirmed what I saw on tape. Potentially, down the road, he could be a franchise quarterback. The problem is, he’s not ready to play right now. He’s very raw; he only had 19 starts in college. However, because the NFL is so overheated right now when it comes to finding franchise quarterbacks, I think the kid is probably going to go higher than he should. I think Cleveland has to take him at No. 4, and if they don’t, Miami is sitting there at No. 8. So the worst-case scenario for him is, I think, that he’s going to go at No. 8 to the Dolphins. But I don’t think he’s ready to play Day 1. I don’t think he trusts his reads yet. He’s got a long way to go, but I think he’s got the tools necessary to be a franchise quarterback.
PFW Scout's Candid Comment: "What you have to keep in mind when you're looking at Tannehill - Mike Sherman's offense is not very good. (He) has plenty of arm talent. He's athletic, he can move around, he's got a ton of upside. If you have time to sit him, you can hit big in a few years."
Pro Football Draft Guide - He probably needs another year to get ready, but a potentially solid starter in a West Coast offense
From nfl.com - Dynamic athlete who was a major contributor at receiver for his first 2+ college years. More of a gunslinger early on as a QB, but has morphed into an effective and efficient pocket passer. A fierce competitor with the overall tools to be a first- or second-round pick.
Calm dropping back from center…it’s obvious that he is a natural athlete at the position. Good feel for pressure and has made his scrambling ability a heavy asset in the passing game as a play-extender. Mechanically sound / can anticipate where the receiver will be… fairly consistent accuracy on all throws and a consummate running threat. Only one year’s collegiate experience but has demonstrated he has the arm and decision to make it in the NFL. Did a lot to dispel inexperience concerns in his senior year, but he will need to continue to develop before he’s ready to start.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Physically tough with enough mental toughness to succeed at the position. Best football appears in front of him. Natural leader on the field with clear command of huddle. Goes through progressions and very effective when pre-snap read and first option aren’t there. But has limited game experience, and his rawness shines through at times. Forces too many throws into coverage. Competitive edge gets the best of him and he’ll try to make plays that aren't there. Must learn the value of ball security and when to throw it away.
"Good anticipation and ability to deliver the ball before the receiver makes his break. A bit unpolished with mechanics - especially with footwork. Does not always step to target or throw on balance which can cause him to miss the mark. Ball placement must improve /he forces receivers to adjust on routine throws. Much more accurate with short-to-intermediate throws than as a deep thrower (Deep throws can occasionally sail). Appears more comfortable targeting the middle of the field than outside the numbers. Usually throws accurately on the run both rolling left and right. "
¾ to sidearm release, but gets it out quickly and can release the ball accurately from a variety of launch points.. Low release point raises slight concerns about batted balls. Arm strength is adequate-to-good / can make all the NFL throws. Lacks elite ability to stretch the field vertically.
Above-average athleticism and quick feet within the pocket. Can break contain and buy time to extend plays. But must do a better job of keeping eyes downfield when avoiding the rush. Long strider who can move the sticks with feet if he can gain the perimeter. Lacks a natural feel in the pocket, must show more poise and vacates the pocket too quickly.
Pro Day - Osweiler sprained his foot in ASU’s loss to the Boise State in the Las Vegas Bowl, an injury that kept him from participating in the combine. One day after Ryan Tannehill wowed NFL scouts and coaches with his workout, Osweiler did the same, launching himself into first-round consideration.
He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.98 and 4.97 seconds indoors on FieldTurf. He threw for those in attendance, but did not do any other drills. Osweiler threw 72 passes, with seven hitting the ground. The seven misses were not, however, an indicator of wildness; his accuracy was very good. He presented himself very well, which is important for a quarterback, and interacted well with his receivers.
Despite his height, he is very flexible and has a solid throwing platform. Mazzone has worked with him to correct a tendency to drop his elbow, which Osweiler avoided doing on Friday. Based on Friday’s workout, I think Osweiler vaulted himself into the first round on draft day. He will likely work out for a number of teams; there is a lot of excitement surrounding him. His showing Friday was somewhat surprising; I think he exceeded the expectations of everybody in attendance. Osweiler has a lot of upside, and some team with a need at the position will be tempted late in the first round.
PFW Scout's Candid Comment: "The big guy has a lot of talent to work with now. He's not ready, but he has the "tools" - sick size, athletic ability, and he's a passer, not a thrower. The senior class is gross."
Pro Football Draft Guide – Brings an unprecedented package of size and athleticism. A developmental QB but has starting potential in an offense that emphasizes the deep ball.
From nfl.com - Intriguing early-entry prospect out of ASU. Two year starter. Good athlete for the position. Basketball background. Has the arm strength to be a first-day pick but lacks first round consistency .
Has a very deliberate, quick-twitch setup … athleticism allows him to play the position naturally and with ease. Slings the ball naturally. Release is so compact and effective he can get away with patting the ball Shining asset is his arm strength; (he can make all the NFL throws).Good leader who looks in control in the huddle and on the field. Above average accuracy and knows when to add touch to the ball or to zip it. Has the pocket presence of a first-day pick and doesn't go down easily. Can extend plays with his feet. Had on-the-field judgment issues throughout his college career and has ball-protection issues. The more confidence he builds, the more of a gun-slinger mentality he adopts - tThis severely hinders his play. When under control, early in games, he is athletic, accurate, and a good game manager. Will need to learn to rein in some of his more competitive traits. Developmental prospect who might struggle if forced to play early on.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Comes from a spread system /will need time to adjust to pro system. Tough competitor on the field and not afraid to sit the pocket and deliver throw while taking a hit or give up body as a runner. Seems to have the mental capacity to adapt / sees the entire field and get to second and third progression during film study. Good at holding safeties and not tipping his hand with initial drop. Sometimes trusts arm too much. Some inconsistency vs. blitz.
A lot of room to grow, but naturally accurate due to athleticism and very good hand-eye coordination. Will need coaching and polish with mechanics and footwork . Will short-hop throws when over-striding with front foot. Has big hands that swallow the ball and allow him to deliver an accurate throw off-balance. Can drive the ball and fit throws into tight windows (only a very few prospects and a handful of NFL quarterbacks can do what he can do). Still developing in terms of projection and ball speed with deep throws. Excellent upside in this area with proper coaching and development. "
¾ release but lower release point does not appear to be an issue due to height. Will pat the ball which can tip off defenders at the next level. But his release is compact and he gets the ball out quickly for a quarterback his height. Also can change up release points on the move. Arm strength a notch below elite but can make all the NFL throws. Can drive the ball down field and stretch the field vertically.
"Height and long limbs make for a big tackling target inside the pocket. But much more athletic and agile than Joe Flacco, Ryan Mallett. Etc. Basketball background translates to maneuvers inside the pocket. Has a natural feel for the rush and good at keeping eyes downfield. Ball security a glaring issue /must do a better job of keeping both hands on the ball inside the pocket. Will never be a running threat is able to break contain and extend plays on the perimeter. Mobile enough to pick up yards and move the chains with his feet.
Pro Day — Foles ran the 40-yard dash in 5.04 and 5.03 seconds. He had a 33-1/2-inch vertical and a 9-0 broad jump. He did the short shuttle in 4.60 seconds and did the three-cone in 7.27 seconds. Foles was nothing special; he was okay in his quarterback workout.
Pro Football Draft Guide – Should have a lengthy NFL career. But he seems less franchise QB and more the guy you’d plug in until something better comes around.
From nfl.com - Has the arm strength and size that warrants first-day consideration . A mechanically sound passer with a solid release. Buried within a quarterback-laden draft class. Big-time leader who rarely gets rattled. Lack of athleticism a concern (projected as more of a "game manager" type) . But should be at least a serviceable starter at the next level. A team that falls in love with his arm strength, could draft him as early as the second round.
Strong arm. Sometimes will throw the deep, cross-field out-route (under pressure and from his back foot) accurately and with ease. Not the most athletic quarterback, but aware in the pocket & with a good sense of how and when to extend a play. Strong deep passer but can struggle with accuracy at times. Accurate on short to intermediate throws… would be more valuable in a West Coast scheme. Excellent game manager. Extremely poised in the pocket and rarely lets a heavy pass rush rattle him.
Mobility has been his Achilles heel…solely a pocket passer /hardly ever moves the chains with his feetCan extend, but he is not going to out-run anyone at the next level. There are times when the ball can get away from him when throwing deep…release is OK but not fast by any means. Judgment with the ball is somewhat questionable, (can be slow to get rid of the ball and tends to scramble into trouble).
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Knows how to go through progressions. No longer panics when first read fails him. Will miss some open receivers at times but knows how to scan the entire field and work back to his third and fourth reads. Poise and anticipation much improved in 2011. Physically and mentally tough. Will hang in the pocket and take a big hit in order to deliver the ball. Still makes some questionable decisions - must limit amount of risks he takes when defenders are wrapping him up.
Overall accuracy is good. Good balance as a passer and generally will step to his target and follow through. A bit erratic on fades and back shoulder throws. Will miss inside the strike zone and must improve ball placement consistency. Has improved his touch and timing. Throws a very catchable ball and knows how to lead his receivers after catch on underneath throws. Most underrated aspect of his game is accuracy under pressure – completed 65-percent of his throws under pressure - among the elite in the 2012 draft class.
Compact ¾ release. Has very few passes batted down. Will change release point if necessary. Arm strength good but not elite. Can make all the necessary throws and drive the ball down the field vertically.
Limited overall athlete. Takes too many sacks. Slow footed and takes too long to get on the move. Can extend plays but is limited in terms of elusiveness and will not pose as a running threat at the next level. But his poise under pressure is much improved. Creativity and playmaking ability after initial play broke down has improved. A big, sturdy QB who frequently can make throws with defenders hanging fall over his lower body.
Pro Day - The 28-year-old ran 4.95 seconds in the 40, posted a 32-inch vertical jump, 8-6 broad jump, 4.49-second short shuttle and 7.40-second three-cone drill. He looked very good throwing, tossing only one uncatchable pass.
Pro Football Draft Guide – The age factor will rightly push him down, but Weeden is a safe pick. We think he tops out as a quality No. 2.
From nfl.com - Pro baseball background. Weeden has been the signal caller for one of the country's most efficient offenses. Poised, effective with great pocket presence - makes quick decisions with the ball to keep the chains moving. Rarely throws interceptions despite a high number of attempts /could go as high as the second round.
Has an NFL-quality frame that Quick release is his strongest asset -consistently gets the ball out with a compact throwing motion and strong delivery. Ball zips off his arm /he can fit it in any tight space with great velocity. He is "all of the above" in terms of being a mature, poised leader. Accurate passer both short and long, with that gunslinger mentality to go for the deep ball and give his receivers a chance. Understands route progressions and how to throw ball to where his guy can make a play.
Only an average athlete and very limited when scrambling. Tough time getting outside the pocket/ his accuracy and touch decrease immensely when he scrambles. Seems to grasp route concepts and looks for his second option, but he will hold the ball too long.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Plays in a spread system and has almost no experience working under center. Gun-slinger type mentality Must continue to cut down on forced throws . Hangs tough in pocket and will go through progressions. Patient in the pocket / keeps his eyes down the field. Physically and mentally tough. Capable of leading his team from behind and delivering in clutch.
Exceptionally accurate when he has a clean pocket and can step into his throws. Above average anticipation and timing. Knows how to take mustard off fastball and throw a more catchable ball underneath. Can throw accurately from different launch points. Puts good air under deep ball, but a high percentage of his throws were made within 10 yards of the LOS. Struggles with his accuracy when throwing under pressure.
Baseball background. Tends to pat the ball before delivery / release point is closer to three-quarters than over-the-top (raising concerns about batted balls). However, he has a quick delivery and the ball explodes off of his hand. Throws a tight spiral more often than not. Overall arm strength is just a notch below elite.
Overall pocket awareness has improved but remains only average at best. Tends to drift backwards vs. outside pressure rather than stepping up in the pocket. But showed more patience in the pocket as a senior and does a good job of keeping his eyes down the field. Adequate athletic ability for position. Can slide and buy some second chances but lacks ideal foot quickness. Will never be a running threat.
Pro Day - Scripted his own workout and threw for about 25 minutes. He was very accurate in short and intermediate routes but missed a couple of long throws. Scouts said he worked out real well — was what you expected. Right now he ranks as the fifth-best quarterback in the draft. I would say if Minnesota, Seattle and Cleveland had their QB coaches there, they would think of him in the second round.
BRS (Gollin) - Once upon a time, there was this unspectacular dude who ran the Michigan offense efficiently but was drafted late. His name: Tom Brady. (Just sayin')
PFW Scout's Candid Comment: "I wish (Cousins) had more juice in his arm, but it's difficult not to like everything else about him."
Pro Football Draft Guide – He should stick as a backup, but Cousins’ poor decision-making should prevent him from earning a starting job
From nfl.com - Three-year captain, at Michigan State. Self-made guy, a tireless worker with deficiencies that could hurt his pro potential. Not a very strong deep thrower (velocity is OK, but his accuracy is questionable). Could get drafted based on his experience and intangibles, but will need to put on size and fine-tune certain throwing deficiencies to catch on at the next level. Has late-round value to a team as a potential backup.
Has all the intangibles to be an NFL quarterback . An accurate and safe thrower who knows how to pick his spots. A good athlete who can make plays on the run, but won’t run past many NFL defenders. Safe pick as a backup option. Widely considered to be a game manager type at the next level. Makes good decisions with the ball but has not shown he can make big plays to move the offense and win games. Will need talent around him to succeed.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - 39 career starts in a pro-style system and will be ahead of the learning curve in terms of understanding protections and making pro-style reads. Goes through progressions but doesn't always see the entire field and will lock onto target at times. Structurally sound / plays within the system. Will take his check downs / knows when to throw the ball away.. Will get into trouble trying thread the needle. Solid internal clock under pressure. Tough both physically and mentally. Will sit in the pocket and deliver throw knowing he is going to take a shot. Smart with a good feel for situational football. Fairly successful running the two minute drill with the game on the line.
Above-average accuracy when on schedule and throwing with good rhythm and timing. Adequate touch / can change up projections and ball-speeds to drop the ball into a window on intermediate throws. Can throw receivers open away from coverage. Accuracy will dip when he doesn’t set feet /not adept at consistently delivering accurate throws when offbalance. Will fall off throws throwing to his left. Deep ball accuracy is adequate but there’s room for improvement in touch and projection.
Over-the-top to ¾ release. A bit of a wind up but gets the ball out relatively quickly. Can make all the necessary NFL throws. Adequate zip on deep outs from opposite hash. But lacks (Matt Stafford or Joe Flacco) elite arm strength to stretch the field vertically.
Limited overall athlete. Moves well enough to buy time within the pocket. Can feel edge pressure and climb the pocket when needed. But doesn't always sense backside pressure and can hold onto the ball too long. Lacks elite ability to escape pressure and buy time. Will never be a running threat at the next level.
Pro Day - The early-entrant signal caller ran a 4.80 40-yard dash and had a 35 1/2-inch vertical jump and a 10-6 broad jump.
Pro Football Draft Guide – The Tim Tebow phenomenon has certainly opened a few minds when it comes to athletic non-passers under center, but Thomas is even further away than Tebow is. He seems like a practice squad body who could have the potential to contribute down the line under a creative coordinator.
From nfl.com - Passed up his senior year. Only a year removed from appearing in the national championship game, he had an extremely productive year. Has some intriguing aspects to his game and potemntially could be taken as a flier in the late rounds.
There is something to be said for being able to run such a high-tempo spread option offense like the one run at Oregon. Excellent game manager. Deceptively big and strong, and ( at 6'3" 215 pounds) has good size for the NFL. Room to add more weight to his frame. Can make quick decisions with the ball and is an accurate passer in the short to intermediate game. A threat as a runner and can get zip on some of his balls.
Must develop a quicker release. Although he releases the ball at a nice high point, he has a lot of wasted motions that delay the timing of routes. Often made easy, dump-off throws in cllege and wasn't relied upon to put the ball in tight spots. Not the open-field athlete that his pocket movements might suggest.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Comes from a fast-paced spread attack and has very limited experience taking snaps from under center. Must learn how to make reads while dropping. Can go through progressions with good tempo. Good poise in the pocket and cool under pressure but also has made some critical errors. Must be more consistent with his decision making and production while under pressure.
Inconsistent accuracy, but can make some difficult throws look easy at times. Good accuracy when he steps toward his target and transfers weight from back-to-front, but gets sloppy with his footwork and needs to become more diligent. Not a natural spinner. Does not get great rpm’s on the ball. Not accurate enough when throwing in the face of the pass rush. Must be more consistent with his touch on underneath throws; (tries to throw too many fastballs when touch needed). Will make tough throws when throwing on the run. Lacks ideal height and seems to struggle finding clean passing windows. Has too many balls batted down..
"Long, wind-up delivery a significant concern. Release is over-the-top but he’ll dip the ball down and take entirely too long to get from Point A to Point B. Overall arm strength adequate but not elite. Can get good zip on intermediate throws and can fit the ball into tight spots when he really gets his body behind the throw. Struggles to consistently drive the ball down the field but is capable of making all the throws so long as the ball comes out on time and he has room to follow through on delivery.
Quick feet. Generally feels pressure on time and is agile enough to consistently buy extra time. Good at resetting his feet. Will hang tough in the pocket and take the hit in order to buy time for receiver to get open. Adept at throwing accurately on the run. Average speed and elusiveness for the position, and is a better-than-average threat to run.
Pro Day - Put on a show, completing 67 of 73 passes on the day despite not working with any of his own receivers. Lindley is very smart and has good arm strength. He should be a fourth-round draft pick.
BRS (Gollin) - Not my favorite Cardinal pick. Wasn't impressed by his tendency to make mental errors in post season. Hope he proves me wrong.
Pro Football Draft Guide – His arm makes him worth a look, but Lindley has a ways to go before he can see the field. He’s a #3 with the potential to become a quality #2.
From nfl.com - Athletic signal caller with first-round physical talent (Strongest senior thrower in this year's draft, Can make cross-field deep out throws with ease. Athletic in his pass set /good at surveying the field for his second and third reads. Has problems in judgment / getsinto trouble with interceptions and poorly placed balls. Solely on his size and arm strength , Lindley could be selected in the late third round
He has a very lively arm and can drive the ball from anywhere on the field off his back foot. When he is having a good game, Lindley can thread the needle and put the ball on a receiver in stride 65 yards down the field. Athletic in his pass set and can extend plays / fend off would-be rushersA developmental talent who has value to teams who are willing to be patient with him. Could develop into a starter based off his size and arm strength.
But he has been inaccurate at times - will throw an NFL pass on one play, and then come back to make a bad decision and put his team in trouble on the next. Athletic but can be a slow mover and take sacks when he holds on to the ball too long. Most of his issues stem from his inconsistency throwing the ball on intermediate and deep routes.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Gunslinger who puts too much faith in arm strength and throws into coverage far too often. Inconsistent with his reads. Makes far too many questionable decisions, especially when pocket is collapsing around him. Tough and willing to hang in the pocket. Goes through progressions and Can manipulate coverage with eyes but has room to improve. Smart and picks things up quickly but film room work doesn't always transfer to the field."
Very good touch and timing on deep throws over the middle. Can put the ball where the receiver can run under it when throwing down the sideline. Can make tough throws look easy, but is far too inconsistent with his accuracy. Everything he does feels rushed. Struggles with touch throws. Tries to sling everything. Not natural at taking velocity off the ball. Does not do well when forced to change release points.
Over-the-top and quick release. Natural and relaxed follow through when footwork is sound. Arm strength a notch below elite. Puts the ball on a rope when throwing outside the hashes. Can thread the needle. Can stretch the field vertically and made some impressive throws on film. Can drive the ball vertically. Doesn't have to set or step into throw to put adequate zip on pass.
Pocket presence and mobility below average. Takes a split longer to set than most quarterbacks when dropping from under center. Senses pressure off the edge and keeps eyes downfield when stepping up, but not quick enough to get outside the pocket and can’t move well enough laterally to consistently sidestep pressure up the middle.
Pro Day - Moore was the winningest quarterback in NCAA history, but teams are concerned about his height and whether he will be able to make all the necessary throws in the NFL. After taking in his workout Thursday, most scouts think he might never be more than a very successful backup in a timing-based system.
BRS (Gollin) - Just for the sake of argument - If Joe Montana were to come out in 2012 (given the recent trend toward big, athletic, mobile &/or big-armed QB's), would he do as well in today's NFL then he did in his heyday?
Pro Football Draft Guide – A classic overachiever. Moore will stick in the NFL. But, with his lack of arm-strength, it’s tough to see him ever becoming a starter.
From nfl.com - Moore has been at the forefront of draft discussions for years (about whether his incredible accuracy and intangibles - as the undisputed leader for a perennial Boise State winner - are enough to offset physical limitations – most notably lack of size and arm strength). Look for a team to take Moore in the late rounds looking to bring in a strong leader, heady quarterback, and potential backup onto their team.
A strong leader / very poised in the pocket and under pressure. Quick pass set that is balanced and under control. Gets rid of the ball quickly and picks his spots effectively, although his release is slightly a 3/4 sidearm. Has all the intangibles and is a very accurate thrower both short and long. Understands route progressions and how to put touch on the ball. Will scan the field and locate his second and third options.. But he is just under six feet tall… struggles when throwing on the run and working outside the pocket…a very slow mover with his feet. Biggest knock on Moore is his arm strength. Often lobs the ball and puts touch on his deep outs and will likely be intercepted early in the NFL if he can't learn to drive it harder.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Cerebral QB who does an efficient job of orchestrating a pro-style offense. Great at getting pre/post snap reads. Diagnoses coverages quickly and has very good anticipation and timing with throws. Sound decision maker who can get through progressions and rarely forces throws into coverage. Understands the value of ball security and willing to take check downs. Holds a 99-19 TD/INT ratio through first three seasons. Arguably the most poised, efficient and effective QBs in all of football running the two-minute drill with the game on the line.
Throws a catchable ball. Very accurate with short-throws and rarely forces targets to adjust to the ball. Excellent touch /candrop the ball in the bucket with fade/go routes. Can change ball speeds and projection with intermediate crossing passes. Makes accurate throws off of back foot. But too often falls away with throws. Accuracy can also dip when he tries to drive the ball into tight window downfield.
¾ release. Lower release point combined with lack of height brings up concerns for batted down balls. But does an excellent job of changing release points when need be. Arm strength average at best. Will have issues driving the ball down field and ball can hang in the air on deeper out routes. Will have to rely on above-average anticipation and timing to be successful at the next level.
Lacks speed and elusiveness to be a running threat. But quick with great poise in the pocket. Naturally feels the rush and does a great job of maneuvering to buy time while keeping eyes down field. While he lacks height he does a nice job of finding throwing lanes to deliver throw. Can buy break contain and extend play outside of the pocket if need be. Must do a better job of keeping both hands on the ball to protect the ball inside the pocket.
Pro Day - Put on a show .Everyone is scared of quarterbacks who measure under 6-feet, but Wilson looked absolutely great. This guy whistles the ball. they say he only had four passes blocked at Wisconsin this past year — that’s outstanding for a short guy. His stock is rising.
PFW Scout's Candid Comment: "Wilson is as raw as can be, but I've warmed up to him. He's going to play in the league. He's really improved throwing the ball."
Pro Football Draft Guide – The combination of athleticism and arm will be enough to earn him a backup role and a chance to play in some special packages, but he’s a longshot to become a starting QB.
From nfl.com - Big-time question mark at quarterback. If he were three inches taller there would be debate at the top of the draft as to where he fits in A stellar passer with arm strength and accuracy when he is able to deliver the ball without a hitch. Outstanding football intelligence (picked up the Wisconsin offense as a NC transfer this past year and in so short a time became opening-day starter). But, given his short stature, teams will have concerns whether or not he can see over the LOS to make throws at the next level. A mechanical mover with strong technique and leadership qualities.. Look for teams to take a flier on him in late rounds to see if he can develop and outplay his size.
Accurate passer. Very mechanical - consistent in his drop -step and thoroughly understands how to move within the pocket and evade when the pocket collapses. Can torque his body to make any sort of throw on the run, and is accurate in doing so. A born signal caller with command of the offense. Has the arm strength to make the deep throws and the touch to put it on a receiver in stride. Effective when scrambling - a classic play extender. Short height will be his biggest problem at the next level (and the largest reason for his late-round value). It remains to be seen if he can throw effectively from the pocket at the next level.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Four-year starter who’s excelled in two different offenses and a leader for two different teams over the past two seasons. Above average awareness with a strong grasp of both offenses he's played in. But an inconsistent decision maker / size appears to play bigger role than mental makeup. Inability to see the entire field causes him to throw into coverage. While he occasionally gets rattled in the face of pressure, his poise is generally above average.
Will occasionally miss the strike zone / deep accuracy is especially inconsistent but timing is above average and can pound the strike zone when gets into a rhythm and has a clear sightline. Hits receivers in stride when gets a clear passing window. Accurate rolling right and left. But accuracy dips considerably when forced to throw from inside the pocket.
Pats the ball before starting his throwing motion. Gets ball out quickly once he's made a decision. Big hands for frame and can pump the ball without losing grip. Average to slightly above average overall arm strength.
Senses pressure. Can step up to avoid pressure off the edge though he can struggle locating receivers downfield when does. Can spin away from pressure. Freezes defenders with quick feet. As effective rolling left as is rolling right. A threat to tuck and run when gets a seam.
Pro Day - Ran a 4.30 40 (Ed Note - That forty time has to be a typo) and had a time of 6.88 seconds in the three cone. Keenum did 18 lifts on the bench and looked good throwing the ball. Keenum is one of the most productive quarterbacks in college football history, setting the record for overall passing yardage in a career.
Pro Football Draft Guide – Consider that many of the records he broke belonged to Hawaii’s Tommy Chang who never got close to an NFL roster spot. Keenum is a similar prospect. When you look past the numbers, he’s a borderline NFL prospect.
From nfl.com - One of the most highly productive quarterbacks in college football history. (If numbers were pure projections to the next level, Keenum would be the undisputed top pick). Unfortunately for him, his height might limit him as he moves to the next level. It's obvious that Keenum is an accurate and prolific passer working from inside the pocket. How that production translates to the NFL is the big question.
He had an ungodly amount of production while at Houston - a good, mechanical thrower who makes quick decisions within the scheme. Understands how to read defenses and pick his spots in zones. Accurate thrower who puts good touch on his throws to lead his receivers. Good at extending the play and working outside the pocket. But he’s an undersized prospect (will need to show he can throw effectively from the pocket. Could be considered the beneficiary of an effective, high-octane collegiate spread offense.
ESPN (Scouts, Inc.) - Played in a spread shotgun attack that runs a lot of screens and is misdirection heavy. Didn't always make sound reads after the snap. Put too much faith in arm strength and forced the ball into coverage too often. Can throw the ball away when situations call for it but is inconsistent in this area /takes too many chances in the face of pressure. (Took a 21-yard sack in the 2009 East Carolina game). Can scanned the field and check down when pass protection is sound. Will fight for yards after contact when scrambling.
Can lead receivers and hit stationary targets in the numbers but timing and footwork affect deep accuracy. Can be a quarter-count late delivering the ball and will throw behind receivers. Above-average touch but ball can also sail when attacking the deep middle.
Can get the ball out of hands in a flash but has a bit of a sidearm release and is vulnerable to getting passes tipped at the LOS. Seemed to grip the ball well in bad weather. Above average arm strength. Can zip the ball downfield and thread the needle.
Active feet and excellent pocket presence. Will step up or spin outside to avoid pressure coming off the edge. Can sidestep pressure up the middle. Keeps eyes downfield. Can pick up yards and extend drives with feet when nothing available downfield. Knee injury raises concerns here and ability to bounce back remains to be seen.
BRS (Gollin) - He'll have to pass a try-out before we actually sign him. Seems to be more a creature of the reputation of the Miami program than he is a legitimate pro talent. He'd logically throw to former 'Cane teammate and UDFA signee LaRon Byrd when he arrives in AZ.
Walter Mitchell (posting on ASFN) - 2011 stats: personal best 65% comp. 3rd best QB rating in ACC at 158.2 20 TD 9 int. He too is being brought in for a tryout. He burst on the scene three years ago when Mark Whipple became the OC---had a good sophomore year and then struggled quite a bit as a junior. Lacks the big arm you want---and doesn't scramble the way you think he could. But, he leaves Miami as 2nd All-Time in TDs (70) and yards (8,826).
NFL.Com - Harris is a player who will be under the microscope in the postseason draft process considering his history at Miami. Although he has started three years (plus two games as a true freshman, including the opener) and has experience quarterbacking at a high level, Harris lacks many of the key inherent attributes that make NFL quarterbacks successful, as he is thin and lacks arm strength. Harris could stand to put on size before expecting to step into an NFL pocket, as well as continue to develop his arm and accuracy. While there are knocks on his skill set, Harris is considered a gamer and could expect to be taken in late rounds by teams looking for a change-of-pace quarterback.
Harris' biggest strength is that he was able to start for so many games at Miami. He has led the Hurricanes on many late-game victory drives and had some productive outings. He is a good game manager and distributes the ball well both short and intermediate. He has shown a good throwing motion and touch on his ball.
Harris is thin for the position and could have durability issues. He can be sporadic with his throws and is not accurate throwing the ball deep. For his size, he should be more of a running threat, and he is effective mostly just out of the pocket.

Bankruptcy is a process provided by Federal law that allows financially distressed individuals to have some or all of their debts eliminated. There are two classes of bankruptcy: liquidation and reorganization. The two most common types of bankruptcy are Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 13 reorganization.
Chapter 7 is referred to as "liquidation" or "straight bankruptcy." It is used primarily by individuals who wish to free themselves of burdensome debt simply and inexpensively.
Chapter 13 or reorganization is designed for individuals to repay part or all of their debts, usually based on their ability to repay. It involves filing a plan with the bankruptcy court proposing how the debtor will repay creditors and debts. Some creditors must be repaid in full; others are only repaid a percentage of the original debt; others may not be paid at all.
The primary purpose of Chapter 7 and 13 bankruptcies is to receive a Discharge of Debts. This gives debtors a fresh start. The discharge has the effect of eliminating debts.

The Folio media stand designed by Giuseppe Bavuso is a freestanding unit that hides most of its storage at the back while the front features a sleek, curved panel that doubles as a TV stand. Behind it there’s a series of small shelves/ storage compartments for DVDs and other small objects. If you prefer something a bit more low profile, take a look at the NeXo cabinet. It has a simple and sophisticated design and comes with built-in speakers, a detail that increases the unit’s versatility, allowing it to suit living rooms and home theater’s alike.
Our enthusiasm for DIY projects involving Ikea products led us to explore a bit more the versatility of the Ikea Lack Table. There’s actually a whole series entitled like that and it includes a TV unit, coffee table, side table and some wall shelves. Today we’ll only focus on the tables, trying to find ways to integrate them into ingenious projects. Let’s start with a simple transformation. For this project you can use either a Lack or a Hemnes table which are both Ikea coffee tables. Get some wooden boards and cut them to size so you can make a tabletop. Stain them and measure the center of the table so you know where to place the first board. Clamp each end down and then add the others the same way. Glue and screw all the boards, turn the table upside down and put something heavy on the middle. Let it sit overnight, add more screws in the center of each board but on the underside so you don’t see them.
All over Italy, visitors stand gaping at the fluidity of the garments in classic statues. Similarly, it’s hard not to be astonished by the detail in these tables that Knibb has designed. You feel as if you will reach out and touch well-worn, soft fabric, yet instead your fingers meet with cool, solid marble. It’s as if opposites have morphed together into a single tactile contradiction.

Dubbed the ‘Year of the Condo,’ owning a piece of real estate in the sky proved the smartest bet last year, according to a new report released this morning.
Condos appreciated faster than detached homes in 2017, largely a consequence of the affordability and land scarcity crunches that have become particularly pronounced in the Vancouver and Toronto metropolitan regions.
The Royal LePage National House Price Composite, which looked at the fourth quarter of 2017, revealed condos appreciated 14.3% year-over-year, but that number jumped to 19.5% in the GTA, and just a hair higher to 19.6% in the City of Toronto.
“The condominiums are what I call the last bastion of affordability,” said Royal LePage’s CEO Phil Soper. “While they’re expensive in places like Vancouver and Toronto, they’re still much more affordable than detached homes.“
While land value is highest on detached lots, where demand is through the roof but supply is extremely low, condos aren’t bound by the same constraint because sky’s the limit, provided very tall buildings are funded and approved.
“With condos, because we can go up, we don’t have to have new land; we just need planning, capital and approvals from the municipal development boards,” said Soper. “Once we have that, we can go up and we’re not constrained by land affordability. Availability and affordability drove people towards condos in 2017.”
Claude Boiron, a University of Toronto lecturer on real estate investing, isn’t surprised. He says the Fair Housing Plan demobilized more expensive properties, namely single-family detached homes, often leaving people hamstrung by properties they’d just purchased and ones they couldn’t sell.
“The market for freehold properties in very hot neighbourhoods bottomed out very quickly, and then we had two to four months where people who bought a new home could not sell and were forced to hold a property,” he said.
“Anything under $700,000, which only leaves condos, more people were able to afford that than any other price class.”
Soper says ‘peak millennials,’ who are aged 25 to 30, are one of the largest demographical groups in Canadian history and roughly a third own their homes—mostly condos—but 30% will be purchasing over the next decade. Add another three to five years until they start families, and “you will see a huge opportunity to service these growing families,” said Soper.
“One of the most attractive investment sectors in Canada will be condominium properties focused on serving the needs of both young people, young single buying first home and young couples who are having their first child. Demographically, that segment is set to explode over the next decade.”

Making robotics accessible has been a career-long goal of mine. For many of the themes of this blog: all citizens should be empowered to use robotics (and computing) technology in their own work, and the fields of robotics and computing need to be informed by a diverse set of contributors. My class on Drones this Fall will continue this track of teaching and research.
Starting with some of my earliest work on using open-source software with robotics and then later with my work with IPRE on using robots in CS-1, I have been on a mission to make robotics more open, transparent and adaptable. My latest effort in this vein is embodied by the Calico Project. Calico is a learning environment for computing particularly suited for robotics.
Calico is about choice: choice of operating system, choice of programming language, and choice of programming context. The particular operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux) or programming language (e.g., Java, C#, Scheme, Python, Ruby) should not limit your pedagogical mission. Although Calico started as a way to easily program the IPRE Scribbler robot in Python on all three platforms it has evolved into a system that allows students to explore a variety of computing contexts (e.g. Processing-inspired graphics) with a variety of languages (e.g. scheme). We have extended Calico to work with other robot platforms like the Lego NXT and the Finch. Our next step, in the spirit of Pyro, is to use Calico as a front-end to the Robot Operating System (ROS).
Last week, we had a Calico summer research meet-up at Sarah Lawrence College. Part of this meeting was devoted to understanding how we could use ROS with Calico. A prototype system was presented that is able to control both the simple ROS turtle simulation, but also the Stage robot simulation, the iRobot Create, and the Parrot AR Drone. We are in the process of flushing out this interface and writing a proposal, stay tuned!

I hate to review books that I didn't like, but I console myself with the fact that it may serve as a warning to those who haven't read it. Or something-or-rather.
"Someday someday maybe" is a book that I really wanted to like, because, have you SEEN the cover? Oh so cute. If I'm honest, that MAY have been why I picked it up.
It was tolerable for the first 1/3 of the book. It was amusing for the first part. I kept hoping it would get better. A few swear words, but in this day and age that isn't so much of a shocker.
I won't spoil it for you (although I hope you won't read it), but things starting going downhill until I actually literally skipped to the very end of the book. I can't bear to not finish a book so having to skip ahead is major for me. Very weak and absurd storyline, and nothing more worth mentioning. I am aware I did just mention it, but that's not the point. Well, it is the point that I shouldn't mention it, but what I am saying is.....oh never mind. Also, too many unnecessary "bad bits."
Thankfully I got this from the library so it didn't cost me anything except my time. I know people that tend to buy books straight off the bat, and I do this if I know (like, really know) that it is going to be good, but I would generally recommend getting the book out first, and then you can buy it if you love it (I usually buy all my books from The Book Depository). And it's free! A whole place full of books FREE to read! How could you not?
In short, I don't want to be negative, and I hope I won't be doing too many more of these types of reviews. It is the most frustrating thing to get into a rut of bad books and just mope about, bobbing your tea bag up and down, wishing that the world would JUST GET ITSELF SORTED and produce some decent literature.
I like that you still wrote a review, even though you didn't like it! Now i'm really curious! I'll get back to you once I've read it myself :)
I was wanting to read this book, but wasn't sure if I'd feel it. (Plus, I've got too much to read on my Want to Read list.) It's good to write a review, even if you didn't like it.
The first thing that stood out to me was the price, and this was mainly because at the time I was juggling multiple subscriptions to several sites and had been feeling underwhelmed with the content I had. So when I saw how great the deal was, my ears perked up indeed.
Upon a closer inspection I realized that the models they use are absolutely stunning. Usually a dude is driving around picking up chicks off the street and they’re told they’ll be paid to fuck in this bus.
I mean, really, the best looking girls I had seen in the business. Well, come to find out, it’s actually a network pass, so I was actually able to cancel my other subscriptions, as I now have a huge variety of quality porn and for one low price. Usually they don’t end up paid and are thrown out of the bus when everything’s said and done.
The other way this happens is a sexy babe is picking up random dudes off the street and they’ll fuck her in the bus, sometimes leaving their girlfriends behind, only to be tossed out like a used piece of shit when those insatiable porn babes are done with them.

The star is called KIC 8462852, and it’s one of more than a hundred thousand stars that was observed by NASA’s Kepler mission. Kepler stared at these stars, looking for dips in their brightness. These very slight dimmings can be due to many factors, but one is if the star has planets, and one (or more) of them orbits the star in such a way that it passes directly in front of the star as seen from Earth. If it does—what we call a transit—we see a tiny diminution of starlight, usually by less than a percent.
Thousands of exoplanets have been found this way. Usually the planet is on a short orbit, so the dip we see is periodic, repeating every few days, weeks, or months, depending on the size of the planet’s orbit.
KIC 8462852 is a star somewhat more massive, hotter, and brighter than the Sun. It’s about 1,500 light-years away, a decent distance, so it’s too faint to see with the naked eye. The Kepler data for the star are pretty bizarre: There are dips in the light, but they aren’t periodic. They can be very deep; one dropped the amount of starlight by 15 percent, and another by a whopping 22 percent!
Kepler data show huge dips in brightness, up to 22 percent in the star. The bottom axis is days after an arbitrary date, and the bottom two panels are close-ups of the top one, centered near 800 days (left) and 1,500 days (right). The average amount of starlight over time is set equal to 1 for ease of display.
Straight away, we know we’re not dealing with a planet here. Even a Jupiter-sized planet only blocks roughly 1 percent of this kind of star’s light, and that’s about as big as a planet gets. It can’t be due to a star, either; we’d see it if it were. And the lack of a regular, repeating signal belies both of these as well. Whatever is blocking the star isbig, though, up to half the width of the star itself!
Since the 1990s, scientists have detected thousands of exoplanets orbiting distant stars, but the discovery…

Purpose of this paper: To demonstrate how traditional definitions of family, in the context of employment, have not kept pace with actual family formation in the U.S. and much of the rest of the world, and how this disadvantages individuals from atypical (i.e., non-nuclear), but increasingly common, families. Design/methodology/approach: A wide range of literature from disciplines spanning industrial relations, gerontology, management, and family studies is invoked to illustrate how employers’ definitions of “family” are often incompatible with actual contemporary family structures, and how this poses difficulties for employed individuals in non-traditional families. Findings: Many family structures are not accounted for by employment legislation and thus organizational work-family policies. These include same-sex couples, multi-generational and extended families (e.g., including parents or other elders; members from outside the bloodline or with grandparents providing primary care for grandchildren) and virtual families. Practical implications (if applicable): We discuss a number of problems associated with current provision of work-family policy and practice among organizations, and recommend that governments and organizations expand upon the traditional definition of “family” to better enable employees in a variety of familial configurations to successfully balance their work and family demands. What is original/value of paper: This paper identifies current failings in employment legislation and suggests improvements so that both governments and organizations can better facilitate employees’ work-life balance. As such, it will be of use researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers interested in the interface between work and family. Keywords: family, legislation, work-life balance, work-family policies, diversity

adidas J Wall 3 |/ 3 Crazy Explosive adidas | 088f006 - asiabandarkiu.online So you want to start bass fishing? July 1, 2015 by fishingva
I was lucky enough to have a father that was a pretty serious fishermen who showed me the ropes when it came to tackle and equipment needs as I was starting out at a very young age. Many of you are not lucky like I was. All too often I see people that would really love to get into fishing especially for bass but become very frustrated and give it up because they are improperly outfitted. Because of this I decided to try and share some of the knowledge I have gained in my 28 or so years of fishing and write something on the needs of a fishermen trying to get into bass fishing.
The first thing a person who wants to get into bass fishing will need to do is get themselves some rods and reels. As a beginner my advice is to keep this as simple as you can. I know you will see many seasoned vets, myself included, out there with a whole boat load of rod and reel combos but since you are just starting you don’t need to go that far. I would suggest you do the following:
1) Decide how much you are willing to spend but don’t go overboard. You can buy quality reels for around $30 dollars and quality rods for around $30 – $40. These reels will be good enough for you at this point, by no means garbage, and will easily serve you as you are learning to love the sport. It won’t make sense for you to spend the big dollars on rod and reels right now because frankly I don’t think you would be able to notice the difference and appreciate them with a beginners skill level. Be patient buy the good stuff when you are good enough to really judge what you want.
2) Get yourself one Spinning reel. Look for a reel that will hold an ample amount of 8-10 pound test line. Usually these will be in the 30 or 3000 series of a reel for example I use Quantum, Catalyst 30PTi reels that will hold 160 yards of 8 pound test. Have the reel spooled with 8 or 10 pound monofilament line. Do not skimp on the line. This is the one area where as a beginner you need to spend money. Cheap line will make your life a nightmare with tangles and broken knots, etc…
4) Buy yourself a decent casting reel. I prefer low profile design reels but you will have to make the choice of low profile or round body yourself. In bass size reels you usually won’t have to make a decision on the line capacity for a reel. The one thing you may see are different retrieve ratios. Common ones are 6.1:1 or 5.2:1, what this means is the rate at which the reel brings like in. A 6.1:1 reel will bring in line quicker than a 5.2:1. Since you are a beginner go with the 6.1:1. I believe it will be the best suited for your needs. On the casting reel line with 10 to 14 pound test monofilament. See my comments above about cheap line.
6) Once you have your rods and reels practice your casting, especially with the casting reel/rod combo, in your yard or any open area. Nothing will be more frustrating to you than trying to learn to cast while on the water where there are lots of things for you to snag. I am not going to go into the details of casting a spinning reel or casting reel as there are plenty of places to go to find that out. I will however pass on this piece of advice on setting up your casting reel before you cast. On the reel there is a cast control knob, usually located behind the handle. This knob controls the spools ability to spin freely. To adjust this tie on whatever you are going to cast then hold the rod tip up a little. Click open the reels spool release. Whatever you have tied on should begin to fall. If it does not then loosen up the cast control knob until it does. If it does then proceed to the next step. To set the knob right let your lure or weight to fall to the ground if the spool continues to spin once the lure hits the ground then tighten the knob slightly. Continue to do this until the spool allows the lure to fall freely but then stops as soon as the lure hits. Set the knob like this and it will help you avoid, not eliminate, some of the backlashes you are going to encounter.
Now you have your rods and reels and they are all lined up to go, what kind of tackle do you need? As with the rods and reels keep it simple. Usually as you fish for bass more and more you will find techniques and tackle that you will like to fish more then others and you can specialize your buying toward that. Right now since you are just starting it is a little harder because you really need to cover quite a few bases to find out what you like but still keep it simple. Essentially lures can be broken down into a few categories:
You need to attack this like the old daily food group thing where you were supposed to have items from each group.
As far as Jigs for a beginner I would not go there. Jigs are great for catching really big bass but in general you will not catch nearly as many. Since I am writing this for a beginner my biggest concern is to suggest what will catch more fish.
You will need hooks for rigging your softbaits. Get yourself some 3/0 worm hooks they will cover your needs for now.
The above selection is obviously not all inclusive but I think it would definitely give you a good selection of items to get you started on the right track.
Now you have your rods and reels, where can you go to learn how to fish for Bass? Your lucky in that aspect. This sport has taken off and because of the there is just a wealth of information out there. Here is what I would do.
1) Search the web, there are plenty of sites, like mine where you are reading this article, that can provide you great info on how to fish for bass. A few notables are: Bassdozer.com, Bassresource.com, BassBoatCentral.com, Bassfishingusa.com. These sites provide info. For all levels of bass fishermen. Also most of them have forums, as does this site fishingva.com, where you can interact with other fisher persons. Do not hesitate to go to the forums and ask your questions? That is the beauty of bass fishing, most of us will help another out without question. Don’t hesitate to try and get to fish with some of the people you meet on forums. A lot of more advance anglers like to help new fishermen out so take advantage of that.
2) READ. There are a lot of books and magazines out there that cover Bass fishing topics. As a beginner I would tend to go more to books. The magazines are great but cater more to advanced angler. If you do go for magazines some of the ones that are not bass fishing specific may be better for you as a beginner as they will cover things more general. Check out Field and Stream, Outdoor Life, and mags like that.
3) Go to your local tackle shop and talk to the people there. One thing about us bass fishermen is we love to talk about out sport. Take advantage of that and go pick the brains of your local experts.
4) Watch fishing shows on TV. I know it may seem like watching paint dry but you can learn a lot from doing this. What you need to do is make sure you watch the shows with the mind set of you are going to learn. Really pay attention not only to what the people on the show say but also to what they do. You can learn just by seeing things like how they cast, etc…
That is all I have for what you need to do to get started. Check back on the site often as I will be adding tactics whenever I can and one last thing….
No matter where you’re fishing think in terms of “breaks.” A break is something different. A dropoff is a “break.” So is a log in the water. Both will attract fish. A log that has fallen on a drop-off is a “break on a break.” Even better.
A “break” can be anything. A place where two types of grass come together. A place where the shoreline changes from big chunk rock, to gravel, or gravel to sand. You get the idea. The bigger the change the better, but the more subtle they are, the less likely they are to have been seen by other fishermen. Fish relate to these places the same way you relate to road signs. They tell them where they are, and how to get where they’re going as they migrate from deep to shallow and back. A long flat area of mud for example doesn’t give a fish anything to relate to, but if you put a couple of stumps on that same flat, suddenly the fish have a “hangout.” These are the kinds of places you’ll be looking for with your electronics, your crankbaits, your Carolina Rig sinkers.
When fishing a lake, a good tip is to observe the terrain around where you’re fishing. Try to imagine what it looked like before they flooded the lake. Is the land around flat? If so it’s probably flat out under the water too. If it’s steep and drops off suddenly, the same thing probably extends under the water. A gully above ground is probably a ditch under water. If you see that the shoreline changes from pea gravel to chunk rock, you can figure that it extends out into the water also. Watch for those types of places as you fish.
When fishing a river, remember that current is another key. Think of current as wind. In cold weather, you want to get out of the wind. Fish are no different. In cold weather they like to get out of the current so that they don’t expend any more energy than they have to. In the summer it’s just the opposite. Moving water is cooler than standing water. Fish seek out current then. Current is also a break. Anyplace where the direction and speed of the current changes, or where two currents meet is a potential hotspot.
In tidal rivers, the same thing applies, but the water runs both ways. Outgoing tide pulls water and nutrients out of areas and into the main river. As the water falls, baitfish and other forage are forced out of their hiding places. Bass and other predators will “gang up” anywhere the water runs out of those areas. Where a creek meets a channel, where a feeder creek meets a creek, and so on down to a place where you see a trickle of water no bigger than a pencil running across a flat. Baitfish will come out and hold right along the waterline. The predator fish will usually be right on the first breakline waiting for forage to make a mistake and wander over the deeper water. Sometimes they won’t wait, they’ll run up into the shallow water and break up the schools of bait.
Incoming tide has the opposite effect. Baitfish can move back up into the flooded areas and scatter. This makes it much harder for the predators to find them. The predator seems to understand that hunting is tougher at this time, and they tend to “shut off” during incoming. You can find some places where baitfish are forced to congregate, and if you find one, you can bet that predators have already found it too.
The best techniques I’ve found for incoming tide is to simply put your trolling motor down, and cover ground. Fish can still be caught but you have to work harder and cover more area for them. I like to find pads or grass, and throw something like a rattle trap or a buzz bait. Make lots of casts, always casting up the current and bringing your bait back “downstream”. Keep your boat pointing into the current so the current won’t carry you along so fast that you can’t control the boat. You want to be able to turn your trolling motor off, and have the boat drift back from the area you’re fishing, not drift over top of it.
The spinner bait has to be one of the best and most popular bass baits out there but when I watch people fishing them I often notice that they are not getting the most out of them. It seems to me to many of us just get hung up in the easiest way to fish this bait which is to just straight retrieve it at a constant fairly rapid speed in shallow water over weeds or around other cover. You will catch fish this way but probably not as many as you could. In order to have more success you have to start to think out of the box. Next time you are out and you feel like a spinner bait might be what you want to fish try doing some of these:
Really the name tells it all. To slow roll a spinner bait just retrieve it at the slowest possible speed you can where you still can feel that the blades are working. What this does for you is allows you to work the bait on or really close to the bottom. This tactic can be deadly when used over deeper weed beds or if you have found some deep structure such as hump.
Instead of just retrieving at one speed mix it up. As you reel the bait in speed up and slow down your retrieve as you go. A lot of times the fish will hit as you speed up. It must trigger an instinct that the bait is getting away or something. Anyway if you think about this it makes sense as if you watch bait they rarely are swimming at one constant speed.
You can do this technique combined with any of the above. Just add a yo-yoing motion as you go through your retrieve. To do this as you reel you can drop your rod tip down. Then as you continue to retrieve lift the rod up this will cause the bait to rise and fall as you retrieve. I have found this works really well combined with a slow roll over deeper water.
Do any of the above retrieves or combination of retrieves but every once in a while just stop and let the bait flutter down. You can vary the amount of time you let the bait flutter to very short to long enough to let it come to rest on the bottom. When restarting your retrieve just give the rod a quick pop upward to get the blades spinning again and then continue on with your retrieve. This works really well when you are retrieving past cover like stumps, retrieve until you are near the cover and then “kill it” and allow it to flutter down along the cover. I know someone who employs this tactic and who catches some real hawgs by doing it.
Rather than going with one of the retrieves above you can actually jig it. Cast then allow the bait to fall all the way to the bottom. Then sweep the rod up quickly. Then slowly reel in retrieving line until the bait flutters back to the bottom. Just keep repeating until you bring the bait all the way in.
There are really infinite possibilities you can employ when fising a spinner bait. Just use your imagination. That is what makes this such a fun bait to use.
Anybody ever use Charlie Brewer Slider worms? This is a technique that will help you catch more fish, and help you learn more about fishing at the same time, than anything else you can do.
For those of you who don’t know, a Charlie Brewer Slider worm is more than just a lure. It’s an entire method of fishing. It is probably the original “finesse” style of fishing. It’s simple, it’s inexpensive, and it catches fish. What more could you ask for?
You’ll need some simple tackle, most of which you probably already have. A med to med light, or I’ve even used an ultra light spinning combo, but I recommend a medium action rod actually. Whatever length you’re comfortable with, and a reel to match. Spool it up with 6 to 10 lb test line. I use 10 lb BPS Excel most of the time.
Now you’ll need to get your hands on some Charlie Brewer slider worms and the slider jig heads. I know you can get them at Greentops, but most well stocked tackle shops should have them. Go ahead and get the bags of 20. You will find them packed 4 to a card, but they’re a rip off that way. Get the bag. Then pick up some slider jig heads. I prefer the 1/8 oz “Super Slider” head. It looks like a Texas rigged worm rig, with the sinker molded to the hook. That’s really what it is. You rig the worm up “Texas” style so it’s self weed-less, and cast it out.
Now is where the fun part comes in. You just reel it back. That’s all. You don’t hop it, you don’t bump it, you DO NOTHING but reel it straight back to you, holding the rod at about the 10 o’clock position. You can’t reel it too slow. That is the key. Reel it so slow you think you’re going too slow. When a fish bites you, you’ll feel a weight. Just keep reeling until the slack is all out of the line, then set the hook with a snap of your wrist. You don’t need to “cross his eyes” or “jerk his lips off”. The little slider hook is very sharp, and of course you should have made sure it was even sharper. (right?) Make sure your drag is set properly, (Personally I tighten my drag down and back-reel, but most people will do better with the drag)
Give this a try. I think you’ll find it a very effective method. You will hear that “Sliders don’t catch big fish”. There maybe some truth to this, the biggest I ever caught on a slider was 6 lbs, but you will not find a better method to catch numbers of fish.
This is a technique that was taught to me by a fellow Virginia Bass fishermen, Wayne Purdham. Wayne and I both fish Briery Creek Reservoir quite often and this is a tactic that works excellent there.
First off, in case you don’t know what a wacky rig is let me give a quick description of that technique. The wacky rig has been around for quite some time (some say since the 70s) but has recently gained huge popularity with the advent of soft stick baits as the technique works especially well with them. The basic wacky rig is quite simple. All you do is take a soft plastic bait such as a soft stick bait, or finesse worm, and hook it through the egg sac like in this picture.
To fish the wacky rig all you do is cast it to the location you expect fish to be holding on like a grass edge, stump, dock, etc… and allow it to sink to the bottom. Hooking the bait like this causes the bait to have a unique wobbling motion as it drops which just slays the fish. Quite often the fish will hit the bait on this initial drop so be prepared. If the bait is not hit on the initial drop to the key is to work the bait slowly. Pick up the rod tip ever so slightly to raise the bait off the bottom and then let it drop again. When it drops to the bottom patience is definitely a virtue here as many times the fish will pick the bait off the bottom after it has set for several seconds. I have had days where I have let the bait sit as long as 30 seconds although most days between 5 and 10 seconds will suffice. Continue to work the bait as long as it is still near the cover you wanted to fish. For docks and stumps this may only be a few short lifts and lowers. If you are fishing a grass edge or weed edge or open water channel, etc…you can work the bait all the way back to you.
Now what is the weed-less wacky rig. Essentially it is the same rig and is fished the same way. The difference lies in the type of hook used and how it is placed in the worm. It is really an improvement on the normal wacky rig that addresses to flaws. The first flaw is that baits rigged wacky style can be hard to keep on a hook as the soft plastic tends to tear when hooked this way, you will go through a lot of baits using this method. The second flaw is that the rig will get hung up on weeds and other debris fairly easily as the hook point is exposed, even with wire guard weed-less hooks this seems to be a problem. The weed-less wacky rig solves these problems quite well. So how do you set it up?
Take a hook and insert the point into the worm at the front of the “egg sac”. Thread it through the “egg sac” and bring the point back out on the back end of it. It will look like this picture:
Now continue to pull the hook through the worm until the eye of the hook is just about into the worm. At this point rotate the hook 180 degrees so that the hook point is pointing back towards the worm body. Then continue to pull the hook through the worm so that the eye becomes imbedded in the plastic of the worm. To finish push the point of the hook into the worm. I prefer to push it all the way through and then back it into the plastic. The finished rig will look like this:
I use Gamakatsu’s Octopus hooks in sizes 1/0 to 3/0. Any similar hook will work. I also find that the new red colored hooks i.e. “bleeding bait’ seem to work really well.
I generally prefer to fish my weed-less wacky-rigs weightless as the slow fall seems to be what tantalizes the bass. There are some case when I will add weight though, like if it is a little windy. To add weight use finish nails or a “nail” weight. You can insert it into the end or ends of the worm and fish it that way. If you want the weight to fall a little bit head down add weight to the front of the bait. If you want to maintain the “flat” fall then add weight to both ends. The picture below shows how to insert a weight.
Monster blue catfish that is. If you are interested in landing some really big citation fish, year round, blue cats on the lower James are your ticket. According to the VDGIF, in 2004, only 3 citation large mouth bass were reported from the lower James. In contrast, 995 citation blue cats were reported. So many in fact, that on January 1st, 2005, the VDGIF raised the citation weight/ length requirement from 20 Lbs, 34 Inches to 30 lbs, 38 inches. There are still plenty of fish in the 30 lb plus range, with 60 lbs not uncommon and a whopping 83.5 lb fish caught in late 2004 . Blue cats were introduced into the tidal James River in the mid 1970’s. Some fish biologists believe that under the right conditions, blue cats can live 30 years. That would put those 1975 fish at there biggest ever right now. That all being said, I will share with you my tips and tactics on catching these huge fish.
One of the best things about cat-fishing is, you don’t have to spend a lot on tackle. Just buy good quality at good prices. Start with a 6′ 6″ Medium/Heavy rod. Use round, level wind, bait-casting reels. The kind designed for heavy fresh or light salt water fishing. Shakespeare and Okuma have never let me down and they are very reasonably priced. Spool them with Berkley Big Game 30 lb test. It has very good abrasion resistance and chances are, you’re gonna need that. Now just Carolina rig it. I use a 5 oz. weight on a big snap swivel that has the plastic tube slider to protect your line from chaffing. Use a glass bead and then a good quality 1/0 or 2/0 barrel swivel. Then tie on about 2 feet of 50 lb mono leader and an 8/0 Gamakatsu circle hook. I only use Gamakatsu circle hooks and that’s because they work so well. With the heavy line and tackle, I can’t tell you enough how important it is to make sure that you have perfect knots. Without going into the art of knot tying, suffice it to say that nothing’s worse than losing a good fish to a bad knot. It’s happened to me, learn from my mistakes.
The first thing to do is forget about every kind of catfish bait and catfish bait system you have ever seen in a fishing department. Yes, dough balls, stink baits, dip baits and the like work fine if you want to catch eating size cats in a pond or reservoir, but that’s not what we are fishing for here. We need big fresh bait for that big hook and the big fish. Are you starting to see the pattern here? If you want to catch big fish you have to fish for big fish. I have caught small fish on big bait, but I have never caught big fish on small bait. The best possible bait to use is fresh shad from the river. There are plenty of them in the barge and spray pit areas of the James, but you wont catch them on hook and line. They are mud feeders with small mouths. You need to be able to throw a cast net with some proficiency or know someone who can. You will want to net whole fresh shad in the 8-12″ range. Next, scale them, and expose the brain to maximize scent. Cut them in half, using the head for one 4-6″ bait and the tail section for a second. Now, if you don’t have access to a cast net you do have a couple of other options. You can go to a bait store and buy a few of the biggest eels that they have, then cut them in 6″ lengths and butterfly them open to present a big bait. You can also just stop by a fresh seafood store like B&B Seafood and buy several of their biggest, fresh, whole white perch. They are cheap and if you tell B&B that its for bait, they will usually even knock the price down a little more. Fish the perch just like you would the shad. The last citation caught in my boat was on white perch.
Blue catfish are big river fish. You wont find many above the James fall line or in ponds or lakes. Big, deep, reservoirs are an exception. Blue cats are active and will bite year round. In the heat of summer the biggest are often caught at night. The rest of the year, any time is a good time. I’ve had my best month in December and in the middle of the day. You don’t have to be out at the crack of dawn for these fish. I fish the lower James river from Dutch Gap landing down river to the Jones Neck loop area and all in between. Its close to home and all the fishing grounds I need.
For a couple of years, I made two very big mistakes trying to catch trophy size fish. One of the mistakes I made , and one I still see cat-fisherman doing, is to look for the deepest hole you can find on the river and sit on it for hours waiting for a big fish to come by. The second mistake I made was using bait that I thought was big enough, but the fish didn’t. I learned from experience.
Now that you have your tackle and bait, lets fish. Instead of deep holes, we are looking for current breaks. Think a little like a bass fisherman. A 60 lb fish needs to get behind something to break the current while it waits for dinner to come by. Look for favorites like old wing dams, blown down trees, bridge or dock pilings, sunken barges and creek channels into the river. All will be relatively close to shore and you will probably be fishing no deeper than 12 feet. Anchor up current of the cover, within casting distance. Cast out as many rods as you can handle, in a fan pattern, as close to the up current side of the cover as you can. Place them in rod holders and engage the reel with the drag set at around 10 lbs. When the catfish smells the bait he will swim up current to find it. Once he picks it up, he will turn with the current and head straight back to cover. Don’t pick up the rod yet. Let the rod load up and do the work. This loading will set that circle hook right in the corner of his mouth. Now grab the rod, crank down some more drag and try and keep the fish out of the cover he so desires now. Do not give the fish any slack line, as they can sometimes dislodge the hook if you do. Now be ready with a big net and hopefully you have your citation. A couple of more pointers, when you get a big cat near the boat, they often dive, or roll. Be prepared. If your fish of a lifetime does get back into the cover, branches, logs etc., don’t give up. Remember you are using heavy line and tackle. Try pulling, try giving, try moving the boat around, or just do nothing for a minute or two. I had one wrapped in a downed tree for 30 minutes once before it finally came up. And lastly, don’t fish a piece of cover for more than 20 minutes. If a big fish is there, they will let you know pretty quick. Usually within the first 15 minutes or so.
And finally, if you are new to big cat-fishing, I hope this will save you some of the countless hours it took me to learn it. Good luck out there!
Jig fishing is a tried and true method for producing big bass. In general you will not catch as many bass jig fishing as you will with some other tactics but for some reason the quality of the fish the jig will produce is usually better. There is just something about the the jig that gets the big ones to hit. This is one reason that you will find jig fishing as one of the mainstay tactics that anglers targeting trophy fish will use.
Oddly enough, even though most bass fishermen have heard of jigs and most bass fishermen would love to catch that “trophy” bass it seems that the majority of fishermen have never ventured to try them. I was one of those fishermen until recently. I had always heard of how great the jig was for producing big fish but it also seemed like there was some mystique to the bait. It just came across to me as a hard to fish bait that a lot of pros and hardcore bassers were able to catch fish on but not one that was that great for the average weekend basser because it would take too much time to learn how to fish. How wrong I was. Through good fortune I was able to hook up with two fishermen that fish a jig quite often. Watching them fish the jig while I fished my soft plastics I learned a lot most importantly that it really was not that hard to do. Anyway I decided to try it for myself and now I am sold. I am so sold that I decided to do this tactics page just so others might become inspired to try to fish the jig themselves and see how great this bait really is. Now to the good stuff the info on jigs.
First let me start with a quick description of the bait. The jig is a very simple bait. In a nutshell it is a lead headed bait that has a skirt of feather, hair, rubber or silicone on it. Depending on the method you fish and the color you fish it will most closely resemble a minnow or crawfish.
Usually A jig will be fished with a “trailer” of pork or rubber. The trailer just adds a little more movement to the bait and helps to make it look more lifelike it can also affect the sink rate of the bait as it adds bulk to it. A lot of people ask about the differences in materials for the trailer. A lot of what you use depends on personal preference but here is a quick summary of both.
Pork: More lifelike feel to it. Very traditional bait. May have a more natural look to it. Very durable to fish.
Rubber: More colors available. Can use trailers that are bouyant to adjust the sink rate of your jig more than you can by just adding bulk. Come in wide variety of shapes and sizes.
I’ll start with the easiest and move on to what I perceive as harder methods. Really all jig methods are relatively simple. It is just that some will require you to be able to make specialized cast such as flipping, pitching, and skipping.
The easiest method I have used. Essentially all you do is cast out. Let the bait sink to the depth you desire and then retrieve. A few things to note. First when swimming a jig it is very useful to have an idea of what depth you are fishing the jig at. You can of course let the jig sink all the way to the bottom and then retrieve it so that it stays close to the bottom but quite often I have used this tactic to target bass that are suspended somewhere off the bottom. The first thing I do everytime I tie a jig on is determine how long it takes for that jig/trailer combo to sink. I generally try to find a depth of around ten feet. I then pull a lot of line off the reel while holding the jig in my hand. When I am ready I will throw the jig into the water. As soon as it hits the water I will start counting 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004, etc… I can then use the count that it took to reach bottom to reasonably predict what depth my bait is at. For example if the bait takes 10 counts to reach the 10 foot bottom it will be somewhere around 5 feet after 5 counts and somewhere near 15 feet at a 15 count etc…This is useful because lets say I am marking bait on my LCD at 12 feet I know how long to count before beginning my retrieve every time I cast. From the example below i would simply cast, as soon as the bait hits the water begin counting and when I hit 1012 start my retrieve. How to retrieve for swimming can vary quite a lot and will be determined by what the fish want. The basics are to just straight retrieve the bait, straight retrieve the bait but vary the speed as you do so the bait slows and speeds up intermittently, straight retrieve while pumping the rod up and down slow the bait moves up and down in the water as you bring it in, and finally to use a stop and go retrieve where you reel the bait then stop and let it sink for a 1/2 second to a second and then retrieve again.
The simplest method for fishing a jig. Simply cast the jig out and let it sink all the way to the bottom. Then work it slowly back along the bottom. You can just straight drag the jig, or drag the jig and hop it every once in awhile by giving your rod tip a short jerk up.
Flipping or Pitching a jig is probably the most popular method these lures are used. Flipping and Pitching are specialized casting techniques that I will at some point try to explain in another tactics page. For this article I will assume you are familiar with these casting methods and just explain how to use a jig with them.
Jigs are especially useful flipping and pitching lures because they are probably the most weedless lures you can fish if you fish a jig with a weed guard. This makes them great for fishing pockets in heavy weed cover. All you have to do is work weed areas and look for pockets or cover that you feel may hold a fish. Then simply flip or pitch your jig to the area and allow it to sink. Many times you will get bit on the fall. In this type of fishing bites often are subtle so be a line watcher. If the line moves side to side or stops sinking before you thought it hit bottom, strike. When fishing cover like this you just don’t have the luxury of allowing the fish to move off until you are sure so strike early just in case it is a fish. If you did not get struck on the initial fall you can shake the bait a few times on the bottom to try and draw a strike. If no fish hits just retrieve and move on to the next likely spot.
The weed-lessness of the jig combined with its weight also make it very useful for flips and pitches to trees whether they be upright in the water or laying down or just a stump. Fish them the same as you would in a weed pocket. The big advantage with these baits is that while others may get hung up on braches and never make it to the targeted fish the jig with its high weight to relatively small size will usually be able to get down where the fish are.
Skipping like pitching and flipping is a casting technique that I will at some point try to explain in an article. Jigs are especially useful for skipping because of the high weight to small body size. Use jigs to skip under branches or bushes that overhang the water or skip them under docks. Then you just have to use one of the previously described methods, I usually opt for crawling and hopping it.
Because of the way you will fish this lure it is usually best to use a high strength line. For most applications line in the 12 – 20 pound test class are preferred. I will generally use a low stretch line so that I lose nothing in my hook set. I have recently been using flouro-carbon lines a lot because they are less visible than others.
The type of reel you use is kind of open to personal preference. For me I use three different types depending on what I am doing. If I am swimming a jig or crawling and hopping a jig I will use one of my high speed 6.1:1 ratio casting reels. In the open water that I usually fish these methods the high speed retrieve seems to be best. If I am flipping or pitching I will switch to one of my lower speed casting reels 5.2:1 ratio. Since these methods are in heavy cover and I am usually relatively close to the fish I am targeting I find the winching power of the slower speed reel to be better. Finally if I am skipping a jig I will go to a spinning reel. I just find that for skipping I have a lot less hassles with spinning gear.
For swimming and crawling I use a Medium Heavy Casting rod, 6 1/2 feet, Fast Action. This rod gives the best combo of castability and fish fighting. For flipping and pitching I jump up to a Heavy Casting Rod, 7 foot, Fast action. This gives the most accurate rod for this technique while giving me the backbone to get fish out of heavy cover. For skipping I use a medium spinning rod, 6 1/2 feet, moderate fast action. This gives me enough whip to give me good skipping speed on the lures whiel still allowing me enough backbone to get fish out from under bushes and docks.
When December rolls around many of us in Virginia just pack up the fishing equipment, winterize the boat, and hunker down to hide from the cold but that can be a mistake. One of the great things about our state is that there are some great opportunities for fishing through the winter, and I don’t mean through a hole in the ice like some of our neighbors to the north. This article is intended to point out some of the more prevalent winter fishing opportunities out there in our state and maybe inspire you to try and get out and catch yourself some fish rather than sit on the couch waiting for spring.
The tidal portion of the James River below Richmond offers excellent prospects for those fishermen that venture out on winter days. Available species to catch are Blue Catfish, Striped Bass, Largemouth Bass, Crappie, Bream, and even the occasional Smallmouth Bass.
These months are the time to catch the giants. On most bearable days you are sure to see the catfish guides and catfish die-hards cruising the river around the Dutch Gap area, barge pits, spray pond, and all the way down to the Appomattox looking for one of those giants. Preferred tactics are to find deep holes or deeper areas with cover in them and fish live or fresh cut eels, shad, or herring on a large circle hook rigged below a fish finder rig and heavy (4 – 8 oz) weight.
Fishermen will hit most of the same areas the cat-fishermen will be in, even using most of the same baits. There are two major differences in the tactics though. First for Stripers most of the fishermen seem to like to suspend the bait below a float rather than pin it to the bottom with a heavy weight like in cat fishing. Second while cat-fishermen will anchor in a spot, fish it for around a half hour, and then move on to their next spot, those fishing for stripers will often drift fish to cover a lot of water in search of their quarry.
The key for largemouth bass is to look for areas of the river where the current is slower then anywhere else or look for places that have warmer water then the bulk of the river. Popular spots are the barge pits near Dutch Gap, and the Spray Pond at the end of the old River Channel in Dutch Gap. These areas are warmed by the discharge from the Dominion Virginia Power Plant so they stay a lot warmer than the main river areas. Also check out any of the many “pits” areas on the river, you can find them on any good map of the river. These “pit” areas are not nearly as warm as the first two areas but due to the openness of them and their relatively shallow, slow flowing waters, they tend to warm from the Sun more then the rest of the river so they can be good place to target, especially on sunny days. Many tactics will take fish in the areas mentioned, try slow rolling a Spinner-bait around deeper structure and cover, or fish the same with a crank-bait. My personal favorite is to pitch a jig or creature bait into cover and work it real slow.
Crappie are found in most of the same areas the large mouths are. I have actually caught several near citation and citation class fish on my offerings to the largemouth. Other than that use typical crappie baits, small shiners on floats, small jigs and spoons, etc…
Buggs Island can mean good wintertime fishing for Blue Catfish, and Striped Bass, also Largemouth Bass and Crappie can be had if you can locate the deep-water haunts they are in right now.
For Blue Catfish, try fishing fresh cut bait around channel drops near the middle portion of the lake. Also channel drops on some of the bigger creeks like Rudds, Grassy, and Bluestone can be good areas to look. The fish will concentrate on deep holes in these areas so use your fish finder or graph to look for them. When you do locate concentrations of fish drop your baits down on fish-finder rigs with 2 – 3 oz weights and 7/0 or 8/0 circle hooks, remember Buggs is where the current 94 ½ pound state record Blue comes from so be prepared for big fish.
For Buggs winter Stripers, the area around Clarksville seems to be where good concentrations of the line siders will roam. Trolling live bait rigs or buck-tails around the mouths of some of the creeks can work well or you can always use the time proven method of looking for a flock of birds feeding on the water surface. If you do encounter birds feeding try to approach the area as stealthily as possible, you can then cast buck-tails into the area where the feeding is going on. Allow the buck-tail to sink a few feet and then use a jigging retrieve and hang on.
Look for deep-water structure along main river channel bends where there are quick changes in depths or on some of the various bridge piles. Fish these areas with bait or small jigs for crappie or with Jigging Spoons or C-rigs for bass. This action will be sporadic so don’t get discouraged if you don’t catch fish every trip.
Wintertime on Lake Anna means two things. Great striped bass fishing on the main lake and very good largemouth fishing on the “warm side” of the lake.
On Lake Anna your tactics are going to be basically the same as they are on any of the lakes in our state where you can catch stripers. You can drift live bait on float rigs in areas you have found schools of baitfish or you can look for the tell-tale feeding birds and then cast buck-tails or swim-baits to the area to try and pick off a few of the feeders. Look for stripers to be in the upper end of the main lake around the “splits”.
On Lake Anna you can catch them on the main lake during the winter if you target structure on areas where there are good quick drops like along old channel edges. Fish these areas with slow presentations like a jigging spoon or c-rig and be prepared to not catch anything as this is some tough fishing. That said you can catch good numbers of fish on Lake Anna if you are lucky enough to have access to the private “warm side” of the lake. The warm side of the lake is comprised of 3 cooling lagoons that are used to cool the heated water that is discharged from the Dominion Power North Anna Nuclear Plant’s reactors. The water in these lagoons is significantly warmer then in the rest of the lake, which can make for some awesome wintertime fishing. For example a friend of mine and his partner, on a recent January outing, caught 40 largemouth in the 1 ½ to 2-pound range. That is just awesome. As for tactics a lot of things will work on these fish as the water is so warm so don’t be afraid to try out your favorite tactic.
Many of the Old Dominions smallmouth rivers can provide good smallmouth fishing in the winter. The James, New, and Shenandoah, are good places to try out. Keys to this winter fishing are to first try to get to them after we have had a several day warming trend. The warming does not need to be huge, just a few days of slightly warmer weather can have an impact on the water temp and put the fish on the feed. Second look for areas of the rivers that are deeper. There are many pools on these rivers that will run 10 feet or more deep and these are where the fish will concentrate. When you do have the right conditions and find the right spot try slow rolling a spinner-bait, or working a tube or jig on around and available structure.
The James is not Virginia’s only Tidal River that can have some good winter fishing although it is the best. You can also try the Pamunkey, Mattaponi, Rappahannock, Nottoway and Potomac for wintertime bass and catfish.
For catfish fish the same as you would the James, look for deep holes, especially those with structure or cover and drop your lines.
For bass fishing on the Pamunkey, Mattaponi, and Nottoway try to get to the river after a few day warming trend then fish slow with jigs, c-rigged ringworms, and slow rolled spinner baits. You will usually be able to pick up a few largemouths on these rivers. Also if you fish up closer to the fall lines on these rivers you can catch smallmouth bass that have moved down from the upper reaches of the river for the winter. On the Potomac and the Rappahannock fish them just like the James. Look for back areas, bays and flats that have warmer water then the main river and then fish them slow.
Hopefully this article has shed some light on the many opportunities that await the Virginia fishermen during the winter. Now go out there and try some of them out and as always be safe and tight lines.
The following are prohibited on this property: swimming, open air fires, trapping, trotlines, littering, sailboats, camping.
The current fishery supports a healthy population of largemouth bass due in part to a 12 ? 15 inch protected slot limit in effect since 1990. The slot limit was imposed to allow harvest of ample numbers of largemouth less than 12 inches and still provide an opportunity to catch quality fish. Good numbers of largemouth bass in the one to three pound range are abundant with a few bass in the seven to ten pound range caught occasionally. Growth rates for largemouth are very good compared to the state average with most fish reaching catchable size at age 3 and growing out of the slot limit just after age 6. The spring spawn is the best time of year to catch a trophy-sized fish. Spinnerbaits, plastic worms and crankbaits are best suited for bass from April until early June. During the summer months and on into the fall, jigs work best when working deep water where fish congregate these times of the year.
Bluegill and redear sunfish offer anglers in the spring a fantastic bank fishing opportunity. Spawning fish congregate in the spring on the shoreline along the dam where they are easily accessible. There are abundant numbers of both species weighing up to ? pound and the number of larger fish has been increasing over the last several years. This trend is expected to continue. Overhanging trees and submerged structure offer the best cover around which to find either of the sunfish species. Live bait, jigs and small crankbaits are the best lures for catching in the spring and summer months.
Black crappie and channel catfish provide fishermen with a good change of pace when fishing. Numbers of crappie in the lake are low, however the average size of those fish is excellent. Small minnow plugs and live minnows are the best bet for catching these tasty fish. The catfish fishery is sustained by stocking fish every year. Natural reproduction is not successful enough to maintain good numbers of fish so the department releases about 15 fish per acre each year.
I’ve fished quite a few rivers across Virginia and if I had to choose a favorite, I’d have to pick the Nottoway. Actually, if I had to pick a favorite fishing spot, lake, or river, I’d pick the Nottoway. Sure, there are places where you can catch more fish, places where you can catch bigger fish, and places that may be a bit more scenic, but if you like catching fish, with some variety in sizes and species, plus have a little scenery tossed in as well, the Nottoway is worth checking out.
The Nottoway River is located in south central and southeastern Virginia. The river’s length is approximately 130 miles. It begins in Prince Edward and Lunenburg counties and flows southeasterly, forming a boundary for Nottoway-Lunenburg, Brunswick-Dinwiddie, and Greensville-Sussex counties, then meanders across Sussex and Southampton counties to its confluence with the Blackwater River at the North Carolina line, forming the Chowan River.
Above the Route 619 bridge on the Greensville-Sussex County line, the river is generally shallow, clear and fast flowing. There are numerous small rapids that prevent the use of outboard motors and large boats, but canoeists will find some nice float trips. Below Route 619, the river slows, deepens, and darkens as numerous swamps in the Coastal Plain join it. This part of the river, particularly in Southampton County, is large enough for bass boats during normal flows.
For anglers, the river’s fishery could also be divided at the Route 619 bridge. The upper river has numerous redbreast sunfish, smallmouth bass, and Roanoke bass. Below the bridge, bluegill, largemouth bass, black crappie, and channel catfish are more common. In the spring, anglers can catch blueback herring, American shad, striped bass, and white perch migrating upstream from North Carolina.
The fun part of fishing the Nottoway is you never know what you might catch. In one season of sampling fish and angling on the river, I saw 51 different species of fish. It’s not unusual to catch six or eight different species of fish on a given day on one lure. If you want to have some fun, switch lures and baits a couple of time and see how many species you can catch in a day. Every time I fished the river with someone, we ended up having a contest to see who could catch the most species, the most fish, and the biggest fish. The Nottoway is that kind of river. It’s not really a place for trophy fish seekers or those wanting to bring home dinner, though you certainly could. It’s the kind of place where a couple of fishing buddies can have a good time catching and releasing a wide variety of fish. The numbers aren’t bad either. If the water’s clear, you can shoot for catching a hundred fish in a day.
For anglers who don’t have a boat or can’t find a canoeing partner, there’s always wading. The Nottoway can be a great river to wade and fish in the summer and fall. You might want to avoid wading in the spring, because spring flows are typically a little strong, and the river can get muddy after a good rain. In the summer and fall though, the river is typically low and clear. Head for one of the bridge crossing accesses along Rt. 40, or better yet, head up to the Rt. 619 ramp and jump in! On a hot July day, nothing beats standing waist deep in a cool, clean river, catching Roanoke bass and smallmouth bass on an ultra-light rod. If you go wading at the Rt. 619 ramp, don’t worry if the water seems too cold when you step in. You are actually feeling the little spring creek that flows in next to the ramp, which is a lot colder than the river. Once you venture a few feet out into the river, the water’s perfect.
The Nottoway River is a four-season fishery. With its southeast location, the winter isn’t too server on the lower river, and anglers can catch some nice fish. Winter is a great time to fish the lower Nottoway River around Courtland for one pound and larger Roanoke bass. Find the deeper holes and fish on the bottom with small, live shiners. In recent years, a greater number of striped bass have been caught in the winter around the Rt. 258 bridge. To catch these angler favorites, use larger minnows, shad, and jigs.
In late February or early March, depending on water temperature, American shad, hickory shad, blueback herring, and alewife migrate upstream into the Nottoway on their annual spawning run. Southampton County is a good fishing spot early in the run, but most of the bigger American shad head upriver into Sussex County to spawn in the faster flowing water there. Peter’s Bridge Landing (Rt. 631) is a good place to launch a boat and drift shad darts and small spoons for shad. White perch and yellow perch also run up the river in the spring and can provide some good angling. Hungry striped bass will follow the shad and herring schools upstream and add some excitement to a quite day on the river. By late spring, largemouth bass and redear sunfish are active in the backwaters downstream of Courtland and are targeted by many anglers. The lower Nottoway River is an excellent location for one-pound plus size shellcrackers. Lily pad beds along the shore and in backwater sloughs hold some of the bigger fish.
The summertime offers good fishing throughout the river, but anglers will typically head either further upstream or further downstream depending on their preferred species. As the river gets warmer, many species will head upriver to find cooler, flowing water, while other seek out deep, quite pools in the lower river. Around the Fall Line, waders and canoeists can cast small spinners and floating crankbaits to entice smallmouth bass, Roanoke bass, and redbreast sunfish. Downriver, where channel catfish are biting well, bluegill and bass fishing can still be good. Longnose gar school in the pools and can be caught easily on live minnows. Gar will also hit slow moving surface lures in the summer. Fishing in Sussex County is especially rewarding at this time of year because you can catch a little bit of everything.
In the fall, fish will be fairly well distributed throughout the river. Water levels can be low and fish will have found the deeper pools to hang out in. The lower river provides better action as the water cools and fish start moving down to their winter pools. Basically, Nottoway fishing works on a cycle. Start the year far downstream; follow the shad upriver in the spring; go further up for the summer; and then come back downstream as water temperatures fall again.
There are a half dozen paved ramps and about a dozen canoe access areas along the Nottoway, providing boaters and anglers with a wide variety of float trips. There are more access sites and more water in the lower river. The upper river is sandy and shallow, so it is more suited to wading than boating. The first public boat access on the river is at Nottoway Falls on Route 49, south of Crewe (downstream of the Fort Pickett military reservation, the river is deeper and rockier). Canoes can be launched at Rt. 613 and each bridge downriver (except I-85) in Dinwiddie County. In Greensville County and further downstream, there are more public ramps and parking areas for anglers and boaters to enjoy the river. Give the Nottoway a try and I’ll bet it becomes on e of your favorites too. The scenery is nice and the float is very easy. The river is deeper here than upstream, so anglers can use small motors to cut the float time, allowing them more time to fish the good spots. This transition area from the fast flowing waters upstream and the slow, swampy areas downstream provides anglers the chance to catch a little bit of everything.
Richard Cockett, author of 'Blood, Dreams and Gold: The Changing Face of Burma', gives a talk about how drug abuse is rife in Myanmar, at a gripping talk during the Asia House Bagri Foundation Literature Festival
It’s been swept under the carpet but drugs have ruined large parts of the regions in Myanmar where the ethnic minorities live, according to a recent book.
In Blood, Dreams and Gold: The Changing Face of Burma, The Economist correspondent Richard Cockett explores how the drugs trade is intertwined with political issues and ethnic minority conflicts in Myanmar, how it is supported by the police and ethnic militia and how farmers get drawn to growing opium poppies as they make far more money from that, than, for example, growing tomatoes. He also claims that the drugs trade is inexorably linked to the peace process and has to be solved for that to be successful.
The book, published by Yale University Press in 2015, covers the country from the colonial era onwards and explains how it descended into civil war with successive military regimes and then why it started to reform.
It is based on hundreds of interviews he conducted in Myanmar after the country started to open up in 2011.
“When I first went to Burma*, it was a closed military dictatorship but I slipped in as a tourist, with fake documents and I snatched conversations with members of the Opposition in cafes. It was evident that things were changing.” he said.
“In March 2011 Thein Sein was appointed as the new president,” Cockett said. “He met with Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released from house arrest at the end of 2010, and established a good rapport with her,” he added. She soon reinstated her NLD party which had boycotted the 2010 elections. Sein sped up the reforms process, freed hundreds of prisoners and began peace talks with ethnic minorities, as well as pressed for the lifting of Western sanctions, he explained.
“This book is part a reflection on the changes and how far they will go and two thirds of it is a historical reflection on the country’s past, how it descended into a military regime which ruined the country and how it will be a very tough task to reform it now, even though Aung San Suu Kyi has come to power,” he said.
The title of the book is taken from a poem written by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda about colonial-era Rangoon (now Yangon) when it was the country’s capital.
“That is when Myanmar was at its height – one of the most prosperous counties in the Empire and Southeast Asia. One aspect of the decline of the country is drugs,” he explained.
His talk during the Asia House Bagri Foundation Literature Festival was about drug taking in the Kayin, Mon, Shan and Kachin states of Myanmar, which is covered in one chapter.
“I always thought there were much greater geo-political issues like democracy and human rights, but the more I travelled, especially in the East of the country, the more it became clear that drugs were an enormous problem and for the people themselves, the biggest problem they face,” he said.
“Many of the people I spoke to said that more people have died from drugs than have died from civil conflicts and warfare over the past decade. It’s certainly the biggest social problem interwoven with all the political and economic problems that have to be resolved if the country is to be at peace,” he added.
According to Cockett, the Karen Hills area, once a thriving economy in the Shan and Kayah States in the east of Myanmar, is now ravaged by drugs. He said it is estimated that 80 per cent of people in the Karen Hills area are taking or selling drugs.
The drug of choice in Myanmar is yaba (a Thai nickname meaning ‘crazy drug’) – a methamphetamine – originally a drug given to horses to make them work harder which can be injected, inhaled or swallowed as a tablet. Most of the pills are produced in the eastern Shan region and over the border in Thailand. The pills just cost US$1 to US$3. Many steal to fund their habits, including from their family.
A doctor he features in his book tells him that the police know all about it but take no meaningful action. “The doctor said that everyone, the police, armed groups, local militias, professional drug dealers, make money out of selling yaba. So they all have a vested interest in keeping the drugs going. Some of the dealers are occasionally arrested but it’s just for show, said the doctor. And the reason why so many boys and girls turn to yaba, or even heroin? The young have no future, no jobs and so nothing else to do. The effect of yaba is to repress feelings and emotions, enough, at least, for frustrated, bored and disconsolate Karen youth to get through the day,” Cockett said, reading from the book.
“The consequences can be devastating. There are social, political and economic consequences. The authorities are very compliant in protecting the drug dealers,” he said.
Richard Cockett reads an extract from a chapter on drug abuse in Myanmar in his book ‘Blood, Dreams and Gold: The Changing Face of Burma’
The book also contains an interview with a 24-year-old Kachin recovering addict, which Cockett read out.
“I started taking drugs aged sixteen. My friends used them and I had no job, I was addicted to heroin and yaba for seven years. I was an only child; I stole money from my parents – maybe 30,000 – 40,000 kyan each time (US$30-$40)….The police are the guards for the drug dealers…every day the police, two or three of them, would stand by the drug dealer to protect them, and the dealer gave money to the police in turn..I had five or six friends who have died of drug overdoses..they were 20 or 21 when they died, ” he said, reading from the book.
“It’s a crazy drug and people get psychotic on it and even beat up their friends or family on it,” he told those attending the talk. “All the people involved in conflicts in Burma are protecting the drug dealers as a source of revenue for their conflicts against the Burmese government. So many people have come to rely on the drugs trade and the profits of drugs to fund conflicts. This will make ending the conflict very difficult as it’s intertwined with drugs revenues in ethnic states. Why would farmers grow tomatoes if they can make so much money from poppies?”
In 1985 Myanmar produced more opium than any other country in the world. Then Afghanistan replaced Myanmar as the biggest supplier of opium in the early 1990s.
“This is partly due to the drug eradication programmes carried out by the military government of the time,” he explained. “They tried to eradicate opium because it was such a big problem,” Cockett continued. “To a degree they managed it but by 2012 it was rising again. In 2013 poppy cultivation in Burma rose by 13 per cent on the previous year to 143,000 acres – well over double the total acreage in 2006. Now the industry is worth US$5040 million a year. In 2013 Afghanistan and Burma produced 18 per cent of the world’s opium supply,” he stated.
He said there was a huge demand for drugs in Southeast Asia and China. Trade routes going out of Myanmar around the world were increasingly being used to supply drugs as well. Half of China’s registered drug addicts are in the Yunnan province, near the border of Myanmar, he pointed out. “The borders are porous and it’s very easy for the drugs to get into China,” he said.
“Yaba has become very popular in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos and elsewhere in Southeast Asia but nowhere near as high a proportion of people consume it as they do in the Kayin, Mon, Shan and Kachin States,” Cockett told the audience.
He said there was “a complete absence of government social structures” so there were no government-funded rehabilitation programmes in place to counter drug abuse.
The government did “not have the incentive” to help, he said, so it was left “largely to self-help groups” and even vigilante groups. “Some groups have been set up by well-meaning individuals such as a Christian women who lost her son,” he explained.
“Aung San Suu Kyi has made it a priority to continue the peace process to end the conflict between the army and the ethnic people. However, rarely is anything said about drugs and how inexorably linked drugs are to solving the problem,” he said.
“This is a problem that the West should know more about. It will have a huge impact on relations between the central government and regions like Shan and Han because so much of their land economy is built up doing this. The solution is to end complicity with the local police. Central control flows down from the capital. If the local areas had more local ownership they could start to do something about this problem. If they were given control of the police force they could do more about it. Vigilantes are trying to control it because no one else is doing anything. Once the economies of the states recover, as you create more employment, demand will go down for drugs. These states are trying to build their own economies and tourism is an obvious option. They need to give the young less need to turn to yaba. Unless people take back control and own the problem nothing will be done,” he said.
He added there were many projects afoot to increase transport links in ASEAN and create more free-flowing inter-state markets which “is all fine on paper but it makes it much easier for drugs barons to shift stuff more quickly to other markets.”
When asked whether there was drug-taking in places like Yangon, he said it was much less prevalent and more behind closed doors but it did go on. “I have not spoken to anyone whose family has not suffered in some way. The Burmese just see it as a problem of the ethnic areas, not a problem for the Burmese,” he said.
* Burma calls itself Myanmar as do many other countries, but the British Government continues to refer to the country as Burma. Internationally both names are recognised.

We have been faithful customers of Sprint for over 10 years. We had been mostly happy and quite satisfied with the customer service provided by their representatives, until recently. Sprint representatives today make verbal promises over the phone that do not last for even six months. Although representatives are warm, polite and helpful, the base of their poor and dishonest service doesn’t change.
Wonderful and polite reps will create an atmosphere of trust. They will lie to you to keep you as a faithful customer, while providing a future that will leave you wondering why you didn't just go to a discount store for your cell phone. After-all, the service and quality will be the same for almost all customers.
In fact, wireless service goes across the same towers and has all opportunity as your provider allows over their service.
Having been an internet service provider during it's youth, I know that cell service is no different. Bandwidth or services can be open or limited. Other than bandwidth, Comcast was a great limiter of services such as email, news servers, web servers and others, but yet charging customers for full service at a specified bandwidth.
Fooling customers, for the purpose of profit without integrity, is the norm. And yes, our government eliminates competition... but that's another subject for another day.
After hours on the phone with Sprint, absolutely nothing is offered or have changed. Sprint offers no compensation or even only a $0.10 per month discount. After nearly 15 years as a customer, I'm finished. To have NO cell phone, I'll exist.

Croatian head coaches Davor Rokavec and Iva Kanjugović and captains of Croatian teams Ivan Jurić and Kristina Smiljanić participated at the official press conference ahead the Beach Handball European Championship. Guests spoke about the preparation period and their expectations at the EURO.
Croatian men’s team is current European champion and they will do their best to win the fifth European title in a row. „We always want to win a gold medal and this time as well. Preparation period was short, but I am satisfied. I would like to thank the guys from other clubs who were selflessly coming to train with us every day and they were our sparing partners. I think we are well prepared for the Championship”, head coach Davor Rokavec said.
Men’s team captain Ivan Jurić believes that Croatia will qualify into the main phase of the competition with the maximum number of points. His opinion about Croatian opponents in the group is: “The first match will be against Serbia, which is a very good team. Then, we will play against French team who was excellent. On Wednesday, we will compete against Switzerland. The last matches in the group will be played against Norway and Ukraine, teams that should not be underestimated”.
Captain of Croatian women’s team, Kristina Smiljanić is optimistic ahead of the European Championship. “I think the Spanish team who are current champions is the biggest favorite. We played friendly matches and were better in every game. If we will play the way we have agreed, I believe we can pass the group at least to place second”, captain Smiljanić said.
Croatian men’s team is allocated in the group with France, Norway, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine, while women’s team will compete against Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. The first game, seniors will play tomorrow, 20th of June at 10 am against Serbia, while the women’s team will open the competition with Italy at 12 pm.

Leadership development expert Jack Zenger wrote a provocative piece in Forbes, titled, “Change Your Leaders To Change Your Culture.” Here’s the opening.
“How would you describe the culture of your organization? Some might say, “It’s the smell of the place,” or, “It’s how things are done around here.” Research done on culture and organizational performance by Kotter and Heskett defines culture as “…gained knowledge, explanations, values, beliefs, communication and behaviors of large group of people, at the same time and same place.” They concluded that differences in culture explains why one company succeeds where another fails within an industry. Consider Apple versus Blackberry, or Target versus Kmart. It wasn’t just the strategy that determined the success of the company, it was the culture. The ultimate summary statement on the topic may have been Peter Drucker’s familiar saying, “Culture eats strategy for lunch.” However, culture can’t remain stagnant. As the economy and each industry changes, company culture needs to be constantly adapting.”
Your leadership development program is the carrier of your culture. The program is the one place in most companies that brings together leaders from all over the company. It’s the place where senior leadership can speak directly to leaders who will return to work and become the most powerful influence on their team’s culture.
If you want the changes you encourage in your leadership development program to take root in day-to-day operations, there are some things you should do differently. You should train your leaders to understand how change happens. You should bring leaders together more often, so they can support each other and share tips and ideas for change at ground level. You should make sure leaders can access information on culture change and the culture you want to create.
Culture change will never be easy. But your leadership development program can help make sure the right changes happen.

Then on Saturday I decided to bring Bella to a secret place to have our brunch that I made a reservation beforehand. Took us about 30min to reach our destination after changing 1 bus service.
Left: Our theme for the day is sporty couple! She wearing my shirt though (can you guess the event of the shirt?)
Right: Tada reached the place. Its the good old Thomson Plaza where most of us went to after our Secondary School X-Country at MacRitchie (memories~~ hur hur)
For the price of $20 per head (dim sum buffet), I wouldn't say its not worth it. However, there isn't much variety there. I just ate the usual har gao, siew mai, chee joing fan, deep fried pork. Worth a try.
After our nice lunch, we stroll around thomson plaza that we have not been to after we left our secondary school. The usual interior is still the same but with an extension behind. A nice walk to digest our food, we proceeded to take a bus down to Suntec. Thankfully there is a direct bus service from thomson plaza to suntec. Never mind the long journey (45mins) because we think that its a luxury to sleep after a heavy brunch/lunch. Bella "dunno sleep until where" (if you get what I mean).
We reached Suntec at around 6.30pm. Knowing that we have booked a show at 9.10pm, we decided to walk around Suntec to kill time. It was really meant to be a "walk-around" just to kill time but we ended up with quite a number of "hoots" that we were happy about.
I went into several sports shop just to take a look at soccer boots as my current one kept giving me blister and bloodclot perhaps due to the tightness. Some of the boots are dirt cheap ($20+, $30+). Unfortunately, they do not have my size.
Then I went to the Royal Sporting House below and tried 2 boots. I bought the white one, its Nike Tiempo Air Legend II if I'm not wrong.
Our eventful day ended with the movie Terminator Salvation at Marina Square. It was really nice and strongly recommend you to watch it if you are Terminator fan (duh...). Again, blessed with a central location with superb transport link network, we took a direct bus back to my home where we have a short nap (again).
P.S I just got back from my Sunday morning soccer with my new boots and I think I bought half a size bigger :(
Good news for those who are still pursuing studies in the western part of Singapore. (NTU, NUS, SIM, NP, SP etc) PublicTransport@SG had extended their free to use real-time SMS bus arrival notification to 31 Dec 09.
Tensions between US, South and North Korea are getting tighter (ok I know I should not have write "South and North Korea" together). Will we finally witness the long hatred between N.Korea and S.Korea been brought into the military battle fields?
SEOUL - NORTH Korea said on Wednesday it was abandoning the truce that ended the Korean war and warned it could launch a military attack, deepening tensions two days after testing an atomic bomb for the second time.
The strongly worded announcement came amid reports the secretive North, which outraged the international community with its bomb test on Monday, was also restarting nuclear fuel work that could make plutonium for an atomic weapon.
Defying international condemnation, the regime of Kim Jong-Il said it could no longer guarantee the safety of US and South Korean ships off its west coast and that the Korean peninsula was veering back to a state of war.
'Those who have provoked us will face unimaginable merciless punishment,' the statement on the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, blaming Washington and Seoul for the latest turn of events.
The North's anger was provoked by the South's decision to join a US-led international security initiative, established after the September 11 attacks, to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
South Korea joined the so-called PSI after the North Monday carried out a second nuclear bomb test which was far more powerful than the first test in October 2006.
The PSI, which includes more than 90 nations, provides for the stopping of vessels to ensure they are not carrying weapons of mass destruction or the components to make them.
'Any tiny hostile acts against our republic, including the stopping and searching of our peaceful vessels... will face an immediate and strong military strike in response,' the North Korean statement said.
It said its military would 'no longer be bound' by the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean war - in which the United States fought on the side of the South - because Washington had drawn Seoul into the PSI.
With no binding ceasefire, it said, 'the Korean peninsula will go back to a state of war.' The North has taken an increasingly harder line with the international community in recent months, testing a long-range rocket in April, several missiles over the past few days and its second-ever nuclear test on Monday. -- AFP
Had a stomach flu on Sunday night at around 1am. Recalling the food I ate on Sunday, I had fishball noodle and oyster omelet with Bella for lunch and chicken curry, fried prawn and fish for dinner with her family. I guess I might have missed out some vege and fruits for the day which results in stomach flu.
Recalling one of the night in my Army days when I had a similar encounter that I could not sleep all night due to the continuous pain, I went to see the MO (Medical Officer) in the morning. He diagnosed that I have suspected appendicitis and sent me to the hospital A&E. There, my pain actually subsided quite a fair bit but the symptom for appendicitis was still there. Apparently, if you press and release your bottom right stomach, the sudden release will cause a sharp pain; thats a symptom for appendicitis. So, I was still warded for a good 2 nights as a guinea pig for those young doctors. I actually looked like the fittest patient Tan Tock Seng Hospital ever have because I move around freely and eat freely and I was not displaying any single sign of distress at all.
Left: The things that accompanied me during one of the night. A Real Estate book by one of Robet Kiyosaki's mentee, a mp3 player, TV remote (ya my ward was shared among 3 others and each of us have a TV) and a phone to call Bella!
How bad is this stomach flu? Its even worse than the above one but however I was not warded, thanks to the second doctor I visited where he gave me the medicine to ease the pain; the first doctor only gave me the medicine for to get rid of the stomach "wind" and help with the "digestion". But the horrible torturing is due to the pain instead. Hence, I was left to suffer for the whole afternoon thinking the pain will ease after taking both medicine. My condition did not improve and I was groaning all day.
Eventually, I went to see the doctor again and then asked for a jab and some painkillers. With Bella's TLC and feeding me dinner, I ate about 4 spoon of porridge (cooked by my sister, no need to guess the taste hahaha) before trying to sleep. I tossed around as the pain prevented me from doing anything, even sleep! Somehow or rather, I managed to fall asleep and by the time I woke up from my 2 hours nap, the pain subsided and I was a free man again! (free to do anything).
I am a guy who seldom visit doctor for any illness unless its a severe one. Ever since i was enlisted into Army, I had 3 major illness. Time to take good care of my body!
N.B. Oh did I mention that Newcastle lost the match to Aston Villa when the whistle blew at 1am. And it was the match that caused my beloved Newcastle to relegate to Championship next season? Is there a correlation? hmmm....
THE final moments before Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student David Hartanto Widjaja fell to his death were captured on a mobile phone by a fellow faculty mate.
Fourth-year electrical and electronic engineering student Lin Zhenxing was waiting for the lift with a friend, Mr Liu Yan, when they spotted Mr Widjaja - alleged to have stabbed his final-year project supervisor, Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk, during a meeting - sitting on the rooftop of a link bridge three floors below them.
Mr Lin whipped out his mobile phone to record Mr Widjaja through a glass window, for about eight seconds, before he called campus security using the phone.
While both men were making calls, Mr Widjaja allegedly pushed himself off the rooftop, falling four storeys to his death.
It was screened in court yesterday at the fourth day of the coroner's inquiry into Mr Widjaja's death on March 2.
A total of 10 witnesses - including NTU staff and students, Mr Widjaja's online 'wife' and a forensic expert - took the stand.
It was also the first time Mr Widjaja's family, who had flown in from Indonesia, viewed the footage.
The footage was grainy and shaky and showed Mr Widjaja sitting by himself on the rooftop of the bridge, first looking down and then to his right - before the clip ended. His legs, shorts and T-shirt were seen to be covered with blood.
1.) Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.
2.) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means half an hour. "Five Minutes" is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.
3.) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with "Nothing" usually end in "Fine". (Refer back to #1 for the meaning of "Fine".)
5.) Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about "nothing". (Refer back to #3 for the meaning of "Nothing".)
6.) That's Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can make to a man. "That's Okay" means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.
8.) If you say so: Men, take note: this is a trick. This is THE statement that means the opposite of what it says. When a woman says, "If you say so," she actually means, "you're an idiot; I can't believe I ever married you, and you better realize how lucky you are every day of your miserable life." She will then issue forth a loud sigh (see #5), and assign you a task worthy of your limited intelligence (although you will NOT be given the "five minutes" as discussed in #2).
10 .) Don't worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking "what's wrong", for the woman's; response to be "nothing" ( refer back to #3 for the meaning of "Nothing") .
NANYANG Technological University (NTU) student David Hartanto Widjaja turned up unexpectedly at his professor's office on March 2 morning, after avoiding him for a week to discuss his final year project.
He was supposed to see Associate Professor Chan Kap Luk on Feb 26 morning together with several other final year students but he didn't show up. Prof Chan then moved the meeting to the next morning but this had to be rescheduled to 2pm that day as the professor was engaged with two other students that morning. Widjaja did not come in the afternoon.
Three days later, he walked into Prof Chan's office at 10.25am. What followed was an exchange which ended in Prof Chan, 45, being stabbed and the 21-year-old electrical and electronic engineering undergraduate falling four storeys to his death from a bridge.
Prof Chan who was Widjaja's project supervisor, recounted the moments leading to attack on that fateful morning in his conditional statement when he took the stand on Thursday on Day Two of a coroner's inquiry into the Indonesian student's death fall.
He told a packed courtroom that Widjaja came to his office on March 2 morning, saying he wanted to discuss his final year project. Widjaja then produced a thumb drive, claiming his work was stored in it. Prof Chan had problem running the programme on his computer, which showed nothing. To which, Mr Widjaja insisted that he had indeed done the project.
During the exchange, Prof Chan noticed that Widjaja's voice was turning shaky. Moments later, when his back was turned against Widjaja, he felt a blow on his back. He spun around and saw Widjaja wielding an 18-cm knife coming for him. Prof Chan said he tried to block with his arm and fell to the floor.
He said Widjaja attacked him again but he managed to grab the knife, breaking the blade from the handle. A struggle followed, during which Widjaja fell back and hit a metal filing cabinet in the room.
The professor then tried to run out of the office but was blocked by Widjaja. He managed to push Widjaja aside and ran towards the students' graduation office a few metres away. While being tended to by staff, Prof Chan said it was then that he realised that he had been stabbed in the back by Widjaja.
The professor suffered a cut on the tendon of his right index finger and needed five stitches for the wound on his back. He was given 20 days' medical leave.
Prof Chan said that as he was running away from Widjaja, he glanced back briefly and heard the Indonesian student shouting from the door way that he blamed the professor for the whole incident.
He said he did not know what happened to Widjaja as he was rushed to hospital, and only found out he had died from the news.
But I am not happy at all because 2 of the papers are killers i.e. new type of questions came out which are different from the past 3 years. Really caught many of us by surprised and hopefully they would do some moderation, if not there might be a similar failure rate as CFA papers!
Anyway, since there are not much use crying over spilled milk now, I shall concentrate on my deserved break (Just feel that UOL exams paper is really #)($&#$)(&#, most of the papers are a test on your English and understanding of the concept as a whole. This means that even if you study diligently throughout from beginning to end of semester, you would still lose out to a smart guy who chiong in the last few weeks and who managed to interpret the question correctly because he has a better English language!)
Enough said about the exams. Trying to work towards to be a principle-minded person, I shall forget about my exams and concentrate on my holiday! So many things are waiting for me; swimming, jogging, soccer, a whole list of books, and maybe learn a few more dishes!
Few weeks ago, I sent out more than 20 resumes for a 3 months temp job but to no avail. NO ONE called at all, how depressing is that. And the job alerts I received are xxx firms representing xxx insurance company wanting to view my resume from jobscentral. But the good news is that I am going for another internship interview on Monday at a particular S&P500 company in Marymount for some accounting position. Hopefully I could clinch it since the labour market has so much excess supply (Reminds me of my econs paper yesterday which I hope I can just pass! :( ).
Basically, aglio means garlic, olio means olive oil, peperoncino means pepper/chilli and prawn means... prawn.

The multi-featured GSX-R/4 concept car combined Suzuki’s automotive and motorcycle technologies to create a one-of-a-kind high-performance vehicle using the 1.3-liter 173 horsepower engine of the GSX1300R Hayabusa motorcycle to create a high-tech, aluminium-framed, light weight 640 kilogram two-seater sportscar capable of 140 mph and motorcycle-like acceleration. With the rumours already ...
2008 Suzuki B-King A motorcycle so striking and so unique that it set off a styling revolution with a single public appearance as a concept bike at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2001. Now, the concept has become a production reality, and the genuine article is here. Backing up its exciting looks with a genuine Suzuki performance. Bringing breathtaking performance, technological excellence and overwhelming styling to the street. Combining strength and personality with muscular torque and exhilarating throttle response. With 1,340cm3 of displacement and advanced Suzuki Dual Throttle valve (SDTV) digital fuel injection featuring two-way selectable mapping to suit personal preferences. Delivering ...
Suzuki @ Frankfurt ’07: New Models, New Race Cars Suzuki SX4 WRC Suzuki Kizashi Shizuoka, Japan You can tell when the Frankfurt Motor Show arrives, because almost every single car maker the world over begins to show off new models, or in many cases – such as Suzuki’s – concept cars. Suzuki has exhibited a trio of new vehicles at the ’07 Motor Show in Frankfurt, the new Splash compact car, the SX4 WRC, and the most intriguing of all the Kizashi. Taking a leaf from Mazda’s book of using traditional Japanese monikers to name its concept and influential show cars, Kizashi translates roughly into ‘prelude’. The new model will be a mid-sized vehicle ...

Suzuki B-King THERE’S no such thing as a bad bike these days, but every now and again you come across a motorcycle that crosses the boundary and enters the category of exceptional. Without a shadow of a doubt the B-King is one such machine. Starting life as nothing more than a concept back in 2002, it captured the imagination of the bike-buying public to such an extent that Suzuki was left with little option but to turn the dream into reality. It’s taken five long years to make it into production, and that, I can assure you, is the slowest journey the B-King is ever likely to make. Under difficult circumstances Suzuki had to make sure absolutely certain that if they made a bike that ...

The B-King Ian Kerr rides Suzuki’s B-King and concludes that ‘more is more’ The production version of the Suzuki B-King is just as impressive as the original prototype was way back in 2001, despite the wait. Sure a lot has happened in those six years that it has taken to become a reality and maybe there are now other bikes that will attract the same sort of long lingering looks that this bike does, but this is now a living legend. This is a bike that has never been far away from the news pages and has apparently caused some internal fighting in Suzuki between the marketing and engineering departments, but they are all friends now. Despite an original watered-down half-way ...
146_0803_18_z+2008_suzuki_b-King+andrew_trevitt.jpg It was a pretty audacious move by a Japanese OEM. Even one with a long-established reputation for performance above all else. When Suzuki unveiled the original B-King concept bike at the ’01 Tokyo Motor Show, all the rest of the interesting machinery displayed at the event faded into oblivion as far as the sportbike public was concerned. Concept bikes usually showcase wild and alternative ideas in motorcycle design, and while the B-King included its share of unorthodox visions of motorcycling’s future in its overall package, the centerpiece of the bike-the engine-is what captivated the public. Instead of some biofuel or electric/hybrid ...

The Kitimat RCMP arrested a 31 yr old man shortly after he allegedly assaulted the owner/manager of the Kitimat Hotel last weekend.
On March 17th, 2013 at around 05:30 the Kitimat RCMP and BC Ambulance Services, responded to a report of a female laying unconscious outside the Kitimat Hotel.
Witnesses at the scene assisted investigators by providing the direction of travel of a male suspect, who was seen fleeing north from the hotel towards a wooded area. RCMP officers were able to quickly track the man down due to his footprints left in the snow. Daniel Charles RINQUINHA formerly of Kitimat, who now resides in Alberta remains in custody and is facing a charge of aggravated assault.
The 50 yr old female victim was transported to hospital from treatment of severe head trauma and broken facial bones. RCMP Terrace Ident along with an investigator from Terrace assisted in the ongoing investigation.
The Kitimat RCMP would like to speak to anyone with information or to witnesses who have not yet spoken to investigators.
Feel better soon Sue. Everyone I know is just sick about this and we are all saying a prayer for you.

Aankomende vrijdag 18 maart hebben we een film avondje op groot scherm in onze box met eventueel het genot van een heerlijke boxmeal.
A friend pointed out a Web site that lets you generate your own graph paper (along with a few other things that aren’t exactly graph paper). You fill out a Web form and it comes back with a customized PDF. You can do grids, grids with heavy lines every inch and medium lines every half inch (configurable, of course), hex paper, dots (grid and hex), asymmetric grids, staves for sheet music, plain old lined paper, and a few other things I’ve never even heard of (tumbling blocks, anyone?). You can also set the number of lines per inch (or centimeter) and the color of the grid lines. And it’s free. Pretty sweet.
Last year I had the pleasure of giving a talk at the ThingMonk Internet of Things conference. I spoke about my experiences and learnings in building a crowdsourced radiation map for Japan after the Fukushima disaster.
The biggest point I wanted to get across is that crowdsourced science is not about gathering as many scientific readings as possible from the crowd and then using that multitude of data to derive the truth. In fact, when it comes to scientific data, quality trumps quantity. So with radiation it wasn’t about getting as many readings as possible, but making sure that geiger counters were correctly calibrated and readings were being taken in a responsible manner. The crowd in this case of crowdsourcing comes from the volunteer efforts of the community that works to ensure a high quality bar in the data gathering.
Some interesting issues to consider in the future Internet of Things world, where many things may be connected to eachother and to us, but the value of those things and that data will be up to us to determine and safeguard.
No need to tell you that we have been quite busy these days. Most of our teams are working on several projects at the same time excepting Creatures’ team who is focusing on finishing Creatures Online. That game really cost us an arm.
Talking about Creatures Online, we have been releasing a “weekly update” on the forum every week for 4 months now . The point of those updates is to show to the community where the development exactly stands. We should have done that from the beginning but the community management was not that effective back in those days. It was the first time we had to manage such a big license with such an active community. We did our best and I really hope that the community noticed it. As you certainly know, Fishing Cactus doesn’t take care of the CO page on Facebook nor the Twitter account anymore.
Andrea and I talked to Raphaël “Ulandar” from ProsiebenSat.1 Games, who is in charge of the whole community management of Creatures Online. A bunch of good ideas came from that conversation such as making videos to show game improvements, talking about CAOS, etc.
The sooner Creatures will be finished the sooner the team will be available to work on other games in production such as Algo-Bot which should hit Kickstarter in January. Yeah I know what you think! It’s a fact that we have deadline issues I have to admit that I’ve never thought that launching a Kickstarter campaign could be that difficult. Meanwhile, you will find our Kickstarter video here and signup if you want to be informed the day Algo-Bot hits Kickstarter. Hope that this game will be funded because it really deserves to be finished. It’s not my only opinion, the awards below talk by themselves: Top 5 of the best Indie Game at Indie Prize Showcase and Best Serious Game in category HR – Training at Serious Game Expo. So, proud of our little fellow <3
To finish my post I would like to wish you a lot of Roasted Turkey, Mashed Potatoes and Pumpkin Pie! Happy Thanksgiving!

Millions of vacationers across the world take a ski holiday every year. While Michael Schumacher’s unfortunate accident is a grim reminder of the dangers of off-piste skiing, this is the right time to look for the most frequented, reliable slopes to enjoy the winter sport safely.
For many people Val D’Isere remains the first choice. This area in the French Alps has become so sought after by foreign visitors that you’ll be hard pressed to find a pub or shop where the locals don’t speak English. The ski area is excellent, as are the facilities away from the slopes. Of course, it gets crowded, so if you’re looking for a quiet week away then Val D’Isere may not be right for you. Other popular ski resorts in France include Chamonix and Courchevel.
Krasnaya Polyana, a hugely popular Russian winter ski destination on the Caucasus Mountains, will be the hub of all Mountain Cluster games in the Sochi Winter Olympics this year.
Many holiday-makers tend to be put off Switzerland and Austria because of exorbitant prices. Whilst it’s undeniable that both countries have some very expensive resorts, if you shop around you can still find some bargains in terms of both getting to your chosen destination and making the most of your stay there. St Anton in Austria is less well-known but also has a wonderful ski area. This provides a great platform for both skiing and snowboarding. Scenic Kitzbühel is everything an alpine resort should be: a charming village with a medieval center, a world-famous après-ski mecca, and a ski run regularly used on the World Cup circuit. Kitzbühel offers over 145 km of trails, most parts for beginners and intermediates. There are four main mountains: the Hahnenkamm, theKitzbüheler Horn, the Bichlalm, and Pass Thurn. Kitzbühel is also home to the popular Ski Safari circuit, marked by elephant symbols. The circuit allows skiers to explore the entire area between Hahnenkamm and Pass Thurn. Whether you go to Kitzbühel to ski the Hahnenkamm or to party all night (or both), Kitzbühel doesn’t disappoint.
Set in the centre of Europe, Switzerland is of course highly accessible for Europeans, but has also been very popular with tourists from all over the world. The Zermatt resort in Switzerland is amajor contender for the title of the best ski resort in Europe, with fine Alpine scenery. There are 29 mountains surrounding Zermatt that rise over 4,000 meters (13,200 feet), of which Matterhorn is the most renowned. The Matterhorn Ski Paradise covers three ski areas: the Sunnegga-Rothorn, the Gornergrat, and the Klein Matterhorn. There are 250 km of trails, of which 70 km is for advanced skiers and the rest for beginners and intermediates. The intermediates have the advantage in Zermatt with miles of scenic runs but there are special heli-skiing trips for advanced skiers. Zermatt runs a highly efficient transport facility with high-speed cableways, mountain railways, and ski lifts. This system also provides access to Cervinia, Italy, where visitors can ski down the slopes and enjoy a tasty Italian meal.
For skiing and hiking in Northern Europe, the Sudeten Mountain Range which winds through part of southern Poland and includes popular escapes in the Tetra Mountains, and the lakeside resort of Voss in Norway offer plenty of snow.
Aspen Colorado is one of the world’s largest and most famous ski resorts. Cuddled in the higher ranges of Rocky Mountains, it is 200 miles southwest of Denver and 130 miles northeast of Grand Junction, In Aspen you will find all that you are looking for in a winter vacation – snow capped mountains, ski resorts, forests, festivals, Victorian architecture, music, arts and a historical background. Vail in Colorado is touted as America’s favorite winter resort, and offers a great variety of entertainment choices as well. While Jackson Hole is another popular North American resort, the recent avalanche-related death there is a point of concern. Whistler, with the highest vertical drop in North America and the Piccolo lift draws several advanced ski enthusiasts.
Choosing a good winter base can make your ski vacation truly awesome. You can rent a ‘ski-in, ski-out’ log cabin or a chalet, or a traditional resort, which can offer perks such as free lifts and discounted ski lessons. Do check for space for skis, parkas, snowboards and other equipment which you might be carrying.
I sort of wish I had yards and yards of this vintage velvet fabric featuring frisky ponies and pretty flowers. If I had a bunch I think I'd make myself a blazer, but I only had enough for a few pouches… Which are now available here!

These past few weeks, I've been sourcing swatches, trims, and buttons for my ballgown presentation and tailored jacket for school, which has taken me on adventures all across Seattle: from the drool-worthy District Fabric in Fremont, to the charming & friendly Artist & Craftsman Supply in the University District, to the magical ribbon room of Nancy's Sewing Basket on upper Queen Anne.
I think at this point I've crossed into Deeply and Hilariously Scattered Artist territory. I have a Ziploc baggie full of crystal embellishments, printed silk georgette, Copic markers, and bits of French lace that I carry around my purse and occasionally whip out at random moments to stare at. I'm considering doing major research into home bookbinding. The other day, I spent an hour in the cardmaking section of Paper Source waffling between four colors of pre-fab folded cards to best complement the color of my swatches. Plus, Sparklepants and I are both working on our ballgown presentation projects at the same time, so it's become common for one of us to punctuate a completely normal conversation about sandwiches or television with things like, "I really just want to find tulle the color of the mist from that one Tarkovsky film and it's stressing me ouuuuut" (And then I have a moment where I wonder what kind of floaty goofball says stuff like that and realize OH HEY IT'S TOTALLY ME)
In the midst of all of this sourcing, I find myself focusing on the most minute of details - in particular, these past few weeks I got really fixated on finding the right buttons for my jacket. I had this beautiful Balenciaga suit in mind when I designed it, and as a result, I have a very specific vision of the materials and feel of the final garment. I knew that I wanted vintage black glass, Czech if possible, in a faceted style, but beyond that I couldn't tell you what they looked like. And I needed 5 or 6 big ones, and 8-12 little ones. Easy, right?
So I went to every fabric store in the greater Seattle area and a couple in Portland, and...nothing. Each time I walked in determined, and each time I deflated a little as I faced the button wall and was not immediately drawn to my Destiny Buttons. (Who knew being weirdly specific about buttons that may or may not exist would be a complicating factor?) Then, in the stroke of luck/fate/timing, I was able to attend a trade show through the school last week, and not ten minutes after we arrived, I walked into one of the vendor's rooms and there they were: two different sizes of vintage, cut glass Czech buttons with a gentle swirl motif that set off the herringbone of my jacket fabric perfectly, with just the right weight and sparkle, that walked that fine line between beauty and functionality.
And the funny thing is: in the midst of all this scatter and distraction and stress, that single moment of clarity - that moment when the last detail softly clicked into place, and my jacket turned into My Jacket - it made it all absolutely worth it.
Hi, I'm Cory! I'm a knitwear designer, teacher, and writer; fashion enthusiast, color lover, and rat & Corgi mom. Welcome to my blog!

I never thought I would be publicly on the look for a new gig, but here I am. I went on a rollercoaster ride the last few months and have exited the ride and am in search of a new thrill.
As I have progressed in my career I feel ever more confident in the set of skills I have acquired and my ability to use them. Reflecting on my accomplishments over the past few years I am inspired to continue to add to that list. Those accomplishments all have come through hard work and collaboration. I love collaborating in some capacity, everything from being in a room or video call with someone to pair programming to a discussion over pull requests.
I’ve reflected also on how much I have learned over the years and this also inspires me to keep growing as a person, developer, and manager. I care about helping mold quality people and quality software. I find the best way to do this is with constant feedback and education. I love being a part-time instructor at the local community college, there is a feeling of accomplishment I get vicariously through my students as they achieve success.
My time in the classroom impacts my daily work in so many ways. One of the biggest lessons I have learned is how to communicate to someone your idea in a way that is empathetic and compassionate. Much like the co-workers I have had or employees I have managed, students come to me with different experiences. These are both life and education experiences, some know object-oriented programming others don’t. Some have used an operating system other than Windows, some not. The list can continue on. This poses a challenge when giving assignments and even during lecture and lab times. Through practice and constant feedback from students and employees, I have developed a communication platform that consists primarily of storytelling and analogies.
Storytelling allows me to frame the content in a way that is best fitted for the individual, in order to do that I need to have a good understanding of the person that I am communicating with. Building a relationship to a level that allows me to communicate effectively has the side effect of building trust with the person. This trust increases their comfort in speaking up when they don’t understand something, knowing I will find another way to communicate with them.
As I move forward in my career I am looking for a place that will allow me to use all my skills and acquire new ones. I’m open to opportunities that push me out of my comfort zone and give me more perspectives to attack problems with. I have really enjoyed my time with Ruby on Rails and specifically the Ruby language. I see new things on the horizon like ELM and WebAssembly along with tools like React Native which is gaining traction and I’m excited about something new.
If you are looking for someone like me, please contact me chris at johnsonch.com. You’ll find my resume related information on LinkedIn and code related information on Github. My course materials are out on my course Github organization including class samples and lectures.
I just realized that my latest custom kernel didnt have DMA support for my box !!! ... thats explains why my harddisk is darned slow lately~ ... haha
now i'm lost, not very sure which option to enable for my box. In the end, i pick the kernel .config which i used in my liveCD , and compile everything as module~ ... lol .. hopefully it will work and get back my previous performance...

At this point I’m pretty sure Final Fantasy fans are used to the delays that come with a PC release for a Final Fantasy game, yet in this case that frustration can finally be washed away with hype: Final Fantasy XV for PC is here! Now let’s get to the builds!
When putting this build together, I wanted to build a Mini ITX PC that can play almost any game at 1440p at 60 FPS with Ultra settings. I allocated a budget of $1,200 and picked parts accordingly.
This is a Haswell build, but I’ve provided alternative options for Skylake, at a slightly higher price.

There is far too much to explain in just a few articles, and there is much excellent and detailed information about each of these points on the internet. If you are already familiar with the current food system and the controversy surrounding it, much of this will not be new to you. This series is only meant to be a brief introduction and overview to a very deep problem.
This second article focuses on an essential part of growing and agriculture that does not seem to get the public recognition it deserves: Seeds. For those of us (in the West, it is most of us!) who no longer plant and grow and measure prosperity by the bounty of our harvest (both of produce and of seed to replant the next year), these bits of matter might seem so inconsequential: They are not life-giving miracles, but frozen corn kernels and dried beans, sunflower seeds we eat by the handful, watermelon seeds and cherry pits we casually spit into the trash.
However, the fact is that most of the countless plants and trees on our world (and the food they sustain us with), whether huge and grandiose or small and unassuming, ancient or harvested yearly, were once nothing more than a seed small enough to hold. They are truly an extraordinary and humbling Creation of God, and a reminder that we live and survive due to His Compassion and at His Mercy alone.
The importance of these tiny sparks of life is underscored by the huge industry that has developed around them (estimated by this 2004 study to be a $25 billion global market in 1997, a number which has surely increased substantially since then). No longer is it a simple matter of saving part of your harvest to replant; now, growers have options, and not just in crop varieties (although the easy availability of thousands of varieties from all over the world, and being able to have any of them sent to you with the click of a button, is by itself pretty amazing and revolutionary). Two of the most important of these options, in terms of their widespread adoption and the huge changes they have caused in how things are done in the farming world (much of it not for the better), are hybrids and GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms):
"Hybrid" in modern growing and agriculture refers to the result of crossing two (or more) crop varieties in a precisely controlled manner leading to a crop that is superior to both (due to a genetic effect called heterosis or hybrid vigor), but is usually infertile (seed harvested from them will not grow or will only produce weak and sickly plants; some, such as seedless watermelon, do not even have seeds anymore). A good comparison is the mule, the sterile offspring of a donkey and a horse, bred because many consider it to be a superior pack and work animal to either a donkey or a horse.
This potential of hybrids was first theorized and tested in the US in the early 1900s, and was successfully developed on a commercial scale for corn by the 1930s. By the 1960s, it was in widespread use, and the development and use of hybrids has only increased since then (for more of the history of the US seed industry, see the section "A Brief History of the Development of the Seed Industry..." in this article).
The benefits of hybrid crops cannot be denied: They are consistently better at what they were selected for (often yield, transportability, disease and pest resistance, etc.) than their non-hybrid counterparts. The difference is so significant that, for example, 99% of the corn grown in the US is hybrid, and many other hybrid varieties enjoy widespread use by both conventional and organic farmers. Furthermore, hybrids are created naturally by breeding and selection, so they do not appear to be fighting or going against Nature (God) the way so many other parts of our modern food system do. Overall, it seems that if used correctly, hybrids could certainly be included as part of a Godly, fresh, local, organic food system.
However, the key word is "part," whereas for many modern farms, especially large-scale monocropping, it seems to be "all." The key problem is that you cannot save hybrid seed; if you farm hybrids, you must buy new seed from the supplier each year. In such a relationship, who has the control? In fact, one of the main reasons that seed companies have invested so much money and research into developing excellent hybrids is because they were having trouble selling regular seeds profitably (it is difficult to sell something to someone more than once when it will replicate itself for free). With hybrids, they have assured themselves continual business, because the hybrid farmer cannot farm without them. If your survival is completely at the mercy of someone else, then they have the control, and you are in trouble (especially when that someone else is a businessman)!
Also, although hybrids could be a harmonious part of a healthy fresh, local, and organic food system, most of the hybrids that we currently have probably could not. This is because most current hybrid varieties are developed to fit with our broken and unnatural system of maximizing yield (not nutrition; quantity, not quality), then harvesting hundreds of acres of produce all at once using huge machines that need consistency to function, and finally shipping that produce hundreds of miles rather than eating locally. Therefore, hybrids have been bred primarily for these three things: Yield, consistency, and shelf life.
The tradeoff is a significant decline in the nutritional value and taste of these crops. An acre only has an acre's worth of nutrients, whether you are getting 20 bushels of corn out of it (in 1930) or 140 bushels (by the mid 1990s) (Source). Farmers try to offset some of this huge increase in nutritional demand by artificially adding more, usually through large amounts of chemical fertilizer (which does not include many important trace nutrients and is very bad for the environment, see Part 1), but the numbers simply do not add up that a 600% increase in yield, on the same land, can retain 100% nutrient density.
To make matters worse, the plants have been bred to focus what nutrients they do get on creating (for example) perfectly red, round tomatoes that can be shipped cross-country, but are missing 58% of their calcium and 46% of their Vitamin A (Source, also see here). This is truly an awful bargain. The vastly increased amount of food we are producing, hailed as one of the great successes of the so-called Green Revolution, is hiding a deep and unacceptable cost. Maitreya has said that His mother often spoke of Nostradamus's prophecy that in the end times, people would eat constantly, but still be hungry. The nutritionally empty, unnaturally produced, processed food of our age, which we can eat until we explode and still be malnourished, is clear fulfillment of these words.
Therefore, I feel that in a strong, stable, and healthy food system, hybrids can certainly play a role, but they should not be adopted to the extent that the farmer loses self-sufficiency, and should be bred for nutrition and with a focus on fresh, local, and organic. (For more information, here is one article that discusses some consequences of the widespread use of hybrids in corn, as well as GMOs and other topics).
GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism. It refers to any creature whose genetics has been directly altered by humans. This does not mean by breeding or other methods that are found in Nature, but by injecting new genes from other sources, or trying to alter existing genes, using modern methods collectively known as "genetic engineering." The glow in the dark fish known as GloFish, created by inserting genes from fluorescent jellyfish into zebrafish embryos, are examples of GMOs.
The first plant cell was genetically modified in 1982, commercial use of GMO seeds began in 1996, and GMOs have since become nearly as widespread and game-changing as hybrids were in the 1960s (although there is much more controversy about this than hybrids, and many countries such as Japan and the EU are strongly resisting the adoption of GM crops).
The advantage of GMOs is simple: It allows for the addition of very specific desirable traits without having to deal with the lengthy and uncertain process of traditional, natural breeding and selection. For example, one of the most widespread types of GMO crops is created by taking genes from naturally pesticide resistant plants and putting them into food crops, thus making them pesticide resistant. Farmers can then plant these crops and spray their whole field, and only the weeds will die. Another popular set of GMOs incorporates genes from bacteria known as Bt which produce substances that are toxic to many insects. When pests attack and feed on the GMO crops, they are killed by the Bt toxin. Genetic modification is now even being used in livestock, such as cows in China that have been genetically modified to produce human milk.
While it may sound good on the surface (or maybe not), there are some very unsettling problems already known about this practice, and many important questions have been left unanswered as the industry pushes GMO adoption forward at ever-increasing speed in the name of progress (and profit). It is really an enormous topic, encompassing scientific, environmental, political, and ethical issues, so instead of trying to discuss all of these in detail, I will simply give an overall look at the topic within the context of the Mission and Maitreya's Teachings:
Our belief that God created the universe and Nature in His Infinite Wisdom, and that He has done it the way He has for a reason, seems at great odds with the GMO mindset that we have the ability and authority to step outside of the natural method of gene selection (reproduction, evolution, etc.) and stick in whatever we want, wherever we want, however we want. While the biotech scientists have developed some admittedly ingenious methods to alter genetics in this way, we have absolutely no understanding of what we are really doing, or the consequences it might cause. We are cavemen who have discovered flame, seen that it is useful, and proceeded to start fires in every nook, hole, and cranny of our environment. If the whole forest goes up in smoke, perhaps then we will realize it is also dangerous, but by then it is too late.
If there is anything we should learn from the effects that our actions have had on Nature (global warming, destruction of ecosystems, release of carbon into the atmosphere, etc.), it is that everything is interconnected, often in ways we do not realize until after we have caused much destruction. If this is also true in the amazingly complex and still very poorly understood world of genetics (and I am sure it is), then what is the effect of sticking a gene here, a gene there, considering that this is not how God does it in Nature?
There was an experiment done in Russia (more detail), not on plants but on foxes, that nevertheless illustrates this point well. In order to study how animals become domesticated, scientists directed the evolution of foxes in a very simple manner: If a fox acted tame (less scared, friendlier, accepted or sought out physical contact, etc.), it was bred; if not, it was not.
Over many generations of this, the foxes did indeed become tamer, but the truly amazing thing was the slew of other changes that also occurred: Their ears became floppy, they began wagging their tails and barking, would come when they were called, etc. In effect, they became dog-like. There were even changes that seemed completely unrelated to tameness, such as the baby foxes' eyes opening several days later than regular foxes. This illustrates so strongly that the entire genetic makeup of a creature is deeply interconnected, and no part of it changes by itself. It really makes one question the wisdom of tampering with bits and pieces of that structure the way that genetic modification does.
We are not against technology and progress, but we are against that which is against God's Way. It cannot be denied that genetic modification and engineering do seem like they might have amazing potential to help humanity in all walks of life, from medicine, to communications, to agriculture. However, not all that glitters is gold. Perhaps God does intend that eventually humans develop enough understanding of genetics to be able to manipulate it in this way, and will give His Permission as long as we use it for a Godly purpose. But perhaps this branch of science is inherently unnatural and ungodly, and something that humanity should abandon and leave to God and Nature to handle (do not eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil!).
What is for sure is that we must know without a doubt what we are doing before we permeate our lives and our food system with something so new and potentially dangerous (1, 2, many more are available)!
It should also be considered that the agricultural biotechnology and seed industries are using GMOs (and the fact that they can be patented in the US and elsewhere) to control and take power away from famers even more than they could with hybrids. To use GMOs, farmers often have to sign agreements that they will not save their seed and will buy seed from the company every year. These companies are trying to also introduce this practice into third-world countries and poverty-stricken areas, with some horrific results.
There have also been documented cases of farmers being sued for growing patented GMO crops where the farmers claim that the plant blew in from another field or interpollinated with existing crops, and was neither intentional nor preventable. In all cases, it is clear that these companies' focus is not on developing a strong food system, but on protecting their investment, finding ways to maximize profit, and forcing farmers to become more and more dependent on their products.
One of the major reasons that farmers have bought into these methods of control is very simple: It is convenient to just buy seed every year and let someone else take care of the admittedly complex and difficult process of seed saving, development and preparation. However, we have taken a glimpse at some of the consequences of this convenience. The best way to break the power of these companies and to regain self-sufficiency is to return to the traditional practice of seed saving. God has made it so each seed planted will eventually create hundreds, thousands, or even millions more just like it. All that has to be done is to take advantage of that miracle, and each community and area can regain control over their own food sources.
If we are expecting and preparing for the Tribulation, we should be aware that the distribution channels that currently provide seeds to growers are as tenuous as the channels that provide food to supermarkets. Maitreya has asked: If the trucks stopped delivering food tomorrow (especially to the big cities), what would the people do? As we create communities and begin growing our own food again, we need to remember to ask ourselves the same question about the seeds we buy. It is not to be fearful, but to understand that having a stable supply of seeds is an integral part of self-sufficiency, and so seed saving must be a piece of our ideal fresh, local, organic system (especially at this time when we are expecting so much destruction and uncertainty in the future).
Seed saving and replanting will also allow us to grow crops more fully suited to our individual and local environments. A plant variety that was developed in Russia and is now being propagated at a seed farm in Maine is clearly not genetically predisposed to a life in New Mexico. Maitreya has explained that this is not too important in terms of the nutritional and health benefits of eating local, and that plants (like animals and humans) have a great ability to adapt to their environment and pick up the nutrients, antibiotics, etc. of the area (and pass them to us when we eat them). However, He agreed that even more ideal than buying seed from elsewhere and growing it locally is to grow the seed locally as well, especially in terms of developing disease and pest resistance, tolerance to the weather, vigor and growth, etc.
It is possible that over many generations, using technology and knowledge of genetics and plant breeding and selection, each area could create crops so well-suited to their environment that they could be competitive with or even superior to hybrids and GMOs. However, only God Knows the future. In the meantime, let us focus on local, fresh, organic, becoming self-sufficient, breaking the power of the large companies, and returning to the natural Way!
The next article (in the next Newsbrief) will focus on modern industrial livestock management, which is one of the most unnatural and horrifying parts of the modern food system.
questa settimana mi sono resa conto di aver quasi fatto solo post di smalti. Mi dispiace per le non amanti del genere, ma con la primavera alle porte le novità sono troppe e non voglio perdemene nemmeno una.
Our friends at the Quiet Skies Coalition – a grassroots organization to challenge the new airplane flight-patterns from Sea-Tac Airport over Burien – released their latest newsletter on Saturday, Dec. 17.
In the newsletter, organizers are alerting residents that they will be asking the Burien City Council at Monday night’s meeting (Dec. 19) “to release funds that have already been approved for airport litigation against the FAA and their policy of directing flights over our neighborhoods. We have a course of action that cannot be openly discussed at this time. However, we have a small window of opportunity that will close if we don’t execute our plan in a timely manner. This course of action is extremely time sensitive and we must act NOW.”
Organizers are asking for concerned residents to show up at the Monday night meeting to support this effort.
“It is imperative that we have a large showing of support at the meeting on Monday night where we will be asking the council for the necessary release of funding. Your presence will help ensure the City Council Members to recognize the importance and urgency we all feel. Please spread the word and make every effort to be there!”
Monday night’s City Council meeting will start at 7 p.m. at Burien City Hall, located at 400 SW 152nd Street.
The Burien City Council will meet on Monday, Dec. 19th at 7PM. At that meeting, your Quiet Skies Coalition committee will be asking the council to release funds that have already been approved for airport litigation against the FAA and their policy of directing flights over our neighborhoods. We have a course of action that cannot be openly discussed at this time. However, we have a small window of opportunity that will close if we don’t execute our plan in a timely manner. This course of action is extremely time sensitive and we must act NOW.
It is imperative that we have a large showing of support at the meeting on Monday night where we will be asking the Counsel for the necessary release of funding. Your presence will help ensure the City Council Members to recognize the importance and urgency we all feel. Please spread the word and make every effort to be there!
Does the quote “please spread the word and make every effort to be there!” apply to our own horrendously absentee council member Bezerkoitz? If anyone should be there it should be her as she’s getting paid with our tax money to hypothetically represent us. Even though her position on matters usually goes against common sense and only plays into the hands of her Socialist masters, a job is a job so step up or preferably quit.

The crowdfunding sector in Albania is still in its early stages. There are no signs of organic development for the market in this country.
The Austrian crowdfunding market is slowly changing from a small market niche to a serious alternative in the financial system. The change is due to the introduction of a new legal framework, which came into effect in Austria on the 1st of September 2015.
The Belgian crowdfunding market started late, however, it is evolving quickly and crowdfunding is becoming a viable alternative for financing. The Belgian market is primarily dominated by local platforms, with some impact from international players.
So far, there isn't much data available with regard to the crowdfunding industry in Bosnia and Herzegovina. No platforms are active in this country, however, there are some interesting initiatives which use crowdfunding as a democratising tool.
Crowdfunding is a relatively new and not yet widely used instrument for fundraising in Bulgaria. However, more and more entrepreneurs from the country, especially those in the technological field, take advantage of the international outreach of large crowdfunding platforms.
China is the largest market for alternative finance in the world. According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), China delivered over $100 billion in alternative finance, including peer to peer lending and crowdfunding, in 2015.
From the Croatian perspective, crowdfunding is currently a big challenge. The greatest weaknesses are a small general awareness of the possibility of crowdfunding, low use of Internet for online purchasing of goods, poor development and mistrust of e-business.
The Crowdfunding business in Cyprus is under-developed, Recently there are a few upcoming initiatives and the industry might evolve in 2016.
Although the crowdfunding market in the Czech Republic is quite small compared to other European countries, it is growing rapidly. By the end of 2015, 5 platforms were online and policy makers started including crowdfunding related issues into current legislation.
As the Danish market for Crowdfunding is very limited, there is currently no regulatory regime that is specifically adapted to Crowdfunding in Denmark.
Estonia is a European frontrunner! Crowdfunding started in 2009 with a local P2P consumer lending platform called isePankur (now Bondora). In 2015, Estonia ranked second in Europe in total volume per capital.
Since September 1st, Finland is also one of the countries with a crowdfunding regulation. In Finland, the Crowdfunding Act is part of the key Government projects.
Excluding the UK, France has the largest crowdfunding volumes in Europe. Thus, it constitutes a good example of the impact of good policy measures and having sufficient regulation in place.
Accoring to the 2nd European Alternative Finance Industry Report that Cambridge University published in September 2016, Germany ranks second amongst European countries in terms of total volume.
The Greek crowdfunding landscape consists mostly of donation/rewards-based platforms with a short operation lifetime and a relatively low number of projects. Crowdfunding is still in its infancy in Greece.
General mistrust, relatively low population and limited savings seem to hinder the enhancement of crowdfunding in Hungary.
Iceland has the smallest crowdfunding volumes compared to other Nordic countries, however higher per capita investments than Norway and Sweden.
According to the 2nd European Alternative Finance Industry Report, Ireland raised 3m EUR with alternative finance and thus has one of the smallest crowdfunding industries in Europe.
Being known as the Startup Nation, with perhaps the second most active entrepreneurial scene in the world after the US, Israel is expected to pay particular attention to the crowdfuning market.
Crowdfunding established itself rather quickly in Italy, where Produzioni dal Basso, the first donation and rewards-based platform was launched in 2005. The growth of the crowdfunding market has been slow, but nevertheless relevant.
According to the 2nd European Alternative Finance Industry Report, Latvia raised € 15.20m through Alternative Financing.
Crowdfunding platforms based on donations or rewards models could operate in Lithuania without any major regulatory burden, nevertheless Lithuania has no donation or rewards based platforms. Within the last year, as many as five P2P consumer lending platforms were launched in Lithuania.
Crowdfunding has yet to arrive in Luxembourg. Neither the legislator nor the financial authority have given any indications as to how crowdfunding will be organised on the field or what laws and regulations will be applicable.
Crowdfunding in Malta still has to emerge. However, the one platform that is active constitutes a nice Best Practice example to enhance cooperation between universities and entrepreneurship.
There are quite a few crowdfunding projects that are linked to Moldova, but until the beginning of 2016, they were all hosted by foreign crowdfunding platforms like Indiegogo, since there were no active local platforms in the country.
Montenegro hasn't established a crowdfunding industry, yet. Due to difficult political circumstances, the uptake of crowdfunding still might take a few years.
The Netherlands ranks with France and Germany in the top three countries in Europe, with regards to the size of the crowdfunding industry.
Recently, Norway has seen growth in the number of platforms offering crowdfunding services locally. Furthermore, there are some impressive successful campaigns from Norway-based companies on global platforms.
Capital market regulations and administrative barriers connected mostly with public money gathering, are limiting the development of crowdfunding in Poland, a nation with almost 40 million people. The Polish Crowdfunding Society Aims At Changing Crowdfunding Landscape In Poland.
Rewards-based crowdfunding started in Portugal in 2011. Further growth is expected, once the general public is comfortable with the concept of crowdfunding. This is because Portugal is one of the few countries with a regulation of crowdfunding since mid 2015.
Crowdfunding in Romania is in the learning phase. It has a short and inconsistent history. The first platform for crowdfunding is only three years old, and only few dozen small projects were eventually financed and finalised.
Serbia doesn't have a crowdfunding industry yet. However, different projects supporting initiatives for and from Serbia.can be observed on international crowdfunding platforms.
The Slovakian crowdfunding industry represents a newcomer in Europe. So far, projects from Slovakia have widely used international crowdfunding platforms.
Until 2015, no crowdfunding platforms were active in Slovenia. Thus, crowdfunding is a completely new industry for this small country and 2016 will be a trend indicator.
Spain ranks fifth amongst European countries in terms of total volume. The current number of crowdfunding platforms in Spain is around 52. It is a relatively young but continuously growing market.
Sweden has accelerated its activity in the alternative financing sector and offers (as of 2016) approximately seven local platforms, with a wide range of business models and nearly all types of crowdfunding models.
Crowdfunding started in Switzerland in 2008 with the crowdlending platform Cashare. Since then, the market has seen strong growth. In 2010, the first crowdinvesting platform was launched. 100-days and wemakeit, both reward-based, were launched in 2012 and seem to be the largest ones.
Up to now, the crowdfunding sector has not been extablished yet in Macedonia. There is only one active platform that collected a very small amount in the last three years.
Crowdfunding isn't easy in North Africa, including Tunisia, due to a lack of knowledge for creating high quality campaigns and payment difficulties.
The potential of crowdfunding is seen controversely in Turkey. On the one hand, there are significant cultural and historical impediments. On the other hand, it can be a valuable alternative financing method for entrepreneurs and startups.
Crowdfunding in the Ukraine is limited to very special projects. Whilst it has been used to raise money for films, rock bands and aspiring performance artists. Now, Ukrainians have used the concept of online crowdfunding to fund the army.
The UK is dominating the European online alternative finance landscape, increasing its overall market share of Europe to 81% in 2015 with EUR 4,412m.
The crowdfunding market in the USA has entered the mainstream. The JOBS Act of 2012 represented a turning point for the American crowdfunding sector, starting a regulation that was greatly needed.

1 Jesus had left the Temple and was going on His way, when His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple buildings.
2 'You see all these?' He replied; 'in solemn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down.'
3 Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others, and said, 'Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign of your Coming and of the Close of the Age?'
6 And before long you will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the End is not yet.
7 For nation will rise in arms against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places;
9 'At that time they will deliver you up to punishment and will put you to death; and you will be objects of hatred to all the nations because you are called by my name.
12 and because of the prevalent disregard of God's law the love of the great majority will grow cold;
14 And this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the whole world to set the evidence before all the Gentiles; and then the End will come.
15 'When you have seen (to use the language of the Prophet Daniel) the 'Abomination of Desolation', standing in the Holy Place' --let the reader observe those words--
21 for it will be a time of great suffering, such as never has been from the beginning of the world till now, and assuredly never will be again.
22 And if those days had not been cut short, no one would escape; but for the sake of God's own People those days will be cut short.
23 'If at that time any one should say to you, 'See, here is the Christ!' or 'Here!' give no credence to it.
24 For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying wonderful signs and prodigies, so as to deceive, were it possible, even God's own People.
26 If therefore they should say to you, 'See, He is in the Desert!' do not go out there: or 'See, He is indoors in the room!' do not believe it.
27 For just as the lightning flashes in the east and is seen to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man.
29 'But immediately after those times of distress the sun will be darkened, the moon will not shed her light, the stars will fall from the firmament, and the forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.
30 Then will appear the Sign of the Son of Man in the sky; and then will all the nations of the earth lament, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.
31 And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet-blast, and they will bring together His own People to Him from north, south, east and west--from one extremity of the world to the other.
32 'Now learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branches have now become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you all know that summer is near.
34 I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.
36 'But as to that day and the exact time no one knows--not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.
38 At that time, before the Deluge, men were busy eating and drinking, taking wives or giving them, up to the very day when Noah entered the Ark,
39 nor did they realise any danger till the Deluge came and swept them all away; so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.
43 But of this be assured, that if the master of the house had known the hour at which the robber was coming, he would have kept awake, and not have allowed his house to be broken into.
44 Therefore you also must be ready; for it is at a time when you do not expect Him that the Son of Man will come.
45 'Who therefore is the loyal and intelligent servant to whom his master has entrusted the control of his household to give them their rations at the appointed time?
48 But if the man, being a bad servant, should say in his heart, 'My master is a long time in coming,'
50 the master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not expecting him and at an hour of which he has not been informed;
51 he will treat him with the utmost severity and assign him a place among the hypocrites: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
Yesterday my mom and I went over to a friends house and they showed us how to make these really cute fabric pumpkins! :-) They are relatively easy to make and we were so pleased with the end result.
To begin, cut out a circle of fabric. You can use a pizza pan as a pattern for a larger pumpkin or perhaps a plate for a smaller pumpkin. Next you take take 6 strans of embroidery thread and a needle and start to run a gathering stitch about an 1/8 to a 1/4 of an inch from the edge of the fabric. You won't need to tie a knot at the end of this thread, but you should leave a portion out to use later when gathering. After stitching all the way around the edge, gently pull the thread to gather the fabric up a bit and then put stuffing inside the opening. You'll want to put in enough so that the sides of the pumpkin will stand out nicely. Now, carefully pull the threads again until only a small hole remains. It might be helpful for another person to smash down the cotton as your doing this to prevent the thread from breaking. If it does break, don't worry! Just try to find where the thread broke, thread your needle and go at it again! (This happened to me once. :-) ) Once it's all gathered up into a ball, tie a knot in the thread (twice) and then wrap the remaining thread around the pumpkin like you would a package. Pull the thread to the bottom of the pumpkin, (turn the pumpkin over) twist the threads and bring them back up to the top dividing the pumpkin into 1/4 's. Continue doing this until the pumpkin is divided into 1/8's. Now tie the threads off and trim off the excess thread. Now you can add decorative leaves, a small (real) stick, and or a pretty bow made out of ribbon or even a curled up wire or small ribbon (applied with hot glue) to add a finishing touch. This project is so fun and easy to make and I hope you'll be able to try it!
These are SO cute! Very autumn, Chloe! I liked them so much that I decided to make some of my own. = ) That's what I'm working on today. You did a really good job with writing out the directions. I also loved the pictures of the ones you and your mom made. They really turned out beautiful!
I broke my thread while gathering too - more than once! I have trouble getting all six strands of embroidery floss through the fabric. = / But I think my pumpkins are turning out nicely anyway! = ) I have to go get back to working on them!
I'm so glad you got to make some of the pumpkins! :-) I thought that they were really fun to make and so pretty and decorative for fall. :-) Did you see the felt coasters on www.sewchick.blogspot.com ? Mom and I have started on making some of those, and they are turning out really cute too! :-)
Yes, I did see the coasters. Cute! :-) I'm glad you and your mom are getting to make some autumn decorations! I can't believe it's already November. It's so much fun to decorate for the Holidays!!!
After you get there, you can click on a link to their blog, "Crystal's blog." Anyways, I recently found this, and I've found a lot of encouraging articles and stuff. Maybe you already know about it. But I just thought I'd mention it in case you don't, and you wanna check it out. I've printed up some of the articles and posts, and our family has had some neat discussions about them! :-)
I read in the Family Fun magazine for Sept/Oct 2009 to use dental floss for thread. I haven't tried it but hopefully it won't break and will work nicely.
Sorry, I don't know English enough and Polish but omly YOU can help me and all Joanna's Russian worshippers (admirers) in my face!!!
As far as I know her surname was Becker, but her first name wasn't said in any book... But maybe I'm not right
Our girls tried to translate Polish forums and can understand that name was Barbara because in Joanna Chmielewska's full name was "Barbara"... But we don't know Polish
We want to try also because we love her and her books (And I think Poland too... As for me it like my native country ).
This is in vol.4 just before second part of photos (page 311 in my edition) - when Joanna Chmielewska's mother was about to fly to Canada for the second time - this time without Joanna, and just before departure she said to Joanna: My doughter, thank you a lot (and it is written, that it was 24 of June - just in her name day)
In general, all of us are very glad, that " it was possible though something to receive from the Polish forum " - nobody knows the Polish Language, Unfortunately!
I think we celebrate only first name or this that we use (some of us use second name, or third - like JCh)
and if the name appears more than one time in calendar - we celebrate either the one that comes the closest after Birthday, or the most common one

I love the qualifier “actually” in this context, as if, after 40 years of acupuncture in the USA, anyone would be surprised. When I began my acupuncture practice in San Diego 24 years ago, I routinely had to deal with questions like “does acupuncture really work,” to which I would respond, “acupuncture has worked for me on my back and neck pain.” I also rountinely used to encounter patients whose MD’s would, at best, say condescending things like, “it probably won’t help, but try if you want.”
Things have changed. Every week now I get patients with back, neck, shoulder, elbow, knee and other kinds of pain like arthritis whose Rheumatologists and Orthopedic Surgeons are gung ho for them getting acupuncture. So it did not surprise me at all when this Time magazine article, reporting on a randomized trial done in the U.K., and published in the prestigious Annals of Internal Medicine, established in 1927 by the American College of Physicians, article here, that, not only did Acupuncture and the wonderful physical medicine called Alexander technique, reduce neck pain by 32%, but that in contrast, Physical Therapy, the standard western medicine treatment for mild neck pain that does not require surgery, only reduced pain by 9%.
A year after the start of the study, people in the groups doing acupuncture and the Alexander Technique had significant reductions in neck pain—pain was assessed by questionnaire—compared to those who just got usual care. Both groups reported about 32% less pain than they had at the start of the study, which is far greater than the 9% typically associated with physical therapy and exercise.
This does not surprise me at all, because the flaw, if you will, in the thinking of physical therapy as its practiced by less progessive P.T.’s, especially in the HMO type PT mills, is that they seem to always want to treat pain as due to weak muscles that should be strengthened, while seemingly ignoring the fact that pain is due to inflammation, and that
before you can strengthen a weak muscle, you have to reduce the pain so that the muscle fibers can be restored to their normal length, and the inflammation reduced. That is how acupuncture is so helpful for pain conditions.
Moreover, acupuncture needs to be tailored to the individual, and there are many different techniques. In my San Diego acupuncture clinic when treating neck and other kinds of pain, I most often use dry needling for neck and other kinds of muscular and fascia based pain. I find dry needling and other methods like cupping most effective for deactivating painful trigger points that cause the pain and cause the muscles to shorten. Dry needling breaks the vicious cycle of tight stiff shortened muscles that lead to sever pain and inflammation. I dare say that the average length for the successful treatment of moderate neck pain in my clinic is more like 3-6 treatments….In any case, this is great news being made public. Thanks to the M.D.s in England who participated in this study on the use of Acupuncture for neck pain.
p.s. And the great thing about using acupuncture for neck pain is it is totally safe, there is absolutely no danger, compared to s therapy like chiropractic adjustment, which, while great, and something I have done myself, does have a small element of risk involved.
Hi Mary, I dont know anyone who does Dry Needling for Neck Pain specifically in Huatulco, but last year I had a very fine deep tissue massage in San Agustinillo, next to Mazunte. I am sure there are a few acupuncturists in Mazunte. Good luck!

Customer testimonials – whether written, visual, or auditory – are an important aspect of any business marketing plan, and always hold great value with customers
You know that customer testimonials are essential for persuading prospects to become buyers. You can write down their testimonies for posting on your website or printing in your marketing materials, but when you combine testimonials with video, it takes these advantages to a whole new level. A VIDEO testimonial is far more effective, and an even better, more powerful format than a text-based testimonial. Let’s see why.
1- Video testimonials are hard to fake: Anyone can post a stock photo and add a made up written testimonial to their website, but this is not possible with video testimonials which bring a higher level of trust.
2- Video testimonials play a major role in establishing brand credibility, and compared to questionable plain-text testimonials, videos can establish a valuable connection with your consumers because the words are literally coming straight from the happy customer’s mouth. With a video, you can see a real-life customer explaining thoroughly and convincingly how your company has made a positive impact on his life or business.
3- Video testimonials are more convincing and engaging as compared to text testimonials as they keep visitors on your business website longer & at the same time increase the chances that they will make a purchase.
4- Video testimonials are more efficient than written testimonials. They capture the raw emotion of your happy customers. It’s one thing to read what a customer has said about you. But it’s a whole new thing to see a happy customer on screen.
That’s why video testimonials are so crucial to your business’s success. Video testimonials are a referral for your business. Nothing sells your business as well as the positive and happy voice of an existing customer.
Approach your customers: First, you should identify the customers who are loyal and completely satisfied with their entire experience with your company. Call them and introduce to them the idea of the testimonial video and explain the concept – that the video will be edited and won’t contain anything they aren’t comfortable with.
Set a date and location for recording the video: Ideally, your client testimonials will be filmed in a comfortable and professional setting where the customer feels relaxed and prepared to discuss the details of his experience with your company. Tell him that you are willing to go to their offices at a time convenient for them.
Prepare a list of questions with anticipation (but not a script): This will help you get all the information you need for developing a compelling video, and it will help the customer understand and prepare the points that will be covered in the conversation.
Keep the video short and engaging: You obviously don’t want your video to be too long, but you should take care not to leave out any important parts of the conversation.
Promote your testimonial videos: Once the testimonial video is all edited, the best places to promote it include: your website, social media platforms, e-mail signature, in-store displays, newsletters, trade shows, client quotes and proposals. If positioned properly, professional-looking testimonial videos are some of the most powerful tools a business can have in its marketing toolbox.
A solid, high-quality, and professional testimonial video can go a long way, and will project the right image for your business and encourage prospects to choose you as their vendor.
If you don’t have any video testimonials right now, get them! Simply contact your customers and ask for their feedback on your business, products and services. Most happy customers will gladly provide this.
Nevertheless, to develop the most effective and better-quality video testimonials, you should find a professional company to assist you.
Ready to dive into creating customer testimonial videos for your business but not sure where to start?

Here is what I’ve noticed, when I leave free play at the lever it’s hard to engage the gears but when it’s tight at the lever it’s no problem. I’ve followed your instructions to the tee and still it boggles me. I guess I don’t know what I should expect with having your mods in there. Also where should the clutch start to grab? Very soon from the handle or in the middle? This has been racking my brain since I’ve owned the bike.

LibraryBox v2.0 is a combination of a router (a variety of hardware will work), USB drive, and software that, when combined, give you a small, low powered webserver. The webserver acts like a captive portal, and delivers files that are stored on the USB drive. To use LibraryBox, you simply connect to the wifi SSID “LibraryBox” and launch a browser. Attempting to visit any webpage will push you to the LibraryBox homepage on the device, which has information about the project, and links on the menu for downloads. You can browse the contents of the Shared folder, and download any files you’d like. The device you are using does have to be able to understand the download (for instance, downloading an EPUB ebook to a Kindle won’t really work).
Power on the LightStream Pocket and any nearby cell phone can connect to the WiFi hotspot and browse through the “netflix-like” user interface to select and download or stream the Christian media stored on the device. Put a microSD card in the microSD slot, and the LightStream Pocket will quickly copy the media over to the card and optionally lock it if you don’t want the media to ever be removed or deleted. Finally, the LightStream Pocket scans for bluetooth-enabled devices and automatically “pushes” the Christian media files to them. These 3 distribution methods make the LightStream an ideal solution to quickly and efficiently get Bibles and other Christian media to the people you’re trying to reach.
The Pastorbox Project involves the manufacturing and distribution of a highly rugged wireless hotspot that can deliver training to pastors and Christian leaders in remote areas.

Training reinforcement has many benefits, but the true value of a reinforcement program comes from its ability to create a large pool of data that can be used to create organizational change. We call this Actionable Intelligence.
Actionable Intelligence is used to make decisions about an organization’s training programs, helping to increase its effectiveness with behavior change and increased knowledge retention.
Simply collecting data is not creating Actionable Intelligence. You must analyze reinforcement data and use it to make predictions on why and what will happen, creating intelligence. Then, using your new intelligence, you’ll identify potential decisions regarding your training.
The first thing you should ask yourself when dealing with a training reinforcement program is: “Am I collecting the right information about my participants?” Many training programs are not built to create Actionable Intelligence, but instead rely on traditional data-collection methods such as end-of-training surveys (happy sheets) and reminder services.
Understanding exactly what happened during training and how to increase the effectiveness of your training takes more data and information than you can collect with traditional methods. Actionable Intelligence can only be gathered using a structured reinforcement program.
When creating a reinforcement program, it’s important that you start with the end in mind. What data do you need to collect in order to make organizational decisions that will impact your training and its return on investment?
Are you looking for an increase in sales, a decrease in deals lost, an increase in customer retention? If you start with the end in mind, you can make better decisions when analyzing your training reinforcement data. Start by setting training goal and reinforcement objectives.
How will you use Actionable Intelligence gathered from your training program? Although it’s ultimately up to you or your clients as to how you use the data gathered from your reinforcement program, we advise clients to use this information as soon as possible to see an increase in their results. Don’t wait until the end of your program before you analyze the data and make organizational changes!
The availability of reinforcement data is not an immediate way to improve the effectiveness of your training. You must take this data and convert it into Actionable Intelligence using our 5-step process.

Starting with Excel 2002, Microsoft have included the RTD interface which allows Excel to poll for data. Polling seems to be a much more efficient way of getting data into Excel than the classic approach which is pushing – it’s not uncommon to find yourself pushing when Excel isn’t ready which results in lockups, inconstitencies and other undesirable effects.
The RTD interface is small (6 methods) and Kenny Kerr has a great series of articles about RTD on his blog so I won’t repeat that information here and instead concentrate on integration to StreamLink.NET and pulling in real time data from a Caplin platform deployment.
The following walkthrough is a short example of how to do this, there’s no error checking, logging and certainly the example is nowhere near production quality, however it does demonstrate that linking up Excel and data from the Liberator is straightforward.
ServerStart is the entry point and in here we can instantiate StreamLink.NET and setup a map between the RTD topic ids and the Subject/Field information.
Because Excel polls for the data we’ve got to have a cache within our RTD server so that data is available when Excel calls in, for the purposes of this exercise we’re only considering Record data without market depth or history so our cache can be really simple:
The only missing part is the StreamLinkInterop class which integrates with StreamLink, this needs to implement the public methods we saw earlier: Subscribe, Unsubscribe and GetData as well as the IRecordSubscriptionListener interface from StreamLink.NET since we want to receive record updates. When an update is received we put it into our cache and return immediately.
There’s a couple of maps which allows finding the RecordType1Cache object from both the StreamLink side (using the IRecordSubscription as the key) and from the RTD side (using a subscription name as the key).
The connection to the server is setup in the constructor for code simplification purposes. The servername is hard coded so you’ll probably need to change it or find a way to configure it if you use this code as a base for your own project.
To pull data into excel into excel use a formula along the following lines: =RTD("com.caplin.excel",,"/I/MSFT.O", "BID"). The data in the cell will update periodically (by default every 2000ms). This period can be changed using either a registry setting or using VBA, details can be found at MSDN.
I'm an architect at Caplin, over the years I've worked on most of our server products and I'm now embracing the joys of the frontend as well.

Our friends from Liberty, who supply our lovely coffee beans, were also in the house to help us out behind the Elektra.
Since we've been open, we have gotten so many nice comments about our food and decor and furniture. Crowd favourites such as our Passionfruit Meringue Tart, Carrot Cake and Lemon Drizzle Cake, and oh not to forget the delicious homemade Passionfruit Marshmallows, have been flying off the shelf. We really can't make them fast enough!

I became motivated, and stayed motivated to run for senator because of the egregious lack of diversity among the current senate make-up. This issue of representation is something that extends beyond the lack of people of color representing CC in the University Senate because we also do not have any first-generation or low-income students currently representing CC. As a first-generation, low-income student of color myself I can speak to the feeling of othering that is had when you are one of the most historically marginalized identities but you have no voice on the highest acting body in the University. I do not naively believe that I can be the voice for all people that identify as people of color, first-gen, low-income since every person has their own unique experience, but I am supremely confident that I can do a better job than those that have never lived the experience. With that being said, the goals that I have for my senate tenure are things that will benefit the entire Columbia community. I seek to improve mental health support on campus, and sexual violence and response. These things all provide a wholesale positive affects the Columbia community, but they Mental health has become the number one issue at Columbia, and for good reason. Our community was rocked by the recent waves of suicide and it is clear that something must be done to better campus-wide mental health. The Student affairs community has already created a steering group that will work with the Jed foundation to evaluate how the university needs to address the issues of mental health on campus. Hence, my focus as a University Senator would ensure that the voices of Columbia’s most marginalized communities, who are disproportionately affected by mental health, are brought to the conversation on how to better mental health on campus. The initiative I would center in these conversations would be increasing the diversity of the CPS staff. Me and every other student of color or first-generation student who wanted to have their CPS staff member to be a person of color or a first-generation would have to wait even longer than normal to receive help. This wait time could be up to half of the semester, which is a ridiculous amount of time to have to wait to receive help. Further, I want to take a comprehensive look at how CPS is handled during NSOP in hopes of decreasing the stigma around mental health and ensuring that as many people get help as need help. One such program that I would advocate for would be an Opt-Out appointment that all freshmen would be signed up for. Each student would choose if they wanted to actually attend the appointment, but this would remove the initial stress and stigma of having to schedule an appointment with CPS in the first place.
Next, even though sexual violence has remained a big issue in campus, it does not seem that there has been effective reform. It would difficult to convince the university to allocate more funds, but we can take a comprehensive look at the programs we have now and how we can improve them. For example, there was an SVR requirement during NSOP, but it was very light and played down how big of an issue sexual violence is on campus. Hence as University Senator, I will take a look an extensive look at these programs, and bring in the voices of groups like No Red Tape to center the experience of survivors in the process of reform.
I do not know if I would use the word “fix”, but I would like to improve upon Columbia’s commitment to Community Service. Community Service is a lacking part of the Columbia experience. Many of us acknowledge and criticize Columbia for its negative impact on the Harlem community, but few of us spend a lot of time trying to help the community. That is largely in part to the fact that many students just do not have the time to spend looking for community service opportunities. Hence, I will want to work with SGB and ABC, the umbrella organizations that contain almost all students groups, to incentivize all student groups to have more service events. These incentives would be given in the form of increased budget allocation.
The Lion asked candidates five questions about their campaigns to give us insight into their aspirations and motivations for running. Here is what Maria Fernanda Martinez had to say:
Alumni Affairs–honestly, the closer graduation gets the more I realize how little we make use of our alumni connections and they’re one of our biggest resources on this campus. I want to make sure that this is a resource we all can feel comfortable using and knowledgeable about.
My goals are to increase accessibility in this area of our lives for all students, and I plan on achieving that by really keeping things simple and going back to basics. What is networking at its core about? It’s about making connections and maintaining relationships. The best way to do these things is to actually interact with people with whom we have shared interests and common backgrounds. My goals are simple: create a student-led newsletter for alumni, host curated alumni-student meet ups based on specific interests and backgrounds, and make sure to lead workshops prior to these meetings that help students work through anxieties about networking and provides folks with specific strategies they can implement.
I would love to push us towards an environment that is less about competing with each other and more about collaboration. I think this would be so useful in helping to deal with stress culture etc on campus. I plan on addressing this by creating spaces that function on the basis of people working together, and emphasizing that there is no need to compete when there are so many things to do and achieve!
While I am running for your Alumni Affairs representative, there is a wide range of issues that I have been involved in throughout my time at Columbia, and I will be able to represent our interests across the board.
The Lion asked candidates five questions about their campaigns to give us insight into their aspirations and motivations for running. Here is what Aaron Fisher had to say:
I’m running for CCSC Student Services Representative. For the past four semesters, I’ve been the head of Third Wheel Improv. Because the group is recognized at Barnard and not Columbia, we’ve had many issues concerning the governing boards and space allocation. In my capacity as head of my improv group, I began meeting with Columbia administrators about space allocation and club issues on our campus. Meanwhile, like many other students at Columbia, I’ve been alarmed and saddened by the mental health issues that affect our campus. I began thinking about how to tackle some of the many issues that we face as a community, and I started to realize that there are many seemingly small issues that, when fixed, would together improve our lives at Columbia. These issues range from the mundane–for example, the poor Internet connection in Butler–to larger, more essential issues, such as the lacking mental health support for many students in our community. Student services and community are intricately related: were we to have greater access to the lawns outside Butler, for example, we could further foster school spirit through events and Columbia traditions. I believe that because I’m a junior and have already been involved with a wide array of clubs and communities on our campus, I have the right mix of experience and freshness–I’ve never been involved with student government–to serve Columbia College as Student Services Representative.
I plan to keep Nightline open all night, instead of closing at 3:00am, as it currently does. I plan to achieve this goal by speaking with the heads of Nightline and with administrators who work to improve mental health on our campus. I think that given everything that has happened on our campus in the past year, and given that students already staff CAVA all night, there will surely be students who are willing to work shifts at Nightline past 3:00. I also plan to bring back Staff Appreciation Week, which CCSC spearheaded in November 2015, but then cut from its budget. During this week, students went up to members of dining services, mail services, security staff, and other staff positions and gave them stickers that said “We Appreciate You.” At the end of the week, there was a luncheon to honor our staff members. I believe a week like this is crucial because it’s important to show staff members that they’re just as much a part of the Columbia community as we are. I also think this goal will be easy to achieve because it won’t cost CCSC very much money, and will attract a lot of support from the student body. I also plan to work to keep the lawns outside Butler open longer in the fall, and when they do re-open in the spring, I will try to keep both lawns open more often, instead of just having one open. I believe having more space to relax and hang out with friends on campus during the week will help alleviate stress within the student body. I’ve already spoken with a couple of administrators about this issue, and as Student Services Representative, I plan on continuing this conversation, while making sure students who are not involved with student government are included in the discussion. To find out about more of my campaign ideas and about the rest of my platform, please visit my website here:
The overarching theme of my campaign is improving community through student services. Often, there are many small things that bother students and make our everyday lives more difficult. Columbia is our home, and it’s important for us to live here as comfortably as possible. I will work to address this issue, among other ways, through fixing smaller issues on our campus. These issues include the difficulty some student clubs and groups have of reserving adequate space on campus. I believe University Events Management should work with individual clubs to make sure they’re getting the spaces they need. For example, some performance groups might need to rehearse in larger spaces, while academic clubs might be fine with smaller classrooms. Another such issue is the lack of air conditioning and the problem of overheating in some of the older residence halls on campus. As Student Services Rep, I’ll work with Columbia Housing to figure out solutions to these problems on our campus.
As I have written about in Spectator, too often, CCSC seems distant—even irrelevant—to many Columbia students. As your Student Services Representative, I will hold office hours to speak with any student about your ideas for how to make Columbia’s student services work better for you. Only by such measures of open communication can we learn from each other and ensure our voices are heard. After all, every one of us makes Columbia home, and every one of us deserves the best experience possible.
The Lion asked candidates to tell us about their campaigns to give us insight into their aspirations and motivations for running. Here is what Ethan Kestenberg had to say:
Hi! I’m Ethan, and I’m running for Pre-Professional Representative (no party affiliation). For the past two years, I’ve worked on CCSC as an appointed representative. As a freshman, I served as Secretary of CCSC ’19. We were able to combat food insecurity issues on campus by partnering with 18 local restaurants to create discount meal programs for all 24,000 Columbia students. This year, I am working on the Committee of Finance, and am in the final stages of developing a new Student Events Fund to alleviate prohibitive event fees for eligible students on financial aid.
I want to continue my involvement with CCSC because I believe in the power of community. CCSC provides me with the greatest opportunity not only to get more connected with our community, but also to give back to it. I’ve learned that, without a doubt, the best thing our class council can do is build upon our community. The diversity of our student body, the array of our distinct individual voices, that’s our strength. I firmly believe that this position should be focused on expanding our community so that students of all backgrounds can soak in the rich benefits of our collective body. It’s not about getting everyone an interview at Goldman Sachs, or securing more offers at McKinsey. It’s about building people. It’s about paving the stones of our community. Then the rest will follow.
If elected Pre-Professional Representative, I will promote a more equitable pre-professional environment at Columbia so that students of all backgrounds can confidently prepare for their future careers. I will do so through three stages of community building.
First, I will tackle the hyper-competitive nature of pre-professional club recruitment at Columbia. It is no question that there are many aspects of Columbia that are unduly stressful; club recruitment is no exception. While pre-professional clubs provide students with incredible opportunities, the admissions processes for many pre-professional clubs systematically favor students with certain backgrounds over others, perpetuating already existing student imbalances. This club culture leaves many students feeling rejected and discouraged, particularly freshmen who are not accustomed to such levels of competition. This culture of rejection is installed by freshmen resume ‘screens’, rigorous interview processes, and students not being informed when they are rejected from student groups. I will work hard to ensure club recruitment is more egalitarian by addressing these burdensome club recruitment policies. I will implement a “no-resume rule” for freshmen applying to recognized pre-professional organizations. I will also ensure that clubs provide sample interview questions before each interview to increase transparency and level the playing field. It’s my mission to ensure that pre-professional clubs serve our entire community. This can only be done through an encouraging and cohesive environment, not one that pawns student against student, club against club. I will implement these policies by working with the Policy Committee to draft a motion for what constitutes hyper-competitive club recruitment policies. Then, I will work together with the Activities Board at Columbia to limit access to the activities fair for clubs engaging in hyper-competitive policies. I will also work together with SGA, GSSC, and ESC to curtail excess funding approvals through JCCC to clubs not complying with the CCSC bill.
Second, I will foster diversity in student career choices by connecting students and faculty through a Pre-Professional Mentorship Program. The initiative would enable students with the opportunity to build and develop close relationships with professors in their field of interest. Recent research suggests that schools that implement student-faculty mentorship programs not only reduce student feelings’ of being marginalized, but also empower students to embrace their unique identities. This program will inspire students to explore the various arcs along their career path, offering direction and encouragement to those who lack guidance in navigating the professional world. Moreover, this program will enable students with the ability to work one-on-one with their mentors through student projects, faculty research, and professional work experience. I am confident that this initiative will greatly enhance the focus and clarity of many student’s academic and pre-professional profiles. It will allow our community to soak in the knowledge and experience of our incredible, multifaceted faculty, and break away from the cookie-cutter mold so prevalent at Columbia. I will implement this initiative by first creating a taskforce on the Policy Committee to determine the preliminary structure of the program to propose to the administration. I recommend the proposal include several features, such as designating a faculty member as the program coordinator who is in charge of leading an orientation meeting with mentors and students at the beginning of the program. The proposal should also include some requirements on all mentorship participants, likely requiring each pair to meet at least once a month. Once we draft our proposal, I will work together with Dean Lisa Hollibaugh of Academic Planning and Administration to set up the role of program coordinator, and I will look to Dean Andrew Plaa of Advising for assistance in the development of our Pre-Professional Mentorship Program. Personally, I envision it will be most pragmatic to start with a small experimental group next year – say, fifteen mentor-mentoree pairs—in order to determine what works and what doesn’t work in the program. Then, the plan will be to build off our beta test by rolling out access to the program the following year to the greater Columbia community. We will create an application process for students interested in the program, which will consist of a variety of ‘fit’ and ‘interest’ questions to develop a well-rounded class of mentorees to benefit students of all backgrounds. Our taskforce on the CCSC Policy Committee will interview and screen all applicants to the program. This year on the Committee of Finance, through the Student Project Grants fund, we held a very similar interview and screen process that has proven markedly effective and pragmatic for CCSC to handle.
And finally, I will implement a CCSC database dedicated to pre-professional development that will be constantly maintained and updated each year. To name some examples, the database will include a library of Graduate School Prep Books, an archive of where current and former CC students have worked, and a series of guides on how to master industry-specific interviews. I will collaborate with CCE and our Alumni Affairs representative to ensure that this database is both comprehensive and applicable to Columbia students. This database will build on top of what CCE has to offer, however, it will have a student-minded spin. This initiative will leverage the benefits of near-peer mentorship. While CCE offers many great resources, it’s important to recognize that CCE is overtaxed in many areas and offers an adult-oriented approach to navigating the professional world. I believe that student-engineered database will perfectly complement the resources that CCE offers. Many of the greatest tools we use at Columbia are peer-developed. Think ‘CULPA’, the late ‘gradesatcu’, or Spec’s ‘THE SHAFT’. The initiative will be centered around an online forum for Columbia students to contribute tips and advice on industry-specific interviews, graduate school preparation, and relevant employer information. The forum will be built for students, by students. I hope to interweave this forum with our archive of where current and former CC students have worked so that students can contact their peers regarding specific posts or advice they’re interested in. The ultimate goal is to build a network of peer-developed resources that not only enriches our community, but also inspires interconnectedness across Columbia.
Overall, I see several clear ways of leveraging the responsibility of this position. First, by decreasing the hyper-competitiveness of pre-professional clubs and organizations on campus to expand our community; second, by fostering a pre-professional student-faculty mentorship program to deepen our community; and finally, by developing a warehouse of knowledge that enriches our community. I believe each measure will empower individual student growth and development, while reducing the necessity of students falling into the cookie-cutter mold that we so often get trapped in the vicious battle for internships and jobs.
This position is more than preparing students for the professional life. It’s more than building resumes. It’s about building individuals. It’s about strengthening a community and raising everyone together, not just supporting those already at the top. The greatest thing I can do for this community is to make it more equitable, diverse, and interconnected. I’m excited to do so by reinvigorating our pre-professional development.
The Lion asked candidates to tell us about their campaigns to give us insight into their aspirations and motivations for running. Here is what the members of the Low Beach Party had to say:
My name is Dave Mendelson, and I’m running for CCSC President with Low Beach Party! The thought that many of my peers don’t enjoy their time at Columbia, and that there are a few tangible things I can do to help build the CU community, is what motivates me to run for CCSC Executive Board. I feel that the re-election of this year’s executive board would leave many students in the same place as they were this year; Low Beach Party brings in fresh ideas and a complete restructuring of CCSC that will significantly improve the student experience at Columbia.
Our goals are threefold: events to decrease stress culture, policies to promote mental well-being, and CCSC re-structuring to bolster minority representation. On the intriguing topic of Fall Bacchanal: I have been working with administrators since November to plan this event, and I have figured out exactly how to craft it such that we can make it a campus tradition. First, we need to compromise with the administration and addresses their largest concern: student behavior. We will start small with something like a DJ on the lawns, and by successfully demonstrating to the administration that students will treat their peers, public safety officers, and livers with respect, we will move into a large-scale concert on the Steps. We offer this as an alternative to our opponent’s “fall bacchanal-esque” conert at Baker; I proposed this idea to the administration in January, and they told me that the noise would upset the local residents, and thus Columbia would not host this event. We also plan to host a TEDx Columbia and a few other events that our VP Campus Life Candidate, Vik, will tell you about in his interview.
I know that Kristen will talk more about our proposals to CPS and policies on mental health, so I will go into detail on our proposal to open access to course materials. To promote equity for students who cannot take all the courses they want to during their time at Columbia, potentially because of a part-time job or health issue, we will urge administrators to allow students to access readings and presentations from all courses offered at Columbia, not only ones that you are currently or were previously enrolled in. This is something that I have spoken to many professors about, and they really support this idea.
On the re-structuring of CCSC- this aims to fix the issue of the lack of minority representation on CCSC. It is impossible to elect students of every identity, every year, to represent the student body. With that said, we believe that people from a specific group facing an issue are best suited to speak on that issue and generate solutions. Thus, we aim to amend the CCSC constitution to build a Committee on Diversity and Inclusion, which would have representatives from many student groups and volunteers. The Committee would be led by the Inclusion and Equity Representative, and it would help plan events and policy proposals that specifically benefit members of our community who are not currently represented by CCSC. We also aim to create the positions of Sustainability Representative, Disabilities Representative, and Mental Health Representative, to spend all of their time working on initiatives specific to those three causes and hosting town halls on their respective areas of expertise.
I’m running for VP Finance of CCSC. I felt motivated to run because I’ve seen firsthand over the past two years that I’ve been on the Finance Committee the massive discrepancy that exists between the amount of resources this university has and the amount of resources that actually make their way to students. I’ve formulated a platform that will address this larger concern, making funding more accessible to student groups and ensuring there aren’t cost barriers for students to engage in campus life.
I have several platform points that aim at reducing cost barriers for students to engage in campus life and to improve funding mechanisms for student groups. First I want to finalize the Student Events Fund. I served as the point person this year for the Students Event Fund initiative, working with administrators across different offices to create a fund that would cover the ticket costs of Columbia events for students who otherwise. The Dean’s office has indicated their support for this initiative, and I would finish putting this initiative into place by finalizing the logistical details of the fund with the Office of Financial Aid, the TIC, and Undergraduate Student Life to ensure student confidentiality. Next I want to create an Art Class Registration Fund. Currently cc students have to pay registration costs for art classes, as well as supply costs, that aren’t covered by the administration or financial aid that can total thousands of dollars. Students shouldn’t be prevented from taking a major or classes at a school like Columbia because off their financial status, and I’ve spoken to students who’ve said they couldn’t do an art major because it was too cost prohibitive. I would work with the deans office as well as the office of financial aid to help create this fund to cover registration fees for these classes and then look to expand it to cover supply costs. Next, I would create a Morningside Heights restaurant week. This concept is one that’s been implemented as several of our peer institutions such as Princeton and Yale. This week would allow all CC students to explore all the eating options in Morningside Heights at a reduced cost. During my first year at Columbia, I helped with securing restaurant discounts with my class council, so I would look to use my experience to make this event happen. Finally, I would make a reform to the JCCC (the Joint Council Co-Sponsorship Committee) constitution to create a per—student price cap. The past two years I’ve been on JCCC, the Fund has run out, which has prevented student groups that apply at the end of the year from getting adequate or any funding. This change would ensure that students groups get the funding they need, regardless of when they apply in the year.
I want to help change the campus culture. We have a rampant stress culture at Columbia. Student council should be at the forefront of changing that culture on campus. I would address this issue through working with the other members of my party to plan fun events that bring the community together, such as a Fall Bacchanal and a TEDx Columbia. Additionally, a number of my Finance initiatives are geared towards making our community one that is all accessible to all students. If there are financial barriers for students to engage in campus life, it’s impossible for our community to come together to address stress culture for everyone on this campus. That’s why I have worked on and plan on implementing projects like the Student Events Fund and the Morningside Heights Restaurant Week – because I want to bring out campus together and reduce stress culture.
I love working on student council. I feel it’s one of the most effective avenues of bringing positive change to campus. I have an extensive platform and the experience to make it happen – serving as Vice President of my Class this year and on the Finance Committee for the past two years, funding student groups through JCCC nearly every week, managing the Capital Investment Fund twice and again funding student groups, working on Student Project Grants, and pushing the Student Events Fund to its final stages. I will spend every second as VP Finance to address the needs of students and student groups on this campus, as I’ve always done.
I am affiliated with Low Beach Party, and I’m running for Vice President of Communications. Throughout my first year at Columbia, while I felt that I was reasonably involved in a variety of campus groups, it seemed as if student government was always a bit out of reach and inaccessible. Only when I started considering for running did I begin to hear about the debates going on within CCSC doors, and felt as if more students should be aware of student council and aware of how they can use it to have their own concerns addressed as well.
Given my background and motivations for running, my main platform focus is on transparency. If elected, the first and easiest thing I’d like to do is bring back livestreaming CCSC meetings. ESC does it, CCSC has done it consistently in some years in the past, but this year the practice was not consistently continued. After elections were pushed back 2 weeks, a member of elections board and I tried to look for the recordings of the meetings in which the delay was discussed, but were unable to find anything and had to rely on hearsay about the meetings and what was discussed in them. Additionally, we’d like to better promote and publicize the CCSC website. It’s a really useful way to disseminate information and communicate with the student body. We’d add features to it, like a line of direct question that anybody could type any question in, and a member of exec board would have to respond within 48 hours. This way, any student could immediately have any concern addressed, and be able to voice any input they felt should be brought up at the next council meeting. We also would like to meet personally with representatives from student groups, especially those representing marginalized groups on campus. We feel as if administrative change is often slow and difficult from high up down, but if student groups can talk to members of student council exec board on a personal basis, they can very easily have their concerns voiced in student council meetings for much quicker remedies.
On top of the CCSC website, we’d like to improve CCSC’s facebook presence also. Using a combination of email and social media to survey and poll the student body would be effective at gauging student feelings about issues, and these polls and surveys can be incentivized by entering participants into raffles for gift cards or other simple rewards. Generally, it seems like an easier way to communicate with students is via catchy infographics on their newsfeed, rather than blocks of text in long emails.
Other than facilitating student council-student body connections, much of my platform is dedicated to helping to communicate to students information about the resources they have to them. So, I’d like to work together with health and wellness clubs on a wellness fair, to have fun events and free item giveaways to publicize these organizations. I’d like to revamp alcohol and sexual violence awareness training, both by increasing in person training, and reworking the standards for groups and organizations like Greek organizations and sports teams.
In general, the Communications role is all about information. And so, my job would be to facilitate the connections between students and campus life, and between students and CCSC. This way, we can all know how to best move forward collectively.
I’m running for VP Campus Life. Currently I think the perception of Campus Life is solely as an event planning committee and I think that Campus Life entails not only events but also the wellbeing of the student body, both physical and mental. I was motivated to run because over 3 years at Columbia I have never been enticed by a Campus Life event and thus have never had a positive impact from the committee. Obviously I am not alone and thus I want to change the way Campus Life creates events to help students who feel marginalised or students that don’t have a place on this campus to feel included. I think this is an amazing way to combat mental health issues faced by students.
Our party in an effort to be transparent has divided our platform into two sections: policy and advocacy. Policy changes are those that come within CCSC and we will definitely be able to secure. Advocacy points are those under other Columbia authorities that we will advocate for making sure the students voices are heard.
TedX Columbia: A great way for faculty, guest speakers and even students to share their stories with a wider audience
Fridays at the Beach: Student groups and music playing on the laws and at Low, to raise moral among students
Involving Reslife and RHLO to advertise out events make sure they are better attended and utilise them to plan bigger and better events
Week Long events before Bacchanal: Inclusive events for everybody! There are still some students during events like Bacchanal and homecoming that do not feel included these events would allow them to be more involved.
Late Nights at Lerner: Make Lerner a place where students can meet and interact at night! Have Music Playing, allowing people to use Lerner not only to study but also to relax!
Rebuild this community! I want it to be a place where everyone feels included, people attend sports games, people meet new people all the time! I would address this by having events that inspire socialising, inclusion and school spirit.
While I am not an incumbent, I believe that CCSC requires radical change and fresh voices. I have not benefitted from CCSC in the past and I believe I am not alone, CCSC should be a body that makes a positive impact on everybody on this campus.
My name is Kristen Santiago and I’m running as VP Policy with Low Beach Party. I decided to run as VP Policy because I have had the opportunity to make an impact in groups I truly care about on campus. This past year, however, I realized that those who aren’t a part of such passionate, warm groups often do not feel the same way on campus. Thus, I decided to run in the hopes of making an impact on a larger scale so that everybody feels included and a part of the Columbia community, which is currently lacking on a large scale.
If elected, I would hope to expand CPS to combat the prevalent mental health issues on campus by advocating for identity-specific counselors for those who only feel comfortable approaching someone of a certain identity. Additionally, I would advocate for CPS to be a presence at career fairs given how stressful of an environment these can be. I would work closely with CPS and the administration to bring these proposals to fruition.
Additionally, we would like to create a mental health day form, modeled after Duke STINF (Short Term Illness Notification Form), for students to notify professors that they will not be in attendance that day to due to mental health reasons. Hopefully the administration will then adopt this form so that students can take a day off when absolutely necessary.
With regards to the tampon initiative, I would like to collect data to determine the need for sanitary items around campus and to increase the stock of sanitary items in restrooms so that no financial strain or inaccessibility would prevent a female from having these essential sanitary items.
I will also pressure the administration to create a prayer space for Muslim students in either Uris or Lerner, along with a dining hall in Uris.

I learned an interesting fact the other day from visiting one of my favorite bloggers, Carson at The 7MSN Ranch. Actually, I always learn interesting facts from Carson, especially as she’s about 15 years ahead of me in this City to Ranch transition. Unlike my Dubya Style Ranching (defined as a having the trappings of a ranch except no livestock but terriers), Carson has a real ranch in, as she describes it, Seven Miles South of Nowhere, New Mexico. You want livestock? She’s not only got livestock, but the most personality-forward livestock this side of the set of Babe. As an added bonus, most of them are named after iconic country singers. There are the goats, Willie and Waylon (the latter now sadly deceased), Lyle and Hank the Horses, George and Alan the Burros (named after Strait and Jackson for you non-country fans), and Wynonna the Pig. There were some chickens called The Dixie Chicks, but they aren’t talked about much these days. Carson’s now veering off to naming conventions from the great Western novel, Lonesome Dove, hence Deets the Barn Cat. Smooch the Dog, deserved a name of her own devising.
Anyway, back to that interesting factoid. Have you ever wondered why the West, with millions and millions more acres of tick-infested grasslands, doesn’t have the same or higher incidence of Lyme Disease as the built-up East Coast? Okay, I wonder about these things.
Apparently, when ticks are young. Really young and about the size of a pinhead, their host of choice is the Western Fence Lizard. But when they draw in the blood of the lizard, an interesting thing happens. The tick’s blood is cleansed of the Lyme Disease spirochete (or whatever it is.) So when that tick then grows up and bites you, or your horse, or your terrier, it’s disgusting, but not as dangerous. (It’s all more scientifically explained here.)
Western Fence Lizards, in addition to hanging out on fences, absolutely love stone walls. Luckily, we’ve got loads of them. Yes, we went a little crazy with stone walls up here. Maybe because we have more stones than anything else on our property and we know a great father/son pair, Felix Jr. and Felix Sr., who build beautiful stone walls the traditional Mexican way. Now I’m realizing the stone walls are a health clinic as well as a Club Med for Western Fence Lizards. We’re talking a first line of defense in the prevention of Lyme Disease. I’ve never been so grateful for Oscar and Lucy’s general incompetence as hunters.
(In spite of the help of the hardest working lizards in show business, still be vigilant about tick bites. Work hard to prevent them and, if you get one, watch for the tell-tale signs of Lyme Disease.)
Oh, and Carson? Check out her site. Especially one of my favorite posts: the one where the herd takes on a pack of coyotes and kicks butt.
Although I'd like to think of myself as a rootin', tootin', wine-makin' cowgirl, I currently only live in Sonoma part-time. Mostly I'm on freeways between San Jose and Sonoma. With two yapping terriers in crates behind me. We try to enjoy both places and points in between. Which will explain why my post subjects are all over the map.
You know, when you did your post about Dooce’s remodel and chopped liver and where are the comments, I thought I really should do a post about your blog because it’s so stinkin’ well-written I can barely stand it and people who would love reading it and don’t live in Eastern Europe just haven’t found it and dang that’s a long sentence, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet and now it’s going to seem all like ‘she plugged me so I’d better plug her’ but that’s not it at all. In a blogosphere where so many have so little to say in so many words, only a few stand out as unique and worth reading, and yours is one of those. Thanks for all the kind words you had to say about mine.
Glad to do it for one of the best blogs out there. Just put in a good word for me with Alan and George. And what DID happen to the Dixie Chicks, anyway?
The Dixie Chicks went off to live at the chicken rescue when they stopped laying eggs. Rookie chicken farmer that I was, I kept a light on in their hen house during the winter to mimic the longer daylight hours they need to keep laying. Little did I know that would confuse the heck out of them come spring. So they stopped laying and didn’t seem very happy. I couldn’t bring myself to release them in the wild for coyote bait, so I found someone to adopt them. They made a comeback and started laying again at the new place.
Very interesting about the lizards. Having grown up in the fine Garden State, and having seen friends get lyme disease and the horrifying symptoms we are especially careful when out in tall grass. Where we live now, it is also a high risk area. When my son was 8 we got back from a camping trip and sure enough, he had a tick embedded in his chest. Very scary. Wound up with a huge rash and luckily we got the meds to him quickly. You are doing a great public service here. I’m not sure that many people are aware of the scary consequences of a run-in with a bug the size of a pinhead.
Thanks to those lizards! And the burros are darling…I’ve always thought them to be such placid looking animals. You rarely see a burro with an angry look 😀
Most ticks do not carry diseases, and most tick bites do not cause serious health problems. But it is important to remove a tick as soon as you find it. Removing the tick’s body helps you avoid diseases the tick may pass on during feeding. Removing the tick’s head helps prevent an infection in the skin where it bit you. See the Home Treatment section of this topic for the best way to remove a tick.`’;’

One fellow's interpretation of a "finished" version of Tekedon's "Swamp Castle Beta". Make no mistake, this is overwhelmingly Tekedon's gorgeous work, somewhat altered, slightly embellished, and expanded by myself. It's been several months (and numerous revisions) in the making, but it has finally reached the stage where I consider it not only enjoyable, but quite "complete". (Naturally, YOUR results may vary.)
I thank Tekedon tremendously for this unique opportunity to "stand on the shoulders of giants". I loved this map at very first sight, and have sought to maintain what I perceived to be his intended theme throughout, though there are some changes and re-messaging. (Pay close attention to those messages, by the way; among other things, they'll spare you a lot of grief.)
A scant few difficulty settings have been added, for skills 1-3. Ammo and health should be quite plentiful regardless, though I recommend skill 1 or 2 for a *slightly* less stressful romp. Additional enemy placement has been done with "intensity" rather than "lethality" as the criteria. (I love a good "shit-kicker" myself, but really don't fancy the notion of "Impossible deeds cheerfully done.")

These statements are based on the assumptions and assessments made by Abbey Protection and/or Markel in light of their experience and their perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate and are naturally subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained herein may include statements about the expected effects of the Acquisition, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition, anticipated earnings enhancements, estimated cost savings and other synergies, costs to be incurred in achieving synergies, potential disposals and other strategic options and all other statements in this announcement other than historical facts.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, changes in circumstances and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Many of these risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond the ability of the person making the statement to control or estimate precisely.

In Greek mythology, the word Kleoss means ‘renown’ or ‘glory’. A Greek hero earns Kleoss through accomplishing great deeds, which create a reputation that precedes him.

There was a Shabbaton at my synagogue this past Shabbes with Rabbi Marcia Prager and her husband, Cantor Jack Kessler. Not being someone who davens best in a prayer session, I convinced Judy to come with me for Havdalah and a kickass concert by Jack, his son, and local musicians such as Dena Ressler.
I should mention that I really like Jack's cantorial and Middle Eastern CDs, but the real fun lies in the recordings by his simkha ensemble, the aptly named Klingon Klezmer. And at Temple Beth Zion, Jack managed to infuse a skilled group of pick-up musicians with the Klingon Klezmer fun in a short set that covered familiar repertoire in an unusually energetic and danceably entertaining manner. A delightful time was had by all.
And I am left wondering about the Philadelphia Jewish music scene. It isn't just the Klingons. It's Ken Ulansey's amazing band, and Benny & the Vilda Chayas and the Watts family women and Rachel Lemisch—and lest I forget, this is the town that gave us Hankus Netsky and Charlie Berg and Anthony Coleman and more. Some mighty interesting music happening there.
And while you wait for me to do an official review, you can take my word for it that the new Klingon Klezmer CD is as wonderful a mix of klezmer as done by people who may have taken more drugs than the rest of us during the Sixties, and/or listened to their rock music a bit louder, and who still haven't lost the sense of joy and the madcap fusion of styles that came out of that era. Still klezmer, but definitely not my bubbe's klezmer, for sure. Pick up a copy on CDBaby.com today.

It’s a good day for the crypto markets. In fact, all of the top ten coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap are seeing green. Coins on this list include Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM), and NEO. Bitcoin (BTC), of course, is on this list, currently up 3.03% in the past twenty-four hours. However, that’s not the coin we’re going to focus on today.
Ethereum (ETH) is currently selling for $586.15. This puts the ETH coin up 7.07% in the past twenty-four hours. Ethereum (ETH) is ranked as the 2nd largest virtual currency, with a market capitalization of $57,992,546,630.
Ethereum (ETH) is clearly approaching $600, so it will be interesting to see if the coin will reach that price level, or if it will fall before it gets a chance.
So what caused Ethereum (ETH) to jump? Well, interestingly, there has not been any news announced today that would explain Ethereum (ETH) being up more than 7% in the past twenty-four hours. It’s either that April 20th is just a good day for cryptocurrencies – and that appears to be so – or it’s because the marketplace has become increasingly more interested in Ethereum after the platform announced its involvement with NASA.
Reportedly, NASA is looking at using Ethereum blockchain to conduct a deep-space exploration project. Since the project was unveiled, the public has become intrigued in finding out more details about it.
Stellar (XLM) is currently selling for $0.367357. This puts the XLM coin up 2.03% in the past twenty-four hours. Stellar is ranked as the 7th largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $6,821,536,530.
It has been a pretty significant week for Stellar. The platform made a number of moves in the past 7 days which impacted its growth. One of the moves, for instance, was the announcement that the Stellar network partnered with the Novatti group. This is most likely the reason why the coin is up in the past twenty-four hours. As a global software technology provider, Novatti group partnering with Stellar Network for the integration of blockchain payments is bound to have innovative results.
This is a coin I have been looking at over the course of the week. Primarily because NEO just kicked off its European tour, which means exciting announcements are likely on the way. NEO already announced one announcement in Amsterdam, at the first stop of the tour.
NEO is in Madrid today so stay alert for possible announcements from the Spanish leg of its tour. In other news this week, NEO’s first decentralized exchange project – ‘Switcheo’, has officially gone live.
Were you surprised by any of these coins today? I wasn’t. Out of these three, however, I hope to see Ethereum (ETH) climb further so it can move past the $600 mark.

The IG Client Sentiment Indicator is an essential trader’s tool for keeping in touch with market positioning and changes.
The cryptocurrency market is currently building a trading range, with a slight upside bias, testing and breaking resistance levels along the way. Volatility and volume remain low in the main due to a lack of fundamental market-moving news. In the case of Ether (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) that may be about to change if talk that the SEC is studying the pairs classification is correct. If either, or both, are seen as securities under SEC regulations, then volatility will return in short order with prices expected to fall. The unregulated exchanges which currently host ETH and XRP may be unwilling to continue to keep trading the tokens if they are seen as securities as heavy regulatory scrutiny and fines would follow. Ripple is predominantly traded in Korea while Ether has mass adoption across a range of exchanges.

I just found this really cool free messaging app (similar to Whatsapp, but cooler) because it lets you earn cryptocurrency just by using it and getting linked up with your friends, family and colleagues to chat. You can even set up group chats, and private chats with your friends, or set up broadcast lists and send out a message to a group of people at once like an autoresponder. Big plus...they don't sell your private information from your conversations, like skype does. I think this concept is amazing, as it introduces the average person to cryptocurrency in a very non obtrusive way.
