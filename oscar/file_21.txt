Orvieto is like your fun uncle who has a surprise adventure ready every time you show up. This time we stayed in a room overlooking the Duomo, and on awakening, we watched a couple old Fiats drift into the empty piazza. Fun! After breakfast in the basement, we returned to our window to see that the Fiats had now multiplied to about 30, and the adventure was on. Soon, at least 100 Fiats had gathered, with horns blaring and people swarming like some Roberto Benigni movie. Finally, of course, the bishop arrived to bless the crowd and their cars. And then they were gone. A flash mob, Italian style.

Before we provide you with materials, products or services, we may use personal information you have given us together with information we have collected from external sources such as credit reference agencies, company reports and profiles, electoral role, directories, or fraud prevention agencies. We use this information to manage our credit risk, and prevent and detect fraud and money laundering. We’ll also use these organisations to confirm your identity. We might also share the information with other organisations. We do this because it’s in our, and the organisations’, legitimate interests to prevent fraud and money laundering, and to check identities, to protect our business and to keep to laws that apply to us. Details of the personal information that will be used include your name, address, company name if relevant, contact details, financial information, employment details if relevant. If you don’t become one of our customers, we’ll still keep the result of these checks about you if we have a legal obligation and it’s in our legitimate interests to help prevent or detect fraud. Fraud prevention agencies can hold your personal information for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your information can be held by us and the organisations we share it with for up to ten years. If you give us false or inaccurate information which we identify as fraudulent, we’ll pass that on to fraud prevention agencies. We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with. If you tell us you’re associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we’ll link your records together. So you must make sure you have their agreement to share information about them. The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link. If we, a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you. The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please get in touch with us using the contact details found in the 'How to contact us and further details' section below. We may send credit reference and fraud prevention agencies information about you, and they keep that information. We might also give them details of your accounts and bills, including how you manage them. This includes telling them about your account balances, what you pay us and if you miss a payment (going back in the past, too). So if you don't pay your bills on time, credit reference agencies will record that. They, or a fraud prevention agency, might tell others doing similar checks – including organisations trying to trace you or recover money you owe them. There are different credit reference agencies in the UK (for example, Callcredit, Equifax and Experian). Each one might hold different information about you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they may charge you a small fee. Whenever credit reference and fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area. They may also make the organisation receiving the information subscribe to ‘international frameworks’ aimed at sharing information securely. When we have been contacted a reasonable number of times by the same person without securing any sales of materials, products or services; it may be treated as a delusive contact and future correspondence treated appropriately with the company in house policies. Your details will be kept and flagged up on the system when future correspondence is made to ensure the companies operation and safety is priority. These details will include your name, address, contact phone number and email address including a description of previous correspondence made; and maybe kept for up to ten years or longer depending on the seriousness of the correspondence and repeated nature of it.
If you don’t pay your bills, we might ask a debt-recovery agency to collect what you owe or seek legal proceedings. We’ll give them information about you (such as your contact details) and your account (the amount of the debt) and all correspondences and agreements relating to the debt; and may choose to sell the debt to another organisation to allow us to receive the amount due (see clause 7.11 of our terms and conditions provided with estimates and quotes sent).
Fresh Start Decorators might have to release personal information about you to meet legal and regulatory obligations. Fresh Start Decorators will need to share your personal information with the emergency services if it is necessary to protect you, or another person, or us and because it is in our interests to help. For instance In the event of an accident or incident that requires us to contact an ambulance we may need to share your name, address, phone number and any medical information we know of and possibly materials, products or services that have been used, supplied or carried out. To meet Health and Safety legislation we may need to share the same personal information to HSE and/or RIDDOR if certain serious workplace accidents, occupational diseases and specified dangerous occurrences (near misses). The same information including your email address may need to be provided to the local council or governing body for application licenses (such as scaffolding permits, road closures). We may also need to share your personal information with our insurance providers for any claims or other related insurance purposes.
Fresh Start Decorators might have to share personal information about you to government and law-enforcement agencies, such as the police or hmrc. They might ask for the following details.

That might be when a law says we have to share that information or because of a court order. In limited circumstances, we may also share your information with other public authorities, even if we do not have to. However, we would need to be satisfied that a request for information is lawful and proportionate (in other words, appropriate to the request). And we would need appropriate assurances about security and how the information is used and how long it is kept.

We use other providers to carry out services on our behalf or to help us provide services to you. We also use them to:
•	analyse and improve the information we hold (including about your interactions with our service); and
Where we use another organisation in house, we still control your personal information. And we have strict controls in place to make sure it’s properly protected. Finally, the section above describes the situations in which your personal information is shared to other organisations, government bodies and law-enforcement agencies. When we share your information with other organisations we’ll make sure it’s protected, as far as is reasonably possible. If there’s a change (or expected change) in who owns us or any of our assets, we might share personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. If we do, they’ll have to keep it confidential.
We have strict security measures to protect your personal information. We check your identity when you get in touch with us prior to disclosing any of your information, and we follow our security procedures and apply suitable technical measures, such as encryption and internet security software, to protect your information.
In other cases we’ll store personal information for the periods needed for the purposes for which the information was collected or for which it is to be further processed. And sometimes we’ll keep it for longer if we need to by law. Otherwise we delete it.

I have installed the free version of module Sexy Polling into a gospel website, I wanted to know if you would accept to remove the word "sexy" and replace it by something else as it's not good for religious platform websites as the one I integrated it in.

Tomorrow I’m doing my first brew. The beer shall be a bitter. At this point in time, I should mention that all I really know about beer is that I enjoy drinking it.
It wasn’t always this way. The first time I had a sip of what my Dad was drinking, I spat it out. It was warm, watery, bitter and flat. It had a kind of sickly, poisoned taste. There was even a time, as a young teenage girl, when the idea of sitting down to drink beer actually horrified me. Beer is so full of carbs, and calories, I thought. It doesn’t even taste that good, I thought.
My low opinion of beer was only reinforced by my friends. They agreed that beer was for boys. We would stick to our vodka cruisers and our cocktails, thank you all the same.
After years of prejudice and beverage based gender stereotyping, I gave beer another chance. Years before I had been involved with a theatre group on Waiheke Island, and as a result I had become acquainted with Alan Knight. Anyone seriously interested in the beer industry can probably see where I’m going by this point.
“You simply must try this beer I’ve just brewed,” were the first words out of his mouth when I showed up at his house with some fellow cast-mates one day. “Beer?” I asked nervously, instantly becoming lost in rapid fire mental gymnastics as I tried to recalculate my caloric total for the day (I was forever on some diet).
“You’ll like this one,” he promised, pulling beer out of the hand pump and into a tall pint glass. It was a dark amber liquid with a lacey, cloud-like head. Alan passed the pint glass over the bar “It’s tasting magnificent.”
I took the glass hesitantly, and following the example of a tall, dark-haired young man, I took a gulp. Imagine my surprise when instead of the sad, stale taste I was expecting, my palette was greeted with oranges, summer sun and elderflowers. It must have showed on my face, I took another appreciative sip, and just like that, I loved beer.
Since then I learned that beer isn’t really about gender. Beer transcends borders. It unites us. Beers like Chick the beer just for women have entirely the wrong idea, because when it comes down to it, drinking beer isn’t about being a man, or being a woman. Drinking beer is about being the wonderful, gloriously flawed human creature that you are and having fun with life.

Where an East Coast contingent of Flyers do some Catskill Canyon carving, hit a Home Run in Cooperstown and get a tasting of a 'first come first served' Dill's Run Winery and B&B....with a cameo appearance by Chairman Walt & Sandy.
In which the Flyers set their sights on the grey mountains (Adirondacks), Green Mountains (VT) and White Mountains (NH). They also get rained on, see lakes, gain weight and get rained on some more...

The Flyers venture into the sun, fog, rain and occasional submarine conditions in lovely New England.
Also known as "The Loose Gravel Tour", for the dozens of warning signs we encountered. Few were accurate. The trip, however, was sublime.
Well it was SUPPOSED to be about geysers anyway...sadly the weather up Yellowstone way decided to suck, so we went back to the warmer canyon lands we all know and love. Some of us still held onto the illusion though...
In addition to our usual southern Utah haunts, this year the Flyers' annual desert expedition ventured down south to the Grand Canyon.
Though the hotels were a bit more modern than we'd expected, our guides Chano and Juan were great. Additional attendees included Betsy Forrester, Hedwig Golant, John & Betsy Rolls, Michael Silecchia and Willo Bellwood.

The guy who suggested it dropped out early. The guy who named it never showed at all. The guy who organized it bailed at the last minute (something about a banking crisis in Frankfurt ). And so it was a diminished group of hard-riding road warriors who gathered on February 29th for the first Flyer adventure of the new millennium.
Chairman Walt leads the group through the rolling hills of the Finger Lakes....made more rolling by the Winery stops.

According to the report, Reid was seen following Gavin Rossdale out of the club as he and a friend left with another mystery blonde.
According to a second report, via , it was noted that while Gavin Rossdale and Reid were at the same nightclub, they weren’t together.
The blonde and Gavin left the club together.” Gavin Rossdale and his former wife, Stefani, parted ways in August of this year after 13 years of marriage and three children together, Kingston, 9, Zuma, 7, and Apollo, 20 months.
Then, months later, published a report, claiming Gavin Rossdale had been involved in a three-year affair with the couple’s former nanny, Mann, which Stefani was made privy to in February.
Although Stefani reportedly caught Gavin Rossdale cheating on their family’s i Pad, which included messages between the pair about meeting for sex and nude photos of Mann, Gavin Rossdale was said to have denied being physical with Mann at the time, and while she was immediately fired, he and wife Stefani remained in their marriage for months until he allegedly admitted to the affair.“The i Pad was linked to [Gavin Rossdale]’s phone,” a family source told .Instead, the source claimed, Gavin Rossdale was with the unnamed blonde, and the two remained close during their outing.Below is what “[Gavin Rossdale] was with [a] mystery blonde inside the club.They held hands and it was apparent they were together—at least for the night…[Gavin Rossdale] was partying with a group of friends, but kept close to the blonde.

Quality control is an integral part of the John Valve production process and checks are carried throughout manufacturing. Each casting procedure is inspected and followed exactly according to the PED standards. In addition, each casting has to go through a series of test (destructive or non-destructive) in order to ensure our high quality.
Analysis of the chemical composition of the molten alloy is carried out using a Spark Spectrometer. After casting and the subsequent heat treatment, further testing is conducted using Metallurgical Micro-Structural Analysis. And we use the 3D Coordinate Machines to inspect the dimension. Additional tests of the tensile and impact strength along with the s-urface hardness of the material are carried out using calibrated equipment and X-Ray inspection. Constant visual inspection by the trained operators helps to ensure very high quality standards are maintained.

We’ve been whale watching before, but our tour in Sydney with Ocean Extreme was an entirely different experience. Ocean Extreme’s zodiac boat sits low in the water and provides an unobstructed view of the whales from every angle, which brings you much closer to the action than a traditional whale watching vessel. We were even lucky enough to get some underwater footage on our GoPro!
We loved our stay at the elegant Four Seasons in Sydney, Australia. Our guest room was lovely and the housekeeping staff was especially wonderful; we loved the turndown service, complimentary water bottles, and organic toiletries. We didn’t think a room with a view of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House was worth the price to upgrade, although we imagine it would have been the icing on the cake!

Boston Marathon Bombing: What Happened?: 'Preparing for Jihad'.....The Alleged Boston Bombers visited a Gym. by B. Blake
Remember when you were in school and asked your parents and teachers why you had to take math classes? “When will I ever use this?” Well, you may not calculate derivatives on a daily basis, but math is still essential for frugal living.
Big warehouse stores want shoppers to believe that buying in bulk saves money. Sometimes it does, but not always. For example, if you save ten cents per pound by buying ten pounds of apples, but four pounds rot before you have a chance to use them, did you really save? Also, there are times when the cost per ounce on certain items is actually more when you purchase the large container. Packaging may lead you to believe that you’re getting twice as much as the next size down for less than twice the cost, but a closer look at the fine print may reveal otherwise. Make sure you’re comparing costs ounce for ounce to ensure savings. Use the calculator app on your phone if necessary.
You have to find a common denominator to compare other things you spend money on, too. When it comes to transportation, per person is a good common denominator. For example, is it cheaper to fly or drive to your destination? Or would it be more cost efficient to rent a car or purchase a bus pass for your week-long business trip? In both cases, the per person cost will help you determine the least expensive option. It could easily be cheaper for one person to fly but less expensive for a family of four to drive. If you split the cost of a rental car five ways, it might be less expensive than purchasing five individual bus passes. Do the math to know for sure.
The same principle holds true for entertainment. It might be silly to pay six dollars for an on-demand movie or more for a pay-per-view fight if you watch it alone, but if you invite a group of people over to watch with you, the cost per person drops significantly.
Hobby stores and Pinterest may like folks to believe that DIY is always the less expensive option. Do the math. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn’t. Consider curtains, cookies, and car washes. Starting with curtains: by the time you purchase fabric, thread, trim, lining, a curtain rod, hardware, and a sewing machine (if you don’t already have one), you may not save any money at all.
As for cookies, the cost of ingredients adds up. If you don’t make them regularly you’re better off buying the ready-made cookie dough at the grocery store.
Then there are the car washes. Logic would lead you to believe that going to a DIY car wash would be less expensive than a full service wash. Do the math. If you have to pay 75 cents for each of the following cycles: rinse, suds, high pressure wash, spotless rinse, clear coat protectant, you’re already up to $3.75 and that’s if you only need one cycle of each. Then you have to dry it. Add another two bucks to vacuum and it may or may not be worth the effort.
Just a quick note about couponing. Compare prices even with a coupon. Often times the store brand is less expensive than a name brand with a coupon. Once again, it’s math for the win and the savings.

"Very limited reliability data from manufacturers. Some have known problems with wear leveling and corruption at power off"
Do you have any references to these known problems? I'm trying to pin down some issues that I am having with a batch of SSD devices. These SSDs have a ZIF IDE interface and store about 8GB of data. We have been seeing file corruption when power is cut off suddenly. The corruption I have seen is NOT similar to the types of filesystem errors you typically see when you cut power to an ordinary disk drive. In the case of a disk drive, one might expect that a filesystem check and journal recovery would show that the last files being written to are inconsistent. With the SSDs I have seen corruption in files that were not being written to or even being read from -- files not opened at all! I hope that I can find more references that discuss this problem. Information from the manufacturer has obviously been hard to come by.
The article I had in mind when I wrote that slide is Valerie Aurora's discussion of log based file systems (http://lwn.net/Articles/353411/)
The corruption you mention is exactly what would happen if the device was powered down while moving blocks round to create a completely empty erase block or as part of wear leveling. A faulty algorithm can cause data to be lost from files that are completely unrelated to those that have been written to recently.
1) You should discuss what types of buffering ubiFS does and the tradeoff on performance vs. data loss during a powerloss situation.
2) Many times there is a significant difference in performance in small and large data writes. It would be good to include both.
I've been eagerly waiting for the post regarding Slides from the Embedded Systems Confernece 2009: UBIFS, power management and porting. Thanks. jeff cavaliere bio

It’s now the end of week 9 and I am having mixed feelings about my internship coming to an end in three weeks. On one hand, I am looking forward to going back to New Orleans and seeing my friends. But on the other hand, I am sad to leave Boingo, a place that I have come to know and love over the past two months. The fun and energetic vibe that exists within these four walls is truly contagious and conducive to success. Never did I think that coming to work every day would bring me so much joy. Waking up routinely for work is without a doubt better than waking up routinely for school. But then again, maybe Boingo has just spoiled me and I am in for a culture shock when I next return to the workforce.
Perhaps the most gratifying part of my experience here has been the relationships that I have made so far. I must admit that on my first day, I was a little intimidated by being the youngest and newest worker in the department. I didn’t even know the first thing about marketing. But now, I am fully comfortable at Boingo. From the jokes I share with Jay and Travis, to the food ordering I bond over with Andrew and Lauren, to the hard work I do with Julie and Katie, to the acceptance that everyone else has shown me, I could not be happier with the group of people that I am surrounded by each day.
My most recent highlight has been working on a corporate recruiting video with Lauren. Last week, after much planning and anticipation, we hosted a nine-person production crew to film a video showcasing our beautiful office space featuring our most attractive workers (AKA everyone). We are now in the post-production phase and the final product will be amazing, but not without heavy scrutiny as to who is to be featured in each shot, what music will be played in the video, what shots to keep and what to cut, and much more. It was also a wonderful learning experience collaborating with Creative Rebellion, the production company that worked with us. It was interesting to get the fresh perspective of an outside professional, as we already had an internal vision of what the project would look like. As the final edits are being made, both our internal and their external vision will come together to produce a stunning video that leaves viewers thinking “Wow, that’s a cool place” or “I want to work there!” I can’t wait for the video to drop. Be sure to check it out on YouTube or LinkedIn when it debuts in early August.
As for the rest of my time here, I am just continuing to help out in any way that I can. Next week, Boingo is putting on a company-wide Hackathon and I am going to be a correspondent, much like a host, for the event along with the Web Systems Engineering intern, Spencer. In between drafting written communications to clients, conducting surveys for our broadband customers, reviewing media ad sales decks, and much more, I am just trying to enjoy the rest of my summer here, continue to establish strong relationships and networks with my coworkers, and soak up as much knowledge and experience as I can. So far, it has been nothing short of inspiring.

On 12 May, curtains will rise on the 7th Ministerial Meeting of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum in Qatar. It is a great opportunity for China and Arab states to enhance cooperation as we celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations.
Two years ago, when addressing the last Ministerial Meeting in Beijing, President Xi Jinping suggested that China and Arab states work together on the "Belt and Road" initiative and proposed a "1+2+3" pattern for cooperation. Two years on, with joint efforts, China-Arab states cooperation is booming with fruitful results.
Stronger political trust underpins China-Arab states relations. China has consistently supported Arab states' quest for development paths suited to their respective national conditions and their struggle to restore the legitimate rights of the Arab nations, especially the establishment of an independent State of Palestine. Arab states have rendered China precious support on issues of core interests and major concerns. China has established strategic relationships with eight Arab states, and seven Arab states have joined the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as founding members. At the leadership level, there is an ever more mature pattern of close communication and deep trust, which serves as a solid political platform for cooperation in various fields and makes it possible for various mechanisms of the Forum to thrive. Early this year, the Chinese government released its first Arab Policy Paper. It is an important program and action guide for the development of China-Arab states relations.
Mutually beneficial cooperation binds China and Arab states closely together. Arab states are China's primary cooperation partners in the energy sector, a popular market of project contracting and a key destination of outbound investment. China is now Arab states' second largest trading partner overall, and the largest trading partner of ten individual Arab countries.
Over the past two years, China and Arab states have signed nearly US$50 billion worth of contractual projects. The two sides have established two joint investment funds, which would finance, among others, major projects of production capacity cooperation, oil refinery and port infrastructure. China and the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) have made encouraging progress in the FTA negotiations. Both sides have substantively concluded in principle the chapter on trade in goods and are committed to reaching an FTA agreement before the year is out. The China-Arab States Technology Transfer Center was inaugurated, cooperation agreement was inked on the use of the Beidou navigation satellite system in Arab countries, and preparations are in place for establishing the training centers for peaceful use of nuclear energy and clean energy. These results have added substance to the "1+2+3" cooperation pattern, expanded China-Arab states practical cooperation and serve as useful templates for converging the interests of the two sides under the "Belt and Road" initiative.
Mutual learning between Chinese and Arab civilizations is deepening. Nurtured by rich history and culture, China and Arab states are both against the view that one civilization is superior to the other and that clash of civilization is inevitable. Both sides champion the diversity of civilizations. Under the framework of the Forum, the two sides have started the China-Arab dialogue on civilization, friendship conference, art festival, etc. to encourage cultural and people-to-people exchanges. A diverse array of activities have been held to promote exchanges between political parties and youth groups as well as in tourism and education. Mid- and long-term plans for cultural, media and training cooperation are being implemented. Eleven Confucius Institutes and five Confucius Classrooms have been set up in nine Arab states. Eleven Arab countries have been identified as overseas destinations for Chinese tourists. There are now 183 flights every week linking the two sides, and about 1.02 million visits are made each year. For two successive years, the two sides have celebrated the China-Arab Friendship Year featuring a number of colorful events.
We live in a world of profound and complex changes, a world in which multi-polarity and economic globalization are a fact of life. The Chinese people are striving to realize a moderately prosperous society in all respects and the Chinese dream of great national renewal. China is a major driving force of the world economy. Last year, we achieved a medium-high growth rate of 6.9% and contributed to over 30% of global growth. Meanwhile, Arab peoples are working tirelessly to make their dream for peace, stability and development come true. Countries in the Arab region have made fruitful gains toward change and development, and their people yearn for a better life. These common dreams and aspirations are a strong bond that links the two sides.
During his visit to Arab states last January, President Xi delivered a speech to the entire Arab world at the Arab League headquarters, in which he outlined a comprehensive vision for China-Arab cooperation, announced a series of major cooperation initiatives and laid down a grand blueprint for future China-Arab relations. As the two sides work together to deliver the outcomes of President Xi's visit, China and Arab countries need to use this opportunity to build consensus and galvanize action to further improve the top-level design of forum mechanisms, promote the "Belt and Road" initiative in the Arab region, and create more synergy for the rejuvenation of the Chinese and Arab people.
- Enhance communication and coordination for greater peace and stability. A peaceful and harmonious regional environment is needed for the advancement of the "Belt and Road" which, in turn, can create a strong momentum for peace building in the region. China will continue to play a constructive part in regional affairs and encourage the parties to find the biggest common denominator through dialogue. China will get actively involved in the political settlement of hotspot issues in the Middle East such as the Syrian issue, support UN's mediation efforts, and support the parties in holding inclusive dialogues and expediting political and economic reconstruction. China will provide more public goods and help Arab countries build capacity in maintaining stability to facilitate peace and stability in the Middle East. China will stay in communication and coordination with Arab states, and will continue to respect each other's primary interests and core concerns on major international issues, support each other's legitimate demands and propositions, and firmly uphold international equity, justice, and the common interests of developing countries.
- Align development strategies to deepen practical cooperation. Both China and Arab states are at a crucial stage of development. The Chinese government has set out a vision for innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development in its 13th Five-Year Plan. Through the open, pragmatic and long-term platform offered by the "Belt and Road" initiative, China would like to promote a new cooperation model featuring "oil and gas plus" with Arab states, accelerate investment facilitation and the application of high and new technologies, and advance the development of key industrial parks. China is sincere and pursues no selfish interest in cooperating with Arab states on industrial capacity. We will combine our quality industrial capacity with the human resources of Arab states, help build much-needed industries such as steel, nonferrous metals, construction materials, glass, automobiles and power plants, and support Arab states in pursuing a new path of industrialization that is economic, people-based and green, that people from both sides will benefit more from China-Arab cooperation and that development on each side will reinforce that of the other.
- Increase cultural exchanges for closer bonds between peoples. "Amity between the people holds the key to friendship between countries". People-to-people exchanges have underpinned the traditional friendship between China and Arab states and constitutes an important pillar for the "Belt and Road" development. Building on the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, the two sides shall further enhance people-to-people exchanges and expand interactions and cooperation in education, culture, health, science, technology, tourism, youth, media, broadcasting and human resource training, so as to increase mutual understanding and friendship between our peoples,build a bridge of communication between China and Arab states, and jointly promote development and progress of human civilization.
- Engage in intercivilization dialogue to draw on each other's strength. The "Belt and Road" is not only a path towards mutual benefit, but more importantly, a path that enables integration and interactions between civilizations. China will, as always, firmly support Arab states in upholding cultural traditions, defusing sectarian conflicts, removing estrangement between ethnic groups, and countering the spread of extremist ideologies. China opposes any discrimination and prejudice against a particular ethnic group or religion. We will step up dialogue between the Chinese and Arab civilizations, advocate the culture of tolerance, share experience in promoting religious harmony and deradicalization, guard against extremist forces and ideologies, and work to promote our own cultural traditions, which in turn will provide more sustainable drivers for our development and prosperity.
2000 years ago, China and Arab states created a glorious history of mutual understanding and interactions along the ancient Silk Road. Today, the land and maritime Silk Roads have converged in the Arab region, connecting the two ends of the Asian continent and ushering in a new phase for all-round China-Arab cooperation. By jointly building the "Belt and Road", China wants to work with Arab states to enhance infrastructure connectivity, further communicate and align our development strategies, promote cultural interactions and integration, expand win-win cooperation and forge a broad platform that facilitates the realization of the "Chinese dream" and the revival of the Arab states. Let us make the most of the "Belt and Road" initiative to carry forward our traditional friendship, pursue mutual benefit and jointly advance the China-Arab strategic cooperative relations.

In the Uniqlo store in NYC, you sit in the mood booth and put on a headset. You then watch a large screen which displays a bunch of images and videos, include kittens and rainstorms. Sounds like a fun way to kill ten minutes, even without all the high-tech shopping wizardry. While you’re watching the screen, your headset is monitoring your brainwaves, and will judge your mood based on how you respond to each image. The UMood will then offer up four t-shirt suggestions to match your mood. Judging from your reaction, it’ll then unite you with the one perfect t-shirt to perfectly reflect how you’re feeling. Magical.

The Canadian company McEwen Mining Inc., with headquarters in Toronto and gold deposits in countries such as Argentina and USA, reported last week that a group of unidentified assailants entered the gold mine empty-handed, and left the place with no fewer than 900 kilos of gold concentrate.
Some experts informed that, after processing and refining that amount of gold, the assailants could get nearly 7,000 ounces of this precious metal worth $8 millions.
The company said in the media that the gold mine boasts 24-hour security, and therefore, according to Gerardo Vargas Landeros, Secretary General of the Government of Sinaloa, affirmed that some person within the gold mine – or who worked there previously – must have helped the assailants find the weak points of the deposit and schedules of the working time.
Fortunately, no one was injured, and the facilities remain intact ever since. The activities continued like nothing had happened, but the insurance will not cover the losses. Now the gold mine workers and security is alert in case this incident takes place one more time.
The authorities believe these assailants are the ones who regularly steal oil from a national company with activities nearby. Nonetheless, this is an isolated case in Mexico and it will be soon water under the bridge.
Things are going from bad to worse, but not just affecting this one mine in the west of Mexico. Regardless of the reduced cost of gold mining worldwide – which was reduced 2.7% during 2014 – in Mexico it has increased by 4%, becoming thus the world's second region where gold mining is more expensive. That significantly reduced gold production in Mexico by 1.3%, yet remaining the eight world's producer.
The clients of Emgoldex bear no risks and buy the highest quality investment gold bars in the online store of the company. They create their own gold reserve and gold business which guarantees them financial stability for tomorrow's future!

Lecture delivered by Mowlana Syed Aftab Haider at the Ahlul Bait (a.s) Islamic Centre during the commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Ali (a.s)
In the first lecture we explained that the root cause of the animosity displayed towards Imam Ali (a.s) was hasad or jealousy which dates back to the forefathers of Imam Ali (a.s) and Bani Umayya.
However the values that Imam Ali (a.s) displayed in his social and political thought created further enemies when Imam Ali (a.s) became khalif as various people were not able to tolerate him for that as they were primarily those whose personal interests were affected.
George Jordac says “Imam Ali (a.s) was killed in his mehrab of worship due to his non compromising justice.”
Though these values of Imam Ali (a.s) which were based on justice manifested on a societal level when he was in power, people already could not tolerate his justice even during the very lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (sawa).
During the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (sawa), Imam Ali (a.s) and various sahaba were sent to Yemen for a campaign under the leadership of Imam Ali (a.s). During that time Yemen was an affluent society and this group upon their return brought back many beautiful cloaks.
Upon reaching the outskirts of Madina, Imam Ali (a.s) asked the group to wait at that point and allow him to first enter Madina on his own and brief Prophet Muhammad (sawa) about their trip and then seek his permission for them to enter.
The sahaba, while waiting for Imam Ali (a.s) to return to them decided that they should enter Madina in style as they had a successful trip and thus decided to wear these beautiful cloaks.
When Imam Ali (a.s) returned and found them wearing these cloaks, he was infuriated and demanded that they inform him who granted them permission to wear those cloaks. When they said that nobody gave them permission but they simply felt like looking dignified when entering Madina, Imam Ali (a.s) said that they cannot do that until they reached Prophet Muhammad (sawa) and he distributed the goods. Imam Ali (a.s) then started to remove these cloaks from the sahabah who were wearing them himself.
So though the sahabah returned to Madina with having achieved victory, this action of Imam Ali (a.s) rectifying their behaviour spoilt the joy they felt at their victory.
Sahabah then went direct to Prophet Muhammad (sawa) to complain that they find Imam Ali (a.s) too harsh towards them! Prophet Muhammad (sawa) replied by saying that “Ali is more harsh in regards to Allah's laws and Pleasure than what you are complaining!”
After the death of the third Khalif Uthman, people came to Imam Ali (a.s) requesting that he becomes the khalif to which he refused and asked them to find another khalif. Imam Ali (a.s)'s initial rejection of the people's request for him to be khalif was based on his knowledge that they were not really interested in a genuine Islamic government but simply one that has an external Islam image while internally it was corrupted.
However when people insisted that he become the khalif, he further warned them that they would not be able to tolerate him before considering to accept their request.
So the power players still insisted and thought that in the current chaos when the third khalif was assassinated, they would appoint Imam Ali (a.s) to fill the power vacuum to bring stability and thereafter they would negotiate with him to secure their personal interests!
So when Imam Ali (a.s) accepted to become khalif, he gave an inaugural speech which made the power players realise that they had made a mistake to get him appointed. Imam Ali (a.s) said in this sermon that “I can see faces whose colour is changing very fast!”
Imam Ali (a.s) promised to establish justice and ensure that the money that was usurped from the Treasury is returned even if it became the dowry of someone who got married!
And Imam Ali (a.s)'s enemies who were previously “hidden tumours”, as described by Prophet Muhammad (sawa), suddenly emerged!
Thus the first group of enemies were those who loved dunya. These people had nothing against Imam Ali (a.s) per se, but were upset that he cut the special monthly allowance that they received in the past, and thus became his enemies due to this.
In Imam Ali (a.s)'s system, everyone received an equal allowance, whether you were an “original” Muslim or a recent convert. People thought that their past services for Islam was sufficient reason for their allowance to be distinguished from others. But Imam Ali (a.s) responded to their claims that he is the first Muslim and historically served Islam the most yet still receives the same allowance like his slave called Qambar!
This caused the first crisis that Imam Ali (a.s) had to deal with which eventually led to the Battle of Jamal.
Maalik Ashtar who was the closest companion of Imam Ali (a.s) even suggested to him that he needs to bend the rules at times in politics! Imam Ali (a.s) responded by asking whether he is expected to achieve “truth” by “baatil” or “false” means? And this is the central them in Surah Yusuf too that the “end” does not justify the “means”.
Today this first group still exists and thus you see that the modern day enemies of Imam Ali (a.s) are those who love dunya and cannot forego the luxury lifestyles that the West provides for them.
Another principle that created a second group of enemies was the fact that Imam Ali (a.s) viewed Governance to be nothing more than a means to establish “Truth”. Personally he considered its value for himself to be less that the value of his broken shoes.
Imam Ali (a.s) did not believe Governance to be a right but actually an onerous responsibility. He believed that with every right there is a concomitant responsibility attached.
Thus Imam Ali (a.s) never considered Governance to be something from which he should benefit personally. It is narrated that even when he had to do his personal mundane shopping that he would go to the outskirts of Kufa where the shop owners did not recognise him to buy from them so that they did not feel obliged to give him a special price.
Imam Ali (a.s) was extremely focussed on what he was responsible for personally and was focussed on fulfilling the rights of others. Thus one day while he was travelling with a Jew as his companion, they reached a point where their journey went in different directions. After having greeted each other, the other traveller saw Imam Ali (a.s) still travelling a distance behind him. Upon enquiry regarding why he was doing that, he said that since thy were together for a portion of their trip, they became companions and this created a right over him and thus he travelled a little distance further to accompany the Jew so that he fulfilled his right!
This second group who became enemies of Imam Ali (a.s) were the hypocrites who wanted Governance and power for themselves and did not consider it a responsibility. Hypocrisy and Imam Ali (a.s) can never be amalgamated.
This group were based in Syria and raised the blood stained shirt of the third khalif who was assassinated claiming that they wanted revenge for his killing. This group were never sincere to the third khalif but were only interested to achieve their personal interests and thus used the shirt of Uthman to gain support. This group also eventually went to war with Imam Ali (a.s).
The third group of enemies who eventually killed Imam Ali (a.s) were the literalists called khawarij. Their external form took the shape of people who fasted every day, prayed the whole night, memorised the Quran and appeared extremely pious, but were considered to be the worst people. They did not love dunya like the first group and were not hypocrites in general either and were very brave and sincere but were still the worst people!
How is it that Imam Ali (a.s) who himself loved to pray and fast and recite Quran, etc. called this group of people the “worst of people”?
These people were enemies of Imam Ali (a.s) due to being enemies of the intellect and thus could not get along with Imam Ali (a.s) who had a pure intellect.
Imam Ali (a.s) said: “Two people broke my back; an aalim who has no fear of Allah; and a pious ignorant person.”
And this group of people were pious ignorant people who shouted slogans like “there's no governance except for Allah.” In principle this is true but their intention by it was false. This governance can only be implemented by a human being, yet they believed that you need no human being to establish the rule of Allah.
Imam Ali (a.s) called them “satan's arrows” as they were used by satan to destroy Islam. The suffering that these people caused in history and today in the form of DAESH, etc. causes us to believe that we living in Imam Ali (a.s)'s time again as they are modern day kharijites who have the mentality of “frozen thought” where we are not allowed to think.
Kharijites used to say “Ali you are kaafir!” In Masjid Kufa, while Imam Ali (a.s) was delivering his sermon, they would stand up and read out verses of “punishment” and intend these for Imam Ali (a.s). During his salaah they would disturb him by reading verses of shirk intending that his actions are nullified.
But Imam Ali (a.s) approach was to still tolerate them as long as they did not kill people as he believed that even his enemies had rights. He did not even prevent these people from receiving their share of the Baytul Maal.
But the moment they killed people and wanted to destabilize the system, Imam Ali (a.s) first cautioned them and fought them and destroyed them and said “I extracted the eye out from this fitna” and said that nobody had the courage to fight with such people than Imam Ali (a.s).

Our Club is organised for windsurfers and kitesurfers by windsurfers and kitesurfers. It gives its members year round easy access to this the blue flag beach as well as a clubhouse (built in 2006) where they can hang out, shelter from the elements, have a second office with the new WIFI and have a nice hot shower before driving home. Add to that the top quality instruction from 2XS, free social events and the new hire and demo centre and you would be mad not to join the place.
For a long time West Wittering beach has been a favourite amongst windsurfers, kitesurfers and paddlesurfers. There has been a Club since the late 70’s.
The unspoilt, rural bliss of the surrounding area easily earns the place its reputation as one of the best beaches in the UK. It’s amazing really that you can find such a place just over an hour’s drive from London.
Being on the edge of the South Downs and Chichester Harbour, this really is a fantastic part of the world.
Lose yourself in a walk along the sand dunes at East Head, gorge yourself on a BBQ or just sit on the beach and take in the view, this place is not only for those that like to go in the water.
The range of conditions and spectacular open space on the beach means that windsurfers and kitesurfers from complete beginner to addicted wave-head can benefit from wonderful, non-gusty winds.
The beach is sandy and the water is clean, there is no shorebreak at any state of tide and you have all the space in the world to perfect that new manoeuvre or just sail about taking in the scenery.
Built in 2006, the building is very modern and withstands the elements well (it is about as close to the water’s edge as it can be!) The clubhouse is, most importantly, very warm and dry with french windows to take advantage of the summer weather.
There is also a kitchen with a fridge, microwave, dishwasher and plenty of free tea, coffee, hot chocolate and milk. Members can keep their lunch in the fridge.
There is free WIFI and a lounge with sofas, so you can treat the club house as your second office (and many do!)
There is a static barbecue next to the club that members can use to have barbecues with friends. West Wittering Windsurf Club run club barbecue nights throughout the season for the members.
West Wittering Windsurf Club has a premium selection of windsurfing, kitesurfing, SUPing and kayaking rental gear which is replaced every year:
*2XS members receive the option of taking the annual hire package. For full details of equipment hire, see the windsurfing and kitesurfing equipment hire page.
WWWC has a (very fast to launch) jet ski and quad setup that is the ideal rescue vehicle for West Wittering’s range of conditions. The 2XS staff are very vigilant and will launch the ski at the drop of a hat.
Finding all the right spots and when they work is the key to having fun on the water it’s a matter of time, understanding how the combinations of tide, wind and swell direction work.

Ezzy mast pad. Is ideal for Legacy model sail, or for sails without mast pads. This is a thick pad of Ezzy quality – that will protect your feet and the rail of your board near mast box area.
To keep the Ezzy Legacy at a reasonable priced sail range, Ezzy colour schemes for this sail range frequently changes due to production availability. We cannot guarantee colour availability or consistency as the Legacy is produced from remnant materials.
This is the best uphaul on the market. It stays out of the way when you don’t need it and is really easy on the hands.
As you might have guessed I love bunnies and since I've been writting patterns I've done quite a lot of bunny patterns. I can't help it they are so cute and great fun to design.
I discontinued this pattern a while ago as I have come up with better designs since but I think I need to go back and look at this pattern to update it and re-release it.
Bubblebun was the first of the fat friends, a set of patterns that have been very popular. Bubblebun when on to star in Craftseller and love crochet magazine and she will be the first of my amigurumi kits I'm building.
This little bunny is a free pattern that is still available for anyone who want to make him its on the blog over here.
Green sweater bunny. Hes one of my faves, I just love the bright green of his sweater. He still has friends waiting to be made to finish his pattern set but at the moment hes quite lonely.
Love Crochet magazine commissioned a little boy and girl bunny for their magazine and I was happy to help.
For this year Easter project for Let knit magazine they wanted an Easter themed cot mobile and of course it had to have lots of little bunnies on it.
Then there was my big book project for DK. They wanted a long eared stripy bunny and that what I gave them, even if they did have to cheer him up :)
This is Lucy and Lucy bunny who was named after her. I make no excuses this is the most girly bunny I have every made. She has a frilly skirt on, patchwork fabric ears and lots of flowers and bows.
In my head when I came up with this design there was an image of a little girl in her wellies out for a walk with her bunny toy, holding it by the ear as they splashed in puddles together. It was an image that always made me happy and brought back memories of when I was a girl and would walk for miles over the countryside.
When you send of a design to publishers you have no control over how they will go about photographing them. I have always loved every photo of my work I've seen published so I'm happy to leave them to it, but in the back of my head I just really wanted to see that little girl holding Lucy bunny by the ear.
I didn't know I would be in this months Inside crochet magazine it seems like it was only a couple of weeks ago I sent the designs off to them but there was Lucy bunny on the front
It has Lucy bunny and also my crochet earrings patterns in it plus its chock full of so much crochet loveliness its defiantly worth a buy.
It really seems that you love bunnies XD But I like them too and your bunny creations are very special and so cute. It' s great that you use so much different kinds of designs to make them.
Hey! I live in Finland and i had to buy that magazine when i visit in Tallinn Estonia because of Lusy Bunny :D

Truth be told, I’ve never been a great admirer of the virtues of virtual communication: it is my paramount belief that there can be no substitute for actual face to face- mano à mano- flesh and blood, contact between two or more hot-blooded human beings (a fact, needless to say, epitomized by the sexual act). So, it was only after my Inbox was regularly carpet-bombarded with automated emails inviting me to join Orkut, Google’s social networking website, from the never-say-die, Rajesh Dulani, that I finally overcame my initial skepticism, and yielded (if only as a token of my inevitable appreciation for Mr. Dulani’s patient persistence).
During the past year, Orkut has helped me revive old (not to mention, cold) intimacies with long lost friends (at last count, 95), and allowed me to befriend many more (555 and counting). To illustrate, while on a pilgrimage to the khanqah of the venerable Sufi saint, Moin-ud-din Chisti, at Ajmer-é-sharif two days ago, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a telephone call from a college-mate, Aseem Andrews, who is, as it turns out, presently working for the United Nation’s Resident Coordinator at Windhoek, Namibia: when I inquired how he had managed to find me after an absence of about a decade, he exclaimed from beyond the oceans, “Thank God for Orkut!” Not only that, since Mr. Andrews seemed to know all about what’s happened to me in the interregnum simply by reading my somewhat dense, soap-operatic profile, we could resume our dialogue as if it had never really been discontinued.
Now, as regards the rapidly-mushrooming Galaxy of Friends I’ve never really met, well, the experience hasn’t been quite as enriching as I would have liked it to be: to put it plainly, it’s more quantity than quality. Let me explain. It’s like meeting people at a rather large party where nobody (including the host) knows anybody: with most, one runs out of things to say after exchanging the first few pleasantries (hi!- how are you?- I am fine, thank you, how are you?- I am fine, thank you ad infinitum). This sort of conversational impasse is not unlike the dozens of automated messages we are flooded with (on say, Friendship Day or Diwali), where the need or the motivation to respond simply doesn't exist. (See my entry on 'From One Computer to Another: Shubh Diwali, Eid Mubarak etc...')
To take a pointer from Dale Carnegie’s bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, we simply fail to move onto the next strata of 'virtual-proximity', which must, I guess, necessarily be based on a mutuality of shared experiences and interests (which college did you go to?- Stephen’s- O! what batch?- 1998- ah, I am your senior by a decade. Way before your time, kiddo’- Wow! is that so!- boy, do I miss those mince-cutlets!- etc. till one of them invites the other for a drink).
On the left-hand margin of its Friends section, Orkut provides a neat little hierarchy pertaining to ‘levels of friendship’. Virtual friends can be successively categorized into the following levels: haven’t met (555); acquaintances (51); friends (30); good friends (8); best friends (6). If one remains actively involved with Orkut, then there’s a fairly good probability that a lot of people in the haven’t met-list will move up to the acquaintances-list, who will in turn rise to the friends-list, and so on and so forth. As the numbers I’ve indicated in the brackets above show, the greatest hurdle is to migrate from the haven’t met-list to the acquaintances-list. From there on, it becomes relatively easier. In my case, of the 606 persons who were originally on the ‘haven’t met-list’, only 51 became acquaintances. In most of these 51 instances, I must admit that the ‘initiative’ to do so has almost always come from the other party. To enable this upward movement, Orkut offers two rather interesting options.
First, there are tens of thousands of ‘communities’ catering to every conceivable interest-group, from Harry Potter to ‘Against People Who Hate Sonia’ (a community formed in response to its rival, ‘I hate Sonia Gandhi’). Every day, hundreds more are being added (‘Free Sanjay Dutt’). It would seem that all one has to do to move to the next proximity-level is to join any of these communities that might be of interest to you. I am now a member of a staggering 115 communities (three of which were started by me). However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I actively participate in all of them; or even that most of these communities have activity of any kind going on. A majority of them are quite simply, defunct. In retrospect, the only reason why I joined most of these communities was the exact same reason why I joined Orkut in the first place: not only to stop people- ‘friends’- from stuffing my Inbox with invitations to communities that couldn’t possibly be of interest to me (‘Raipur Property Developers’) but also to avoid offending these gentle souls.
Of course, there have been a few praiseworthy exceptions: SNT’s ‘Jai Chhattisgarh’ community has done more to revive a love for Chhattisgarhi-culture and language among our youth than any other forum, virtual or otherwise, I know of. However, to get it off the ground, he had to take out several hours from his daily schedule, sending invitations, posting topics, conducting polls, and even telephoning friends to join. Needless to say, not many of us can put in this kind of singular dedication and time, which is a requisite to keep a niche-group like this one alive. In contrast, a community named ‘India’, which doesn’t really cater to any particular interest or sentiment, doesn’t require this kind of effort: yet, of its 447,417 members (!) only a miniscule percent actually participate in any kind of community-discussion. So is there an alternative to ‘communities’?
To use an analogy, if ‘communities’ are akin to ‘parties’, and you don’t really feel like going to one, then Orkut offers you a second option: its rather powerful ‘search engine’ allows you to look for, and directly get in touch with, like-minded individuals (as opposed to communities), with whom one might share a hitherto undiscovered niche. For instance, typing ‘à la recherché du temps perdu’ will fish out all those who, for one reason or another, love Proust; and then, you can while away time musing about Cambray in chaste provincial-French. Chances are you will both also like listening to Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1: ‘I love the way it opens with oooo such aplomb, and then quietly disintegrates into near-oblivion’. And what’s true of Tchaikovsky also applies to most virtual dialogues I’ve endeavored to sustain: for better and worse, their disintegration into ‘near-oblivion’ has been inevitable.
The reason, I believe, lies in an unavoidable ‘structural blockage’ inherent in all virtual communication. And the only way to overcome it is to quite literally, step out of each others’ computer monitors, shake hands, and embrace. Needless to say, this requires a ‘leap of faith’: what if, for instance, this person who loves Proust and Tchaikovsky turns out to be Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant psychiatrist from Thomas Harris’ novel, The Silence of the Lambs, who preferred to eat his patients’ ‘liver(s) with a nice bottle of Chianti’ on the sole pretext that their ‘therapy wasn’t going anywhere’? Well, unless and until one decides to meet, there’s no other way to find out, is there? And this is precisely where most people chicken out, and rightly so. As things stand, web-based social networking is fraught with a variety of dangers, both foreseen and unforeseen. Allow me to share three anecdotes (one involving me, and two concerning friends) to elaborate on what I mean.
I first got involved with the Internet thirteen years ago, in 1994. In those prehistoric cyber-days, chatting on Yahoo! was the ‘in-thing’ (if not the only thing one could do with the then irritatingly-slow internet); likewise, at that age- 17 being the time when one’s testosterones are just firing-up- one chatted mainly to ‘get hooked’. And so it came to pass that I fell head-over-heels in ‘virtual love’ with “smittenkitten”, the chosen nom de plume of the enigmatic object of my affection (or what is more commonly known as chat-ID). We’d spend hours chatting endlessly through moist summer-nights. I learnt that she lived in Bombay (was this before they changed the name to Mumbai?); despite being vegetarian, was supremely intelligent; had a wonderful, if slightly warped, sense of humor; studied FY-Eco (short for ‘first year economics’) at Wilson’s College; and hoped to become, of all things, a fashion designer. I kept begging her to meet, and she finally consented. On the pretext of attending a friend, Ravi Patodi’s sister’s wedding, I managed to fly to Bombay; then I sneaked away from the wedding, to a restaurant on Queen’s Necklace Road (a.k.a. Marine Drive) called New Yorker. I waited for two hours, slowly drowning myself in six tall glasses of excessively-sugary milkshakes to justify my occupation of the extremely hard-to-get table, and left, thoroughly disenchanted. When we ‘met’ again for PM (private messaging), I was quite naturally furious at her. But her explanation put me at rest: “do you remember the guy on the table next to yours,’ she asked, ‘the one in the dark blue polo shirt?” “Not really,” I typed back, almost shattering the keyboard. “Well, that was me.”
After all these years, I still try to laugh the whole thing off. But somehow I can’t. Perhaps, this is the principal reason why I’ve had to turn-down requests from ‘females’ who, however valid their reasons for doing so (personal safety?), cut-and-paste a Catherine Zeta Jones photo on their profile. The fact is that ‘virtual communication’ allows you to be dishonest- to project an image of not what you really are but what you would much rather want to be- in ways that real communication simply cannot. As Amit Tiwari remarks in a particularly incisive blog-entry, "We become someone else in the virtual world." (What he doesn't quite answer is whether this someone else is actually more representative of our true selves?) Whatever be the case, any relationship based on a lie, howsoever big or small, cannot endure. Understandably, after this ‘experience’ I haven’t really had the heart- or the stomach- for similar misadventures. The risks, physical but also, more importantly, emotional, are far too great, as another friend, Mohit Singhania, was to discover to his chagrin, thirteen years later.
Mr. Singhania was an ardent Orkutian, and like the me of thirteen years ago, keen on ‘getting hooked’. However unlike me, most of his real-life encounters with his virtual friends were going splendidly, thanks mostly to the relatively deserted ‘VIP Road’ (leading to the Raipur airport). That was before he discovered that his Orkut Identity- his photos, his interests, his life- had been, for lack of a better word, copied by a perverted nymphomaniac: soon, this copycat-Mohit was hosting a conglomerate of sex-communities soliciting the participation of petite Raipuriyan femmes fatale in expectedly-depraved orgiastic rituals. To use Mr. Singhania’s own words from his hedonistically funny blog-entry, ‘Why I left Orkut’: “this guy had the balls to use my snap on his profile and then join adult communities on Orkut and finally harass the limited number of females on my friends list. Already the number of females was limited and thanks to him, I was almost about to look like a total gay on Orkut with 99% male friends. Can somebody get me this guy’s address?” Well, as it turned out, another friend, Amit Tiwari, was able to find Mr. Singhania’s elusive bête noire, after which I am happy to report he is back to his good ol’ philandering ways on Orkut. He’s even found a way to ‘talk to chicks’ behind his somewhat nosy ex-girlfriend’s back: rather than scrap, he now ‘messages’ his nice little sonnets to them (like his beefy t-shirts, he’s discovered that ‘one sonnet fits all’).
A third anecdote involves Mr. Singhania’s benefactor, Mr. Tiwari himself: it illustrates how even a relatively minor ‘dispute’ can turn grotesquely ugly. Like most men of his age, he is a man of strong opinions (to see what I mean, do visit his aptly named blog, 'Chaos and Creation'): he breathes Nietzsche (but thankfully, is spared the Great Philosopher’s descent into madness). Without going into its context, Mr. Tiwari found himself engaged in a somewhat heated textual-parley with a Raipur-based Sikh boy studying at IIT, Powai. Unable to beat him in this debate, the IITian then proceeded to ‘hack into’ not only Mr. Tiwari’s Orkut account, but also his email accounts (which he used for business purposes), and quiet skillfully, deleted them: suddenly, Mr. Tiwari was without a ‘virtual identity’. As with Mr. Singhania’s case, he ultimately managed to locate his nemesis in the real-world, and persuaded him to restore his virtual life.
The point I wish to make here is this: unlike me, neither of my friends went looking for trouble. Trouble, it seems, found them. It’s kind of like that Sandra Bullock film, The Net: a cat-and-mouse tale of deception where Ms. Bullock’s character finds her entire life erased by a band of cyber-terrorists who, typically of Hollywood blockbusters, are out to take over America’s computerized-civilization. The fourth installment of the Die Hard series starring Bruce Willis is also based on a somewhat similar premise (I will spare you the details, assuming that those of you who haven’t seen it might want to do so at some later date). Unfortunately, such tales are not confined to celluloid: if newspaper reports are to be believed, then instances of Orkut being involved in anti-social activities- narco-jamborees, hate-communities, classroom harassments, even homicides- are becoming increasingly rampant in metropolitan India.
Not surprisingly, the Mumbai chief of the ultra-right party, Shiv Sena’s youth wing, Abhijit Panse, recently agitated to get Orkut banned: his raison d’être has little to with crime per se; instead, he believes that Orkut is, well, ‘anti-India’. Nothing could be farther from the truth: more Indians use Orkut than any other social-networking website (as a matter of fact, the number of Indians on Orkut is next only to Brazilians, and we are fast catching up). If anything, Orkut has become a powerful medium for Track Three Diplomacy (more commonly known as, P2P, or people-to-people diplomacy): the ‘India-Pakistan Friendship Club’ has 83,594 members. In fact, Mr. Panse would be better advised if he were to emulate his party’s alliance partner, the BJP, which has obviously realized the immense potential of Orkut in promoting itself among its predominantly youth members: while the ‘BJP Supporters Group’ has 7997 members, its parent-body, the RSS boasts a membership of a whopping 22,853 (which is more than all other political parties combined, Congress included). Even Lok Paritran (formed by IT-savvy IITian do-gooders), a relatively insignificant political outfit in the real-world most recognized for its anti-reservation stance, has a membership of 10,185. In contrast, the ‘Dalit’ community, whose members support affirmative action for the depressed communities, number only 505. In fact, it would not be incorrect to say that Orkut is fast becoming an ideal representative of what’s happening in- and to- Urban Upper Caste India. And even as Orkut continues to draw parts of this India closer to each other, and to the world, it also shows us how fast and how far this India is moving away from its Rural, Exurbian counterpart.
As I enter my second year of Orkuting, my effort, therefore, shall be twofold: first, at a personal level, I should like to make a conscious effort to convert my virtual friendships into real-life friendships, believing that the Good in all of us cumulatively overpowers the Bad that might exist in some of us; secondly, I would want to explore ways in which this immensely powerful medium could be used to ‘sensitize’ my Urban Friends, both real as well as virtual, to the needs, the hopes and aspirations, of the India that doesn’t quite have the luxury of connecting to the world on Orkut.
Exactly 364 days, I remember handing a note to this blogger saying 'A pen in your hand, surely is, mightier than the sword'. My words echoes all over his blog, evident from the rattling use of the words, that his pen, in this case his keyboard, is yielding. My love & respect for him apart, he is one of the best writer I ever came across & this I am saying after spending half of my already short life in the wadded libraries.
I still feel he must put himself into writing some books especially fictions. I am sure, if does so, in few years I can have a Nobel-laureate friend.
About this entry, I would steal Mr. Woody Allen's phrase - 'The lion & calf may sleep together but the calf wont get much sleep.' :)
About Orkut… what you had mentioned above is a true picture, covering almost all of its fragments. And thanx to Orkut, it’s because of you, that I always find Amit bhaiya very close to me. And I wish… & am sure that orkut will prove altogether a different success story.
Here the other important thing I observed is “YOU” bhaiya. I never had impression of yours ultimate analyzing & writing ability what I learned by knowing these blogs. In single word it’s really “AMAZING”. Jitna bole, utna hi kam hoga bhaiya.
Also I believe that knowing a tool is important, but knowledge to utilize that tool is equally important. And I am sure your this blog will definitely be helpful for all of us to better know & utilize this Orkut tool.

ALPINE SPOTTING BEADS additive is a spherical co-polymer that acts as a mechanical lubricant in stable temperatures up to 425° F (218° C). Compatible with water-base, oil-base and synthetic-base mud systems, the additive’s range of particle sizes and specific gravities can reduce torque and drag and lower the risk of differential sticking in depleted, underbalanced formations by optimizing the radial symmetry of beads in the wellbore.
The ALPINE SPOTTING BEADS mechanical lubricant includes particle sizes from 18 to 200 mesh (74 to 1,000 microns) and specific gravities from 1.08 to 1.50 s.g. The additive is typically applied in highly deviated wellbores, including those with high tortuosity and severe or unplanned doglegs that contribute to high torque and drag.

Last week, I attended the Envestnet conference in Chicago. On Friday, the keynote speaker was Mike Krzyzewski, head basketball coach of the 2015 National Champion Duke Blue Devils and Team USA. To say I had high expectations for his speech is an understatement. He exceeded my expectations by delivering an energized, story filled presentation.
Today, I would like to share some of the main takeaways from his talk that I know will prove useful to you as you pursue your goals for your business, team, and family.
Coach K, as he is known by everyone, has coached at Duke since 1980. He has led them to an amazing 5 National Championships and 12 Final Fours. Averaging over 25 wins a year, he has led his teams to over 1,000 wins. In addition, as head coach, he lead Team USA to 2 gold medals and was an assistant on 2 other gold medal winning teams.
“I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life…” – Henry David Thoreau
In the end, like Henry, our clients want favorable outcomes. What are these and why are they important? In our business a favorable outcome may be a comfortable retirement, college education for our children and grandchildren, protection for our loved ones in case of disability or death, a well funded emergency fund or a number of other specific goals. These are all long term outcomes. Today, there is too much focus on the moment and on disruptive events than on these long term needs of families. As advisors we need to help our clients not be victimized by short term circumstances but rather use these events as springboards for long term wealth accumulation.

There seems to be a revolution in the world of CAD/CAM processes these days. One example is 3D printing, where a set of coded instructions allows you to create anything from plastic tape. Another example is computerised engraving using CNC [Computer Numerical Control]. CNC has been with us for quite a while with PLC [Programmable Logic Controller] automated milling machines.
Today, computers can take the strain. Though they have done for well over 30 years, today’s systems are more user-friendly, accessible, and smaller. If you go to your local shopping centre, you might see a While-u-Wait engraving machine in the lobby. The stallholder uses computer aided engraving to engrave, for example, dog tags and trophies, then sells each dog tag for a fiver or so (or whatever the going rate may be).
We at Able Engraving and Design offer a similar service, though we turn our hand to more complex operations. Not only dog tags but also information boards and ceremonial plaques. Our Computer Aided Engraving machines support a wealth of typefaces from Arial to Zapf Dingbats and create complex engravings. Here’s a demonstration of computer aided engraving in progress:
Not only that, our computer aided engraving services is a reflection of our experience. Our signage include:
We are situated near Gatwick Airport and East Grinstead, just off the A22 (Eastbourne Road). Our company works with a number of public and private sector concerns. Approaching our thirtieth year of business, we have moved from strength to strength by keeping up with the latest developments in engraving technologies. Our embracement of computer aided engraving is one example.
I have been using Able Engraving and Design’s engraving services for more than ten years now. You can depend on Able Engraving to provide you with the highest quality engraved products at competitive prices and trust them to deliver on time.
Able Engraving and Design eagerly awaits the new look £10 note, due for public release in September 2017
Have you got used to the new fivers yet? We seem to have got over the plasticky feel, or the craze of selling some specimens on eBay due to some inconsistencies. From September 2017, this will be joined by a new wave of similarly plasticky £10 notes. The new £10 note design was revealed in a press conference on the 18 July at Winchester Cathedral, by the Bank of England’s Chief Governor, Mark Carney.
In place of Charles Darwin on the new notes, Jane Austen will be seen. Some early specimens had Jane Austen in a happier pose than the more ‘usual’ sour faced pose. A move which has appalled historians. Some sources have stated how early specimens of the new tenner were similar to the new £5 notes. There will be a new tactile feature, to help visually impaired people. Winchester Cathedral was chosen for its launch as it was Jane Austen’s final resting place. The new note was revealed live on the Bank of England’s YouTube channel.
In previous years, Jane Austen has been a source of inspiration for stamps as well as television adaptations for her novels. Postage stamps have had illustrations of characters from her literary works. The Royal Mail issued a set of stamps in 1975. There had been plans for a new look £10 note since 2013.
The present £10 note, featuring Charles Darwin, will be taken out of circulation at the end of 2018. No date has been confirmed as yet. If you’ve still got some old pound coins knocking about, you have until the 15 October to get them spent. After that, they should be handed into your local bank.
I put my 8" SCT out in the garden to start cooling just before 9pm, and set up my tripod twenty minutes later. I made a good guess when positioning it, since I could see Polaris in the polar-scope. I'd set up my laptop just inside the kitchen window, connected via a long serial lead to the mount and a 5m USB extension to the webcam. I also had a long extension to my focus-motor.
With the tiny webcam sensor behind an effective focal length of more than 7m, the 'scope needs to be pointed accurately, but I had Saturn on my screen just after 9:30. At this point the seeing was appalling - wobbling all over the place, but I captured a video stream just in case it should cloud over later. At this point I could see a couple of dust-specks on the sensor, so I brought the camera indoors and cleaned it.
I returned every half-hour to see if things had settled down, but as my tracking was a bit off I had to re-point the 'scope each time - a very quick job, thanks to my flip-mirror. By 11pm the image was much clearer, but the planet was about to "set" behind next-door's roof, so this was the last (and clearest) video I captured.
I use the NexStar Control Pad program to adjust the pointing of my mount from indoors. It's a simple utility with which it's very easy to alter the rate and direction of the control buttons. I needed to make corrections every few minutes to keep the planet centred on the sensor.
Instead of wxAstroCapture I tried the SharpCap program - this was just as easy to use, and I found that its ability to RGB align the incoming video "on the fly" made the image look much clearer on the screen - and so easier to focus. When a planet is low in the sky it's light is badly refracted by the thick layer of Earth's atmosphere, and so the colours are smeared out across the sensor - the RGB align function allows us to re-combine the three colours so that the image is much sharper. (Note that it just does this on the displayed image - the captured video is not processed, so we still need to run the RGB align in RegiStax when doing the post-processing).
Operating at round f/37, the image was pretty dim (especially with some hazy cloud around), so I had the camera set at 5 fps and the video gain wound up to around 70% in order to get a reasonable signal. My captures are 450 frames, which produces .AVI files of around 200MB each.
Then this morning I processed my last three video streams using RegiStax 5.1 (version 6 won't run on that laptop). The latest one was the best: I stacked the clearest 360 of the 450 frames to produce the result which I've loaded into my Gallery: http://www.boltonastro.co.uk/gallery/displayimage.php?pid=1226&fullsize=1
I was out last night too practising polar alignment with Alignmaster and scope control with Stellarium with some success but as you say the seeing was not very good. You managed a good image of Saturn though despite this.
With the planet coming to oppostion in the summer months it's low down in the SE, so I'm seeing it above the roofs of nearby houses (which tend to re-radiate heat in the evening after a warm sunny day), so that's not a good direction for me. It was much better a few years back, when it was at opposition in the winter and so high in the East (and viewed over the trees in the park from here).
So as it's unlikely that I'll get any better conditions than last Thursday, I did some more work on my penultimate video-stream from last week - this time doing the stacking and RGB aligning in RegiStax 5.1, and then exporting this result (as a 16-bit TIFF) into IRIS to do the rest of the processing there.
I think that I've teased out a little more detail now - the cloud-belts and Cassini division are certainly clearer:
We don't know who this guy is, but we definitely want to be friends. The folks over at Daily Rock Box recently dug up this video from last summer of an older-looking man at a stoplight air drumming and rocking out to AC/DC's iconic "Hell's Bells." Whoever sneakily filmed the clip from a nearby car should also get an award for capturing the epic moment.

Christine Bentley, head of the art department at Missouri Southern State University, talks about improvements made to a storage space at Missouri Southern for the university's African art collection. A nearly yearlong effort to catalog the art holdings has resulted in the creation of an online, searchable database and is expected to be made public soon. GLOBE | ROGER NOMER
Residents will soon be able to view a one-of-a-kind collection of African art from the comfort of their own homes.
A nearly yearlong effort to catalog Missouri Southern State University’s African art holdings has resulted in the creation of an online, searchable database of the collection. The site is expected to be made public soon, said Christine Bentley, head of the art department.
"It's really wonderful because we have it all online; we didn't have this before," she said. "We at least have a permanent record that is a great first step in the preservation of the objects."
The works — more than 300 in total — had been confined for years in a small storage area in the art building. The collection includes several items that would have been used in African rituals, such as statues and masks, as well as everyday items such as bows, arrows and a headrest for the dead. "It's a valuable collection, and not just monetarily," said Bentley, who added that the artifacts provide a glimpse into the cultures of western and northern Africa.
Work to restore the collection began last summer, when staff members from the Spencer Museum of Art at the University of Kansas-Lawrence visited Missouri Southern to view the collection and offer recommendations about how best to catalog and preserve it. Bentley and others in the art department spent much of the summer painstakingly cleaning the artifacts, cleaning mold off some of them and ridding others of bug infestations.
Then came the more time-consuming work: Researching each artifact and logging its details into a database software called PastPerfect, which is used by many small- to mid-sized museums. The result of that work, which was completed a few weeks ago, is an online database that is set to be made public at artcollection.mssu.edu. Viewers will be able to see photographs of all the items along with information about each piece, such as its dimensions, its materials and any history related to it, said Eric Rasheed, collections care manager.
"I wanted to put something into it that talked a little bit about the piece and what it was used for, if I could find that out, and why it was made and who made it," said Rasheed, who helped conduct research on the artifacts. "If I couldn't find anything about (the specific item), then I would put something in about the people or the geographic area."
Funding for the restoration and archival project — several thousand dollars' worth — was made available through the university and private donations. The complete collection is worth several hundred thousand dollars, Bentley said. "I don't even want to think what would have happened to it" without the archival project, she said. "I'm still worried, but I'm not as worried because I think we at least have it stable." The collection is currently stored in two buildings on campus in areas where the temperature and humidity can be carefully regulated. It is not publicly accessible, but residents can view it by appointment, Bentley said.
Bentley said her long-term goal is to find a permanent storage or gallery location for the collection. The next steps toward that goal, she said, will be to tag each piece with the catalog number that matches its entry in the database and to build archival boxes for pieces that shouldn't be out in the open air.
Collection details The works that constitute the basis for Missouri Southern State University's collection of African art and artifacts were presented to the university by John and Pam Finley in 1997. Other contributors included Marianna Keown, Vivian Olson, Guy Mace and Ben Pickard.
The ANC-run Boksburg authority was helped by police to forcibly evict some 70 homeless people from the 'People's Rescue Centre' at 39 Market Street, a 100-year-old building without electricity.
Local journalist Fanie Mthupha wrote on July 6 2011 that the authorities claimed it was 'unsafe, vulnerable to fire-accidents because it has no electricity.' Many of the evicted residents said they felt 'uncomfortable' about going to a temporary shelter run by pastor Stephen du Plessis at New Beginnings – which was the ‘alternative accommodation’ with the Boksburg municipality claimed they should go to. They offered no permanent alternative accommodation for any of these people, however, although this is required by law.
The Boksburg authorities moved these vulnerable people in the middle of the winter because they plan to tear down the building and ‘use it for something else like offices.’ they told Mthupha. The forced eviction started very early in the morning, with hired black guards in red overalls, referred to as the 'Red Ants', protected by local and national police, moving the people's few belongings. “ It was all done 'according to law', the Boksburg authorities told Mthupha.
Meanwhile, the Salvage Management and Disposal (Pty) Ltd, a company situated in Boksburg, recently donated items to the Chubby Chums Child Protection Organisation, which runs about 30 children's homes in Gauteng. According to Monica Friend, marketing assistant for SMD, the staff decided to make a contribution to Chubby Chums to help people who are without food, shelter and warmth. Items collected were non-perishable foodstuffs, clothing, blankets and toys. If anyone else would like to make a donation, they can contact Chubby Chums on 011 8257773.
Eating good-for-you whole foods is easy when they taste this delicious. It’s seriously crazy how quickly a couple spoons of curry paste and a bit of coconut milk can transform basic pantry ingredients into a creamy, dreamy crave-able meal that will have you going back for seconds – maybe even thirds. Hey, I’m not judging 😉
Soft sweet potato and cauliflower add a comfortingly rich texture to this coconut curry while packing in the nutrition, after simmering away with fragrant onion, garlic and tender, perfectly-browned chunks of beef.
Serve it up over a bowl of fluffy rice, and don’t forget to dip back into the pan for that extra splash of coconut curry sauce. Top with a handful of cilantro, chopped peanuts, and a squeeze of fresh lime to see your food dreams come to life.
This is another recipe – like these winter glow bowls – that’s almost too simple to really be called a recipe. But at 31+ weeks pregnant and counting, I’m about all things simple. The less time each meal takes to prepare and the less I need to hover over the pot stirring and mixing, the more I can stock away in the freezer. At our last doctor appointment, we learned that if Baby wants to make his debut at 35 weeks, they won’t stop him. That puts us at less than 4 weeks from the point of no return… !!
I know first babies usually come late, so we’ve likely got a bit more time (*looks down at belly and says we need more time!*). But I’m a planner and an over-preparer at heart, and stocking my freezer to hopefully make the first few weeks with Baby that much easier is a great way to feel useful and productive and like I have a modicum of control over this amazing whirlwind adventure.
A couple of quick notes on this coconut curry awesomeness before diving right into the recipe – because let’s face it, that’s what you’re really here for!
The 7 main ingredients don’t include olive oil, salt and pepper – which I use in 99.99999% of all recipes and are freebies in my book!
Want to put your Instant Pot to use? Start by sautéing the beef until browned, then add the rest of the ingredients and switch to Pressure Cook mode for 12-15 minutes. I haven’t tried it yet myself, but that’s where I’d start and I bet it’d turn out great.
This dreamy coconut curry hits that perfect spot between oh-so-creamy and bursting with flavor in each saucy bite. Done in just over 30 minutes, and with plenty to store in the fridge for that perfect leftovers lunch.
Meat: Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove to a plate or bowl and set aside.
Veggies: Add the onions to the hot skillet, cooking until starting to turn translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add the rest of the veggies, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
Sauce & Simmer: Add the curry paste and coconut milk to the skillet, along with the cooked beef. Stir to combine. Cover and simmer for about 12-15 minutes, until the veggies are soft and the beef is cooked all the way through.
Serve: Dish this creamy curry up over a bowl of rice and top with cilantro, lime and crushed peanuts. Enjoy!
Note: The nutrition information above does not include rice, toppings, or additional salt and pepper.
A little bit about me: I love food. I make quick, tasty and (mostly) healthy recipes. Did you make a recipe? Tag @anotherroot on Instagram. I'd love to see!
Hey! So glad you're here! I'm Jaenell, food lover + self-taught cook. My husband Kristian and I live in Michigan. I'm all about simple, tasty recipes made with whole foods and lots of love. Learn more →

This is hilarious. I didn’t get to see this show much when I was a kid because I was too young. I remember sneaking downstairs with my brother to watch Benny Hill. These are great and I’m glad I get to see it. I’m going to do a show like this.
I hope someone can help me with a movie title. In the mid 1970’s I saw a movie with Tim Conway where he had to wear a pair of roller skates for an extended period of time. He got called to be a pall bearer at a funeral & wore those skates at the funeral. One of the funniest things I ever saw. Would someone know the name of this movie?
i’m playing the patient but atthe beginning doing the dentist monologue from the bill cosby show. WITH SOUND EFFECTS!!!!
I remember seeing this skit when I was a child, funny then, funny now. The thing that I enjoy most is the joy that these people have working with each other. They are really fans of each other. Therefore the Majic. That s for posting.
I just watched a new video of Cat Williams and asked myself “How can they sell that crap?” Why can’t they do it like these guys did? My only answer is lack of talent on the new comedians part!
Tim Conway said he would read the scripts and knew how to break Harvey Korman up, they taped it live and aired it. There are many times you will see them break character and laugh, and that was the way they wanted it
as the cast said they new harvey would bust up, they just put bets down as to when……he looks like he wants to chew off his lower lip at some point….

One of the important stages in our lives as believers is the growing up stage and moving on to the next step in maturing in…
Your Woodface WF-55 amplifier kit contains all of the electronics and hardware parts needed to make a great-sounding valve amplifier. Before jumping in, clear a space on your workbench and unpack all of the components.
Start by checking the Kit contents listing supplied with the kit package. Look through the electronic components and check them off.
If this is your first electronics build, familiarise yourself with the component values. In some cases, it's as simple as reading the value from the body of component (most capacitors, for example). However, most resistors are too small to have printed values, and instead colour coded bands on the resistor indicate the resistor's value. You can decipher the code using the Resistor colour codes table at the bottom of this page.
Some of the components have a polarity, meaning that the component needs to be inserted in one particular direction for the circuit to work. For example, if you look closely at the larger capacitors, you'll see a small '-' (minus) mark close to (or pointing at) one of the capacitor's two leads. This marks the negative terminal. In the WF-55, all of the capacitors' negative terminals point towards ground.
The rectifier (D1-D4) and zener (D5) diodes also have a polarity, indicated by a silver band around one end of the diode's black body. Where the diodes are used to rectify AC voltage into DC voltage (D1 to D4) the silver band points away from ground. The zener diode (D5) is a special case, and in this amplifier, the silver band points towards ground. Don't worry if you're not clear of the reasons - the turret board photos on the next few pages show exactly which way to use these components.
Go through the components in the WF-55 Kit contents list and tick them off. Get in touch with Amp Maker if there's any discrepancy or confusion.
All components have a voltage rating - a maximum voltage for the component. The resistors supplied in your kit are rated well over the maximum voltage present inside this amplifier. It's a different story for the capacitors, however. Here, they are rated according to their place in the circuit and the voltages present at that position.
For example, the large power supply capacitors will be faced with the highest voltages in your amp - up to about 370V. So they must be rated for at least this voltage; the parts supplied with your kit are rated at 450V - plenty. Some other capacitors may be rated at a lower voltage - for example, capacitor C3 is rated according to its position in the circuit and it never sees the high voltages that the other capacitors see.

Sable is very similar to red but with a pattern of black over the red as though someone had rubbed a sooty glove over the back of the dog. Often the sable will have lighter colored areas where the "points" would be on a black Cardigan, some sables are very light with only a small smudge of black on the tail, others may be so heavily overlaid with black as to appear to be almost tri-colored.
These two perfectly matched sables won Best Brace at American and Canadian National Specialties and back-to-back Best Brace in Show in all-breed competition. Brace is a non-regular class so these wins did not add to the dogs' national standings. We did this to illustrate the fantastic temperament of these two stud dogs who lived on opposite sides of the continent and saw each other about once a year, yet got along so well that they could be shown on a single leash.
Jasper was Winners Dog, Best Of Winners, Best Puppy at the 1990 Canadian National Specialty, and a Canadian Best Puppy in Group winner. He produced National Specialty Best Of Breed winner (Cobol) a National Specialty Best Of Winners and Best Puppy (Cali), two Best Puppy in Group winners (Cobol & Cali) and two grandchildren (by Cobol) that were Winners or better at Canadian National Specialties from puppy class.
"Cali" Cobol's litter brother had already won back-to-back Best Puppy In Group before this big win at the National Specialty: Winners Dog, Best of Winners, Best Puppy the day he finished his championship.
"Cobol," winning Best In Specialty at the 1995 Canadian National. His Best Of Breed wins on this single weekend in Alberta ranked him as #7 Cardigan nationally for the year. Cobol is such a special dog that he rates his very own page, so please follow the link to his page and meet the dog known as Pond Scum.
This gorgeous son of Pond Scum and Mim is shown winning a 4 point major at the CWCCA supported show at Old Dominion KC. Max belongs to our good friend Goldah Magill, capably handled by Kathy Schwabe,
"Audrey" came back to me at the age of 10 months. After two months in her new home she had won 12 points and her first major, Best Of Breed and Best Opposite Sex over champions and finished with a 5 point major and BOW at the Orange Empire supported show. Her first show as a special she was BOB over a large entry and pulled in Group.
Well, gang, Thanksgiving is upon us. I am, as many of you know, on a SWTOR hiatus, duration undetermined.
You all are in my thoughts constantly. Daily. Hourly. I treasure each and every one of you, from those who have flashed in and out of my life, to those who are in my life beyond the forums. Many, many times, the thoughts of this community have given me the strength to continue keepin' on.
Aenea family, I love you all, and am so very thankful that you are [or have been] a part of my life.
Thank you especially, , for putting together such an engaging place and allowing us to call it our home.
Myself, I had a long period of not much gaming due to RL issues. Then the past month or so I've had a bit of time, but because there hasn't been much of anyone IG here in Aenea, my absolutely most favoritest PW, to RP with lately, I've gone for a hiatus in my old community, Thain. But I've been trying to charm some of my buds there to come populate Aenea.
Agreed with both Eric and Ramana - Aenea pretty much *is* NWN for me. And my life is better for all that I have encountered regarding Aenea.
Outdoor Garden Bath Tubs Inspirations to Consider - There‘s nothing quite as relaxing like a leisurely evening soak inside the hot tub following a long, hard day's work. Sore muscles can finally relax like t...
The more people working towards a goal, the better the odds that the goal will be reached, it’s the basic driving force in croudsourced development. This is especially true for out-there type research that needs many independent minds looking for breakthroughs. Unfortunately some ideas are just too out there, just as time travel, so there are pitifully few people dedicating their lives to these goals.
The idea here is to find a photo that is clearly from, say, the early 90’s with a younger man and an older man or woman, and send the photo to random people around the age of 20 to 22 (men or women as the case may be) with a note that says something of the sort:
In 1994 you and I met. You spun some tale that you were from the distant future, showed me some interesting technology that would seem to indicate it, predicted smart phones and the whole Charlie Sheen incident, bummed a meal off me, and posed for the enclosed photo. You are the older gentleman on the left. You asked me to send you this photo in/around 2013 to 2014 timeframe to inspire you to get to work, that it was actually this photo that got you going on the road to making the breakthrough and meeting the people necessary to develop your time travelling capabilities.
To be honest, I’m still having a hard time believing it (which, ironically, you told me I would write in this letter) and if it wasn’t for the technology you brought from the future to show me I would have never believed enough even to write this letter and buy a stamp, so don’t forget to bring some cool stuff along to show me.
1) “linear accelerations in a *near* vacuum, with emphasis on the near” and you’d know what that meant
Sure, most people are not going to change their lives based on this letter, but send this letter to a significantly large number of people, but not so large that it is exposed as a hoax, and you’ll get lots of people dedicating significant time to this task.

A multimedia showcase by the pioneer students of the School of Science and Technology (SST) Singapore, on 'The Elderly Challenge'
A creative take on resolving the problem of pouring liquids from one container into another, without spillage.
The main objective of this blog is to showcase and celebrate the multimedia artefacts by the pioneer (Year 1, 2010) batch of students of the School of Science and Technology (SST), Singapore.
These works are the culmination of the students' 1-semester effort in uncovering their understanding of the theme 'The Elderly Challenge' in the Art, Design, Media and Technology (ADMT) subject area. Though the primary aim of this effort is in proposing an elderly-friendly product experience, elements of Challenge-Based Learning (CBL), innovation, entrepreneurship and media literacy are also encouraged to give the SST student a deeper experience towards the idea of Applied Learning. And all this in collaboration with the Alexandra Health Group (Singapore) that has so kindly provided support and expertise when needed.
It is hoped that through the students' exposure to the challenges faced by the elderly in the context of a developed country like Singapore, the students would be more aware of the situation and future environment that they are in, and would be in.
So do take some time to look through the multimedia presentations done creatively by the students from the various classes for their proposed products and/or solutions, and enjoy their efforts.

I have recently set up two blogs, which are based elsewhere so clicking on them will take you to another site.
My new blog is off-site and not concerned solely with music but with any old topic that crosses the brain. Early topics covered include:-
The importance of Remembrance and the impressive television programmes shown around Remembrance Day, such as the heart-wrenching Forgotten Heroes: the Not Dead and Ian Hislop's Not Forgotten
Watching repeats of the 80s UK version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and seeing some of those comedians regularly at the Comedy Store
Visiting an orthopaedic consultant at an NHS hospital and learning I have something in common with Wayne Rooney
The odd glimpse of wildlife, such as watching a pigeon family raise its surprisingly cute (at one stage) bambino outside my kitchen window
Music topics will be covered occasionally, but basically I will post about whatever meandering journeys my brain has taken me on that day or so....
I've set this blog up to replace the guest book on this site, which was defeated by spam, (although previously left comments remain on the Guest Book page), and although I might occasionally add some music thoughts there instead of two the Brain Tracings blog, it's principally just there for you to add any comments you have about this site, about any great concerts you've been to, about what you're listening to these days.....so please visit it and have your say by clicking the link below!

On December 7th, 2013 a group of Jordan’s closest family and friends met for dinner at El Quijote in Chelsea, NYC to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Jordan’s death. I had been avoiding eating there while living in the city for the past nine and a half years, since that was where we had our final family dinner with Jordan 10 years ago — right before he went to the protest in Miami.
In attendance were Abe, Jared, Tom, Diane, Sheila, and my fiance Danielle. We caught up on each other’s lives while sharing pitchers of sangria along with our favorite Jordan stories. We had a toast to him and Abe volunteered to read some words my Dad had written for the occasion. Here are those words.
We are here to Honor the Life of Jordan Matthew Feder. To say he’ll be missed does not begin to cover the depth of what we’ve lost. Men of his character, commitment, wit and courtesy are rare indeed, sad to say. Those of us whose lives he touched came away so much the richer for the experience.
Jordan was a unique character. From the onset of college, he did not do drugs. He did not drink alcohol. He was a vegan in his dietary food. Under a crisis when most people would put in shows of false bravado – Jordan would quietly attend to his business. He liked to get people to underestimate him. His quick smile and friendly manner was always disarming and warming, but there was no mistaking – He was as fierce in battle as he was gentle in friendship. His friends always wanted Jordan next to them when a skirmish or battle with either the police or white supremacists caused trouble because his friends felt safer when he was near them.
As far as I am concerned, he died a hero – returning from a NAFTA demonstration in Florida trying to make the world a safer and better place for us all. But more importantly, he lived a hero.
If the world had more men like Jordan Feder, there would be no need for an Army to protect us from harm.
This past June, I turned 67 years old. To some here, it’s ancient. To others it’s young. But lately I’ve been thinking about what we leave behind when we die, what are our legacies. I even wonder how long our loved ones will remember us.
So I started to think about my son, Jordan. I thought about his voice, his laugh, and the days when he was 3 (three) years old and he would stare in the mirror and practice his funny faces. I recall another incident when he was around 5 years old and he jumped on a big 7 year old kid that was hitting his older brother – yelling at him to get off his brother. Even then, he was wildly protective of his friends or relatives. I thought about the day in High School he informed me he was going to stop drinking alcohol – for good. Knowing he was on his way to college soon, I suggested to moderate his drinking and stopping altogether would be difficult with all the peer pressure around him in college. His answer was, “I can handle that part – I intend to stop drinking.” And for the four years in college and beyond, he did exactly that.
I marveled at his wisdom in seeing the big picture of things. I recalled how much I enjoyed talking with him, how much common sense he had and how much he loved his brother, his Mom and me. I remember how many people wrote to us telling us how much Jordan impacted their lives. He was the glue that kept everybody together. He never judged others; he just tried to bring out the best in them. I am proud because my son, Jordan, came into the world and made the world a better place. You can’t ask much more of a son to leave the world in a better place that he came into. Early in his life he realized that if we don’t care about others, others will not care about us. He used to say ‘wealth is not calculated by what you accumulate, but by what you share.’ So take what he taught us and pass it on. It’s important you understand that now, you’re Jordan’s voice.
He was my son. When he came home from college, he would go out and come home very late at night. I knew the things he was doing were dangerous, and I would never go to sleep until he came home safely. When he came home, we would talk – sometimes for hours. He loved sharing his world with me. He was more than my son…he was also my friend. But he also was a great friend and brother to many others. Irreplaceable. He will forever be missed. For all that knew him behind the facade of Mr. Cool & Quirky, he was a kind-hearted, genuine, warm person who always believed that people meant well, even if they did not.
So, what is his legacy? “He was the glue that kept people together.” He negotiated truces and kept the peace. He was cool-headed when everyone else around them might not have been. He made people feel good about themselves. He made them believe in themselves. He made them laugh. He made them feel safe. He was a friend to all those around him. He was a leader. Jordan brought out the best in you – and made you a better person for it. So the real question I pose to you that knew Jordan – “Has Jordan brought joy to you or to others you know?” The resounding answer is “YES!” That is his legacy!
Jordan fought the good fight and I was proud to call him my son. Walking through life with my son, Jordan, for 23 years has been a very gracious experience.
Murrow: Have you found anything that has been particularly useful, or perhaps I could use the word inspirational, to you?
JFK: Well, I do have something here that was written by Alan Seeger who, as you’ll remember, was born in NY & fought in the Foreign Legion and was killed in the First World War in 1916. He wrote that famous poem, I Have a Rendezvous with Death.
Just before he died, he wrote a letter home to his mother which I think has good advice for all of us: Whether I am on the winning or losing side is not the point with me. It is being on the side where my sympathies lie that matters. Success in life means doing that thing that which nothing else conceivable seems more noble or satisfactory or remunerative. And then being ready to see it through to the end.”

Vivian is rolled into the scene in a wheelchair for her x-ray and upper GI series. She is asked her name but when she tries to provide additional information about who she is and what she does, there is no response. At one point she gives the name Lucy, Countess of Bedford, which again inspires no reaction from the technicians. Vivian continues to talk to the audience as the technicians run the tests. After her undergraduate degree, Vivian continued to study for three years with E.M. Ashford, “during which time,” she says, “I learned by example what it means to be a scholar of distinction.” She names off her publications. Vivian identifies the salient characteristic of Donne’s poems as wit. Wit sharpens the mind, and uncovering the wit in Donne’s poems is the final test of ability...

Exporting Essentials: Selling Products and Services to the World Successfully is for entrepreneurs and small business owners--the makers, movers, and shakers in our world--interested in taking their businesses to the next level of growth through exports. This short, hard-hitting book covers just the essentials, providing the tools you need to tap new markets. And it couldn't be more timely.
In the old days, creating an international business was left to relatively few--those with the wherewithal to move boatloads of goods into foreign countries. But now, thanks to the Internet, businesses of all sizes have a huge new opportunity to sell both goods and services globally. Yet only 1% of all U.S. businesses export. Why?
Typically, exporting begins with unsolicited inquiries from foreign customers on the web via email, website, blog, or posting on a Facebook page. People outside your country want your product, and they want it now. The problem is that most small business owners do not know how to service these inquiries. What's the best way to ship goods? Do I need a license? Should I sell through wholesalers in specific countries or directly to consumers? How will I get paid?
Help is here--Exporting Essentials, an abridged version of the author's Exporting: The Definitive Guide to Selling Abroad Profitably, equips you with the knowledge you need to sell and fulfill orders internationally. It also imparts a can-do spirit on exporting, leading to greater revenues, stability, and profitability for your business. Exporting Essentials: Selling Products and Services to the World Successfully
Lays out simple steps to conduct market research, find customers, open new markets, get paid, and ship goods and services.
With 70 percent of global buying power lying outside U.S. borders, exporting is not just an option for ambitious entrepreneurs--it's an absolute must for building and sustaining a successful future.

Young scientists can build a wormery and learn about compost, crack rocks with water and learn about freezing and thawing, build and launch a water rocket to see Newton's laws in action, and more.
Supporting STEAM education initiatives and the Maker Movement, Maker Lab: Outdoors includes 25 interactive projects to inspire kids' creativity and their scientific side, and, as the founder of Maker Faire Dale Dougherty says, "to realize with their hands what they can imagine in their minds."
With stunning photography, succinct step-by-step instructions, and detailed explanations, Maker Lab: Outdoors takes readers on a journey of discovery. A must-have for every young scientist curious about their surroundings, and for makers, crafters, and those who enjoy exploring the outdoors.
Many women believe that the aches and pains associated with pregnancy-from backaches to carpal tunnel syndrome-just have to be tolerated. But that doesn't need to be the case Drs. Vicki and Erik Hemmett, two passionate and expert chiropractors, are here to help you enjoy a vibrant pregnancy with minimal discomfort.
The doctors outline nine basic prenatal orthopedic conditions: piriformis syndrome (hip and/or leg pain), bursitis (hip pain), sacroiliac syndrome, low back pain, foot pain, pubic pain, carpal tunnel syndrome and thoracic outlet syndrome (numbness and tingling in the hands), breech presentation, and preventing postnatal urinary incontinence.
In addition to these different techniques, the Hemmetts have created a guide to basic prenatal nutrition requirements. You don't need to "eat for two," but you do need to make sure you and your baby get essential vitamins and nutrients.
You don't need to live with your pain Take the first step to alleviating your aches and tension, and have a happier, healthier, and more peaceful pregnancy.
Union army officer Cameron Scott is used to being obeyed, but nothing about this journey to Lake Tahoe has gone as expected. He's come to fetch his daughter and nephew, and seek revenge on the people who killed his brother. Instead he finds himself trapped by a blizzard with two children who are terrified of him and stubborn but beautiful Gwen Harkness, who he worries may be trying to keep the children.
When danger descends on the cabin where they're huddled, Cam is hurt trying to protect everyone and now finds Gwen caring for him too. He soon realizes why the kids love her so much and wonders if it might be best for him to move on without them. When she sees his broken heart, Gwen decides to help him win back their affection--and in the process he might just win her heart as well.

In June 2000, IBM displayed a prototype for a wristwatch that ran Linux. The original version had only 6 hours of battery life, which was later extended to 12.[20] It featured 8 MB of memory and ran Linux 2.2.[21] The device was later upgraded with an accelerometer, vibrating mechanism, and fingerprint sensor. IBM began to collaborate with Citizen Watch Co. to create the "WatchPad". The WatchPad 1.5 features a 320 × 240 QVGA monochrome touch sensitive display and runs Linux 2.4.[22][23] It also features calendar software, Bluetooth, 8 MB of RAM and 16 MB of flash memory.[24][25] Citizen was hoping to market the watch to students and businessmen, with a retail price of around $399.[25] Epson Seiko introduced their Chrono-bit wristwatch in September 2000. The Chrono-bit watches feature a rotating bezel for data input, synchronize PIM data via a serial cable, and can load custom watch faces.[26]
Built-in GPS and a great workout coach make the Huawei Watch 2 a great companion on long runs and intense workouts. You can leave your phone behind, too, thanks to onboard music storage and the ability to connect Bluetooth headphones to the watch. Like the LG Watch Sport, the Huawei Watch 2 has an LTE version, but unfortunately, Huawei isn't selling that model in the US yet.
If you’re trying to decide which one is right for you, allow us to help. The Versa is smaller and looks good on most wrist sizes, while the Ionic is probably best for large wrists. The other main difference is GPS connectivity — the Ionic comes with built-in GPS, while the Versa does not. However, you can pair it with your smartphone if you don’t mind bringing it with you on a run.
Smartwatches, like smart phones, can also run apps, via your smart phone or right on the watch. These include health and fitness apps (thus the comparison with activity trackers), apps that control functions such as music and the camera on your phone, navigation apps, and more. Because most smartwatches have open software platforms (at least so far), developers are coming up with new and innovative apps that can increase the functionality of the devices.
The original android smartwatch models were bulky and uncomfortable, but technological advances have led to stunning designs including the Samsung smart watch and apple smart watch. Our incredible selection of android smart watch devices is packed with the latest smartwatch android OS systems for maximum performance. Together with clear displays (with customization options), they also deliver maximum comfort with premium quality straps (including leather) for all-day use, Bluetooth functionality to connect to your smartphone for notifications, and dedicated apps for precise control. Enjoy a smart watch android experience with the freedom to do more and achieve so much more with your time.
Fitbit OS 2.0 brings a new-look UI that offers more insights into your daily data and quick reply support for messages for Android phone users (iOS support coming at a later date). You can still download apps and a whole lot of watch faces, pay from your wrist using Fitbit Pay and tap into Fitbit Coach, while new women's health tracking has also been introduced for the first time, which is also available for the Ionic, too.

Smart watches are more than for just tech lovers. Today’s smart watches are packed with health and fitness monitoring features to stay motivated and improve your health over time including pedometer (step count), precision heart rate monitor, sleep tracking, sedentary reminder and even GPS. Water resistant designs make them especially ideal for both sports and outdoor use. Android smart watches also help you to stay organized in your busy life, working in tandem with other devices, such as connecting to your smart phone via Bluetooth to show incoming calls and notification alerts. Style matters too: that’s why our extensive range offers great designs suitable for urban wear, sports, and outdoor wear. So whether you’re shopping for smart watches for men or smart watches for women, our affordable deals provide the perfect blend of versatility, style and features.
In 2009, Hermen van den Burg, CEO of Smartwatch and Burg Wearables, launches Burg the first standalone smartphone watch which has its own sim card and does not require to be tethered to a smartphone. Burg receives the award for the Most Innovative Product at the Canton Fair in April 2009[36][37][38][39][40][41][42] Also, Samsung launched the S9110 Watch Phone which featured a 1.76-inch (45 mm) color LCD display and was 11.98 millimetres (0.472 in) thin.[18]
Then your typical exercise activity will determine which model is the best fit. You can expect to pay $1500 - $350 for a fitness tracker. If you are simply interested in hitting your 10,000 steps a day, an entry-level Fitbit will do the trick for around $150. Garmin has fitness trackers designed specifically with runners and cyclists in mind, giving you accurate tracking of biking and cycling distance covered using GPS. They’ll cost more as a result - $350 - $800.
Why we like it: Fossil’s Q Explorist and Venture watches are good-looking watches with a decent range of case and band options, and decent responsiveness and battery life—this is high praise given the current state of Android smartwatches. They can track steps, control music playback, give you turn-by-turn directions on your wrist, and allow you to respond to messages with your voice or quick-reply taps. But these two models are not unique: The Fossil Group offers an array of more than 300 smartwatches under different fashion brands—including Diesel, Skagen, Tag Heuer, Kate Spade, and Movado—that have essentially the same internal components and software, so you can pick the watch design you like best.
Flaws but not dealbreakers: The Apple Watch requires an iPhone—if you have another kind of phone, you’re out of luck. While good Apple Watch apps are better than what you get for Android smartwatches, many are still very limited compared with their phone counterparts. And it can get annoying how aggressively the Apple Watch turns off its screen (to save energy) whenever it senses you’ve put your arm down.
My personal favorite watch for Android on the market today actually isn’t an Android Wear device, rather coming from Samsung and running atop Tizen. The Samsung Gear S3 Frontier is all the smartwatch you’ll ever need, with a sporty, circular gray design with a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display that is the best I’ve personally ever used and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass SR+.

The City Hall of Barcelona is continuously working to obtain easier and safer the journeys through the streets of this city by bicycle. And it seems that they are achieving it!
Barcelona thinks that the bicycle is the best means of transport for circulating through the city. For this reason, as we indicated in other mails of this blog, it is working in order for the circulation to become easier and safer, something that the very neighbors of the city are perceiving.
During the year 2015, the journeys through Barcelona increased a 2.7%, which has turned into 4.9 MILIONS of internal journeys, of which more than 96% have been carried out by the people who live in the city. For us, these figures are an irrefutable evidence that bicycles are going to be the means of transport of the future in these streets, improving, in this way, the traffic, the pollution levels and, in general, the good mood of all the people who are moving through the streets of Barcelona.
In order to guarantee this result, Barcelona has created a new manual about the bike lanes’ signposting. With this manual, it pretends, among other goals, to improve the cyclists’ security, reducing the conflicts with the pedestrian and also improving the routes’ connectivity. You can find this manual in the Bicycle section of the Barcelona’s City Hall web, together with other audiovisual resources which completes it.
If you are not already circulating through the city by bicycle, it seems that you will run out of any excuses to avoid trying it.
Nuestra prioridad es la seguridad, utilizando los carriles bici, planteamos rutas seguras y tranquilas evitando al máximo el tráfico. Un plan para todos los públicos. Límite de 15 personas por grupo.
Production of biofuels from renewable feedstocks has captured considerable scientific attention since they could be used to supply energy and alternative fuels. Bioethanol is one of the most interesting biofuels due to its positive impact on the environment. Currently, it is mostly produced from sugar- and starch-containing raw materials. However, various available types of lignocellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues, and herbaceous energy crops could serve as feedstocks for the production of bioethanol, energy, heat and value-added chemicals. Lignocellulose is a complex mixture of carbohydrates that needs an efficient pretreatment to make accessible pathways to enzymes for the production of fermentable sugars, which after hydrolysis are fermented into ethanol. Despite technical and economic difficulties, renewable lignocellulosic raw materials represent low-cost feedstocks that do not compete with the food and feed chain, thereby stimulating the sustainability. Different bioprocess operational modes were developed for bioethanol production from renewable raw materials. Furthermore, alternative bioethanol separation and purification processes have also been intensively developed. This paper deals with recent trends in the bioethanol production as a fuel from different renewable raw materials as well as with its separation and purification processes.

I wanted to share some upcoming concert dates. The last two years I’ve toured Europe in the fall but this year I’m working on a European tour for Spring of 2018 and instead I have fall concerts on Vancouver Island and near Washington, DC.
I start things off with a solo concert at 2:30 pm, Sunday, September 24th in Qualicum Beach, BC, at the “Old School House Arts Centre” as part of their concert series. A nice article about the concert in the local paper.
Then I’ll be performing as a soloist with the Victoria Chamber Orchestra, playing Debussy’s Danses Sacrée et Profane at 8 pm on Friday, October 20th at First Church of Christ, Scientist, 1205 Pandora, Victoria, BC. I love the Debussy Danses – I played them for the first time with Yariv Aloni and the Victoria Chamber Orchestra over 20 years ago – can’t wait to play them again :) I’ll also be playing the wonderful harp part to Vaughan Williams Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus on the same concert.
I’ll be performing a solo concert at 2:30pm, on Saturday, October 28th in Victoria, BC, at St. Luke’s Church, 3821 Cedar Hill X Rd.
I’m attending the Camac Harp Festival in Washington, DC (well, actually in Alexandria) the weekend of November 3-5, just for fun! Should be a great weekend :)
And afterwards I’ll be doing a masterclass and solo concert for the Washington, DC, American Harp Society chapter on Monday, November 6th. The masterclass starts at 4:30pm and the concert starts at 7pm. Ark and Dove Presbyterian Church (8424 Piney Orchard Parkway, Odenton, Maryland
And finally I’ll be playing in Lumberon, North Carolina, on Tuesday, November 7th. 7pm, Trinity Episcopal Church, 1202 N Chestnut St. Lumberton, NC
Moving forces you to sort through everything you own, and that develops a chance to prune your valuables. It's not constantly simple to choose what you'll bring along to your brand-new house and what is predestined for the curb. In some cases we're sentimental about items that have no practical use, and sometimes we're overly optimistic about clothes that no longer sports or fits equipment we inform ourselves we'll begin using again after the move.
Despite any pain it may cause you, it is necessary to eliminate anything you genuinely do not require. Not just will it help you avoid clutter, but it can actually make it much easier and more affordable to move.

In about 20 years of cohabiting, my partner and I have moved 8 times. For the very first seven moves, our homes or condominiums got progressively bigger. That permitted us to build up more clutter than we required, and by our eighth move we had a basement storage location that housed six VCRs, a minimum of a lots board games we had actually seldom played, and a guitar and a pair of amplifiers that I had actually not touched in the whole time we had cohabited.
We had actually carted all this things around since our ever-increasing space permitted us to. For our final move, nevertheless, we were downsizing from about 2,300 square feet of completed area, with storage and a two-car garage, to 1,300 square feet with neither storage nor a garage. And we were doing it by U-Haul.
As we packed up our personal belongings, we were constrained by the space limitations of both our brand-new condominium and the 20-foot rental truck. We required to discharge some stuff, that made for some tough options.
Having room for something and requiring it are two totally various things. For our move from Connecticut to Florida, my other half and I put down some ground guidelines:
If we have not utilized it in over a year, it goes. This helped both people cut our wardrobes way down. I personally got additional hints rid of half a lots matches I had no event to wear (a lot of which did not fit), along with lots of winter season clothes I would no longer require (though a few pieces were kept for journeys up North).
If it has not been opened considering that the previous move, eliminate it. We had a whole garage filled with plastic bins from our previous relocation. One contained absolutely nothing but smashed glass wares, and another had grilling devices we had actually long considering that changed.
Don't let fond memories trump reason. This was a hard one, since we had actually accumulated over 2,000 CDs and more than 10,000 books. Moving them was not useful, and digital formats like MP3s and e-books made them all unneeded.
One was stuff we absolutely wanted-- things like our staying clothing and the furniture we required for our new home. Due to the fact that we had one U-Haul and two little cars and trucks to fill, some of this stuff would merely not make the cut.
It is possible transferring to another town would put you in line for a property buyer assistance program that is not offered to you now. It is possible relocating to another town would put you in line for a homebuyer help program that is not available to you now.
Moving required us to part with a lot of products we desired but did not need. I even provided a big tv to a friend who helped us move, since in the end, it merely did not fit.
Packing too much stuff is among the greatest moving mistakes you can make. Save yourself some time, cash, and peace of mind by decluttering as much as possible prior to you move.
The Cabaret Metro in Wrigleyville neighborhood of Chicago (well known as just the Metro now) has hosted a great number of stellar acts since 1982. Some of which I have witnessed, and most of them were with our group “The Fish Guys.” Brown and Crosse and Sonny frequented multiple times with me to see a number of acts like Jon Spencer’s Blues Explosion, The Jesus Lizard and The Reverend Horton Heat. The Metro holds about 1100 people. So it’s a larger venue in the city but by no means as massive as say the Aragon Ballroom. And it can get loud…really loud. I remember that from JSBX show…just piercing but somehow cathartic.
That was not the case this past Wednesday when the four of us took in the reincarnation of the MC5 headed by guitarist Wayne Kramer under the guise of the MC50. While it rocked for certain, the sound in the Metro that evening was well, perfect.
Krammer is one of two original members of the MC5 still kicking and has toured as the MC5 in various lineups for good part of the past 15 years. The original MC5 were together until 1973 releasing 3 major label LPs. Then a 20 year hiatus and a reformation of the group in 1993 for a tribute to late singer Rob Tyner. In 2003 Kramer took to the road again and gigged with his two other original band mates Michael Davis on bass and Dennis Thompson on drums. They gigged with supporting members until 2012. This past year Kramer recruited Kim Thayil (Soundgarden) on second guitar, Billy Gould (Faith No More) on bass, Brendan Canty (Fugazi) on drums and front man extraordinaire Mark Durant (Zen Guerilla) to celebrate 50 years of Kicking out the Jams.

Nature is reclaiming my elderly neighbour’s house. Really rubbing his nose in it. Recently I’ve been walking around all my former haunts, and this album has been accompanying me. Of course, there’s nothing like the olfactory and auditory to fast-track you to your memory banks, but this is nostalgia illegitimately invoked since this is an album as new to me as the year. Ordinarily I try to unearth an album to share with you that I’ve lived with for a long time, but strangely, this is an album that takes me to the era it was made without me having heard it before.
So, 2017 huh? Look, I’ll be honest with you, I’ve really been struggling to come up with some kind of year-end list of pop culture phenomena and detritus that were special to me or that made the year great or whatever, and I just don’t think I can do it. I’ll always have “Twin Peaks,” and this new cinematic Stephen King Renaissance has been pretty cool to watch take off, as well as all the other films I enjoyed (which you can read about here) this year. And sure, I’ve got my albums and songs that I dug on a whole bunch just as I do every year (which you can also read about here, here, and here respectively), but I just can’t summon the power or the energy to write a recap that won’t sound like I’m repeating myself…or that will make up for the general, overwhelming hopelessness and despair that 2017 has been wrought with.

Our family was middle class, blue collar, Polish and suburban. If you look at the average income of all the Chicago suburbs, Palos Hills falls literally right in the middle. Whatever “middle class” is these days, but in 1991 there was still a middle class and my brother and I grew up in it. As such we generally took one family trip a year, that is if my parents could afford it and get off of work. In the summer of 1991 we traveled west for not one but two weeks! I think my father’s rationalizing was we hadn’t taken a trip the previous year, and odds on after I graduated high school would not take another one as the four of us. This was “the last big family adventure!”
In late July we pilled into our tan Chevrolet four-door Suburban (the SUV before SUVs) and headed west on I-80. I will hand it to my parents, it was an epic trip and more then likely spawned my travel bug for years to come. We made stops at Pike’s Peak, the Grand Canyon, four corners, Las Vegas, The Great Salt Lake, Yellowstone National Park and The Devil’s tower. I’m sure there were a few kitch stops as well knowing my mother.
Appropriately enough, I read The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy during that two weeks. I had a black Sony Walkman and I loved that machine. I played so much music through that contraption in the four years between sophomore year in high school and freshman year at the university. On this trip it was REM’s Out of Time, Sting’s The Soul Cages and of course Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers Into the Great Wide Open…today’s Friday album.
We come to the final member of the Holy Trinity, The Smiths’ The Queen is Dead, which along with The Cure’s The Head on the Door and New Order’s Brotherhood, were the three albums I was given for Christmas when I was 13 that went on to influence my musical taste for the rest of my life. The Queen is Dead probably got the least play out of the three back then, but has proven to have the most staying power despite my ever-growing weariness with Morrissey and his… Morrisseyness. The simple truth is that I love the Smiths despite Morrissey, not because of him. Johnny Marr has been my lifelong guitar god and if I have to listen to an obnoxious narcissist bloviate over the top of him, it’s worth it to get those sweetass riffs and jangles.

I really thought someone would have already chosen this record for a previous edition of The Joup Friday Album. However, a quick search for “The Postal Service” in the search bar in the upper right column came back with nothing… so here you have it: The Joup Friday album comes from various parts of the world; The Postal Service’s only full length release on Sub Pop Records, entitled “Give Up.”

That kid who sat at the back of the class, seemingly almost monochromatic except for his Egon Schiele pink-tinged skin? You never heard of him again. You assume he was institutionalised after leaving school for the strange things he was rumoured to be doing to the neighbourhood pets in his bedroom. Or perhaps he even managed to drift along under the radar for a while until he finally did that hushed-up ‘something’ that got him put away for the rest of his natural days. It thrills my soul to think, that for someone in the world, that kid has wandered back into their consciousness as a bona fide dyed-in-the-wool purveyor of American song. The signs were already apparent on the aptly named ‘Supper’, the penultimate, most accomplished album of Smog’s career to that point. The songs were sumptuously crafted, achingly poignant or else chugged-along rockingly, teeming with an abundance of astute observation delivered in his trademark laconic style. After declaring his love for a watercourse, the Smog lifted, and along with it, so did his mood…albeit temporarily, making it easy to forget that this monochromatic, Egon Schiele-skinned kid used to do strange things to his tape recorder in his bedroom.

Nordstrom is gearing up to open two new store locations in Los Angeles that will embrace its latest inventory-free retail concept, baptized Nordstrom Local.
The Upscale department store operator announced on Monday that the latest Nordstrom Local neighborhood hubs would open in Brentwood and in Downtown, Los Angeles this fall. The first Nordstrom Local opened late last year on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles and is designed to offer customers access to Nordstrom services like onsite tailoring and alterations, curbside pickup, easy returns, and more. The concept is made to make shopping more convenient for customers by providing services, but no inventory.
"Nordstrom is continuing to invest in its growth strategy with the goal of increasing market share by providing customers with better and more convenient services and access to more products," said Ken Worzel, president of Nordstrom.com and chief digital officer, in a news statement.
"Through our local market strategy, we're combining the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people, product, and place to help reimagine the shopping experience for our customers."
The new Nordstrom Local in Brentwood will be approximately 1,200 square feet and will open at 214 26th Street, while the downtown Los Angeles location will be located at 700 S Flower St, and will be approximately 2,200 square feet.
The new store concept comes at a time where the retail landscape is changing. Retailers have since been embracing smaller retail footprints and more innovative store designs. Nordstrom also opened its first men’s-only store in New York City earlier this year.
In its latest reported quarter ended May 5, Nordstrom’s net income rose to $87 million, or 51 cents per share, from $63 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue increased 6.2 percent to $3.56 billion, beating estimates of $3.46 billion.

An average person spends about 30% of his life in bed, depending on the kind of work he does or the kind of lifestyle he has. Sleeping habits are developed over a period of time. Some jobs that require long wakeful hours at night are one of the known causes of sleep deprivation in adults. Teens and youngsters usually stay up late hanging around with their buddies or watching nightly shows. Either way it will negatively affect our normal sleeping habits. It won’t take long before these sleep patterns become a part of their habit as the body tries to adapt to these unnatural changes. Oversleeping is just as bad because of the negative effects of too much inactivity.
How many hours of sleep is beneficial for well-being? Ideally, 7 to 9 hours is considered to be the best to have optimum results. But then again individual differences would mean that sleeping patterns will be different for every person. The best way to know if you’re getting enough sleep is that you don’t feel drowsy throughout the day. It’s like having yourself fully-charged and you feel like working all day. Of course, this is not necessarily true at all times, especially when you’re a bit under the weather or maybe when you’re in a boring meeting. In some countries, it’s natural to feel a little drowsy during midday or afternoon (“siesta”).
We all need to sleep right to maintain our well-being. We often dismiss the fact that sleep deprivation is scientifically and clinically proven to impair our body’s defenses and ability to recuperate from the wear and tear of our daily activities.
Heart disease prevention. People who suffer from heart disease and stroke are known to have bad sleeping habits. Those with already high levels body fat and cholesterol are especially at risk. Having the right amount of sleep will help reduce the risk and promote a healthier heart.
Cancer Prevention. Prolonged exposure to light at nighttime suppresses our body’s ability to produce melatonin and cortisol. This makes our body vulnerable to cancer cells. Women who are sleep deep deprived are very susceptible to certain cancers such as cancer of the breast.
Sleep enhances brain activity. Needless to say, sleep makes us more alert and energized for the day. Sleeping improves brain functions and is a better alternative to caffeine or other stimulants that have negative side-effects.
As with any other activities, getting the best result comes from consistent effort. Same goes with our sleeping habits.
If you have to make up for a lost sleep, you can take a nap early in the afternoon and it should not be more than 30 minutes. Soon enough, your body learn to adapt to these changes and restore your healthy sleeping habits.

This is the sort of question that vexes film and TV people because we're torn between two things: the need to follow conventions, so that the audience can follow what's going on, and the desire to be original. Or, to put it another way, we're a bunch of insecure fashion victims who lack the courage of our own convictions.

We love to talk smack about the Oscars. They gave Crash the award for Best Picture, after all. And in this day and age when the definitions of cinema are changing and film fans are watching what they want, how they want, through various platforms and formats, the Academy sometimes seems behind the times with all their rules and their fancy black tie affair. Plus there are so many other awards shows, from those favoring more popular movies to those honoring indies, from those chosen by kids to those chosen by critics, and these other options for the celebration of cinema often make up for this or that “snub” by the Oscars by offering some kind of broader recognition of contenders.

So I have been playing as Rome in the Third Servile War scenario. I have utterly crushed the slaves, killed Spartacus and took all their territory back. There wasn't even a "Slaves" faction listed in the objective screen anymore. Only objective city I didn't control was the one in Sicily and that was because the region was locked. But in the end l got a minor victory, why? I have gone through the manual again but to no avail. I have been only able to get minors in this game, how am I supposed to get a major victory?
AGEOD victory are different from other games. Most other games only use territorial objectives or territorial objectives minus battle casualties. These are fine, but often understate actual victory.
Before providing my understanding, let me say, in these games if you break even or win a minor victory you should be very happy.
Time it takes to achieve your goal – the victory cities. Incidently, there are very few victory cities you cannot take if you take the best couse of play or the optimum options. So if there is a locked one, there might be an option you are missing.
I think the Major victory in AJE is only awarded if you force the enemy to surrender before the end of the scenario because of a national Morale automatic victory.

Invisalign® straightens your teeth without wires and brackets, using a series of clear, customized, removable appliances called aligners. It's virtually undetectable, which means hardly anyone will know that you're straightening your teeth.
The Invisalign System combines advanced 3-D computer graphics technology with 100-year-old science of orthodontics. Invisalign aligners are designed to move your teeth in small steps to the desired final position prescribed by your orthodontist. Each aligner is precisely calibrated and manufactured to fit your mouth at each stage of the treatment plan. Your first step is to visit our office to determine if Invisalign is right for you. After sending precise treatment instructions, Invisalign uses advanced computer technology to translate these instructions in a sequence of finely calibrated aligners - as few as 12 or as many as 48. Each aligner is worn for about two weeks and only taken out to eat, brush and floss. As you replace each aligner with the next, your teeth will begin to move gradually - week-by-week until the final alignment prescribed is attained. Then you'll be smiling like you never have before!
To ensure the best possible results, only an orthodontist who has been trained and certified by Align Technology can diagnose and treat using Invisalign. Invisalign is not intended for children and is not appropriate for every adult. Only an orthodontist can determine if this treatment is an effective option for you. To see if Invisalign can help you achieve the smile you've always wanted, contact us to make an appointment.

Description Handwritten letter on lined paper from Laura Dewey Bridgman to Mrs. Abbie Foster, dated December 12th, 1880.
Complete Transcription S Boston. Dec 12th. 1880 My dear Mrs Forest, With a great pleasure for me to write wishing you a merry Christmas, & a jolly new year, I have never forgotten you, & think of the fine calls that we made on each other, in Vt. a year ago in Sept. I enjoyed a taste of those sweet meats often that you sent me last Winter, & also gave my dear friends some of my candy. I have [so] many orders to fulfil for Santaclaus [sic], that I cannot steal a bit of my own time for making many gifts for my friends according to the glorious blessing of Christmas & new year. How glad my heart would feel to send you a piece of my knit, Lace, but my time is so fully occupied for the friends who wish to give some articles made by my own hands away. I wonder if Santaclaus [sic] will visit me for you. Do you anticipate a call from him[?] He may make you & me suffer with a cold day, as he rambles from chimneys, in order to deliver gifts to us. My birth[day]. come[s] just in 1 week from tomorrow. You may remember me. I shall be a half century & one year old. I expect a fine visit from my little & dear blind & deaf friend Kate. Grant an invalid, on my birth.day. with my best friend Miss Moulton at the old Post unless some thing prevents her. Kate is so feeble for ma[n]y years past [.] She was ill with rheumatism in her knees &c for a few years. She called on me last Nov. & visited me 1 day last Winter, or in the Spring. I visited her 1 day in May. She resides in Newton Mass. She is not as tall as yourself. Her Sister is her guardian from place to place. She lived a good many years in Boston then the Dr recommended highly for her to go in the country, for good, when she was so miserable in ill health. It was painful for poor little lady Kate to be removed along. Is better in a'days, but will never be well again. I have a couple of mats & a tiny pitcher [and] a pair of doll-mittens knit by her delicate hands, so precious to my choice. She was instructed to articulate with her mouth as a deaf mute. She is a most charming & loving little lady. Please to excuse a mistake. I mean that my birth[day]. come[s] 1 week from Tuesday 21 of Dec. instead of Monday. I now compr[e]hend that last year, Feb had a Leap-day. I shall be most happy to receive a letter from you. How is your health & is your little son Harry as well now [?] I have the lock of his hair, around the foot-pattern, that you sent me. How do you spend the time[?] I give my aid to the matron with whom I abide the second winter Miss Smith, besides a big family of nice blind girls but they can see a good deal, & 1 small sweet girl who is totally blind, & 2 teachers. I am often ill, a bed. Don't feel as strong as 2 years ago, & have aches on my back. I assist in work[,] school[.] I am so tired writing. I read in Bible usually[.] I visited Sister Nell 3 weeks in Sept. & most [of] 2 weeks in June, once in Nov. Yours truly, L. D. Bridgman.

There are many types of filling materials available, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. You and your dentist can discuss the best options for restoring your teeth. Amalgam fillings, along with composite (tooth colored) fillings, are the most widely used today. An amalgam filling is more commonly used in the back teeth since the color is not as aesthetic as a composite filling.
As with most dental restorations, amalgam fillings are not permanent and may someday need replacement. They are very durable, and will last many years, giving you a long lasting smile.
Amalgam fillings are usually placed in one appointment. While the tooth is numb, your dentist will remove decay as necessary. The space will then be thoroughly cleansed and carefully prepared before the new filling is placed. If the decay was near the nerve of the tooth, a special medication will be applied for added protection. The silver filling will then be precisely placed, shaped, and polished, restoring your tooth to its original shape and function.
It is normal to experience sensitivity to hot and cold when amalgam fillings are first placed, however this will subside shortly after your tooth acclimates to the new filling.
You will be given post-care instructions at the completion of your treatment. Good oral hygiene practices, eating habits, and regular dental visits will aid in the life of your new fillings.

God has given us the gift of Jethro Naito Yardley! Beth and Jethro are healthy and doing well. He is 7lb 8oz and 19in. long! We're tired, but overcome with joy. Above are some pictures (the blood on my shirt is from cutting the cord). Below is the full explanation of this little man's name!
Jethro is named after Moses' father-in-law (Exodus 3:1), which literally means "his excellence" in Hebrew. Beth and I wanted a Biblical name for our son, but not a common one.
Moses' father-in-law was a spiritual man, being the priest of Midian, who became a worshiper of the one true God (YWH) after seeing God rescue Israel from Egypt - "Jethro said, 'Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of Pharaoh and has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods, because in this affair they dealt arrogantly with the people.' And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God; and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God." (Exodus 18:10-12, ESV).
Jethro was also a wise man who counseled and advised Moses himself on how best to shepherd the people of Israel (Exodus 18:13-27, ESV). And if the author of the Torah and God's chosen vessel to lead His people, Moses, "listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said" it seemed good to us also to bestow such a name upon our own son, who we hope will also be a wise spiritual leader in Christ's Kingdom.
Moses takes his leave of Jethro by Jan Victors, c. 1635, from the incident in Exodus 4:18. Jethro is seated on the left, in red.
Jethro's middle name is a Japanese family name pronounced "nigh-to" after Naitō Yukiyasu, a Japanese samurai from the 16th-17th Century who was baptized as a Christian in 1564. However, he returned to Japan in 1604 under the rule of Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu who outlawed Christianity. He was proud about his faith in Christ, even modifying his armor to incorporate the cross (pictured below), and was thus persecuted for his faith being exiled to Manila in 1614AD.
The two kanji (above) literally translate as ‘inner wisteria’; a name taken by two branches of the northern Fujiwara clan. One is descended from the famous warrior Hidesato (10th century), the other from Michinaga (966–1027), the statesman who took his family to its greatest heights of power, and on whom the main character of the classic novel Genji monogatari (‘The tale of Genji’) is based. The hirigana spelling would be うちふじ.
God has given us a love for the Japanese people, who desperately need to be reached with the Gospel of Christ. Beth and I wanted to reinforce God's calling (for all Christians) to His mission to reach all peoples with the message of His love on the cross.
It's hard to summarize all God did in my life and the life of those we interacted in a concise manner, let alone give a snapshot (I took over 1,000 pictures). Here is a quick photo book providing a taste of all we did in July.
We planted a lot of Gospels seeds in Ube and watered a lot of seeds in Ishinomaki. Our pray was that God would use our time and our labor, and we feel that He has honored that. Here is one testimony from a missionary in Ube that touched my heart:
"Praise the Lord for Chuck, Brian, and Brett's visit and time they had encouraging deeper discussions with the people they interacted with in Japan. Since, some of my students have opened up a little more to casually asking about the Bible. "
Reconciled by Christ, Brett & Beth recount their tales of service to God through their gifts of ministry & medicine with Jethro & Edessa in tow.
Growing up as a little half-Filipino boy, it felt simple and easy to practice all day long on my game. I would be in the gym for hours at a time.
Practicing my handles. Shooting jumpers. Playing pick up ball. Running drills. In between these stretches of time spent in the gym only a few other, non-urgent activities consumed my life.
Getting home to have dinner because that was my Pa's rule. And going to school at 7 A.M. Oh, and mowing the lawn and taking the trash out were also on my list.
Looking back, I now realize that because I had such little other responsibility, being in the gym and working my basketball skills was relatively simple for one reason.
My willpower - or my capacity to make decisions - was being leveraged into what I deemed at the time, the most important thing in my life. Spending a good source of my energy each day in the basketball gym was really my only "big-decision."
But fast-forward over decade, and that half-Filipino boy just noticed a few gray hairs in his crop. I've learned that our willpower is not unlimited.
As we age, responsibilities pile up. We simply can't spend all day at the YMCA and suck on capri-sun's between games of half-court lightning.
Deadlines are real now. It's not like your Ma asking you to be home by 11 P.M., and if you walk in at 12:17 A.M., she greets you with, "Oh, honey, I was so worried about you. Your meatloaf is in the microwave."
You have little Ezmae that needs to get to soccer practice at 4 P.M., and Jax has judo at 5:30 P.M., and then you have to consider what you'll prepare for dinner AFTER you get home from CrossFit at 8:44 P.M.
You have to remember to park on the opposite street so you don't get a $91 ticket on your windshield for a street-sweeping violation.
And then we have breakfast. Do I eat or do this thing called intermittent fasting? Oatmeal or bagel? Juice or water? How much coffee? Will this three egg omelette make me fat?
The point is that as we age, more decisions come into our life. Understanding why this is important - rather then resisting it - is where the value resides.
Roy Baumeister ran a study on 205 adults. These subjects were strapped with beepers, and when these beepers were sounded, the subjects were asked to take a moment to reflect on what desires he or she was currently wrestling with in the last 30 minutes.
The most common desires that the subjects reported were eating, sleeping and sex. The list was also rounded out with taking a break from hard work, checking e-mail, and social media, surging the web or watching television.
Not only does life pile on more decisions by default as we age, but it's also designed to bombard you with tempting distractions that cause you to grapple with another decision: "Do I indulge or not?"
Your response might assume a posture of individualism. You might pull your bootstraps up and tell yourself, "I got this. I can do it all on my own."
The confidence is something like a college football player before running out of the tunnel before the Rose Bowl.
Look, I respect the bravado. But research shows otherwise. Here's the truth about willpower: You (and me) have a finite amount that becomes depleted as we use it.
If you don't design your environment in a way where you are making the least amount of trivial decisions, you're likely to deplete your willpower reservoir each day on things that don't matter.
And then, when it comes time to make a decision that carries weight - like hitting the gym, engaging in deep work, meal prepping, or sharpening your skills in your craft - you can't because your pool of willpower has been drained.
I'm just like you. I deal with this same issue. So, a few years ago, I began compiling this little playbook of rituals and habits that save me time, energy and effort.
My process is always a work in progress, but I've found that the key to minimize the amount of willpower necessary to transition into and from task to task is via rituals and habits.
By adopting a system that allows me to go on autopilot with decisions, I reserve my willpower for substantive tasks.
Imagine a geisha pouring tea into a cup up to the brim, and then she keeps pouring. If your life feels like that cup of tea - overflowed with decisions - then it's time to cut down on decision making. It's time to adopt some practices that unload that cognitive demand.
I've got more on my plate now then to spend all day in a basketball gym. And I'm sure you're a busy person too.
This list of strategies are my own. The point is to let you have a glance at what works for me, but more importantly to nudge you into doing the same for yourself. Feel free to use any of them you see fit for your own daily routine.
My simple method for this is a calendar on our refrigerator. Each month, my wife lays out the dates and marks the days when the trash needs to go out and when the car needs to be moved. This works well because I see the reminders every day, multiple times a day because the whiteboard is on the refrigerator.
The reason why we started doing this is because we got tired of having trash pile up when we missed a week. And, paying a street-sweeping ticket makes you want punch a hole in the wall like the Nard dog did in The Office.
The white board automates the decision by reminding us without having to think about when to do each of the tasks.
Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.
This is coming from a man who has published four books, earned a PhD, cranks out peer-reviewed academic papers and is a tenured-track professor at Georgetown University. He also has a wife and a few kids. He doesn't work past past five or six P.M., and has time to "listen to a Nationals game slowly unfold on the radio" as he puts it.
This guy doesn't have more time than either of us - he has the same 168 hours per week. So how does he do it?
Well, because it does. If he didn't use the block method, he could never engage in carefully directed, concentrated work. This would do three things:
3. His work days would extend due to lack of potency and he would have less time to spend with his family and for personal interest, like listening to the Nationals on the radio.
The cost of distraction transcends lack of productivity. It dilutes the depth of our work. It slows down our production. And it eats away at the margins of our life - those pockets of time where you spend time with your wife or in the garage restoring that 63 impala or playing guitar or going to the gym.
When you commit to the block method, you can compress your work schedule into less time without sacrificing quality or output. Research shows that we have about three to five hours of actual work in us each day. After that, things start to dip.
6 P.M. until bedtime: I leave it open. It's usually having dinner with Charlie. Sometimes we'll go for a walk. Sometimes we'll Netflix. Sometimes we'll just sit and talk.
I'm a writer. Consequentially writing is my most important thing. Writer's need to read and research so that's a close second. I also coach people with their fitness, nutrition and wellness, so it's my personal belief that I've got to walk the talk. So training is up on my priority list as well.
These three things are my MIT's (most important things) as Leo Babauta, author of The Power of Less would say. And I've arranged my days to reflect that. The block method allows me to devote my non-renewable asset - time - to the three most important things I need to get done every day.
Find a way to use the block method in your day. Here's a short bullet point list on how to do that if you wish to.
Find uninterrupted times in your day where you can devote concentrated work to. It doesn't have to be the full three to five. In fact, it's smart to start with 90 minutes blocks. Then, as you get accustomed to working this way, add more time.
Identify your MIT's (most important things). What are the three to five most important things that must get done each day. When you find those, everything else can wait.
Use triggers to get you into the state. For me, during my morning writing sessions, my trigger right now is when I take 10g of BCAA's (branch chain amino acids) infused with green tea extract. This immediately puts me into focus mode and off I go. The trigger heaves me into the action without having to think about it.
Martin Seligman of the University of Pennsylvania organized interviews with over 350,000 thousand people over two decades to find out how they thought most of the time. His research is summarized in his book Learned Optimism.
He found that the predominant quality of people who were happy and successful was optimism - hopefulness and confidence about the future or the successful outcome of something.
I've wrestled with the softness of positive thinking and optimism myself. A lot of the advice sounds like it's coming from a world where only unicorns exist. However, I've found a principle - supported by a method that's helped me become more optimistic and think like a winner on a more consistent basis.
The principle of completion satiates a deep rooted desire we as come hard wired with: We need something to complete each day. Without completion on a daily basis, the hope about a successful outcome dissaptes.
The landscape of modern work has thrown a wrench into what completion looks like for us today. Back when everyone was a craftsman - woodworker, blacksmith, saddlers, locksmith, shoemakers, bakers - completion was simple to achieve (not to be mistaken with easy).
It was somewhat linear to conquer your day's work. Make a pair of shoes. Bake two dozen baguettes from scratch. Build a table.
Today, there are a lot more of us like lost children walking around K-Mart looking for their mother. The lack of definite completion due to the rise of mindless meetings, administrative duties that lead to nowhere, power point messages that make you want to rip your eyeballs out, vague imperatives, and overload of distraction has caused us to become less optimistic because it's not clear as to what we've made for the day - it feels like we've just shuffled papers around and exchanged a few letters digitally.
In order to relieve this frustration, find something to finish each day. Identity a measurable outcome that you can chalk off as "complete."
For me, it's writing for about two hours a day. Regardless if I think it's good or not, I stay put in the chair and pound the keys for two hours. When I do this, it gives me a sense of completion. I've done the work.
It's simple. At the end of the day, I write down the five things that must get done the next day. Then, I write down the three things that I did well for the day. Lastly, I write one thing that I'm grateful for.
Again, for me, writing at least two hours a day is my measure of completion. It's a simple mark that I can shoot for everyday. The 5/3/1 exercise helps me stay on track to do this consistently. And when I complete something every day, I become more optimistic.
These three strategies have worked for me. They have provided a simple framework on how to manage my daily decision making.
And thus, it reserves mental and physical energy for me to be my best where my best is needed. I think you can take these strategies and make them your own to do the same.

HERE WE ARE, another Halloween, another list of recommendations for your holiday viewing pleasure. Included are both classics, and a few that you may have missed. There are probably even a couple that you've intentionally passed over at the video store due to lame covers or bad box descriptions. You may not like all of my recommendations, but with any luck you'll find at least one that sends shivers down your spine. After all, 'tis the season. Boo!
Jack Russell (George C. Scott) is a pianist who loses his family in a car accident. Putting the tragedy behind him, Russell moves to Seattle where he takes a teaching position and rents a rambling mansion from the local historical society. No sooner does Russell move into the house than a ghostly presence makes itself known. Doors open by themselves, a loud banging wakes Russell every morning, and a ghost appears in the bathtub (scarier than it sounds). After finding a hidden room in the attic, and an especially productive séance, Russell is slowly drawn into an elaborate murder mystery.
Haunted house films don't get much more classic than this. The house is brooding and dilapidated; the protagonist is anguished and slightly Byronic: the set up is perfect for a dark and stormy night. The Changeling is perhaps best known for its terrifying wheelchair scene, a scene that's engrained in many people's nightmares. This film is for those who prefer supernatural horrors to those more corporeal. It is one part The Haunting (1942) and one part Chinatown (1973).
Creepshow is an anthology of five, star-studded, comic book-style horror stories. "Father's Day," starring Ed Harris, is a zombie revenge story set at a remote manor. "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verill," with tour de force acting by Stephen King, is about a man who turns into a plant. "Something To Tide You Over," starring Leslie Nielson, is another revenge story featuring a zombie Ted Danson returning from his watery grave. "The Crate," with Hal Holbrook, is about a mysterious crate found in the basement of an old university building. And finally, "They'll Creep Up On You," about a rich curmudgeon, E.G. Marshall, who thinks he's living in a bug proof apartment--he's not. The most fun you'll ever have being scared!
Creepshow takes its cue from the E.C. comics of the fifties. Fans of the tv series Tales From the Crypt take note, Creepshow is a comic book come to life. This isn't a dark and muddy horror film, but rather a bright spectacle that's just as fun as it is scary. George A. Romero directs five whiz-bang stories written by Stephen King; you're bound to like at least one of them. If you don't, there's always Creepshow 2, and the forthcoming Creepshow 3.
Serbian-born Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon) is almost the perfect wife for New York architect Ollie Reed. She's beautiful, intelligent, and successful--but she shies from intimacy, and refuses to consummate the marriage. Irena believes in the myths of the old country; that she is of a cursed lineage. She believes that when her passions are aroused, she will turn into a panther, and tear her lover to bits. The marriage starts to crumble, and not even a psychiatrist can help. When Reed turns to another woman for comfort, Irena gets jealous. But is what lurks in the shadows a jealous wife, or a deadly feline?
With a miniscule budget, RKO horror producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur were forced to find a way to make the most of their limited resources. And so they developed their trademark style: heavy shadows, unrelenting atmosphere and off-camera scares. "What you don't see is often scarier than what appears on the screen," became the working mantra of this much-imitated pioneering duo. The formula worked, and Cat People was a smash hit when it was released in 1942. Avoid the 1982 remake with Nastassja Kinski. It's a stinker than a neglected litter box.
Charley Brewster is pretty sure that Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon), his new neighbor, is a vampire. But no one will believe him. His mother, girlfriend, and best bud think he's seen far too many horror films. In order to help Charley work through his delusion, his friends enlist the help of Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowall), a washed-up horror actor cum late night television host. While performing a mock vampire test, Vincent makes an accidental discovery--Dandridge casts no reflection in a mirror. Perhaps Charley's not so delusional after all.
Fright Night is a typical 80s vampire flick, albeit a very good one. It's got a scene set in an 80s dance club, a misfit that wears a jean jacket, a pre-Married...With Children Amanda Bearse, and a monster bat by visual effects wizard Randall William Cook. If the monster bat looks familiar, it's because Cook also designed the Terror Dogs in Ghostbusters, and the Minions in everyone's favorite film about the dangers of heavy metal music, The Gate. Fright Night features a great cast, who are in on the fun, including Roddy McDowall as the reluctant vampire hunter.
Kim (Patricia Clarkson), George (Jake Weber), and their young son Miles (Erik Per Sullivan) have rented a cottage for a short vacation in the snowy wilderness. As they're driving along the dark road to the cottage, they accidentally hit a deer; a deer marked for the kill by local good ol' boy, Otis. The hunter's smug resentment soon turns to harassment that includes pot shots at the family with a rifle. Inspired by his childhood fears, Miles's nightmares begin to take shape; the line between reality and fantasy begins to break down as often does when tragedy strikes.
Admittedly, Wendigo is a flawed film. If you're expecting a monster movie, you're sure to be disappointed. But that doesn't account for the overly ambiguous ending. While the film starts out brilliantly, the end will leave you wondering which part of the puzzle you missed. One almost gets the impression that the filmmakers ran out of both time and money. I personally like this film for its poetry: how a child interprets the complex nature of adult relationships. Wendigo is worth seeing, if only for its strongly realized sense of a cold and ambivalent world. Fessenden is definitely a competent director, and one you should keep your eye on.
A prominent American scientist, Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews), travels to England for a symposium on parapsychology. When Holden arrives, he learns that Dr. Harrington, a colleague who was exposing a devil cult, has died in a mysterious auto accident. Julian Karswell (Niall McGinnis), the head of the devil cult, claims to have conjured the demon that killed Harrington. Holden is skeptical, so when he vows to continue the exposé, Karswell places the same curse on him. Is each successive uncanny occurrence merely mounting coincidence, or will Holden be forced to believe in the power of the supernatural--at the hands of an angry demon?
Another film by famed director Jacques Tourneur. Based on the M.R. James story, "Casting the Runes," Night of the Demon, known as Curse of the Demon in its truncated US form, is considered one of the finest supernatural films of all time. The opening scene shows Dr. Harrington driving frantically down a lonely country road, nervously scanning the dark skies, and thus sets the thrilling tone of this excellent film. But is Night of the Demon a flawed masterpiece? Some people believe the film would have been even more effective had the demon not been shown. Others believe it's a necessary reveal in order to convey threat, no matter how cheesy the demon looks. What do you think?
Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) is the new governess at Bly House, an isolated English manor tenanted by two well-mannered orphans, Miles and Flora. For Miss Giddens, it's a dream come true, that is, until she starts seeing mysterious figures lurking at the top of the tower and across the lake. It isn't long before Miss Giddens learns of the tragedy that befell the former governess, Miss Jessel, and her lover, Peter Quint. And when the children start taking on sinister characteristics, Miss Giddens begins to wonder whether Jessel and Quint are completely dead.
If this story sounds familiar, it's because it's based on Henry James's famous novella, The Turn of the Screw, which also inspired Alejandro Amenábar's The Others. The Innocents was co-scripted by Truman Capote and is rife with sexual undercurrents, readymade for the psychoanalysts. And like James's novel, the ending is ambiguous: Is Miss Giddens going mad, or is the sinister force something external? This film is perfect for those who like their horror a little less bloody, and a little more literary.
Brigitte Fitzgerald has problems. Not only is she slowly turning into a werewolf, but one is also stalking her. Until she can find a cure, the only thing keeping her from full transformation are frequent injections of wolfsbane. After an overdose, she wakes up to find herself incarcerated in a drug treatment center for girls--and without her medication. The center is also home to Ghost, an eccentric girl whose grandmother is being treated for severe burns. With the werewolf getting closer, and Brigitte's transformation imminent, it's not long before the two girls will have to share their dark secrets.
You've already seen Ginger Snaps, right? If not, you're missing out on a top-notch werewolf flick. In either case, part two is a sequel that's worthy of your attention. Where the first film brilliantly equates lycanthropy with puberty, the second film uses drug addiction as its metaphor. The result is an extremely savage film, with a sense of humor even blacker than in the first installment. The make-up effects are notably repulsive, though wholly appropriate. As for the third entry, Ginger Snaps Back, let's just say you're better off re-watching Dog Soldiers or An American Werewolf In London.
After the tragic drowning of their daughter, architect John Baxter and his wife Laura (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) relocate to Venice to restore a historic church. During lunch at one of Venice's sunny café's, Laura meets two batty old sisters: one of which is a blind psychic who claims she can see the Baxters' daughter. Laura accepts the sisters' guidance, and becomes concerned for her husband's safety when they advise him to leave the city. But John is sceptical, even when he starts having his own visions of their dead daughter along the dark canals of Venice.
Venice, the true star of this 1973 film, is a beautifully photographed city of churches, bridges, and canals. While there's only one scene that's outright terrifying--one that your mind will scurry to comprehend--the haunted atmosphere of the film builds unstoppably, making Don't Look Now a unique horror experience. It may not be surprising that this film has more of a following in Europe than in America. And while Don't Look Now certainly is not for everyone, if you're looking for a dreamy and surreal horror film that you can spend hours discussing with your friends, this might be the one for you.
On the Harrington family's annual Christmas drive to grandma's house, Mr. Harrington (Ray Wise) decides to take the scenic back route. After hours of driving down a woodland road with no turnoffs, the Harringtons think they might be lost, and begin to grate each other's nerves as only family can. When they pick up a dazed lady in white and her oddly silent baby, things begin to get weird. Especially when they see signs for Marcott, a town that isn't on any map. And when family members start to disappear, the situation becomes positively desperate.
Dead End is an entertaining and unsettling black comedy with a simple premise that is reminiscent of the best episodes of The Twilight Zone. The amusing dialogue between family members will remind you of your own family car trips at their worst. While the entire film takes place in a car and on a forest road, Andrea and Canepa's clever direction keeps each scene fresh. Combined with an excellent cast, including truly stellar performances by Ray Wise and Lin Shaye, this is one of the best films you've never heard of, but need to see.

OTTAWA — A left-leaning think tank is raising new questions about the possibility of political interference in audits of charities.
The Broadbent Institute says a review of financial records from 10 right-leaning organizations show none of them report carrying out any political activities despite public statements which could be interpreted otherwise.
Yet those groups seem to be escaping the scrutiny of Canada Revenue Agency audits into the political activity of charities even as a host of left-leaning groups are under the microscope, the institute says in a report being released Tuesday.
Though the CRA denies a group’s place on the political spectrum is what triggers an audit, the Broadbent Institute report says the only way to know for certain is to have an impartial inquiry into their work.
“This report, I think, adds to a growing amount of evidence that that CRA may be less interested in compliance with the law than it is in politically-motivated retribution against the Harper government’s critics,” said Rick Smith, the executive director of the Broadbent Institute, an organization founded by former NDP Leader Ed Broadbent.
The CRA is currently conducting audits into whether registered charities are breaking a rule which prohibits them from spending more than 10 per cent of their money on political activities or are engaging in partisan work.
The audits began in 2012 with a special $13.4-million-dollar program around the same time as Conservative ministers were attacking environmental charities as being terrorists.
Since then, nearly four dozen have been called for review, many of whom have been critical of the Conservative government on issues ranging from environmental concerns to poverty issues.
The apparent targeting of Conservative critics has triggered cries of political interference in the process, but both the agency and National Revenue Minister Kerry-Lynne Findlay have denied that’s happening.
The 10 right-leaning groups analysed by the Broadbent Institute have reported spending no money at all in the last three years on political activities.
That’s despite many of the groups releasing statements or reports critical of government policy, which is similar to what left-wing groups appear to have been targeted for doing.
Some of the left-wing groups have also reported spending nothing on political activities, while others have admitted to allocating small portions of their budgets.
“At the very least what’s going on here is that different charities have very different interpretations of what CRA means by political activity,” Smith said.
It’s unknown whether most of the agencies reviewed by the Broadbent Institute’s analysis could in fact be under audit are in fact being audited as that information is not publicly available.

I know everybody in Britain is very into following the American election, many of you feel you should have a right to vote in the American election since we will either do to you or for you a whole bunch of things but that’s not on the cards. So let me ask you this question, first of all does it matter, does the American election really matter, I mean British people I talk to are all upset because the American election is going to effect their lives in I don’t know what ways they think but they think in major ways, maybe for historic reasons that Andrew will talk about.
Part of me says it doesn’t matter to you partly because whoever gets elected is going to face an enormous financial stringency that’s going to make spending plans obsolete. I mean you can promise anything you want on the campaign trail, that was before $700 billion and if you read the bill it’s a lot more than $700 billion because they’re guaranteeing a whole bunch of other stuff.
By the time the election is over and a new President comes in Iraq will be sorted and thanks to General Patrias we have won as you would reasonably define victory in Iraq. That doesn’t mean they’re not going to keep killing each other to some extent, but then again we are in London and killings are known to happen here. There may be more in Iraq but basically it will be sorted.
And both have pledged to increase commitments to Afghanistan, now McCain would and Obama has promised too, so we don’t yet know what will happen when that promise runs into a Liberal Democratic Congress that will have to fund Afghanistan, but they’re both saying that that’s the next theatre. So in a sense all these pieces would suggest it doesn’t matter, but being an economist I have another hand and the other hand is that it might well matter.
Obama is a protectionist, pure and simple, he would repeal NAFTA if he could, the trade unions are his masters and if Obama is elected there will be no trade agreements, they’ll be no Doha extension, of course that’s made more difficult now because Peter Mandelson isn’t there to offset the French when he’s not sailing on various boats. But he is a protectionist, so that matters because McCain is a free trader really down to his fingertips.
Second it matters because of tax policy, we are going to see in America if Obama is elected, a redistribution programme that would not quite please Gordon Brown but certainly move in a direction that would make Gordon Brown happy. Families with over $250,000 in income will pay more taxes and people who – he says it’s a tax rebate, its not – in America families with incomes of under $50,000 a year don’t pay any income tax, they pay what you call NIC and we call social security but they don’t pay any income tax, but they’re going to get cheques for $1,000. Now the way you make that look not like an expenditure you call it a tax credit but it’s a credit against the zero tax, but you will see a redistribution.
You will see a greater emphasis and this might make – well not in this room – most British people happy. The Democrats will be more multi-lateralist, they think the UN actually can be made to work; I was pleased to hear that it’s so loaded with asbestos that they may have to close it down. I’ve always been for turning it over to Trump for a condominium; it’s got a beautiful view of the river.
Also we will see the first period in which, in my judgement if the election goes anything like it looks, where the Democrats will have control over all three branches of Congress possibly with a veto proof majority in the Senate so that there will be no constraint on a very liberal new President if Obama is the President and he will, I think, find it very difficult to cope with the leftward tendencies of the Committee Chairman, Charlie Rangel and Bonnie ((?Frank)), these guys have been there a long time, they know how Washington works. He has been in Washington for two years or at least that part of two years where he wasn’t campaigning. So I think you will see a much left... and we’re seeing that already by the way, there’s a new stimulus package coming down the road in America somewhere between $150 billion and $300 billion, the Democrats want it to be in the form of infrastructure spending of the thing sort of like what Alistair Darling has in mind, the Republicans want it to be as tax cuts, if you’re going to spend the money give it as tax cuts, if the Democrats are elected it will go into infrastructure spending instead of tax.
And finally there is Iran where it will make a very big difference. One of the complaints about McCain is that he is erratic, slightly screw loose, trigger happy, someone which I think is the perfect description for a President that we need right now, facing Iran and Putin and so on, they should be nervous at what he just might do. Now I know that doesn’t make people in Europe very happy. Obama would unleash diplomacy on people, I don’t know quite how that works, he would talk to them and he would persuade China and Russia that they should go along with more sanctions on Iran. How he’s going to do that I have no idea, I mean that would appeal to Europeans, he’s more a European than McCain is. Witness the fact that what 200,000 people showed up in Berlin, although that is a city known for turning out crowds for dramatic speakers.
I think the more profound issues to be confronted in the next several years and in the American election are four. The first is that we have always organised American economic life around the notion that efficiency and the use of resources is the desirable goal of public policy. I think that’s changing, Gordon Brown in his speech at the Party Conference in Manchester proposed that equity is the ultimate test to which public policy should be put. And that I think is where America is going at the moment.
I think the excessive displays of conspicuous consumption by hedge fund people – birthday parties for $15 million – and the fact that we have had greater inequality because of globalisation, now I’m sort of for globalisation, I’m not as enthusiastic about it as a lot of people but I think its net a very good thing has done two things. If you’re a manager or a deal maker, it spreads your talent across the globe whereas before it was confined to a single country. So you are now more valuable. If you’re a worker making trainers or T-shirts you are now less valuable because of globalisation and freer trade because you’re competing with lower cost labour. Now you’re benefiting as a consumer but your wages are more important to you than your consumption spending.
So I think what we’re seeing is a kind of emerging feeling that there’s something unfair going on in society in America and that we should fix it. And I think where you’re going to see it reflected is in taxes as I mentioned, you’re going to see higher taxes and I think you’re going to see that here too with a skew in the direction of higher taxes on higher incomes. I remember being at no. 10 when there was a brawl over whether or not New Labour would adopt a 50% bracket and I remember Tony Blair absolutely saying, out of the question, it will antagonise middle England and I remember that that led to a very serious blow up.
I think you’re going to see higher taxes, I think you’re going to see more restrictions on trade as people begin to feel that the manipulation of currency by the Chinese and the disproportionate distribution of the benefits of trade are unacceptable, they’re not after efficiency, they’re after equity. And I think you’re going to see it now in really a bad place in bank lending policy. You may have noticed you bailed out your banks, you are all now owners of three banks, which must make you feel really rich. But the fact is that you’ll notice it was on the condition that lending be kept to levels of 2007, which of course was a period of excess lending but never mind, that benefits be given to first time homebuyers who are essentially being asked by the government to catch a falling knife, enter the home market when prices are falling. We’re going to do something for small businesses; Shriti Vadera herself is attending to this matter having taken care of the small shareholders in the national rail re-nationalisation. So you’re going to see a non-efficient but seemingly more equitable use of resources in which you will be trading efficiency for equity.
You’re also going to see a shift from deregulation to regulation. Now there is no such thing as a deregulated financial market, the notion that these markets were deregulated and somehow that that caused all the problems is really just nuts. You had regulation of security issues, you had regulation of banks, you had a whole bunch of regulations, we just got the regulations wrong. So there will now be regulations that are different, they will, if the English model is followed, be essentially hands on, swarms of regulators; we need bigger budgets for the FSA and so on. If the more American approach, which is get the incentives fixed and the then don’t have swarms of regulators all over the place, goes we will go in that direction. I doubt very much whether there will be a uniform approach.
You know Mr Sarkozy went to Washington this week to persuade President Bush to go along with a conference, which was easy to do, I mean the President doesn’t have a lot to do these days actually having turned the government over to Hank Paulson. So there will be a conference and as Mr Sarkozy said, we’re not going to let the Americans stand in our way. I don’t think we’ve stood in their way since at least the days of Patan but Andrew can speak to that better than I can, but the fact of the matter is that there is now – and I want to treat that separately – a battle that’s going to go on between the EU and the US.
I think you’re going to see also a retreat by America from the role of world policeman. There has been no benefit from it to America as democratic politicians see it, they will be in control of the government if Obama wins and in control of both houses in any event and I think Europe is going to get more of the America it now wishes for and less of the America that uses hard power. The Europeans like soft power a lot, mainly because it enables them to maintain the Welfare State and what Americans call free riding on the backs of the United States: you need a helicopter, we’ll borrow it from America, we need a transport, we’ll borrow it from America. We have a rapid, what is it called, a rapid reaction force, its neither rapid nor can react nor is a force and its based on using what are called American assets.
I think you’re going to see America getting a little more stingy with its assets partly because of budgetary considerations, partly because of a philosophic shift in America that is I think becoming somewhat more isolationist than it has been in a long time partly out of disgust with the international institutions, partly out of disgust with what the NATO allies are prepared to do in Afghanistan. The Germans are sending more troops who can’t go out at night lest someone shoot at them. The Danes have some troops there I think, I think the average is 48, most of them are bakers as I understand it and I think the Americans are going to say, hey if you guys have got a problem sort it out, I mean we’ll help, but I think you’re going to see more of that.
But the most important thing perhaps from the point of view of your own interests is that there’s going to be a brawl and there now is a brawl between the EU and the United States in which Britain is going to have to choose sides. The brawl is essentially an EU that wants more global regulation, more power to the IMF, it wants another Bretton Woods not remembering what the first Bretton Woods was, which remember set fixed exchange rates and Lord Keynes spent his whole, through his whole frail body, in an effort to get opt-outs for Britain from almost everything that was agreed at Bretton Woods. I mean everybody talks about him, he got it done because of the compromises but he tried to give Britain the right to do a whole lot of things.
I think this odd couple of Brown and Sarkozy with Sarkozy out to have protectionism, he doesn’t want any more Canary Islands which might offer low taxes and he wants a massive regulatory structure which Gordon wants. Gordon has always wanted a regulatory structure, an international regulatory structure, he wants the IMF for instance to be beefed up so it can have an early warning system in a crisis. Now think about that for a minute, that means that he’s going to have economists who are going to warn if a crisis is coming, these economists somehow being superior to all the other economists who work at the central banks or in the city or in Wall Street, they will be superior because they will be selected from the most risk averse section of the profession because they will want their pensions, I mean they’re going to be government employees, I don’t have to say anymore, I mean maybe there are a lot of them here, I don’t mean to insult anybody but they have a different attitude.
Gordon and Sarkozy want to have an international body regulating major international banks. Now if anybody thinks the US is going to go for that, I really, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you because that’s not going to happen. I don’t care if it’s an Obama administration; it’s not going to happen. So what you’re going to see is a Sarkozy led EU that will want to move towards fixed exchange rates he knows he won’t get at all but he’ll want to move towards fixed exchange rates and protectionism. Gordon Brown who doesn’t like protectionism and I’m sure he doesn’t like fixed exchange rates or he would have joined the Euro, maybe he will now that he’s got new friends over there, I don’t really know, but you’ll have Gordon who wants a big regulatory structure put in place and you’ll have the Americans who are not going to be enthusiastic about this at all.
Now which way will Britain come down in the meetings that will inevitably be held? Sarkozy wants it in New York because that’s where all the trouble started. The UN is delighted to be the host and I hope they all inhale a lot. I think what you’re going to see is Gordon sort of stuck, he will I think in the end go along with the EU.
Gordon is in his Churchill moment, he feels he has saved the world probably from as a dangerous an enemy as Hitler, well maybe not quite but pretty close. If you’ll notice, and I’m sure Andrew can document this, he uses Churchillian language to describe what he’s doing: I was born for this moment, which I’m sure his father was not aware of at the time, but I think he is finding the acceptance of his plan, which was by the way the right one, its what should have been done, they had to recapitalise the banks – Bernanke has been saying this in Paulson’s ear for a very long time and Paulson wouldn’t listen – they had to recapitalise the banks, he had that right and he deserves credit for that, I mean having set the house on fire he found a hose to put it out. So he deserves credit for that and I think that he is going to find the Europeans more congenial allies than he’s going to find the Americans.
He has managed to antagonise America in almost everything he’s done since he became Prime Minister. When he went to meet our President the first time he was borderline insulting, he wouldn’t reciprocate praise, he left behind him the President’s gift. Now it was a bomber jacket and Gordon just wouldn’t look good in a bomber jacket but you don’t leave it behind for an aid to pick up. And then he’s of course blamed this whole thing on America, although I’ve never figured out how American bankers forced British bankers to buy this paper or to give 125% mortgages or stuff, I just can’t figure out what the mechanics is of this happening. So he’s not very popular in the administration, he may be more popular in an Obama administration.
Let me conclude with one thing, the election is still up for grabs. I must tell you about the polls, the polls are not what they look like, the polls are adjusted data, adjusted by the pollsters for the number of Democrats they think are likely to vote for instance, they will adjust the polls by the proportion that they expect. Some expect a huge Democratic turnout and are adjusting them up, so they’ve got Obama up by seven. Some say well those young people always talk but they don’t really show up and so therefore we don’t make that adjustment and the polls show Obama up by two. On average he’s up by four or five, which is about where Kerry was at this point in 2004. I mean for those of you like me who are for McCain, despite his complete incomprehension of anything that we would call economics, no interest, no comprehension. I don’t think economic is that important, I think foreign policy is. So it’s not over yet despite what the polls show. There is also the fact that a lot of people wont vote for a black person, they’re not going to tell a pollster that, so you don’t really know how the ‘don’t nos’ are going to break, they’re not going to break 50/50 in New Hampshire, they all broke for Hilary, which is why she won in New Hampshire, the ‘don’t nos’ went massively for her.
So they’re still worth watching, if you want to be certain of an Obama victory you can watch BBC, if you want to find out what’s really happening you can watch Sky or Fox. Now I know Fox is not very popular in this country but you can get it, all you have to do is subscribe to Sky, which I think would be a good idea actually since I helped start it. I watched BBC in the last election and it took me until the spring to realise that Gore was not president. So let me turn it over to Andrew.
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great honour to be invited to address you and thank you very much indeed for those kind words. It’s a great honour also to serve on the Academic Advisory Council of the Bruges Group. The Bruges Group is a cause close to my heart and so thank you for that as well.
I’d like to start if I may, giving you a quotation from Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff from December 1941 and the Chairman of the British Chiefs of Staff from March 1942, speaking seven years afterwards in 1949 to a unionist luncheon in Belfast in which he said this:
‘In 1942, before the battle of El Alamein, Rommel was at the gates of Cairo, German forces were through the Caucasus, Japanese forces were threatening Australia and India, the Mediterranean was closed and Persia had been entirely depleted of forces to save threatened points. The whole of the oil reserves in the Middle East, in Iraq and Persia were at Hitler’s mercy. This loss would have been irreparable as the shortage of tankers due to submarine action made it impossible to supply our wants from the Western Hemisphere and the Burma and Dutch East India oil were lost to Japan. We should have been faced with a crippling paralysis on land, at sea and in the air throughout the Middle East and India. The road would have been open for Germany and Japan to join hands with the dyer results that would have ensued. Its as well that we should avoid unwarranted complacency and remind ourselves that if we did win the last war it was not without moments of extreme peril.’
My book, Masters and Commanders, tells the story of how we came from that situation to VE-day within only two and a half years, by which time the Nazis lay at the mercy of the Allies. And it is told through the prism of the relationship between these four men, Roosevelt, Churchill, General Marshall, the US Army Chief of Staff and Lord Alanbrooke and the way in which these men interacted and through their interaction created grand strategy. They were all very tough men who completely dominated their own hinterland: Churchill, the War Cabinet, the British Chief of Staff was dominated by first amongst equals, but nonetheless he was the first Lord Alan Brooke.
The American Chiefs of Staff, the joint chiefs, saw titanic battles between Ernest King, the naval Chief of Staff and George Marshall, but nonetheless they are in all of the essential battles that Marshall won and then of course Roosevelt, who dominated his own administration.
And so these four men, each of whom felt, each of whom knew that they had the war winning strategy, had to work with each other in order to create allied grand strategy and as a result needless to say, there were some incredibly tough battles between them. You would have just around the corner from here, just directly over there indeed, down in the Cabinet War Rooms Winston Churchill sitting across a green baize table from Alanbrooke and Churchill at one stage shaking his fist in Alanbrooke’s face and Alanbrooke, this flinty Irishman just sitting there breaking pencils in half saying, no I completely disagree with you Prime Minister.
On one occasion in one of the great conferences, the American General ‘Vinegar Joe’ Stilwell, actually said he wanted to leap across and sock Alanbrooke at one moment. Other moments the people would be talking about the deep depression that they got into, Alanbrooke himself said that about himself and many others said that about Churchill.
A marvellous tale to illustrate quite how aggressive some of these meetings got, at the Quadrant Conference in Quebec in August 1943, Lord Mountbatten who sat on the British Chiefs of Staff, had a giant block of ice brought in on a trolley and another giant block of something called pykrete, which was ice mixed up with wood pulp and already the argument had been so tough that all of the advisors had been ordered out of the room so that just the Chiefs of Staff came to a hard fought, bitterly fought compromise at that meeting. And in order to sort of calm everything down, Mountbatten was going to demonstrate how giant aircraft carrier sized icebergs were going to be lassoed effectively to be brought down from the Arctic and used for D-day to be able to land and take off aeroplanes.
And in order to prove how strong these things could be he took out his revolver and fired into the block of ice and the bullet lodged in and the ice fell to pieces and it was quite clear that they couldn’t use that because what would happen if German dive bombers had done the same thing. Then he took out his second shot and fired it at the pykrete and at that point, according to Lord Alan Brooke’s diary, the bullet shot around the room like an angry bee. And the Secretary of the Chiefs of Staff who was standing outside, ‘Oh my God’ he said, ‘they’re shooting at each other now’.
So that explains quite how tough these meetings could be, but at the same time you have this fantastic use, primarily by Churchill but also by Marshall and FDR – less so in Alanbrooke’s case – of charm. One of the most difficult things as a historian to get over to the reader is humour and charm and charisma and Churchill used all three of those to an amazing degree.
There is a wonderful tale of when Anthony Eden was about to go off to try to muscle Turkey into the war, Turkey which had stayed out from the war, stayed absolutely neutral and resisted all pressure from the Allies to join the Allied side. In fact in the end Turkey didn’t declare war against Hitler until February 1945. But he was about to go off to Turkey and so he wrote to Churchill in November 1943 and said, ‘What should be my central message?’ and Churchill wrote back saying ‘Tell Turkey that Christmas is coming’.
The historian, Ronald Lewin said, ‘there’s no rule of law that says that soldiers can die in battle but Staff Officers can’t be vexed’. They were vexed, the official record shows some extent to which they were vexed with one another, but of course like every official record, especially the War Cabinet meetings records, when you go to read them in Kew at the National Archives, they if anything attempt constantly to be as opaque as possible, to downplay any disagreements and any rows that have taken place. And it was therefore with enormous excitement that I discovered what historians I hope from now on will be calling the ‘Burgis material’, the papers of Lawrence Burgis at the immensely efficient Churchill Archives in Cambridge have not been looked at since they were deposited by Lawrence Burgis’ Executors in 1972.
Purely by chance – I would love to be able to pretend that it was through some special archival diligence or some genius of mind, but it wasn’t, it was serendipity – my train was leaving Cambridge at 5:30 and I had an extra half an hour and I took down the Burgis catalogue simply because I hadn’t heard of him amongst this amazing archive with so many famous people, including of course our President Lady Thatcher, whose papers are there as well. And I ordered up the papers and after a while worked out these thousands of pages, certainly hundreds of pages, of hieroglyphics and acronyms and shorthand, quite what this actually consisted of.
It was nothing less ladies and gentlemen, than the verbatim reports of Winston Churchill’s War Cabinet between 1939 and 1945. They should have been destroyed. The rule was that after drawing up the Cabinet Minutes, you then threw the notes of what every single individual Cabinet Minister said into the fire at the War Cabinet Secretariat. But Lawrence Burgis, a very junior figure, just an assistant secretary didn’t do that, he took them home. He should have been arrested under the Official Secrets Act as I pointed out to his nephew a couple of days ago, but nonetheless fortunately for us historians he didn’t. He took them home and finally his Executors gave them to Cambridge.
And so suddenly we see a panoply of what every individual Minister said during the war and the incredible thing was that Churchill dominated that War Cabinet with charm, charisma as I mentioned, with humour, but when he spoke about these great issues, about the Katyn massacre, about the Hess flight, about the Yalta Accords, about the strategic bombing policy, he was always, always on the most extreme side of any argument right the way down to the ruble exchange rate, he would take the most tough stance. He said some various things, which are all quoted in this book, the Burgis papers form the backbone of this book, some things about Ghandi when he was on hunger strike, he said that he actually thought that it was just really nothing more than a change of diet. He could be pretty politically incorrect needless to say. And this man comes out with an inability ever to say a boring sentence. It was a very moving thing needless to say when I stumbled across these papers and as I say, I’ve made as much of them as possible really.
But it is amazing how many people kept diaries, it was completely against the Government regulations, you weren’t supposed to. If the Germans had successfully invaded in 1940, Goebbels would have made an enormous propaganda coup out of the various diaries that were being kept. In the course of my researches I came across no fewer than 60 senior figures who were keeping diaries completely against the rules. Alanbrooke of course as we know but also the other Field Marshals, the Permanent Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, the Foreign Secretary himself, Anthony Eden, his Private Secretary, the King’s Private Secretary, the King himself. There seems to be very few people right at the top echelons, we all know of course also of the Colville diaries that were kept by the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister and its immensely fortunate again that they were because we can recreate these titanic battles that took place. Because there were massive differences between the overall strategic concept of Lord Alanbrooke and that of General Marshall. Marshall wanted to cross the Channel as soon as possible and strike hard into the heart of Germany, if possible by the autumn of 1942 and certainly in 1943. Alan Brooke considered that this would be suicidal and instead preferred attacks on the North African littoral to expel the Germans from North Africa by May 1943, then to attack Sicily in ‘Operation Husky’ in July 1943 and land on the mainland of Italy down at Salerno and the toe of Italy and push their way up to Italy to capture Rome by the 4 June 1944. And the idea there was to try to draw off as much as possible in terms of the German forces, particularly the Luftwafer as well whilst the Russians took the main brunt of the fighting on the Eastern Front. In May 1943 the Germans had six divisions fighting the Anglo-Americans as against the 186 fighting the Russians.
And so this next question must be what would have happened had an Anglo-American force landed on the continent. There was no Atlantic Wall of course by then; it was only after 1942 that two million tons of concrete was placed into the defensive line known as the Atlantic Wall. But it wasn’t until June 1943 that more shipping was launched in the battle of the Atlantic than was sunk and so any attempt to cross in 1942 laid ourselves open, especially as the Germans had introduced the fourth rotor to the Enigma Machine and therefore we were sailing blind between February 1, 1942 and November 1942. Any attempt to have attacked earlier than that could have been destroyed by the U-boats. Also there had been no significant bombing of the rail and road links down which the Germans could be absolutely certain to counter attack.
As a historian one should never use the world ‘inevitable’ but when it comes to German counter attack in the Second World War you pretty much always can. When you think what they achieved at Kasserine Pass and at Anzio, at Monte Cassino, at Arnhem and certainly of course at the greatest of them all, the Battle of the Bulge. One appreciates that the Germans were always capable of immense counter attack. At the Ardennes Offensive they had complete radio silence, they had search lights that created artificial light off the clouds and they attacked through deep snow and nearly got to the Meuse. It was an amazing 26 division attack which the Allies had absolutely no prior knowledge of.
Another point of course is that it tool 1,600 tons of supplies to supply a single division per day, so the most enormous amount of supplies had to be got over to France, something that was next to impossible in 1942, we didn’t have the Mulberry Harbours, we didn’t have the pipeline under the ocean (PLUTO) ready by that stage and Lord Mountbatten’s aircraft carriers made of ice wouldn’t have worked, we know that now. So all in all it seems to me that although it would have been possibly a disastrous error to have attacked too early in the autumn of 1942 or 1943, by the time that we did attack, by the time that Marshall and Roosevelt at the Trident Conference of May 1943 insisted on a cross Channel attack in 1944, they were right and Churchill and Brooke, who were still trying to hold it off, no longer were because by that stage you also had V2 attacks on London, you had the Russians having broken German Army Group Centre in Russia and they were flooding westwards. You had by this stage to have an Anglo-American armed force in North West Europe.
So I think in a sense when the American historian, Kent Greenfield, says ‘whose strategy was the sounder will never be known, it’ll be the subject of controversy as long as men debate the strategy of the Second World War’, I think he’s creating in a sense a false dichotomy, its not that one set were right all the time and one set of people were wrong, its just that the circumstances changed to mean that an attack which was not advisable in 1942 or 1943 was absolutely necessary by 1944. In a sense it’s a little like the false dichotomy of Waterloo when people say would the battle have been won if the Prussians had not turned up, the question is wrong because the battle wouldn’t have been fought, Wellington wouldn’t have fought had he not known that morning that the Prussians were going to turn up.
In the course of writing this book it has struck me again and again and its taken me to the battlefields of Kursk and Stalingrad and Moscow and others on the eastern front, where I am reminded of this what seems to me the absolutely central statistic of the Second World War which is that out of every five Germans killed in combat, i.e., not by aerial bombardment but soldiers killed in combat, four of them were killed on the eastern front. So in a sense the tremendous battering that the Wermarcht took, over three million killed, had to happen in order to have the guts ripped out of the Wermarcht and the moral destroyed of the German people. That wouldn’t have happened if we had landed too early and been repulsed in the same way that we were in Dunkirk.
And what amazing men each of these four was. The strains, the stresses, over six years in the British case, six years of war, night after night. The way in which they managed, especially Brooke who was prone to deep depression, as was Churchill, but these men who nonetheless managed all the way through to keep up a pretence of certainty of victory. An amazing achievement considering that privately they had their doubts, but they knew how vital it was for the moral of the nation to keep up this amazing pretence and so it seems to me that to sum up, they are all four of them heroes, they are all four of them right and in the words of Winston Churchill, when looking at this book and thinking about whether or not to buy it, may I remind you that ‘Christmas is coming’. Thank you very much indeed.

The noun potentiality is often used where potential or possibility would make more sense. It has a two main dictionary-approved definitions—(1) the inherent capacity to grow or come into being, and (2) a person or thing that possesses potential. The first definition is almost identical to the main definition of potential, however, and the second comes very close to possibility. So potentiality often bears replacement with those more common words.
Moreover, the two countries have recently locked into a territorial dispute that some observers see as an issue with disruptive potentiality. [Daily Star]
I still have a long way to go to reach a level of completely understanding my inherent potentiality, but I know I am wishful. [Express Buzz]
The court did not rely on the potentiality that services might be extended beyond six months as a reason supporting denial of services. [quoted on Leagle]

Some readers may wonder why I so commonly use the terminology "these united states" when referring to the group of states known as The United States of America and why I do not capitalize the name. The United States of America is a title and one name of a trust formed at the establishment of these united states. Contrary to what American people have been taught in government run schools, the group of member states are separate nations. The United States is a name that was actually trademarked by the corporation The United States of America.
I recently watched (again) the video about an airman in the Air Force and the injuries he sustained and his overcoming these injuries. He had lost both of his legs and his hand when a rocket RPG exploded 3 feet from where he stood. He was thrown 25 feet in the air.
People seem to be at a loss about what can be done to correct the wrongs of the corporations that we have been told run our government. You should be aware that a corporation has no more authority over you than Walmart or Home Depot. The united states of America formed a 2nd corporation in 1879 (thereabouts) to operate the business of the federal government. With the corporation it was able to do what any other corporation could do. It did not gain any authority over people in forming this new corporation.
I have listened and read complaints by many people about the size of government in these untied states for years now. The way that most people attempt to fix a bloated government is to elect other people who promise to reduce the size of government. Yet, if we look at government, it has never gotten smaller and only gotten bigger since its inception in the united states of America. As a matter of fact, I have met people from some European countries who talk about how much worse the police are here than in their home countries.
I used to be involved in the Libertarian Party. As a matter of fact I chaired the Libertarian Party of Pierce County Washington for a couple of years back in 2000 and 2001. One thing I found frustrating was how most Libertarian candidates could not garner more than around 30% of the vote. This was true even though the race, like mine, was only a two way race.

For many years I have been an avid voter. I have been a firm believer in doing my patriotic duty to participate in determining the course of government in my state and nation. Then something started to change. I learned that state and nation were one and the same. I learned the United States refers most commonly to a corporation. And I learned that when I vote, elections, especially those utilizing electronic tabulation, are rigged. Lastly, I learned that the people for whom I vote are not in fact government representatives, but corporate officers.

February 5, 2018Police, Politics, PressRelease, SupercityComments Off on Delay for two hours at least at truck crash scene – Manakau
Police and emergency services are still at the scene of a crash between a truck and trailer and a car on SH1 near Levin that happened just before 8am.
The truck is still stuck partially hanging over the rail bridge and a heavy haulage tow has just arrived at the scene.
The driver of the southbound car has been airlifted to Palmerston North hospital in a critical condition.
Preliminary indications show that a northbound truck and trailer unit collided with a south bound car on the rail overbridge at Ohau.
There are no detours, so traffic near the scene will have a two or more hour wait for emergency services to clear the scene.
There is no alternative route and Police are aware that there is a tail north-bound stretching to Ohau and the south bound stream of cars is backed up to Otaki at least.

Award-winning external USB DAC and headphone amplifier now ships with a bundled Op-Amp swap kit, allowing audiophiles greater sound characteristic modification
The ASUS Xonar Essence One external digital-analog converter (DAC) and headphone amplifier earned considerable critical acclaim, winning a 2012 CES Innovations Award in the audio component category with the industry’s only 8x symmetrical upsampling. The newly-launched ASUS Xonar Essence One Plus Edition further adds a bundled Op-Amp swap kit with six extensively-tested Op-Amps to make sound characteristic tuning easier out of the box, with no soldering required. It also saves customers the need to purchase Op-Amps separately.
Op-Amps serve a critical role in audio hardware, amplifying analog signals and determining tone and timbre characteristics. Dedicated audiophiles often choose to change Op-Amps to fine-tune performance, something the original Xonar Essence One supported with its eleven swappable Op-Amps. This feature proved highly popular, leading the Xonar team to extensively test over a hundred different Op-Amps with the original Xonar Essence One in order to check for a wide audio tuning range. The six Op-Amps deemed most unique in their impact on sound character were selected to be part of the Xonar Essence One Plus Edition, the first USB DAC with a bundled Op-Amp swap kit. By combining the original Texas Instruments TI-NE5532 Op-Amps with four Texas Instruments TI-OPA2132PA and two NS-LM4562NA Op-Amps, the special edition allows for five unique tonal impression customization options. The kit even includes an IC clamp, a screw driver, and an Op-Amp swap guide which shares various Op-Amp tips based on the Xonar team’s findings. These make swapping any of the existing eleven Op-Amps easy for quick audio modification based on personal preference. The kit further offers compatibility with other Xonar products, including the Xonar Essence ST/STX, Xonar Xense, and Xonar DS/DSX.
We are on the cusp of summer break, which means many teens, grads, and college students will be starting up their summer jobs. Whether they’re nannying, mowing lawns, spinning pies at the local pizza joint, or interning at a law firm, the goal is to gain real life job experience, and of course, make whatever money they can before school starts up again in the fall.
This brings us to an important point. Money. Have you equipped your teen with the financial know-how they need to succeed in the real world (and avoid major financial pit falls)? Many parents assume their kids are learning personal finance at school, but unfortunately, many schools assume the students are learning it at home! It’s a crucial topic that all-too-often falls through the cracks. And, guess who loses?
As your teen embarks on their summer job, use this as a launch pad to build their financial literacy. The principles of wise financial management aren’t that tough to master. You simply need to know the basics and abide by the disciplines and key principles. One way to approach it is to teach them how to avoid these eight most common financial mistakes:
Failure to set goals and plan/save for major purchases (instead, many load their credit cards with debt, making their items that much more expensive)
Incurring significant fixed expenses relative to your income that can’t be reduced in difficult economic times (e.g., spending too much on housing and cars)
Impulse buying and lack of value consciousness when shopping (make, and stick to, your shopping list beforehand!)
Failure to begin saving and investing for the future as soon as possible (and missing out on the compounding of money over long periods of time)
Failure to appreciate how the little things can add up (e.g., eating out versus in, paying up for name brands, owning a dog or cat)
(Number 6 is an especially common pitfall among young people when working a summer job. They aren’t used to having a surplus of money in their checking account, so they go on spending sprees and end up saving much less than they could. A good rule to learn, especially at this time of life, is save first, spend on “needs” second, and IF there is money left over, enjoy some “wants.”
This list isn’t just for young people—they’re for everyone. Periodically review how you’re doing in each of these areas, and encourage the young adults in your life to do the same. (Remember, they’re watching you, so be sure to “walk the talk!”) If we can successfully avoid these traps, we’ll ALL be in better financial shape!

Even if you try making a shopping list and clip coupons before you head to the grocery store, you still need to hold tight onto your money. Every corner and within every aisle in the grocery store, temptations are waiting. I’m not talking about the sweet treats down the candy aisle or the cookies in the shelves. I’m talking about the ways grocery stores use to get you to spend your money more.
No matter how strong you might think you are, the grocery store has plenty of ways to get you to spend more. Check out these seven surprising ways the grocery stores use to thinking spending more money is a good idea.
Can’t find that one item that’s always on your list? Grocery stores sometimes will change the location of item as often as once a month. It isn’t always big changes, but can be shifting an item five feet down the same aisle. Grocery stores do this often to squeeze in new items, but it can rather be frustrating if you are short on time during your day.
Next time you find yourself frustrated and wandering the aisles of the grocery store, stop and take a deep breath and reset. You can even ask a store employee for help.
Buying in bulk can help you save big time. However, before you blindly choose the largest purchase next time take a second look at the unit-price comparison. The unit price is usually located on the price tag affixed to the shelf below the product. For example, “$0.60 per ounce.” If the unit price is not listed, you can divide the price of the item by the number of ounces or other unit of measurement. This can help you decide if the smaller item is better to buy.
Free delivery? Saving money on items? These offers aren’t too good to be true, but they can lead you to spend more than you might have bargained for.
The services of delivery and pickup often come with a premium, and even signing up for a free trail can get you sucked in to what might be really pricy. Before trying a new service at a discounted price, review the print. If you aren’t even willing to pay the full price, then don’t even bother trying it!
Music seems like a harmless tool, but it’s actually a highly effective tool for getting shoppers to spend more. Douglas Rushkoff, author of Coercion: Why We Listen to What ‘They’ Say, says that customers make 38% more purchases when grocery stores play Muzak with slower tempo.
A famous study published by the American Marketing Association found that sales increase and people even spend more time shopping in stores playing music. The study reports that the tempo of instrumental background music influences both the pace of the in-store traffic flow and the daily gross sales volume purchased by the customers. The average gross sales increased $12,122.35 for the fast tempo music to $16,740.23 for the slow tempo music. The average increase of $4,627.39 per day or a 38.2% increase in sales volume.
While these results only apply to this study, the point is that the research shows music can indeed influence the shopping behavior of customers. And you also can bet your grocery stores you shop at use this to their advantage!
Coupons can be tempting to use, especially where you can save a dollar or more on grocery items you already got on your list. Clip those coupons, but take a closer look when you get to the grocery store. Check if the brand-name price is still higher than the generic version after the coupon is applied. Do you really need that particular brand-name if the price is still higher?
Remember to stick to your grocery list and take seemingly targeted messages with a grain of salt. Don’t let the grocery stores market you, but keep up with the products you actually want to buy and keep on saving!
Whether your spouse is looking after and defending humans, animals, the planet or maybe just your family, we can see why you'd say, “I'm married to my hero!” If you are lucky enough to have and amazing husband or wife that inspires you to be better each day, why not share that fact with the World!?

Whenever Masafumi saw his father in a black suit it was only for weddings or funerals: no different from most of society. But unlike most of society, Ryuichi did not wear his with any straight-backed pride; it was as though even a black suit for ceremonies was treated as an extension of daily wear: Ryuichi’s black suit was frayed and dog-eared. Watching his father wear that black suit, Masafumi felt sorrow; as though Ryuichi was burdened with a great loneliness.
What changed this negative impression of black suits for Masafumi was the movies. The dynamic characters and appearances of men clad in black suits; instead of an object of sadness, the black suit became an object of high cool.
The black-suited men appearing in “Blues Brothers” and “Reservoir Dogs” were anti-social, they were defiant. They were exceptionally cool. After watching these films, most men felt an urge to be like what they’d seen. Masafumi was no different and says, only naturally, he was also greatly influenced; and he began to wear black suits.
Recently, Masafumi has realized something. The black suit is a symbol of defiance, but at the same time there is a sense sadness is resident in it. And conversely, at the times we are made to feel such sorrow, the black suit becomes a symbol of living. And there: that is where the black suit’s personality and beauty is. Be yourself. That’s the message wrapped over the memory of his father in a black suit; that’s what the black suit speaks to: the story of its owner.

ACE Education Advice CIC & ACE Education Training LLP | Tackling bullying | Tackling Bullying at School
Many children experience bullying at school. Bullying can be very distressing to children and worrying for parents. It can impact on children’s learning at school and in the the worst cases may lead to truancy, school refusal or mental health problems.
behaviour by an individual or group, usually repeated over time, that intentionally hurts another individual or group either physically or emotionally
Bullying can take place for various reasons such as disability, race, religion or culture, sexual orientation, gender or health conditions
Schools have a duty to promote good behaviour and to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. The head must publish the behaviour policy and bring in to the attention of parents. The anti-bullying policy may be part of the behaviour policy or a stand-alone document.
The government has issued guidance and advice for schools on tackling bullying. Links to these can be found under Government Guidance below.
If your child is being bullied at school this is likely to be upsetting for you as a parent as well. Although there will probably not be any instant answers, there are some steps that you can take.
The ones you will need will be the behaviour policy, the anti-bullying policy and the school’s complaints procedure. Depending on your child’s situation you may also want the special educational needs policy.
Your child will need a lot of encouragement and support. They may be reluctant to tell you about the bullying. You can help by listening and reassuring them that it is not their fault. Try to build up their general confidence and give strategies they can use for helping themselves. Some of the websites in the useful links section have tips for children and young people on dealing with bullies.
When you are taking the matter up with the school it’s a good idea to be sure of your facts. Keep a record of any bullying incidents with as much detail as you can. If your child has been physically injured you may want to take photos of the injuries. Include in your report any medical evidence. If the bullying has taken place outside of school or on social media try to include any evidence you can.
Write down the impact that the bullying has had on your child. Has their behaviour changed, are they reluctant to go to school, are they anxious, withdrawn or not sleeping? Has their school work suffered? Has their behaviour at home changed?
Initially you may want to raise your concerns informally with your child’s class teacher or form tutor. If you feel the bullying is not being dealt with, then ask for a meeting with a more senior teacher. This might be your child’s head of year, the senior teacher in charge of anti-bullying work or the headteacher. It can be helpful to take another person along to support you at the meeting.
Take along any written evidence about the bullying. It will also help to have some suggestions about what the school might do. These might be:
Agree at the meeting what action will be taken, what support your child will receive and when you will meet again to review the situation. Make sure everyone is in agreement.
You will need to allow time for the school to take action but if the bullying continues you can make a formal complaint in line with the school’s complaints procedure. This will generally be first to the headteacher and then to the governors of the school.

“When all this had gone down, we had been together six or seven months,” said the 19-year-old man. “She went out one night and came back with an engagement ring on her finger and dumped me on the spot and ended up getting with another guy who lived close by.”
Close by was a trailer park in Franklin where Dail continued living with Vela, her six children and another man.
“I was staying with them on and off and they kicked me out and I had no place to go and was homeless out in the snow and all that and they eventually I guess felt bad for me and, so they let me move back in.”
It was just a couple days after Christmas 2013, when Vela spotted Dail and her 16-year-old daughter together.
Dail said he smoked marijuana–that he assumes may have been tainted with heroin–with Vela that night and went to bed only to be awakened a few hours later and summoned to a neighbor’s trailer where his ex-girlfriend’s mother and another couple waited.
“Benita says ‘Sit down on the bed,’ so I figure we’re talking about something important, and then she locked the door and then my suspicions got raised and she started yelling at me, and all of a sudden, Benita just smacks me as hard as she can across the face.
“She’s like, ‘Are you trying to make my daughter look like a whore? You’re trying to make her look like a skank. I can’t believe you’re doing this. You’re gonna mess up her life.’
“My head started buzzing and I couldn’t hear anything, and then the next thing I know, she smacks me again and just continues to smack me after she yells other words and then she starts diverging her anger into how she could kill me and get away with it.
“She said she was going to shoot me in the head and tie me to a tree and let animals eat my body,” said Dail. “I was begging for my life at that point.”
Dail said what followed was three hours of abuse and threats and torture and claims by Vela that she had stabbed other men before.
“All I know is I’m about to be the next victim on her list,” said Dail. “When she started saying that, I knew she really meant it.”
There was another man in the bedroom, Tim Potts, who blocked Dail’s attempts to escape, said police.
“When Yim made the comment about, ‘I have a fresh tank of gas now. We can take him anywhere you want to take him.’
“They were talking about tying me up throwing me in a trunk, shooting me in both my legs and leaving me out in the wild of anywhere Brown County or anywhere, all that type of stuff.
“I’m thinking I’m about to die,” said Dail, as he recalled the panic that engulfed him that morning. “The first thought that popped into my head was that I’m going to die tonight. I could see the devil in her eyes.”
Vela later admitted to police that she had been smoking marijuana and could not remember everything she said.
“After a while she is like, ‘Oh, I know what I’ll do,’” said Dail. “She told me to drop my drawers and she was gonna cut my penis with the knife. She said ‘Either drop your pants or I’m gonna kill you’ and I’m like ‘No, just stop’ and I was begging. I was just begging for her to stop torturing me. I had already been through so much and so she starts stabbing at my privates.
“She tried to stab it and she hit it a couple times but it didn’t draw any blood so that’s when she asked for a sharper object.”
Dail said that’s when Potts handed her a box cutter, telling Vela she had to finish up because soon he had to leave for work.
“She said, ‘I’ll say you molested my 3 year old,’” Dail continued, “and I just busted out in tears because I could not imagine touching that kid like that. I could not imagine touching any kid like that and when the cops got involved I told them she said that, and they went and got her and they came back to me and said, ‘Yep, she said that.”’
Vela was arrested and charged with battery with bodily injury and criminal confinement. The 36-year-old woman pleaded guilty to criminal confinement. She received 10 months of home detention, six months of probation and was directed to undergo anger management control training.
Prosecutors said Vela’s status as the primary caregiver for six children figured into her sentence, and the state’s inability to find Dail at the time of sentencing.
“She got home detention. She gets to see her kids every day. That’s not a punishment. That’s a blessing.”
Dail said he still has nightmares about his attack and has post-traumatic stress disorder. Surgeons were able to repair his wounds without stitches.
“Strangers on Facebook who don’t know me think I molested that child, so they sit there and say I deserve what happened to me. They say, ‘You just cut it. You should have cut it all the way off.’ They say, ‘Oh, well, you should’ve just killed them,’ and that hurts me and breaks me down because I’m a victim being victimized for something I didn’t even do.”
The Johnson County Prosecutor’s Office told FOX59 News that if Dail files a criminal confinement report against Potts, the Franklin man could still be charged.
Dail said he filed that report earlier this year with a detective and even picked Potts’ photograph out of a line up, but he’s willing to do it again to see justice done.
“It hurts me for people to think that I’m a monster when I haven’t done nothing,” said Dail. “Even though Benita has recanted her statement about what I supposedly did to her kid, but people are still yet continuing to say this stuff to me.”

The Pompeiiana Newsletter was created and edited by Bernard Barcio and ran from 1974 through 2003. Pompeiiana offered a place for Latin students to publish comics, stories, games, and articles, and was a beloved resource for Latin teachers. In 2008, Barcio granted Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers the rights for all of Pompeiiana. This blog will make all 229 issues freely available to Latin teachers, students, and others interested in Classics, one issue per day.
In August 2013, the Medieval Sai Project: The Greek Norwegian Archaeological Mission to Sudan began the serialized republication of the 22 issues of Nubian Letters published between 1983 and 1994:
Nubian Letters in an independent biannual bulletin for Nubian history and archaeology, published under the auspices of the International Society for Nubian Studies and the Department of Early Christian Art at the University of Leiden, the Netherlands.
I'm really pleased to see these newsletters in general circulation. They represent a form of semi-formal scholarly communication which was common in the second half of the 20th century (and earlier), but which was never properly collected by libraries. Even those which have made the leap to digital media (and you can find many be searching the keyword "newsletter" in AWOL), remain mostly poorly curated or uncollected in libraries. They are nevertheless an extraordinarily important resource for the history of the disciplines they cover and the institutions and projects they represent.
In the Summer of 2014 Oriental Institute Research Archivist, Bibliographer Foy Scalf, began to scan the hard copies of the Oriental Institute Staff Newsletter (63 issues edited by me which appeared between February 1998 and March 2005) and upon discovering that they were incomplete, urged me to try to recover the lost files from a ten year old laptop. As a consequence we now have a complete set available. So a small piece of Oriental Institute microhistory is now recovered and preserved. They are available at Oriental Institute Staff Newsletter, and further information is at the OI History Blog.
Beginning in February 1998, with the encouragement and support of Gene Gragg who was then Director of the Oriental Institute, I compiled, edited and distributed by email an internal newsletter for the staff of the Oriental Institute. It chronicled the activities of the departments of the OI, and of individual scholars and senior students at the OI. It was distributed widely in the University of Chicago community by means of a listhost mailing list, but its archive was not publicly available.
Many scholars keep files of these things, which they get by virtue of memberships in societies or organization, or association with projects, and in other ways. Likewise, many projects, association, and societies hold files of them in their archives, or in their archives of their successor or sponsoring institutions. If you have a files of one of these inaccessible newsletters, or know of one, I challenge you to follow in the footsteps of The Pompeiiana Newsletter, Nubian Letters, and The Oriental Institute Staff Newsletter and make it available to your colleagues and the world at large. It is simple to set up a blog at Blogger, Wordpress or Tumblr (or one of many other comparable tools), to scan an issue a day, and post them online. Please make sure that you get, or make a good faith effort to get, permission from the organization or person who published the newsletter in the first place.
This past year I scanned and posted Pirradaziš: Bulletin of Achaemenian Studies I produced in the 1990s.
Pirradaziš (Pirradazish) [OCLC Number: 863381899] is a newsletter produced by Charles E. Jones at the Oriental Institute Chicago. Eight issues appeared between 1990 and 1994.
Pirradaziš seeks to gather information, primarily bibliographical, which relates to the study of the Achaemenid Persian empire, as well as relevant material on the periods immediately preceding and following it. Each issue will cover the material seen by the editor during the six months (more or less) prior to the date of issue.
Also in 2015, colleagues at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World scanned and made available copies of the orphaned Circle of Inner Asian Art and Archaeology Newsletter as a component of the relaunched Ancient World Digital Library.
Please let me know if you can participate, and what and where you efforts appear so I can include it in AWOL's List of Open Access Journals in Ancient Studies.
And I'll happily offer advice and assistance in how to go about doing it If you'd rather have me do it, and can supply the hard copy, I'll gladly make that happen as well.
The AWOL Index: The bibliographic data presented herein has been programmatically extracted from the content of AWOL - The Ancient World Online (ISSN 2156-2253) and formatted in accordance with a structured data model.
AWOL is a project of Charles E. Jones, Tombros Librarian for Classics and Humanities at the Pattee Library, Penn State University
AWOL began with a series of entries under the heading AWOL on the Ancient World Bloggers Group Blog. I moved it to its own space here beginning in 2009.
The primary focus of the project is notice and comment on open access material relating to the ancient world, but I will also include other kinds of networked information as it comes available.
The ancient world is conceived here as it is at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, my academic home at the time AWOL was launched. That is, from the Pillars of Hercules to the Pacific, from the beginnings of human habitation to the late antique / early Islamic period.
AWOL is the successor to Abzu, a guide to networked open access data relevant to the study and public presentation of the Ancient Near East and the Ancient Mediterranean world, founded at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago in 1994. Together they represent the longest sustained effort to map the development of open digital scholarship in any discipline.
AWOL is one of a suite of online resources initiated by and with the continuing support of The Institute for the Study of the Ancient World
Unlike many programs that offer an independent or hybrid PhD in ancient philosophy, the University of Michigan has its students pursue two degrees in tandem: a PhD in either Philosophy or Classical Studies together with an MA in the companion field, in accordance with the established standards in each field. Because of overlapping requirements, all of this can be accomplished within the standard six years for the PhD, depending on your level of preparation and planning, though some students take slightly longer.
This structure reflects our approach to interdisciplinarity. Rather than look for space between the two fields, we think that the study of ancient philosophy is best stimulated by bringing together the special expertises in each discipline, whether they be logical and analytical techniques, ancient literary theory, the knowledge of politicial institutions and religious traditions, or papyrology (all strengths at Michigan). There is no one best way to study ancient philosophy; all of these approaches provide valuable insights. By bringing each into conversation with the others, all are enriched.
The structure of the program is also designed with students in mind, with regard to both their training and their future job prospects. Students pursue their foundational and specialized training in the normal way, in accordance with the established standards in each department. Because each degree is in a traditionally recognized disclipine, the hiring department can be confident in the value of the degree. The special character and emphasis in a particular student’s course of study will show itself in their selection of courses and research projects.
More detailed information on the two tracks can be found immediately below. A separate page contains information on applying, including links.
Students in the PhD program in Philosophy spend the first four to five terms doing course work to develop their basic philosophical and analytical skills and improve their writing, by taking a range of courses, including a required first term proseminar on philosophical method. Ten graduate courses in philosophy are required, as well as passing a logic requirement (through a course or examination), before candidacy is achieved. After a term transitioning to the dissertation (with dossier and prospectus), the remainder of the time is spent researching and writing the dissertation itself (usually two to three years), culminating in an oral defense. On the website for the Department of Philosophy, there are full details the PhD program in Philosophy and program requirements. There is also information on financial support.
Students on this track will develop their knowledge of the ancient language(s) and culture by pursuing either an MA in Greek or in Latin. The MA requires (a) six to seven graduate courses in the language studied and (b) a sight translation exam. There is some flexibility with regard to (a) for those who have both Latin and Greek: Greek MA students may count up to two courses in Latin, and Latin MA students up to two courses in Greek. Students on this track are also strong encouraged to develop a knowledge of German and either French or Italian. The website for the Department of Classical Studies has more details about the MA in Greek and the MA in Latin.
All graduate programs at Michigan require four credit hours in a cognate subject in a different program. But in dual programs such as ours, the courses for one degree can also serve as cognate credits for the other (by special application to the graduate school), so that no additional course work is required. This significantly reduces the time need to pursue both degrees.
Students in the PhD program in Classical studies spend the first three years doing course work to improve and refine their command of Greek and Latin; gain a broader and firmer grasp of the development of Greek and Roman literature in their historical settings; and acquaint themselves with the various subfields and basic tools, methods, aims, and achievements of classical scholarship, and with the methodologies (literary, historical, linguistic) currently being applied to classical texts. Ten courses of specific types are required, as well as a range of qualifying and preliminary exams, before candidacy is achieved. The student then undertakes a dissertation under the supervision of an advisor and a committee. The usual time required for its completion is one to two years. The final oral examination is on the dissertation and related topics. The website for the Department of Classical Studies has full details about the PhD program and requirements. Information about fellowship opportunities and support can be found in the last section of that page. All students are guaranteed five years of support, with a mixture of fellowship and teaching.
Students on this track will develop their philosophical skills and knowledge by pursuing an MA in the Department of Philosophy. The MA requires six to seven graduate courses in philosophy, in a range of areas, as well as passing a logic requirement (through a course or examination). The website for the Department of Philosophy has full details about the MA requirements.

000120046 520__ $$aThis paper discusses the growth model with environmental constraints recently presented in (Acemoglu et al., 2011) which focuses on the redirection of technical change by climate policies with research subsidies and a carbon tax. First, Acemoglu et al.'s model and chosen parameters yield numerical results that do not support the conclusion that ambitious climate policies can be conducted “without sacrificing (much or any) long-run growth”. Second, they select unrealistic key parameters for carbon sinks and elasticity of substitution. We find that more realistic parameters lead to very different results. Third, the model leads to an unrealistic conclusion when used to analyse endogenous growth, suggesting specification problems.

I plan to develop lessons and activities that will engage my students in learning about fish. This will fit in well with the study of various other living organisms. My class focuses on the value and interdepence of life and the comparison of the various groups of living things on the planet. In my classes I would like for my students identify the structure and function of the anatomical structures of fish. I also want them to be able to discuss specific adaptations of fish and how it makes them suitable for their role in the environment. I also plan to tie in ecological concepts in this unit including population dynamics with fish and how humans are impacting these population (overfishing, coral reef distruction, mangrove forest and estuary destruction/drainage).
a. Students will be given a list of adapations (reproductive, sturctural, patterned, etc.) and will be required to create a fish using various materials showing these adaptations. They will make up a scientific and common name for their fish creation and will introduce this fish to their class explaining the implications of their adaptations.
b. overfishing and habitat destruction and its effect on fish populations (renewable resouce becoming a nonrenewable resource)

Last view: 77 days Might anyone know where the offset is for adjusting Mega Man's speed for climbing a ladder in Mega Man 2 to be more like Mega Man 3-6? I could've sworn there was a patch for this somewhere that someone had already made but I was unable to locate it.
Last view: 1108 days Aren't they the same speed? If not, tell me where Mega Man 3's climbing speed is defined, in Hex Offset.
Aren't they the same speed? If not, tell me where Mega Man 3's climbing speed is defined, in Hex Offset.
I'm pretty sure the climbing speed is faster in the later 4 games. Kuja Killer is the guy to ask about MM3, I'm not sure where the offset is but I'll take a look in FCEUX later today on both ROMs to see if I can find the value(s).
Last view: 713 days Only got involved in this discussion because of Amarcum81 being my good friend. Yes, the climbing speed in Megaman 3-6 was much faster than in 2, although if I remember correctly 2 was faster than 1's climbing speed. Would be nice to improve 2 to be more like 3-6. Glad the Protoman project continues =-)
Tell my tale to those who ask. Tell it truly, the ill deeds along with the good, and let me be judged accordingly. The rest... is silence.

@Duke2go, Good to see you here my friend! Yes, climbing speed is definitely faster in 3-6. I just played a few Rockman 2 ROM hacks where the climbing speed is noticeably faster. So I'm going to open the ROM up again and see if I can track the correct offsets down where this might be located.
Last view: 1301 days Someone should try doing this what with all the rom expansions and mapper conversions.
There I was called the death in the void, but after a long sleep my drill was ready to pierce the void.
Last view: 59 days Kuja Killer has finished putting the text in. All what we need now is ZorakStart's graphics, so the thing is finally done!
I had a couple other minor edits to add too. Some things i did on Odyssey before, i'll do on here. Just "un-used" stuff from original mm3 rom i mean.
Last view: 59 days As it looks like the creator of the fanmade intro would like to do more for Megaman 3.
I tried using Youtube's messaging system to send you the sprites I made for the intro, but I've never used it before so it might have not sent. Which is why I'm glad to talk through email!
Anywho, here is a link to the sprites I converted for the intro to this email. Unfortunately, this does not include the planets/explosions, as they were done by MegaManUSA.
While I'm familiar with Sprites Inc., I do not post on either board- I'm actually pretty weak at spriting, and was only able to make these by converting composited images from the OVA "Upon a Star".
While I can try my hand at additional graphics, I'll admit up front I'm a slow worker and that images without a base (such as if you wanted new images of the Doc Robot) would be more difficult/might come out looking strange.
Still, I love the idea of a Mega Man 3 hack with new additions like this, so I hope the best for this project, and will try and provide additional help if I can."
Last view: 554 days I've been trying to locate Mega Man 5 graphic data for the title screen (Tile and Location) in the rom, and I'm just not finding it.
I've tried several places, but I can't find the tiles and I can't find the pointers for where they go. If anyone happens to know what offset these start at, that would be a huge help.

We are getting ready to put our home on the market and have a porch that was enclosed and want to know if the enclosed porch can be included in the main living area under AC. What qualifies the enclosed porch to be part of the main living area of the house?
In order to be considered living area, a finished enclosed porch must have air conditioning, be located under the main roof of dwelling or have a similar quality roof, and have finishes (floor, ceiling, walls, electrical) that are similar or better in quality compared to the main living area. To further clarify, an "AC" means an AC vent or an AC unit with a vent that blows cooled air and hot air into the finished enclosed porch or room must be located in the finished enclosed porch/room.
Appraisers define the porch as finished or unfinished. A finished enclosed porch can be counted or included in the main living area of the house. An unfinished enclosed porch is not considered in the main living area of dwelling. For example, an enclosed porch that has vinyl windows and an aluminum patio style roof is considered “unfinished”. Another example of an “unfinished enclosed porch” is a porch that has thin glass windows, aluminum patio style exterior wall siding and no finished flooring.
A finished enclosed porch has good air conditioning vents where the temperature stays the same on a very hot or cold day when you walk from the main living area into the finished enclosed porch area. The floor, walls and ceiling are finished with quality and workmanship that are similar to the main dwelling. The finished enclosed porch must have good flow and good functional utility.
If your porch is an unfinished enclosed porch, it will not be included in the main living area, however, an appraiser may give it value, assuming it is considered a usable feature or amenity and has positive market appeal.
When an appraiser has knowledge of a contract price, does it influence their opinion of market value?

Update: I actually figured out why i got the error message. I had removed Al Franken's name from the incumbent and didn't replace it with anything. After editing the scenario, I re added him but instead put vacancy and retried the campaign and it worked! It is possible to do a single senate seat race!
I was wondering if it was possible to make a Senate Scenario where only one seat was up for grabs. Sort of like the 2017 Special Election in Alabama. Because I know it's possible to set which seats are on/off for custom scenarios. So I would set the 99 Senate seats off and leave only one seat up for grabs. Could it be possible to create a single seat race or would the game cause an error?
Check out the updated 2016 Senate I put together. It includes a four way race for Alaska's Senate seat. http://campaigns.270soft.com/2018/09/13/2016-senate-updated/
Thanks for the response! I was going to put the issue in the scenario because the Republicans ran with it but it didn't really go well for them.
I'm going to start making a 1998 Senate Scenario and I want to include the Clinton impeachment as a issue. But I'm stumped on the issue positions Any suggestions?
Honestly I'm unsure at the moment. I can't really think of anyone at the top of my head. Maybe my Governor will appoint someone that is less critical of the President. But we'll have to see, the next Senator will have big shoes to fill.
John McCain was my Senator. I didn't agree with him 100% but I always respected him. May he rest in peace.
Update: I've decided to redo this playthrough after my computer erased my data. I also updated the scenario somewhat. stay tuned!

Moving forces you to sort through everything you own, and that develops a chance to prune your valuables. It's not constantly simple to choose what you'll bring along to your brand-new home and what is destined for the curb. Sometimes we're nostalgic about items that have no useful usage, and often we're extremely positive about clothes that no longer fits or sports gear we tell ourselves we'll start utilizing once again after the relocation.
Regardless of any discomfort it might cause you, it's essential to get rid of anything you truly don't require. Not just will it assist you prevent mess, but it can actually make it easier and cheaper to move.

In about twenty years of cohabiting, my partner and I have moved 8 times. For the very first seven moves, our condos or homes got progressively bigger. That permitted us to build up more mess than we required, and by our eighth relocation we had a basement storage location that housed six VCRs, a minimum of a lots parlor game we had actually seldom played, and a guitar and a pair of amplifiers that I had actually not touched in the entire time we had cohabited.
Since our ever-increasing space permitted us to, we had hauled all this things around. For our final relocation, however, we were downsizing from about 2,300 square feet of completed space, with storage and a two-car garage, to 1,300 square feet with neither storage nor a garage. And we were doing it by U-Haul.
As we evacuated our valuables, we were constrained by the space limitations of both our brand-new condo and the 20-foot rental truck. We required to discharge some things, that made for some tough options.
Having space for something and requiring it are two totally different things. For our relocation from Connecticut to Florida, my partner and I laid down some guideline:
It goes if we have not utilized it in over a year. This helped both people cut our wardrobes way down. I personally got rid of half a lots suits I look at this web-site had no event to wear (much of which did not fit), along with lots of winter season clothes I would no longer require (though a few pieces were kept for journeys up North).
Get rid of it if it has not been opened given that the previous move. We had a whole garage loaded with plastic bins from our previous relocation. One included absolutely nothing but smashed glass wares, and another had grilling devices we had long considering that replaced.
Do not let fond memories trump reason. This was a hard one, since we had actually accumulated over 2,000 CDs and more than 10,000 books. Moving them was not useful, and digital formats like MP3s and e-books made them all unneeded.
After the initial round of purging (and donating), we made 2 lists. One was stuff we absolutely wanted-- things like our remaining clothes and the furniture we required for our new home. The 2nd, which included things like a cooking area table we only sort-of liked, went on an "if it fits" list. Since we had one U-Haul and 2 small cars and trucks to fill, some of this things would simply not make the cut.
It is possible transferring to another town would put you in line for a property buyer assistance program that is not offered to you now. It is possible relocating to another town would put you in line for a homebuyer support program that is not readily available to you now.
Moving forced us to part with a lot of products we desired however did not need. I even provided a big tv to a good friend who helped us move, since in the end, it just did not fit.
Loading too much stuff is one of the most significant moving errors you can make. Conserve yourself some time, money, and peace of mind by decluttering as much as possible prior to you move.
I understand the usefulness of the type operator GHC extension, but I don't like it. For value identifiers any operator not starting with a ':' is treated the same way as identifiers starting with a lower case letter. This is how it used to be on the type level too. But with the latest version of the TypeOperators extension these operators now behave like upper case identifiers and can be used to name types. An ugly wart, IMO.
This extension stems from Levent Erkök's PhD thesis Value Recursion in Monadic Computations. The motivation was to be able to describe circuits with feedback using monadic notation.
There's actually two way to get recursive do-notation. You can either use the rec keyword inside the do or you can use the keyword mdo instead of do. Why mdo, you ask? It should really be μdo, where μ is the recursion operator. But people at GHC HQ are scared of Unicode, so instead we got mdo.
Once you have accepted multi-parameter type classes then nullary type classes are a natural consequence; zero is also a number, after all.
In 1994 I worked on the pH language when I visited MIT. The acronym pH stands for "parallel Haskell", which is what it is. It had some imperative features that were not in a monad. This was in 1994, and the ST monad was just being invented, so we were trying out other things. To keep track of what parts of the program used imperative features I used a nullary type class Imperative that tainted any code that used assignment et al. (As far as I know, this is the earliest use of a nullary type class.) When mixing imperative code and pure code it is important to not be too polymorphic. ML-like languages use the value restriction to accomplish this. Since Haskell's monomorphism restriction is essentially the same as the value restriction, having the Imperative type class neatly accomplished the value restriction for pH.
The implicit parameter started as an attempt to simplify Haskell overloading. Haskell overloading, when implemented by dictionary passing, really has two parts: first there is a way to implicitly pass dictionaries around, and second, dictionaries are constructed automatically by using the instance declarations as a logical inference system.
The implicit parameters do the automagic passing of parameters, and is thus half of what is needed for overloading. But they were never used for overloading, instead it was discovered that they can be made to behave like dynamic binding, but with static types. This is quite cool! Even if one doesn't like dynamic binding (I don't).
There idea is presented Erik Meijer et al's paper Implicit Parameters: Dynamic Scoping with Static Types. It's worth reading.
Type families grew out of the need to have type classes with associated types. The latter is not strictly necessary since it can be emulated with multi-parameter type classes, but it gives a much nicer notation in many cases. The same is true for type families; they can also be emulated by multi-parameter type classes. But MPTC gives a very logic programming style of doing type computation; whereas type families (which are just type functions that can pattern match on the arguments) is like functional programming.
Using closed type families adds some extra strength that cannot be achieved by type classes. To get the same power from type classes we would need to add closed type classes. Which would be quite useful; this is what instance chains gives you.
Even the original paper on Haskell type classes mentions multiple parameters, so this idea has been with us from the start. But it's not present in Stefan Kaes original work on type classes.
Unfortunately, multiple type class parameters very quickly lead to type ambiguities in the code, and we are forced to add type signatures. So MPTC was not really useful until Mark Jones introduced functional dependencies. Mark got the idea from database theory where the same idea is used to limit the relations in the database.
I'm pretty confident that I'm to blame for (re)sparking the idea of supporting nullary classes, though others certainly did the work of pushing a proposal through. For me, this all started with a snarky response to a typo: http://ircbrowse.net/day/haskell/2010/09/20?id=10357620&timestamp=1285006007#t1285006007 (22 minutes later, presumably after trying things in GHC, I came up with some use-cases and a bit more discussion.)
I brought it up a couple of times over the next few years until I inadvertently got Shachaf Ben-Kiki enamoured of the idea. He then made the trivial patch in #7642
It's nice to know that I'm in good company, though I do agree with Oliver that it's not clear that using this is a good idea. The fact that Hugs did(does?) support this, suggests that Gofer did allow this. I don't know if there is any history of use in Hugs or Gofer.
Incidentally, if Haskell disallowed orphan instances, I'm pretty sure this "feature" would become meaningless.
Hi! I am iris, a web developer based in New Zealand and I enjoy travelling and photography as well as gaming, coding and writing in my spare time
Membership dues are now required for forums located under the Member forums category. Membership dues are not required for any of the general discussion forums. Yearly membership dues are $1 per year, however, the reader should note that by $1 we mean "371.25 grains of silver" as defined in the Coinage Act of 1792. One American Eagle silver dollar will do.
There are numerous places from which these silver or gold coins can be purchased. The following are a few suggestions.
We do not endorse any of the above precious metal sellers, so you should do your homework before deciding on where to buy. You should also submit your membership dues before you need help through this site. If you have fallen behind or stopped paying your unsecured debt, you should start the process of obtaining the funds by which you will pay. Once a suit has been filed against you, you have a very limited amount of time in which to respond.
When payment is mailed to us, it should be sent by a means in which we can track its delivery through an online service such as Federal Express, DHL or UPS. Email the tracking number to dues@afreecountry.com. You may also notify us through the site contact form.
Any member who submits more than 1,000 posts while helping others on this site, will be made an honorary member and will be given free lifetime membership to this site. The dues are waived for all moderators and book authors.
I just joined and still get error can't go there. It has been so frustrating getting on this site. I registered with a different email address last night. and I never got an email. So I used a different address this morning. I am fighting for my right to travel and need the affidavit. I only have this internet for a few more hours so am pressed for time. Otherwise it may be next weekend before I can get back here.
I apologize. I was out all day yesterday inspecting. You should have access now. I use cleantalk to keep spammers out of the site. Otherwise we get about 50 spammers per day signing up. People who use email addresses from the big free domains have problems, but we are working it out.
I was under the impression that you paid for access to the Member Forums on the site. The members forums are for contributing members and dues paying members. I am not showing that you paid for dues, not have either joined a common law grand jury of the APP to qualify as a contributing member, When you register, you get access to the regular forums only. As such, you will have to meet one of the two above mentioned tasks to gain access to the member forum where the right to travel affidavit is located.
As a reminder, those who have access to the member forum get more than just one form. They have access to to help with their documents and may access other documents that others have used themselves, for challenging jurisdiction, making orders in courts of record, etc. So their is a wealth of information that Members gain by having access to the member forums worth far more than the $30 annual dues.
Sorry for the confusion and the inconvenience. Spammers have made it inconvenient for all of us on the web.
Sent in credit card info for membership when I registered. If there's a problem let me know. I need the affidavits (IRS and traffic) ASAP. Keep getting error message.
Shitnpickles, It is monitored. I sent you a message through the site. It may have been filtered out to your spam folder. I responded to you before your latest post. You have had access to the member forums for several days now.
My son has a court date for a traffic extortion payout to wisconsin. I understand you have a traffic extortion document. I have a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction (cause of action) sans an injured party and therefore no standing. plus a drivers license is a commercial activity that was not even addressed in the complaint (ticket). NO alleged business being conducted.
Wisconsin Dept of revenue believes they own my labor and should let me have what "we" believe a slave should be allowed to keep. I believe I should include them in the affidavit; any suggestions where to include "we" (DOR) in the text to put them on notice?
I do not kow what you are referring to as a traffic extortion document. We do have a Free Right of Travel Affidavit that can be served on the commissioner of your state's department of motor vehicles. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you will find a file attachment in odt and doc formats so you can simply save it to your computer for editing.
It is best to post your case in the member forums. This is where we share our paperwork and review each other's paperwork for accuracy and format. There is a forum specifically for speeding tickets. The only case there right now has the counterclaim that must be filed, but the judge in that case is being very rebellious, so the sovereign is about to hold the judge in contempt of court in that case.
There is a forum for victimless crimes where you can post your cases for so called crimes for which there was no injured party. This would be for crimes like drug possession or sales, driving, fishing, hunting without a license and so on. Readers should note when reading your charging documents that the state is listed as the "victim" even though the state has suffered no injury. This is just a tactic to try to legitimize the states control over people.
I would not file an affidavit if your are already under attack by the state. I would file a counterclaim and, yes, there is an injured party. When the state attempts to fine you for speeding or any thing else, it has exceeded its jurisdiction and given you cause to defend your rights as a freeman. That takes time. You have been attacked by the state and as such, the state owes you damages. It is not just the state that has caused you an injury. The government agent that did the action caused the injury. The magistrate for the inferior court did the injury as did the prosecutor. They have all worked in unison together for the purpose of conspiring against you to generate revenue for the corporation known as "State of Wisconsin" or whatever your state may be. The damages in the case of a speeding ticket may not be that much, but there are damages none the less. You may calculate your damages based on how much time you will have to devote toward defending your rights.
As to the department of revenue, we do have an affidavit that can be formatted for it as well as the IRS, if you are referring to the income tax. However, I think I have improved this affidavit since posting it, so I would check out the one posted in this thread.
If the state is close to making a move against you or your property, I would again recommend either a claim or a counterclaim. That is the best way to stop the state's action against your until such time as the issue can be resolved in the superior court of record. DO NOT FILE A MOTION IN THEIR COURT. You are consenting to the jurisdiction of the inferior court when doing so. If you do not file a counterclaim as a people in a court of record, you are giving the judge license to make decisions about you and as a people, you are not subject to his law unless you consent. Filing a motion in his court constitutes consent. When you file an action in a court of record, you suspend the judge from making any decisions. That means you do not allow him to make a decision for you of against you.
Here is a case that has gone to the end and has been resolved. The next step in that case is for the sovereign to start garnishing the paychecks of the defendants. It is not probable that the government agencies will pay. However, the government agents can have their paychecks garnished. In this case, the sovereign was being harassed by local law enforcement. He file his action and issued several orders in his case. The end result was a ruling in his favor, not surprising, and the defendants now owe him his damages. The judge tried to circumvent his authority and he issued a Writ of Error overturning the judges ruling. His ruling included an order for the defendants to show just cause without 30 days why his order is not valid. Thirty days have come and gone. His case is done.
It sounds to me like both you and your son need to file counterclaims in your cases. If you need help, just know that I do not have much time for a while. But I can review your paperwork now and again when you need. Just don't wait until the last minute to let me know. DocT can also help. He has gone through this himself. He is the Chair of the Texas American People's Peacekeepers. He is a great coach.
I would also recommend that both of you join the American People's Peacekeepers. Even if you are the first in your state to do so, you will be getting the ball rolling to share the knowledge you are about to gain in defending your rights. You will also be building an organization that will have your back in all of your common law cases.
I paid dues but cannot get to the member forum. My Order Number : 105767674734. Trying to access the counterclaim form.
Fathon21, I'm sorry. That issues was resolved previously. Apparently the issues has returned. So much for automation. I have manually promoted you to member status. You will now have access to the member forum.
In my years of study I have never felt like actually joining anything. Usually a group had language that didn't quite add up, or maybe they were too militant, or just wanted money for forms to download without providing content at all. So far I think I've downloaded/copied and read about 80% of everything available on this site, but I cannot know until I get deeper. I'm looking to join. I've read that info. I don't know what I have to offer. I guess most people arriving are as new as I am but everything our Mr. Hamilton has written hits every nail on the head. I like the direction.
As I said, I'm new to the site and have immediate needs as well. I was arrested and jailed for 90 days on an OUI case here in Massachusetts and I was railroaded because I was not allowed to direct my "appointed" defender to do the right thing. I can expand a lot more on my story but I'll leave that for another spot, but my case is due in trial on the 5th of January so I do feel pressured. And I'm not guilty.
I'm trying to join. I'm also heading towards court to challenge jurisdiction and need as much info as I can get. I'm not confident enough and I'm cramming to learn asap. The counterclaim I'm sure you know is what I'm in need of now and any other information I can find.
Oh, I see you have two sections on fees and dues. One is for $30.00 membership but I also am about to pull the trigger on the Liberty Silver Dollar . . .
I must add I'm not too convinced when very little on this website seems to work and the only one on this site is me every time I arrive here.
Sorry, I am currently working 6 days a week and get little time here. Once I finish my current contract, I will be more readily available. You are right, about the counterclaim. We actually list 13 cases that uphold that once jurisdiction is challenged it must be proven. It is included in all of our declarations of law.
Time is short, so we will have to move. Email me your phone number so I can call you tomorrow. When you email me I will reply with mine so you will know from what number the call is coming.
If you have entered a plea, we will will have to retract it in your paperwork. People not being subject to statutes without their individual consent do not enter pleas. They object to the code and the jurisdiction of the inferior court. They also do not hire attorneys. Attorneys are officers of the inferior courts and hiring one is consent. Like i did in my case, you can fire the oe that has been appointed. As you will see in some of the case law, jurisdiction can be challenged at anytime and once challenged, it must be proven. But will get deeper into this when I talk to you. Most of what affects this case can be found under the Sovereignty of people menu.
The are a few cases in the member forum that serve as good examples, but if you want me to do your paperwork, we can talk about that as well. Randy Townsend is the chairman of the Texas American People's Peacekeepers and can help quite a bit. He is DocT on this site.
Becoming a member of the APP in your state makes you a Contributing Member and if you are the first, we do ask that you serve as chair until you build an organization that can appoint a new chair. No you do not have to know all of the things you will eventually learn. You just have to be willing to learn and share what you learn.
I'm headed to the cart so I can gain access to the forum. One comment before I head in though. As far a me entering a plea on arraignment, I was not given any chance to speak at all in court, the judge/magistrate entered a plea of not guilty and assigned me the public defender. My opinion of the defender is he's useless not only for me but for them plus anytime I tried to lead him he would shooosh me. We'll get into it but I like what you mentioned about taking care of that plea in the paperwork. I also have listened to and watched all the info that Bill Thornton has. I like how he said he doesn't say anything in court because everything is in the paperwork. I just don't know how much or how little to put into it. I also like the saying of, "Don't bring up anything you do not want to argue" but with all the videos I've seen of guys that seem to know what the common law is I see the judges slamming them with questions. Okay . . .
. . . just returned from paying through 2checkout and was returned to an error message: Error 403 -Access Denied so I assume access to the forum is done manually. No problem. Thank you
I think that the judges asking questions is a tactic to get you to argue you case orally so that he can disregard your paperwork and trip you up. Bill also said in one of his lectures, always just refer the judge back to the paperwork. Something simple like, I said all I have to say in my paperwork. I do not know how I can make it any clearer than I have in my paperwork."
You will note in the docs included in the case on this site, the paperwork is very clear. Judges and attorneys will say how it just doesn't make any sense, but it makes no difference. The judge doesn't get to make any decisions anyway.
As far aas the ple is concerned, the arraignment was to get your consent. The fact that you did not say anything, cements your stance that you did not consent. The fact that you did not object is easily overcome, because you had a representative standing there who was supposed to know law. He was the "expert". In fact, he was a conspirator aiding the judge and prosecutor in comitting a fraud or "Trespass on the Case". One of at least 3 causes of action I can see in your case. There are most likely 5 or 6. The public defender should also be a counterdefendant for the reasons I listed above.
I spent the past two days chasing down my paperwork. Not so easy to do on a BICYCLE when everything is 7 miles from my house and lawyer and court and police station are miles from each other too. I actually caught up with my public defender at his home because he would see me after his court date where he was "defending" someone else. What a swell guy. So I knocked on his door at 8AM Saturday morning.
Anyway, I've got everything I think. And I've put all but my past record to scanned images. What the cops wrote is scary. But I do not know any of it because I was in a blackout. How do I prove diabetic blackout when I don't have a doctor or the money to pay for one or the time it takes to process blood work? That was the only thing my defender mentioned I would have to have to "beat the case". He had over 4 months to get the 3 vials of blood the nurse at the prison took~!
I've been studying and searching for laws in my state and the agents and representatives that belong to this state too. As far as copy/pasting laws into a form, do they have to have been decided upon in my state of Massachusetts?
I've naturally got a ton of questions. Those are heading the list. All help is invited. And thanks everyone.
No worries! Automationlove it and hate it but mostly love it. I appreciate your help in resolving the issue.
Still working on correcting automation. I did find a couple of configuration issues. Hopefully it has NOW been fix. Won't know for sure until someone does it again.
There is an app call Cash App that you can use on your smart phone and once you set it up; it uses your cell phone number which you can get another for these purposes; and the users can send the payments directly to you to whatever bank account you set up. Just a thought but in the meantime, you will be getting a letter with my silver dollar.
I've been trying show my gratitude by attempting to pay my dues and still going to send in my oath. But every time I click on check out it doesn't let me. I've used venmo and it's the same thing flower power said, you link it to your card and you can make transactions. I've used it before, works fine.
I appreciate the jester, but 2 checkout cut me off when they reviewed the site and learned the site "gives legal advice." I will have to find another credit card processor.
Michael, I already have silver bullion at my disposal, can I Fed Ex it to you directly or do you require that it come from a third party vendor? What type do you prefer, Rounds, Bars, etc.?
rpiel, I prefer United states coins, like the American Eagle, but any minted in these united states are fine. Just send me the tracking number once you ship it and I will upgrade you.
I can appreciate how busy you are bye essentially holding down multiple full time positions, i am reaching out for help and the window closes on Tuesday December 20th, when I am scheduled to appear before the municipal court here in Douglas County Colorado, I have delivered the dues as requested [USPS tracking- 70090820000203019553]. Can I have access to the Member forums so I can resubmit my request in the proper forum?
Anyone can do a search on this site just like any other site. Just do a search for what you are looking for like "member dues". However, to make this trip easier for you go here. http://afreecountry.com/?q=dues
Besides places like those mentioned on the page, you can get silver from places like silver.com. I do not do pasypal.
You have been promoted to Contributing Member. Make sure you order your id and badge from Marshal Haywood ASAP. The badges are going into production soon. Also make sure you read the Marshal Handbook on lexsuprema.net.
Does anyone know of a coin company that will allow me to ship the coin directly to Mr. Hamilton? Every site i tried would not allow shipping to a different address. I would sure like to avoid the delay.
M.R. Hamilton: Thank you so much for sharing your information, I will get you a coin A.S.A.P. I am expecting a divorce complain in the state of Nebraska very soon and would like to prepare my counter complain with the assistance of this site.

I have not yet received a divorcee complain yet. I did get a letter from The State Child Support Services. That said contact us by Jan 28 2017 for an important matter or "additional legal action could result". I did not contact or reply. So I am expecting something soon. My question is: Is it ok to get a thread started so i can start on document templates and strategies..or is it best to wait? Divorce being a civil contract I am a little confused on how to keep this in the "Kings Court of Record" I know not to sign or agree to anything, i don't really want to go to jail but i do not fear it. I refuse to let these criminals tell me how to raise my kid and would rather be locked up than enslaved. I am not a dead beat dad, i have a good job, and i committed to my children, but i will not be told how to live by the state. No one would tell a King how to raise his princess nor will the state tell me how to do it.

Hadith. Converted to PDF format by. Bill McLean africanpremieradventures.com .. know and those whom you do not Know (See Hadith No. 27). 25 Nov Imam al-Bukhari Language: ِArabic-English | Format: PDF | Volumes: 9 | Size: 80 MB Generally regarded as the single most authentic collection. All Muslim scholars are agreed that Sahih Al-Bukhari is the most authentic and reliable book after the Book of Allah. There are Ahaadeeth in this great.
In death, Achebe became more popular and great. That is the hallmark of true patriots and man of honour. The personality and achievements of Achebe have been given generous mention in the print and electronic media, but not that aspect that defines the Igbo spirit in him. The accident that sent Achebe to the wheelchair brought out the dogged Igbo spirit in him.
Whether the accident is natural or man-made, it brought to the fore the true Igbo spirit in him, because it was in this chair that Achebe became more critical and defiant to unjust rulership. He never wanted sympathy of anybody; neither did he play sycophancy in order to curry favour.
Former governor of Anambra State, Dr.Chris Ngige, said during the funeral service of Achebe in Awka , that it was only Achebe , of all the so-called Igbo elites and politicians, who stood up against the criminality and brigandage that pervaded his regime in Anambra State. It was on his wheelchair that Achebe rejected his national honours award because of what was happening in Anambra then.
Meanwhile, the rascals who perpetrated this evil and being sponsored from Abuja are regarded as “prominent sons of the state”
A prominent son that burnt down his father’s Obi Eze (palace), can only be a bastard son. A leader who enjoys inflicting pain on his subjects, is not only a sadist, but a psychopath. These are what Achebe stood against till death. And nobody has proved him wrong, including those who criticized him for rejecting the national honors award. These are people who love titles, even the ones they did not merit.
Achebe, like Julius creaser, never stood on ceremonies. Achebe chosed to distant himself from corrupt Nigerian government, because he knows that any intellectual or activist who works with such government and makes money will definitely compromise, because he cannot truly and sincerely escape from the pressure from all corners by favour seekers.
He may not have the moral courage to criticize such a government later because they have his dossier. Ask Prof. Wole Soyinka, late Tai Solarin or Faruk Lawan. If men of integrity and principle can reject appointment from such government, it will checkmate the government and Nigeria will be better for it. Those who burnt their fingers with Abacha and Babangida governments are still regretting it till today because of what those regimes did to this country and the scars are still with us till today.
I took time to observe those who eulogized Achebe in death. Some of them were embarrassed that a man they derided and lampooned in life could attract such national and international clout and sympathy even in death. No literally icon in Africa has received such honour in death.
I wonder if any of our so-called national honour holders could come close to Achebe’s status, even in death. That is what I call a man indeed. Like his son said, Achebe did not programme his life and writing to win Nobel Prize. So it means nothing to him. Only few people can handle genuine criticism, including the white man.
It is only a fool who will believe that there is no politics and sentiments in the award of Nobel Prize for literature. So when a Nobel laureate said Achebe is not the father of African literature, in spite of the opinion and verdict of African intellectuals and the world, I knew that envy knows no boundary.
I remember the controversy of Asiwaju and Iroko of African literature that followed the Nobel Prize award and how Achebe handled it like a man. Perhaps, with the criticisms of Nobel Prize award and the constitution of the board, it is time the committee begins a critical reform so that the true spirit behind the establishment of the award by Alfred Nobel will not be defeated.
If the only man whose novel has been translated into 50 languages world-wide and still counting, could not merit Nobel Prize, then something is wrong. It is an embarrassment to the Nobel committee, no matter how they try to defend it.
Having said the above, I must not fail to commend the Sun Newspaper once more. They did it during Ojukwu’s burial. They have done it again for Chinua Achebe’s burial. These are Igbo icons whose life and death would have remained unsung but for the Sun Newspaper. No Nigerian newspaper celebrated these Igbo icons like the Sun Newspaper. No wonder every effort was made by somebody to close down the paper but God is there watching over the Sun. I have never seen any force that can cover the Sun from shining. More so, a Sun that is the voice of the nation; the voice of the voiceless.
The thing is that where other papers try to downplay the achievements of Igbo icons out of sectional or political sentiments, the Sun will highlight it for the world to see. It is now clear to Nigerians and the whole world that Igbos are not only traders and businessmen, but intellectuals of international repute.
There is something about a man who is doing business with university degree. There is something about a man who entered the Nigeria Army with master’s degree from Oxford University in U.K, when the highest Army officer then was a standard six holder.
There is something about the same man who said unless Ogundipe is made the head of State, as the highest ranking officer after the death of Aguiyi-Ironsi, he will not obey any other officer. There is something about a man who sees every part of Nigeria as his home.
There is something about a man whose middle name is “industry and versatility” who refused to remain idle and helpless. There is something about a man whose property and cash were confiscated, but rose up from the ashes like a phoenix.
There is something about a man who did not enjoy massive free education, yet he is leading in every academic department. Several events have happened in this country which proved that the Igbo man has all it takes to liberate, unite, industrialize and elevate this country to enviable height.
So holding him down is like holding the country down. He who is holding a brave man on the ground is holding himself, so says the proverb. The life of Ojukwu and Achebe is a wakeup call for every Igbo man to excel in whatever legitimate endeavour he is doing. They should be the best in their fields and live a principled life of non-compromise. They should live life to be remembered beyond their immediate environment.
The life and death of Ojukwu and Achebe has proved that Igbos are a rare breed. They have proved that something good can come out of Nazareth, contrary to popular propaganda. Finally, while we wish Chinua Achebe farewell journey to his maker, the Igbos must try to re-invent the ofo na ogu (justice system) in Igbo land as a check against those who are bent on desecrating the land.
The Igbo Elders must devise a means of controlling the evil excesses of some people who want to destroy the Igbo culture through over-ambitious quest for wealth and power.

Hey anybody, whatever do you actually think regarding the fresh natural cap? Wow I manufactured this by using the skin of a big green fruit. A few of my local freinds point out this specific green fruit seems perfect, and that i like this particular development quite definitely.

For the past several years our Family Ministry leaders have been helping us explore new ways of being a multi-generational community of faith. CONNECT nights bring together all ages.
You are invited to join an opportunity for discipleship this program year. Members of AACRC will lead us through Philip Kenneson’s book, Life on The Vine: Cultivating the Fruit of the Spirit in Christian Community.
In this book Kenneson uses the the Fruit of the Spirit that is found in Galatians 5:22-23 to demonstrate living the way of Jesus in our personal lives as well as in community of faith.
During each session, each leader will facilitate a conversation on a particular “fruit” and its importance for us today.
The sessions will begin at 6:30 pm and run until 8 pm. Reading the book is not necessary to come to the sessions, just come with an open mind ready to learn and grow.

It is that time of year again; time for our annual Haunted Series where we've explored things that go bump in the cemetery, the restaurant, the town … and this year the asylum! Join me each Friday in October as we cast an eye upon those buildings that were feared by the residents and avoid by everyone else ... those places that are now Haunted Asylums!
Anoka, Minnesota has an interesting claim to fame – It is believed to be the first city in the U.S. to hold a Halloween celebration in order to prevent locals from playing pranks or causing trouble around town. Since 1920, it has been known as the “Halloween Capital of the World.”
It began as the First State Asylum for the Insane. Built in 1898 in the cottage style, the hospital opened in March 1900 to admit patients from other state asylums that had become too crowded. The first 100 patients were males from St. Peter State Hospital and were considered to be “chronic incurables”- Men who had lost their minds due to heredity causes or environment.
Residents were not to receive any type of treatment; this was the final stop for them until they died. And die they did. A total of 86 of the original patients were buried in numbered graves in the asylum cemetery.
In 1906, 115 women were also transferred to the asylum from St. Peter State Hospital. Then in 1909, state policy changed and the hospital was only allowed to admit female transfer patients. (The male patients were then sent to another asylum in the state.) But by 1925, another wing had been added to the building and the hospital became co-ed, admitting both women and men.
Another name change occurred in 1937 when the institution was renamed Anoka State Hospital in an attempt to soften the image of the asylum. Although the name was kinder and gentler, treatment at the facility was not. Patients were subjected to medical experiments and suffered both mental and physical abuse.
Although the hospital provided care to the insane, cruelty and neglect were often reported during the 1930s through the 1950’s. Those deemed a threat to themselves or others were restrained with manacles and straitjackets. Others that were seen as less dangerous were left to wander the grounds and buildings.
From 1948 to 1967, the hospital also treated mentally ill patients with tuberculosis. Actual treatment of the mentally ill began in the 1940s but many times that treatment “progressed” to lobotomies, hydrotherapy, and electroshock therapy.
Conditions became so bad in the Minnesota asylums that in 1948, Governor Luther Youngdahl took a reporter and photographer with him on Halloween to witness his stand against the cruelty being inflicted at the state’s seven asylums including Anoka. With a torch, Youngdahl burned piles of leather wrist straps and straitjackets in front of a nighttime crowd of over 1,000. The governor also began to allot more funding for the state’s hospitals and the care of the mentally ill.
With the advancement of psychoactive drugs in the 1960s, the winding down of these asylums began. Anoka’s population went from 1,085 in 1960 to just under 500 by 1970. It was during the 1970s that the facility also began treatment of emotionally disturbed children and adolescents.
In 1985, the hospital underwent its final name change to the current Anoka-Metro Regional Treatment Center. The original hospital complex closed in 1999 and residents were transferred to a new facility located close by.
The buildings and property were then given to Anoka County to use for offices and to house the county workhouse. The remainder of the buildings were closed and boarded up.
With such a sordid past, it is no wonder that the Anoka State Hospital has been rumored to house phantom patients. Former employees have reported that while unusual occurrences happen throughout the buildings, the most paranormal activities are linked to the tunnels located below the buildings.These tunnels were used as a way of transferring patients from one building to another without risking escape.
Ironically, many patients believed these tunnels would lead them to freedom and so they tried to escape by going down into them. But after a few twists and turns, escapees realized that the tunnels were more of a maze than an escape route. Without an understanding of where each tunnel went and how they joined together, it was easy to get hopelessly lost in them. Several escapees became so disoriented and distraught that they took the only way out that they felt was left to them and hung themselves from heavy pipes suspended along the ceiling.
For years, employees would report hearing footsteps trudging through the tunnels, stopping, pausing; maybe a "former" inmate considering which way to go ... There were also reports of whispering and low voices in conversation, but the words were not understood. Could a past patient have been trying to warn those still using the tunnels of the dire consequences when you didn't know where the routes led? The sounds of voices, plaintive and pleading, seemed to follow those who made their ways from one building to another. At times a burst of laughter might be heard in the dark tunnels, along with odd, ominous noises. And many former employees reported cold spots that moved all too frequently throughout these dark catacombs.
The paranormal activities became so rampant that most employees refused to use the tunnels because they were just too eerie. Today, only maintenance and security are allowed in them.
While there may be other state hospitals that were far worse in the treatment of their patients, some of those who lived at Anoka have apparently not forgotten, or forgiven, their experiences under the guise of medical treatment.
Today, the county owns the buildings that made up the former insane asylum complex. Although the complex was eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, it appears that time has past. The current buildings are in a state of extreme disrepair. It has cost the county $22,000 a year, per building, to preserve them. Now, the county spends about $5,000 for each structure, per year, with no money for unkeep allotted for 2015.
Information released on September 30, 2014, indicated that the County Board hopes to use three of the buildings as locations to house homeless veterans. But with the condition of the buildings, it remains to be seen if the plan is feasible. If not, the Anoka State Hospital would be slated for demolition in 2016.
And who’s to say whether the destruction of the facility will lay to rest those ghosts who remain there; only time will tell …

It is that time of year again; time for our annual Haunted Series where we've explored things that go bump in the cemetery, the restaurant, the town … and this year the asylum! Join me each Friday in October as we cast an eye upon those buildings that were feared by the residents and avoided by the living: those Haunted Asylums.
Construction for the Illinois Asylum for the Incurable Insane began in 1895 in Bartonville, but it was seven years before the facility, built in the “cottage-style” with 7 buildings, would open its doors to the first 100 residents on February 10, 190.
Patients who were characterized as being “incurably insane” were transferred from other hospitals, almshouses, and institutions around the state to Illinois’ newest facility. The asylum was quickly placed under the direction of Dr. George Zeller by the autumn of 1902.
Dr. Zeller was a new breed of asylum doctors; he believed in a humane approach in dealing with the mentally ill. Zeller also thought that the public needed to understand the mentally ill, so he held meetings and invited local newspapers and community members to visit the hospital.
Color therapy and light therapy were both first introduced during the early years of the hospital. In 1905, Dr. Zeller ordered all bars and mechanical restraints removed from the buildings. He also arranged for burial grounds to be set aside on the property for those patients who had no relatives. The site eventually grew to include four cemeteries where over 4,100 patients were interred.
Thanks to Dr. Zeller, in 1907, the term “incurable” was dropped from the name and the institution became known as the Illinois General Hospital for the Insane. In 1909 the name was changed to the Peoria State Hospital, but locals also called the asylum the Bartonville State Hospital.
Dr. Zeller remained with the facility until 1913 when he accepted a position as a state “alienist.” (psychiatrist) But by 1921, Zeller was back on board as Superintendent, He found such neglect and ill treatment that he checked himself in as a patient for three days, living on a different ward each day. At the end of his experiment, he ordered all staff to spend 8 hours being treated as an inmate.
In 1927, the hospital celebrated its 25th Anniversary. More than 13,500 patients had come through the asylum’s doors. The current population was listed at 2,650 residents.
In 1935, Dr. Zeller stepped down as Superintendent but he continued to live on the grounds in the Bowen (administration) Building. He died there on June 29, 1938.
Soon after his death, The Peoria Hospital took a turn for the worse. Insulin Shock Therapy was introduced, lobotomies were performed, and Electro Convulsive Therapy began to be used. The days of kindness and understanding were over.
The 1950’s were peak years at PSH with over 2,800 patients residing here, but several patients were killed or died of mysterious circumstances during this time. At one time over 40 buildings were located on the property.
By 1972 only 600 patients were living here and the imminent closure of the facility was announced. The Peoria State Hospital closed in 1973.
The buildings remained empty after the hospital’s closure. Plans were made but development ideas were never successful. Over time, many of the buildings were demolished, others renovated as the community tried to find uses the buildings.
But even though the buildings appeared to be empty, many say that spirits still reside here. There are four cemeteries located on the property and all are said to be haunted.
Dr. Zeller wrote a book in the 1920s called “The Bereft” about his experiences at the hospital. In it he also documented his paranormal experiences at the facility. One of the first unexplainable incidents that occurred at the hospital, which Zeller witnessed, along with hundreds of other patients and staff, involved a mute patient known as Manuel A. Bookbinder. “Old Book” worked with the burial crew at the facility. After each funeral service, as the body was being lowered into the grave, Old Book would remove his cap, lean against an elm tree and sob. No one knew why.
In 1910, Old Book died and Dr. Zeller along with hundreds of patients and staff attended his funeral at the cemetery. But as the service was being conducted, the sight of Old Book, leaning against the old elm tree, crying, caught everyone’s attention. The funeral was stopped and the casket opened to find the body of Old Book lying peacefully in his coffin. The apparition had vanished and no one could logically explain what had just happened.
Other apparitions have been seen wandering along hospital corridors, shadows flit about the abandoned rooms, sobs and whispers can be heard throughout the remaining buildings along with footsteps.
Although Peoria State Hospital might be considered “mild” in comparison to other haunted hospitals, it was voted “Scariest Insane Asylum” in 2012 by Ghostly World visitors, and has been featured on the television show, “Ghost Hunters.”
Today, a group known as “Save the Bowen” owns the asylum. The group is seeking assistance, including financial and volunteers, to save the historical administration building. Find out more at Peoria Asylum.

1992 - Educating patients in how to deal with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reduced the use of health services and improved patients' knowledge of the disease | 1993 Sep-Oct : Volume 119, Number 2, Page 42 | ACP Journal Club Archives
Educating patients in how to deal with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease reduced the use of health services and improved patients' knowledge of the disease
Tougaard L, Krone T, Sorknaes A, Ellegaard H, the PASTMA Group. Economic benefits of teaching patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease about their illness. Lancet. 1992 Jun 20;339:1517-20.
To evaluate the effect on health service use of educating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) about their illness.
100 consecutive patients aged > 35 years and hospitalized with COPD (pulmonary disease with symptoms of respiratory obstruction or secretions). Exclusion criteria were previous thoracic surgery, pulmonary tuberculosis, silicosis, asbestosis, lung cancer, terminal diseases, or severe learning difficulties. 82 patients (mean age 70 y) completed the study.
50 patients were allocated to receive personalized hospital practice (PHP), which included training in aspects of their disease, and 50 patients were allocated to standard hospital practice. The aim of PHP was to improve patient awareness of their illness and their feelings of self-control. Medical treatment was the same in both groups in the hospital, but PHP patients received about 3 hours more instruction than control patients.
Changes in the use of health services, in level of knowledge of the disease, in severity of respiratory disease and dyspnea, and in arterial blood gas and pulmonary function results.
The PHP group had better knowledge of their disease compared with the control group. Compared with the year before admission, the use of health services after the intervention was on average Kr15 298 {U.S. $2583}* less per patient per year in the PHP group than in the control group (P = 0.048), mainly because of a high rate of readmission in the control group for hospital and respirator treatment. Use of general practitioner services was increased in the control group compared with the PHP group (Kr1346 {U.S. $227}* vs -Kr89 {U.S. $15}*, P = 0.001). A trend toward less dyspnea occurred in PHP patients (P = 0.06). Tests of airflow obstruction showed similar results.
Training patients with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease in how to deal with their disease reduced the use of health services and increased knowledge of the illness.
Small-group and individual asthma education programs improved symptom control and patient's understanding and management of their condition
The studies by Wilson and colleagues and Tougaard and colleagues help to effectively focus adult asthma education in clinical practice. Asthma is responsible for a large burden of illness, which is expensive and increasing. Preventable factors are present in most asthma deaths and in severe asthma exacerbations. The problems of adherence and compliance are particularly important in asthma. Many patients fail to follow a management plan because the plan is either rejected or misunderstood. Patient education can identify barriers to compliance and can reinforce correct instructions. These 2 studies identify the types of intervention that can make a difference in asthma. Most patients (89%) in the study by Tougaard and colleagues had asthma, and their use of the term COPD reflects the European tendency to "lump" rather than "split" airway diseases.
The 2 studies describe the content and process of a successful asthma management program. Knowledge of medications and their effects is required to aid compliance with a treatment regimen that optimizes asthma control. Instruction on the management of exacerbations is of paramount importance. This involves the avoidance of substances or situations that trigger asthma and involves the early recognition of deteriorating asthma by monitoring symptoms or peak expiratory flow or both. If exacerbations occur, the patient is instructed to increase bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy because exacerbations increase bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation. The appropriate use of medical services is reinforced, especially when a patient needs to seek help (1).
The way these instructions are conveyed to the patient is crucial. As the study by Wilson and colleagues describes, the educational content must be delivered personally, either one-to-one or in a group setting, and in addition to a physician's usual care. This is a critical point. To improve the quality of care, it is necessary to spend more time on patient education, either during a consultation or at additional visits. These and other studies however, do justify the added time and expense of asthma education for adults (2). Successful programs improve symptom control and can reduce the use of health services (2). Smoking cessation needs to be addressed in education programs. Smoking is associated with inadequate asthma management (3), and smokers may avoid these programs. (4). However, the cost savings in the study by Tougaard and colleagues were greatest with smokers in the intervention group. The role of exercise and rehabilitation has not been defined in asthma but may be important, particularly in severe disease with complicating chronic airflow obstruction.
Targeting patients with at least moderate-to-severe asthma is sensible. Although not yet proven, it would reduce the cost of intervening, probably maximize the benefit, and make best use of limited resources. Suitable patients can be identified from clinics, or, as the study by Tougaard and colleagues shows, identified after hospitalization for nonrespiratory problems. A simple screening tool can be used to identify patients with more severe diseases (5). Ironically, those patients who could benefit most from asthma education may not comply (45% in Wilson's study). Future studies will need to define strategies for these patients (4, 6).
Asthma education, the personal delivery of asthma knowledge and management skills in addition to usual medical care, should now be routine care for adults with asthma.

That sucks big time. It sounds like they've significantly dialed the trout plants back at castaic and casitas already from what I read. Is there not a better place to cut money out of their budget? I would dial back the Gestapo force they have doing boat inspection for the invasive species.
SUMMIT VALLEY — It’s a bit of a head scratcher, really. Silverwood Lake received a 2,000-pound delivery of brown trout from Fillmore Hatchery on Jan. 5, but fishing pressure remained relatively low in the week that followed. Another load of German browns went in on Jan. 11 meaning trout were stocked on back-to-back weeks after issues at Silverwood’s typical supplying hatcheries kept fish plants from happening for over two months. This in what was arguably the most-consistent trout fishery in Southern California during the 2016-17 winter season.
they stocked little browns there to get rid of them because California is quitting stocking browns. What a BUNCH OR MORONS!!!

Thick outfits can reduce the effect of your stun gun on an assailant, so winter-time in certain regions may well make this a significantly less fascinating weapon than others. In Oakland, CA, you're almost certainly alright.
Naturally, you will discover extra intense selections such as a stun gun, which can be used to just take down an assailant, in the event you truly feel the need.
I do think It can be good that you just are considering numerous approaches to safeguard yourself. Lots of people basically wander all-around in fear or avoid unsafe areas completely. Awareness is a large Element of survival.
This is a YOUTUBE video which is worth watching. It goes to one of the basic themes of this blog: the legacy of The Rockefeller’s; but make no mistake about it: The legacy of The Rothschild’s is equally involved but at a much more subtle level:
I’ve been fortunate in having an intriguing dream life without many nightmares; dreams of houses and mansions being the most recurring, however, this morning I woke from a terrifying nightmare! I didn’t wake in sweats or any other form of distress; in fact, I awoke in a usual way.
As I kid I always loved the horror genre! I can remember my mom coming downstairs at 3 AM and I’d be watching Vincent Price! I think it was why I was always fond of Alice Cooper, too!
Anyway, this ancient being was hominoid in stature and had a feral hatred of humanity and it attacked with a vengeance that I’ve seldom seen in the genre! The closest depiction I can think of is Dracula in Bram Stokers movie which is kind of strange because I never found him that scary.
This monster first attacked in a house and then a night later in a field where a massive group of people were trying to get some sleep as they tried to escape its influence–no such luck–it attacked with a fury! At that point, I was back in a room helping to make a greek salad to feed the masses when the beast broke in and that’s when I awoke! ( I’ve always enjoyed the absurdity of dreams:)
One of the books I’ve most enjoyed lately is Jack Caputo’s and Richard Kearney’s, Religion without Religion where they talk about monsters!
It’s worth mentioning that I’m coming off codeine from a nasty bout with my shoulder which caused me the most pain in my life; the codeine has fired up my right hemisphere as I have a non-stop flow of imagery projecting constantly; of course I’m aware of this as I’m a long time casual meditator.
Oh, yes, back to the beast! My impression of it is that it was ancient and had no relation to god. I can’t say it was angelic (fallen) or E.T.; it was what it was–an ancient feral hated. There was no hell attached to this being at all; there was no religious feeling or attachment that came along with it; it was again–an ancient feral hatred of humanity and it was monological in its obsession and focus.
If I was to say which two religious traditions the dream didn’t contradict in the perception of spiritual evil I would say first: Gnosticism and secondly: Buddhism.
I have a long history of observing or watching or witnessing. It’s probably helped activate processes of inductive reasoning. This proclivity leads to seeing patterns.
One pattern I’ve noticed over 30 years is how often ( almost always) the full moon in Vancouver, B.C. will bring clear skies for a day or two. It doesn’t matter how bad the monsoons are the clouds will invariably clear as the moon waxes full! Not every time but often enough to see a pattern. What’s the causal link between a full moon and where I live? I have no idea! Does this observation connect to the next paragraph? No……..
The recent California drought started when Obama came into power during 2007/2008 and has ended precisely when Trump and the Republicans entered the White House!
These coincidences as they pertain to California are consistent with the Pentagon having weather control technology. If one understands the military industrial complex’s mind then the assertion is a long way from being irrational; in fact, it’s completely consistent with the war machines philosophies. To me, there was something consistent with Obama giving Californians endless sunshine while Trump pentagon sends them deluges! Of course, all of this is speculation; but again, it’s completely consistent with their mindset and the flow of geopolitics.
Here is a link to the documentary. It’s well worth watching as it accurately depicts how humans became ‘wallets’ or consumers rather than citizens in a free enlightened society.
They do bring up the first oligarch, John D. Rockefeller, of whom I speak quite frequently on this blog. The omission in this documentary is the flip side of the coin in modernity: The Rothschild’s and their interests! Apparently, as far as this documentary is concerned, this influence in modernity has no relevance whatsoever to the events of the last century, or in net slang, “I dindu nuffin’ ‘”!
The implementation of The Federal Reserve with its fiat currency fractional reserve system. This is a massive influence which the doc. finds not worth mentioning.
Geopolitical manipulations of North America and Europe for the benefit of setting up and maintaining the modern state of Israel.
Turning the military industrial complex into Israel’s patsy. Using N.A. and the E.U. as cannon fodder for the implementation of The Greater Israel Project; especially since 911 which has led to the destabilization of The Middle East–to Israel’s benefit.
at 1:00:29–“IN SHORT MY FELLOW CITIZENS IT CAN BE SAID TO BE NOTHING LESS THAN A HASTY STRIDE TO UNIVERSAL EMPIRE” This is the mythology of The Judaic Messiah ruling all the nations from Jerusalem. This may well be what this totalitarian two-step is all about. Certainly not worth mentioning in this documentary!
Although correlation is not causation the actual occurrence of the invention of modern banking and gun weaponry is indisputable! The world has been a much more violent place usually because of war. I suspect we may get another one much sooner than later!
In a way, this is another coincidence similar to the ones I pointed out in, The Four Convergences. That in a 13.7-year-old universe the invention of modern banking and guns should so uncannily arise at the exact same time.
This post is an addendum to the three part, Who are The Archons series? In that presentation, I suggest that the arrival of money and guns on the planet in the modern era was instigated by the archons!
The world’s first bank on record was the Taula de la Ciutat, which opened in Barcelona in 1401. Banking practices can be traced back to the Roman Empire
It wasn’t until the matchlock gun arrived in the 1400s that guns began to evolve. Apparently, the very first prototype was around 1350; the same time the earliest prototypes for banks were developing.
Oh, I know! I know what you’re going to say! No problem, Mr. Dawkins, you just carry on with your zygotes and phenotypes! This post is for all those Morpheus’s out there! Interesting that Morpheus is also the God of Dreams after the last one I had on this issue.
Angels are somehow in the pro-creation with human business and the lore says this led to corruption and violence and population explosion.
Let’s go over some facts on 6: every religious book in existence is internally and comparatively contradictory! This is indisputable! We know that Gabriel gave contradictory messages to Mary and Mohammed. We can compare The Book of Mormon given by the angel Moroni to The Urantia Book–the only book I know of that claims definitive angelic authorship–and when compared we find nothing but contradictions! This is true of all channeled material, too!
There is only one reasonable conclusion here if angels exist: they are not telling the truth or being instructed not to tell the truth! **I don’t even know where to begin on the latter so we’ll stick with the former. So, all religious books contradict each other– so they cannot be correct in their depiction of angels; that is to say, we cannot discern the truth of the matter from those sources.
These books tell an ancient tale of alternative Christianity–one which was wiped out numerous times by The Roman Catholic Church. This is a matter of the historical record and not an attack on historic Christendom. It is and was what it was. These books tell the tale of an alternate cosmology wherein humans find themselves the prisoners on this planet ruled by gnostic archons–who are light beings beyond human notions of good and evil! They are what they are and this earth is theirs to rule!
The movie, The Matrix, is a modern-day tale of these ancient religious ideas. If angels exist then this is what humanity is dealing with as far as I can tell from my life research into these matters.
One other thing, for now, and we will continue this series at another time: the traditional notion that angels cannot be female comes from books that the archons wrote and control! So you guessed it!
*Post Script: 2 3 4 and 5: all these phenomena are happening in the modern world and are consistent with this speculation.
** Actually, I have developed a cosmology which could explain why God sanctions outright lying by archons. But that is for another time……
CBC has an article today on Peak Oil. I won’t bother linking as the subject is easy enough to find on -line. Oh, where do I start? Well, it has to be John D. Rockefeller– the grifter who brought this product to the modern world! Everything modernity has today can be traced to him and a few others like him. But Rockefeller didn’t grow up in a vacuum– he was matched in ego and tenacity by preceding oligarchs–The Rothschild’s, who’s financial model is predicated on endless growth on a finite planet ( the problem is easy to spot). Everything modernity is today is because of these groups of people. Modernity, however, is premised on another notion: the non-existence of god! i.e. the scientific worldview which sees progress as inevitable. By the way, a part of this view may be how the left brain functions with its strict linear, sequential proclivity; it does not like the chaotic machinations of right brain creativity, but I digress…………..
So this has set up a situation where modern people view life through a godless lens combined with the notion that time is linear and things will simply, as Wayne Gretzky, argues: get better and better and better……Well, not so fast there, Great One! And I won’t be too hard on you for your cognitive dissonance in proclaiming the “obvious rightness of the NHLPA and owners becoming partners” in a socialistic model!( a CBC interview) What’s good for the NHLPA and the owners does not seem at all acceptable to the billions of wage slave workers out there, does it, Wayne? Anyway, the digression is running amuck on this site today!
What am I getting at here? Well, there is only one coherent view of god within the modern worldview and that view is called Pantheism: a view that equates the universe as being god! So an atheist is really a pantheist although there will probably be much humming and hawing at that assertion! The point to take from that, though, is this: the universe and this planet function via natural law as laid out and correctly espoused by scientists in the last 250 years ( as much as we know to date). So in reality, the modern godless worldview is quite incorrect and that there really is a God! Although at this level it certainly isn’t Thor, Apollo, or any of the other mythological gods. So the fact of the matter is the modernists are quite incorrect and there really is a god which has laws which we break at our peril and no handwaving or screaming and shouting by mythical fundamentalists can change this fact: we cannot do anything we want here! One should research The Laws of Thermodynamics as they relate to energy supplies on a finite planet. There will be consequences for faulty understanding. One last point on this : natural law as understood correctly strives for balance and equilibrium within living systems; that is to say that nature strives for equilibrium within all its life systems and species which over-dominate do so at their peril and this is where The Rothschild /Rockefeller one-two punch becomes exceedingly problematic: they are dominator hierarchies on a finite planet and make no mistake about it: they rule the earth today!
So what does this mean? It means that relatively benign business models and fuel sources in 1900 are exceedingly problematic today!
We are now playing a deadly game of Russian Roulette with the planet! This is consistent with the mafia ethos with its concomitant financial casino model for the world. The fact of the matter is the problem of oil is inextricably linked to money in much the same way that The Ring of Power was linked to Sauron! So the energy and financial behemoths are not above exploiting and using coercive tactics when it comes to traditional religion; that is to say, the rise of fundamentalism is probably not an organic event but a tactic of population control ( and situational control) over the issues which these two behemoths face today. It is by no means a given that science can solve these possibly intractable issues and it would be naïve and foolish not to believe that oil and money don’t have contingencies in place in the event that progress doesn’t go ahead as planned. There is a long dysfunctional historic relationship between money oil and religion!
Is there a way out? The sanest way out at the moment would be to downsize the economy by issuing a non-debt currency with a basic income tied to agreements by mass populations to learn to live harmonious lives with natural law. We know this will never happen! That leaves the wild cards:
any new energy source would have to be controlled by the same pathological power structure so even if it solves the issues humans will still be bound to this corrupt hierarchy which seems to be intent on fulfilling their long-held desire to do away with human labour by A.I. ! Where will that leave us in our master/slave relationship to them?
intervention by god! Looking to traditional religion on this one is a waste of time, imo., but panentheism ( the extended version of the correct pantheistic worldview) may offer hope. Because god transcends the material cosmos it is then possible that there could be intervention. I don’t think this would look like any of the traditional narratives and I doubt it would be god per se doing the intervening, but rather lesser manifestations of god!
we are not alone on this planet and alien lifeforms are or could/would be intervening in the affairs of this planet.

I will be heading to Southern Cali for a business trip next month and wrapping things up in Big Bear for this event. Anyone care to join me and represent AZLRO in a big way? Perfect time of year to escape our heat and travel to the cool pines in Big Bear.
We discussed attending this. I won't leave til Friday afternoon though. Of course I said the same thing last year. Always seem to miss this event.
Great idea. This this is a nice event to go to. This year the San Diego club is helping with the event as well, so it should be good size. The trails around Big Bear are absolutely beautiful and shouldn't be missed. And best of all....$40 registration fee...can't beat that!
AZLRO promotes safe off-road driving, supports the "Tread Lightly" program is active in maintaining access for off-road driving as we explore all the great state of Arizona has to offer.
of none other than myself, Am. This blog will be about anything. Updates about my writing, my day, maybe some snippets of my writing. Who knows what this experience will bring?
In 2010, I saw heartbreak, disappointment, and just a bad overall time. There are a few things that happened this past year that ruined me. But, it all started looking up right around Samhain (Halloween for those of you don't understand).
I opened 2010 with happiness and hope. Not knowing what to expect in the coming year. I was hopeful that I would be happy and would find a way to keep the happiness that was surrounding my life. Within days of ringing in the year with my parents and someone I really cared about, for the first time being home for the ball dropping in Times Square. A few days later, my life was turned upside down with heartbreak and disappointment.
Things weren't that great for me at all. Four different occasions of heartbreak, although two did not know they did anything. And one occasion of pure sadness for the year is when my best friend (well, wifey ;D ) left our little town in Connecticut to move to Illinois. (I was really happy that I got to see her over the winter break though!)
Now, for some resolutions. I never really come up with any, I think of them pointless and when I don't succeed, I feel like I failed myself... But this year, I decided to write some. Maybe this year I won't disappoint myself.
#1: Do not go back to my "old self." I don't really feel like explaining this, but some of my friends understand this.
#2: Finish Senior year with good grades. I haven't done so well in the past, so I hope to bring the rest of this year around.
#3: Finish my first novel. I've been working on it for two-ish years now, and it's about time that I get something done.
#4: Lose weight. Eat heatlhier. Gain some self-esteem. These all go together, because they all have to do with how, right now, I don't like how I look.
#6: Find love. Bonus points if it lasts through the end of the year. (Double bonus points if it goes on until 2012)
The only thing I can look to is the future right now, and I hope it will look bright. With graduation in six months and sixteen days (June 17th), and college just a couple months after that, I have to look to the future and be who I want to be. Maybe this year will be the brightest time in my life.
My only regret is not having someone who was very important to me here with me to see me grow into an adult.
And aw! I'm sorry my moving made you so sad. But six-ish months until I see you again?! Unless you hijack with Allison for spring break :P
And, the eating from sadness thing?! OH MAN. We should like work on our weight loss together - inspire each other?! YES.

Following the manufacture of a pesticide technical material (active ingredient, a.i., active substance a.s.) the manufacturer must prepare a formulation to ensure that it can be used in a safe and efficacious manner. In order to do this the technical material is mixed with other ingredients (sometimes called inert ingredients and or co-formulants) to improve its effectiveness, safety, handling and storage. The other ingredients can include solvents, mineral clays, stickers, wetting agents or other adjuvants1,2. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">
Pesticide formulations may contain one or more active ingredients and come in many different variations depending on the nature of the active ingredient and the proposed use. Formulations may be in the form of solids (e.g. dustable powders), liquids (e.g. emulsifiable concentrates) or gases (e.g. fumigants). Formulations of different active ingredients can in some cases be mixed before use, however, this should only be done if it is known that the two formulations are compatible and that there will be no adverse effects due to the mixing of the formulations.
Pesticide formulations may also come ready to use or require dilution before use. In some cases spray adjuvants can be added to the diluted formulation in order to enhance the performance of the pesticide. Adjuvants are usually classified according to their use rather than their chemistry, they include surfactants, crop oils, antifoaming agents, stickers and spreaders3. Care must be taken when adding adjuvants to a given formulation to ensure that there are no compatibility problems which could make the pesticide less effective.
There is an international coding system for the different pesticide types. The codes, together with definitions, are given in the “Catalogue of Pesticide Formulation Types and International Coding System” published by CropLife International 4.
Water Dispersible Granules (Code WG) – a formulation consisting of granules to be applied after disintegration and dispersion in water.
Emulsifiable Concentrate (Code EC) – a liquid, homogeneous formulation to be applied as an emulsion after dilution in water.
Vapour Releasing Product (Code VP) – a formulation containing one or more volatile active ingredients, the vapours of which are released in the air.

Reportedly, in the 1990s, Nicolas Sarkozy was involved in a deal with Pakistan involving large 'bribes'.
The 11 Frenchmen were engineers working with Pakistan to design an Agosta 90B class submarine for the Pakistani Navy.

Infections, hypertension, bleeding disorders and clot-forming conditions increase stroke risk during and after childbirth
Women with preeclampsia, a common complication of pregnancy, face a heightened risk of stroke during pregnancy and postpartum if they have urinary tract infections, chronic high blood pressure or clotting or bleeding disorders, according to a study by Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian researchers. “We have suspected that certain conditions raise the risk of stroke in women with preeclampsia, but few studies have taken a rigorous look at this issue,” said lead author Eliza C. Miller, MD, a postdoctoral vascular neurology fellow in the department of neurology at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. “Since strokes can be so devastating, it is critical to know whether these are just random events or due to modifiable risk factors.”

A couple of months ago, I wrote in this column about some of the peculiar names I have encountered while broadcasting games at the AHSAA’s Final 48. There are all kinds unusually placed apostrophes and multiple spellings for common names like Stacey or Brandy littered throughout that tournament’s programs.
This month I want to take that name theme a little further and write about some of the more interesting ones in sports history. Considering how many times I get the “Luke…I am your father” routine, I have always had an affinity for less popular monikers.
For example, as an NBA enthusiast back in the mid-1980s, I may have been the only kid in Tallapoosa County with a World B. Free poster.
Oh, you have never heard of World B. Free? It’s cool. Despite the badass name, his fame never really took off to Jordan-esque heights (which is ironic considering he was also dubbed, “The Prince of Midair.”)
Free (born Lloyd Bernard Free) was a 16-year pro-ball vet who had more than a few seasons of hovering near the NBA’s scoring lead. Unfortunately for Free, he was probably born too early to enjoy the notoriety he deserved.
Free should really get more credit for re-naming himself since it was the 70s and all. His self-labeled nickname seems much more organic and original than the current NBA’s copycat Ron Artest and his relatively recent change to Metta World Peace.
Free is cool and errythang, but there are a lot more names that are more creative, funnier, or just flat unfortunate.
Perhaps you enjoy a more regal title. How does God Shammgod strike you? As a high school superstar (who ironically played on the same team as Ron Artest), he was known as “Shammgod Wells.” However, upon attending Providence College in 1995, he had to either use his first name of “God” or legally change it. Since he did not have the $600 to go through that process, God Shammgod is what he went by from that moment forward.
“God” is a bit much? How about Florida Atlantic footballer “Yourhighness Morgan” then? This name works as both pro-royalty and pro-marijuana legalization purposes.
What about “Chief Kickingstallionsisms” who balled at Alabama State not too long ago? At 7’ 1” and 255 pounds, the only thing bigger than him was his personalized license plate. I guess “Chief” was easier to deal with than his real name of “GrlenntyaGrlenntya.” That guy had to be hell in a spelling bee.
While on the subject of the more empiric titles, I suppose Captain Munnerlyn, Majestic Mapp, and Napoleon Outlaw do deserve honorable mentions. Oddly (or not so oddly), Majestic’s brother’s name is “Scientific.” Not kidding.
I’ll also add Danger Fourpence, a former Zimbabwean soccer player, to this list. It’s not necessarily regal, but it is a little British in that it sounds like he should be plotting to blow up the moon in a James Bond movie.
But I know what you are looking for when it comes to outlandish designations: Names that can be sexually suggestive.
It’s almost too easy to begin with NASCAR’s Dick Trickle or baseball’s Dick Pole. Those two aren’t even close to the worst names though. Chubby Cox, Dick Paradise, and Wang Liqin may feel they have it a little worse.
I will start even more obscurely, though, and slide right into Fabian Assman (wait… there has to be a better way to type that.)
Kramer may have made “The Assman” popular on Seinfeld in the 90s, but it was Fabian Assman who played goalkeeper in Argentina. His opponents say nothing gets by him easy. Unless, of course, it is rich in fiber.
Then there is Urban Shocker. Mr. Shocker was a star on the baseball diamond back in the early 1920s. Luckily for him, he didn’t live long enough for his name to become the star of many a dirty joke.
Wide receiver Fair Hooker has an interesting title. But if you are going to be a “Hooker,” people will appreciate your being “Fair.”
Meanwhile, I can only say the opposite for former St. Louis Cardinal Stubby Clapp. Having “Clapp” is bad enough; you have to be “Stubby,” too? That’s almost as bad as former Atlanta Falcon Siff Phlyss or golfer Gonn E. Rhea. (OK, I made those up, but Stubby Clapp was very real.)
So the next time you want to complain to your parents about naming you Normie or Exa Emma, try to remember that things could be worse. You may have had to do banana-fana-fo-fana with “Wonderful Terrific Monds, Jr.”
Things have gotten pretty scary these days for us women, I have to say. I don’t know if you have read any of the news headlines recently, or any magazine articles specifically aimed at women “of a certain age,” but they all seem to say that once a woman turns 50, she completely disappears from society. From what I’ve heard, women the age of 50 and over are completely overlooked by the fashion designers, advertisers, the beauty industry, the movie industry, television shows, magazines…in fact, all of society at large. And, oh yes, we are also invisible to men.
Actually, I find that this isn’t completely true. I am constantly being bombarded with advertising for products that want to help me hide the fact that I am growing older. I’m not sure if they want to help me hide this fact from myself or hide myself from society, but there is definitely a theme to all of this.
“They” have created a narrative that is a constant refrain playing out in all the advertisements, entertainment and media that we consume. That theme is “Anti-Aging.” It actually goes beyond that. Society is apparently against women aging. What else does “Anti-Aging” mean? It literally means “No Aging.” And, “Against Aging.” It’s no longer enough to “age gracefully,” but we must not actually age at all. This is, of course, just for women. If I do dare to actually “age,” then the least I could do is have the courtesy to hide the fact.
All of this came clearly into view for me one evening when I was thinking about an article I had recently read on Huff/Post50 about how middle-age women just don’t seem to be noticed, how we are overlooked by, well, everyone. I just couldn’t understand it until one night when I was going through my regular “beauty routine” and happened to notice all the products I was using. I suddenly realized that they were all “bleaching creams” and “lightening” lotions and “vanishing” potions, to “minimize,” “visibly reduce” and “fade” all age-related wrinkles, lines, dark spots, dark circles, uneven skin tone, yellowing teeth, dark and stormy stray hairs and, well, basically, everything about me. Which is very unfortunate as I am just now finally beginning to get comfortable in my own skin. Now they want to make me disappear!
Then one night when I was flipping channels on the television I saw one of those infomercials that was promising to completely eliminate my sagging neck, and my creapey, veiny skin.
It’s enough to make you want to go into hiding. Actually, the cosmetics industry is more than happy to help us with that, too. And, we willingly play along.
All day long we wear our make-up masks to hide our aging faces. We try to cover up the laugh lines and age spots with products sold to us by advertisers hungry for our money and who make us feel that our self worth is tied up in looking our best. Apparently that is only achieved by using all the make-up, and skin care, and beauty products that help us cover up our age. Then at night it is time for us to remove our mask of meticulously applied make-up with even more products created to help repair all the effects of the makeup, and time and sun and gravity and living, overnight, while we sleep. All so we can wake looking refreshed, but not refreshed enough. So we must go through the whole cover up process again the next day.
It doesn’t stop with our faces. It seems to be a problem with every part of our bodies. There are entire industries created to help us get rid of unwanted pounds and inches and promise to reduce us down whole sizes or more. I’m not sure who it is that doesn’t want the pounds and inches but they must be gotten rid of at any cost.
It’s a good thing we have all those undergarments to squeeze ourselves into until it cuts off our oxygen supply. At least we won’t be showing those unsightly extra pounds we are carrying around that are so difficult to lose the older we get.
Luckily, there is an endless amount of options available for medications that can help us with that, too. All you have to do is turn on the television and you will be inundated with an array of pharmaceutical options to help you feel better about the fact that you have another birthday coming up this year.
The fact is, we can play hide-and-seek with our youth and our looks and make ourselves crazy trying to fight a losing battle, but time marches on. It’s pretty scary stuff. I think I will go put on my beauty mask.•

HUD Secretary joins HACA for Grand Opening of Education and Training Center | Austin Pathways | HACA
The Housing Authority of the City of Austin (HACA) and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Julián Castro today (Nov. 21) hosted a ribbon cutting ceremony for the agency’s new Henry Flores Education and Training Center at Meadowbrook Apartments, 1201 A. W Live Oak St.
“Brainpower is the currency of success in the 21st century global economy. The comprehensive training and resources now available will transform lives and uplift families,” said HUD Secretary Julián Castro. “Equipped with classrooms, a library, an outdoor amphitheater and green space for events, this center will cultivate community and a knowledge-based culture.”
The Flores Center, named in honor of HACA’s former Chairman who retired in 2013 after serving on HACA’s Board of Commissioners for 14 years, will help build resident self-sufficiency and serve as a community learning hub. The building is HACA’s first new construction in two decades.
“This new building is a cornerstone of HACA’s effort to move public housing residents to true self-sufficiency,” said HACA President & CEO Michael Gerber. “Children will have opportunities for after-school programs, a new Boys and Girls Club and other educational programs; adults will have a range of programs from job and skills training to parenting and financial literacy classes.”
In 2011, HACA was awarded $1.74 million in funds through the HUD Capital Fund Education and Training Community Facilities program to support the construction of an innovative learning facility in south Austin.
In addition, Google Fiber contributed a combined donation of $60,000 in support of digital inclusion to Austin Pathways, a nonprofit organization that supports HACA programming. Part of the donation included 25 refurbished desktop systems and 15 refurbished laptop computers.
In addition to the Boys and Girls Club housed onsite at the Flores Center, numerous other community-based partners will provide a range of services for the public housing community:
• Skillpoint Alliance – science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) youth programs and workforce training
• Austin Independent School District – Travis High School monthly parent group and other collaborations with the local schools

I'm Keith, and for the next year, I'll be living and working at the South Pole. I don't quite know what to expect, but with a 6 month long night, regular auroras, and temperatures which dip to -80C, it should be interesting.
There are two primary factors that mark life here at pole as completely different from life in the real world. The first of these is the year-long day, with only a single sunrise and sunset per year. The second is the cold. I've gone on at length over the past four months about the night, but haven't delved too much into the many effects of the cold.
By and large, no machinery works cold. Anything with moving parts takes oil or grease, and there doesn't appear to be any grease which won't freeze solid by -90F. We aren't allowed to take vehicles outside below -80F, not for fear of damage to the engine - running keeps it warm enough - but because if stopped for any length of time they tend to freeze solid to the ground.
As far as SPT goes, the telescope's primary motors are kept warm inside the building (which is heated by waste heat from our electronics, supplemented with heat from the DSL furnace), while the smaller ones sit in the receiver cab on the end of the secondary arm, kept warm by a battery of electric heaters. Without heat, the telescope is dead in the water, just like everything else down here.
With that as preface, at 3am this past Sunday, the telescope lost power. The alarms failed, and Sunday is the one day of the week both Dana and I tend to sleep in a couple of hours. The telescope was without power for 6 hours before we discovered the problem, by which time, it was cold. Very cold. The building and main motors were slightly below freezing, while the entire receiver cab had dropped to -80F.
At that point, simply restoring the power wasn't an option - motors would turn back on and seize, hard drives would fail, fans would stall - in essence, everything breaks if powered up cold.
Instead, the cab needed to be reheated before powering anything back up. That set up a bit of a catch-22 - the heaters are electric, but we couldn't restore power until things were warm again. Worse, the fans on the heaters were all frozen, so powered heaters were likely to melt or catch fire.
Well, after much crawling in and out of the emergency hatch on the back of the cab (the main doors require the cab to be docked against the building, which in turn requires that the motors in the cab be functional), flipping breakers, disconnecting electronics, and fiddling with heaters, we finally got things warming up. Six hours later, the cab was up to freezing, and we were able to begin turning stuff back on.
Several systems came online relatively easily, while others did not. Some metals' resistances drop precipitously when deep frozen, with the result that several of our external heating systems cannot be turned on cold - if you try, they draw too much current and trip a breaker. They work fine once warm, but again, that makes for somewhat of a catch-22. Many of our electronics failed to initialize properly cold, and had to be reset several times as they gradually warmed up from different systems coming online.
Last night at 3am, fully four days after losing power, we finally got everything back online and were able to resume normal observations. It's been a hectic week, all because an alarm didn't go off, and the temperature outside was so cold. This is the sort of thing that makes life and work down here so different from the real world.
With everything back online, it's been amazing to look up from our work and suddenly realize how bright it's been getting outside. The sunrise is starting to feel rather imminent.

The Iranian state-controlled Persian media outlets were filled with warnings and alarm this week. Iranian leaders sent messages to North Korea and lashed out at US President Donald Trump with respect to the Singapore summit.
Iran reacted swiftly to the Trump-Kim summit, with the IRNA news agency quoting the regime’s spokesman Mohammad Bagher Nobakht as saying: “We don’t know what type of person the North Korean leader is negotiating with. It is not clear that he would not cancel the agreement before returning home.”
It is interesting that, while Iranian leaders repeatedly warn other countries, leaders and international organizations not to interfere in Iran’s decisions regarding both domestic and foreign policy issues, Tehran is blatantly interfering in North Korea’s decision to negotiate with the US.
Another paradox that also highlights the Iranian regime’s double standards and hypocrisy is linked to the objective of the US-North Korea summit in light of the vehement opposition of the clerical establishment of Iran to the historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un. On the one hand, the objective of this historic summit was nuclear disarmament. On the other hand, the Iranian regime frequently claims that Tehran is not pursuing a path to obtaining nuclear bombs and that it is opposed to nuclear weaponization for religious reasons.
Just a few days after the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei delivered a speech putting significant emphasis on his fatwa against nuclear weapons: “The Americans say they stopped Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. They know it’s not true. We had a fatwa (religious ruling) declaring nuclear weapons to be religiously forbidden under Islamic law. It had nothing to do with the nuclear talks.”
Iran's authorities are deeply concerned they have lost a long-time friend and ally in North Korea to their long-time enemy, the US.
So, if the ruling mullahs are truly against the supply or deployment of nuclear weapons, why is the regime so robustly standing against the US and North Korea’s agreement, efforts and pledges to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula while Washington provides security guarantees to North Korea? Many people would wonder that such an objective ought to be totally in compliance with Khamenei’s declared fatwa of denuclearization. But Khamenei’s fatwa was most likely the exploitation of religion in order to conduct a tactical and political move, while hiding Iran’s nuclear ambitions.
In addition, Iran’s opposition to such a historic agreement for nuclear disarmament suggests that Tehran is against denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the advancement of peace, security and stability across the world.
Furthermore, Iran’s strong opposition to the rapprochement between the US and North Korea is due to several other reasons.
To begin with, from the Iranian leaders’ perspective, a nuclearized North Korea has been a model to follow for a long time. In fact, Khamenei clearly expressed in a speech why countries that give up their nuclear programs are irrational. Khamenei, who has the final say on major matters of state, previously blamed Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi for giving up his nuclear program and pointed out that Gaddafi’s decision was the paramount factor in his later overthrow. He pointed out after Gaddafi’s fall that the deposed dictator had earlier “wrapped up all his nuclear facilities, packed them on a ship and delivered them to the West and said, ‘Take them’.”
As a result, Iranian leaders have long viewed North Korea as a real example of how and why a country must possess nuclear weapons, not only as a deterrent against “enemies,” but also as a powerful tool to easily pursue the country’s hegemonic ambitions. But the US-North Korea summit has shattered Iran’s argument.
In addition, it is critical to point out that, to Iranian leaders’ eyes, the North Koreans were capable of defying the international community, even frequently conducting nuclear tests without concern about foreign intervention, simply due to the fact Pyongyang is already a nuclear state. Therefore, Iran viewed the North Korean model as an example of how a nuclear program and weapons can bring political success and advance a state’s ambitions.
In addition, for Iranian leaders, North Korea is one of its staunchest allies on the global stage; a nuclear state that would come to the regime’s aid in case it was caught red-handed violating international laws or was pressured by the international community. If North Korea follows up with a nuclear disarmament treaty, Tehran will lose a powerful partner in international politics.
Finally, the “special bond” and the agreement between North Korea and the US is the second significant blow to the Iranian regime this year, after the decision of the Trump administration to withdraw from the JCPOA. Iranian authorities are deeply concerned that they have lost a long-time friend and ally in North Korea to their long-time enemy, the “Great Satan.” This can potentially shift the balance of power against the mullahs. But this does not mean that the Iran regime will halt its attempts at interfering in this historic agreement and the improving relationship between North Korea and the US.

President Trump To End 1 Federal Grant Program That Helps Sanctuary Cities, Instantly Saves Taxpayers Millions
The liberals would like to believe that some of the shake up in the White House staff is indicative of a president who has lost control. The demise of the Trump administration has been greatly exaggerated, and its difficulties overemphasized in order to create a picture the left and its allies in the mainstream media want to portray.
There have been some bumpy times. Perhaps the president should have spent less time reaching out to more mainstream Republicans such as Priebus and stuck with his gut beliefs by hiring people who were solidly in his court, believed in his agenda, and could be counted on to faithfully and competently pursue it without the president having a second thought about issues of loyalty.
In spite of the friction that has existed between the president and Attorney General Sessions over Mr. Sessions’ decision to recuse himself from matters relating to the alleged Russia scandal, Sessions is solidly pursing the Trump agenda with regard to immigration policy as well as other law enforcement issues. In fact, he is getting ready to pull the plug on funding for sanctuary cities that refused to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. This is really upsetting the liberals which is always a good sign.
“The Department of Justice announced last week that sanctuary jurisdictions will lose access to certain federal law enforcement grants in 2017 if they prohibit officials from communicating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, if they block ICE from interviewing jail inmates, or if they fail to notify ICE of the pending release of criminal aliens ICE is seeking to deport.
“These particular grants, known as the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, are the largest source of federal criminal justice funds for state, local, and tribal authorities.
“This move is helping fulfill one early promise of the Trump administration: to impose consequences on the most egregious of the more than 300 sanctuary jurisdictions.”
Sessions is quite aware that there is no better way to get the attention of liberal politicians than to cut off their funds that they use to buy votes with lavish welfare programs. Take away the left’s money, and the movement collapses as it has no reasonable or even workable philosophical basis for its existence. Put more bluntly,the left exists because of its ability to buy votes using government funded benefits and by pursuing identity politics. Not a very admirable basis for a political movement.
“Under the new rules announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, these four top grant-getters (New York City; Cook County, Illinois; Los Angeles; and Philadelphia) are likely to be disqualified from these grants in the future if they maintain their current policies toward ICE.
Of course, $10 million spread over these four jurisdictions is not a lot of money. More than that is probably passed around under the table on a slow week. Nevertheless, it will get their attention.
“Ten sanctuaries are already at risk of debarment based on an initiative launched last year by Rep. John Culberson, R-Texas, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that controls the Justice Department’s budget.
“Last year, the department notified 10 of the worst sanctuaries that their Justice Department law enforcement grants could be pulled if they did not come into compliance with the federal law prohibiting sanctuary policies.
“The jurisdictions are California; Connecticut; Cook County, Illinois; Chicago; Milwaukee County; New York City; New Orleans; Philadelphia; Miami-Dade County, Florida; and Las Vegas.”
At least one jurisdiction saw the light and decided to wise up and flight right: “A few months later, Miami-Dade County reversed its sanctuary policy and began cooperating fully with ICE.” Good for them. Sounds like a great place to reward with some extra tourism this winter.
While being advocates for states’ rights, it remains a fact of law that the federal government is responsible for enforcing the federal laws pertaining to immigration. States and local jurisdictions have no right to impede, obstruct, or refuse cooperation with such federal law enforcement activities.
If we are not going to take state and local leaders and arrest them for obstruction of justice, we can at least make sure they don’t financially profit from their rebellion. Mr. Sessions is in the process of doing just that. And it’s way past time to do so.

This tablet doesn’t have market app. installed on it. You’re saying that we can install market APK file. Where can I download market apk file?
I know of 4-5 sites that have had it (not test samples) in stock for $129 since Jan 14th & already shipped them out on the 19th. But since then they have gone up in price to $159 now

Neuroscientists have developed an efficient and reliable method of analyzing brain activity to detect autism in children. The researchers recorded and analyzed dynamic patterns of brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) to determine the brain's functional connectivity - that is, its communication from one region to another. MEG measures magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in neurons of the brain.

Van Eck is a Dutch family business which was set up in 1912. Within the entire Van Eckorganization, around 150 people are busy working on the construction and maintenanceof the latest road transport means. Beesd is the operational base for the developmentand manufacturing of all new vehicles, whereas maintenance and repairs as well asbodyshop work are carried out in the branches of Lexmond and Schiphol. The designand manufacturing of all products is entirely tailored to the wishes of the customer. Ourproduction line consists of semi-trailers, trailers and trucks. A total of approximately 500custom-made vehicles are delivered each year.
Our organization has all disciplines in-house, ranging from research and production toafter sales. Van Eck is unique in the market, as they are the only Dutch company in thesector that manufactures its own chassis and bodyworks and that customizes andinstalls refrigerating units. As a result, Van Eck is able to quickly respond to changes inthe market. Thanks to our creativity and 3D engineering, our position in both thedomestic and exporting market is strong. More than 55% of our products are soldoutside the Netherlands in more than 14 European countries.
The vehicles of Van Eck are the result of a consistent innovation strategy. The maintheme therein is our continuous quest to increase loading capacity and produce CO2-reducing transport solutions. Partly by applying new technologies, Van Eck helps carriersto meet both the economic requirements and the increasingly stricter legislation as wellas the social pressure in the field of the environment. Within this context, Van Eckbelieves that caring for the environment is a perpetual duty towards future generations.This belief forms an important guideline in the activities of the Van Eck Group.
By applying sustainable materials, our vehicles last extremely long. This means that thesavings on the total costs throughout the life cycle of the trailers far exceed the slightlyhigher investment costs. Furthermore, a long life cycle means less consumption ofrelatively scarce raw materials, which is better for the environment.

Wagtail, Virginia, the top pet-friendly getaway in the United States, is gearing up for a howling good Halloween—until a spooky murder shakes the town to its core...
Holly Miller doesn’t believe in spirits, but the Sugar Maple Inn is filled with guests who do. The TV series in development, Apparition Apprehenders, has descended on Wagtail’s annual Halloween festivities to investigate supernatural local legends, and Holly has her hands full showing the ghost hunters a scary-fun time.
But the frights turn real when Holly’s Jack Russell, Trixie, and kitten, Twinkletoes, find a young woman drowned in the Wagtail Springs Hotel’s bathhouse—the spot of the town’s most infamous haunting. The crime scene is eerily similar to the creepy legend, convincing Holly that the death wasn’t just accidental. Now she’ll have to race to catch a flesh-and-blood killer—before someone else in town gives up the ghost...
The Net Neutrality regulations, according to our government, will give us a free and open Internet by granting them the power to regulate it. Wait… what? Isn’t the internet already free and open. So just what is this proposed Net Neutrality plan? Well that is the problem. Nobody seems to know for sure. The FCC has made it clear that they will not release the 332 page plan to “regulate” the Internet until after the agency votes on it. does that make you think of Nancy Pelosi’s infamous statement about the Affordable Care Act: Congress had to pass it for Americans to learn what it would do. Trust me when I say this…. This is bad for the Internet! Sooner or later, under FCC regulation of the Internet, there will be “regulatory capture”—large established firms exploiting regulations to suppress the emergence of small, creative startups. Because it will be impossible for the FCC to keep close tabs on thousands of Internet companies, they will find it expedient to limit the number of participants, finding it easier to oversee a few large corporations than countless smaller ones. Think of the investment implications here: Who knows how many would-be startups that might have become the next Facebook or Twitter may be strangled in their cribs by FCC regulators? Think of all the new millionaires that won’t be created. Successful investing in the Internet will be influenced greatly by which companies the FCC’s policies favor, meaning that the homework needed to discover which companies have the best business plan may not be as important as following what the FCC regulators do. Our entire system of government is owned and ran by politicians who pass legislation according to who is giving them the most money. And after seeing how government runs our healthcare, medicare and social security, do you really want them taking over the Internet? They can’t deliver our mail without going broke. Furthermore, imagine the power they have now and times it by a billion. We could easily see content being blocked, regulated and manipulated. Especially if it helps government and their agenda. How about reelection time? They could push whatever agenda they want right to your desktop. They already do this to us on our TV’s. Net neutrality wants to stop companies from assigning priorities to Internet traffic. The problem is, prioritization is the most elementary and necessary feature of economic activity and free markets. In a world of finite... read more
Nothing makes me more angry than seeing videos of police using force and intimidation on innocent people. A man driving through an Illinois checkpoint attempted to exercise his Constitutional rights to question officers on whether he was being detained or free to go. The first Illinois State Police officer remained calm, especially considering the driver had informed him he was being recorded from the get-go. But a second officer who walked up to the car after the initial exchange, only to hear the man telling the cop that it was an unconstitutional stop, became so enraged that he yanked the door open and began yelling in his face. This officer doesn’t even know the law he is supposed to uphold. Driving is not a privilege. Travelling is a right, AND LOCK YOUR DOORS! “Even the legislature has no power to deny to a citizen the right to travel upon the highway and transport his property in the ordinary course of his business or pleasure, though this right may be regulated in accordance with the public interest and convenience.” Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 169 NE 22. (“Regulated” here means traffic safety enforcement: stop lights, signs, etc.) “The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit at will, but a common right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” Thompson v. Smith, 154 SE 179. “The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the 5th Amendment.” Kent v. Dulles, 357 US 116, 125. “Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to move from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the 14th amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution.” Schactman v. Dulles, 96 App DC 287, 293. Just saying he is wrong and a stupid road side thug. Are you awake Yet?

Bringing about change in how our public servants treat us can only take place if YOU start to understand and insert your rights. Civil disobedience is one way to effect this change. It is very important to understand that the 5th Amendment protects the innocent more than the guilty. Knowing how to assert your rights is not only a good idea to prevent from being unlawfully kidnapped or caged, but it is also a successful catalyst for change when applied on a large enough scale. Remember, “Everything you say can and will be held against you.” This video shows how to properly remain silent during police interactions. It is as simple as stating, “I do not answer questions.” Because of the SCOTUS ruling in Salinas v. Texas, you are now expected to know that you have a right against self-incrimination, and unless you specifically and clearly invoke this right, anything you say or do not say, including your mannerisms at the time you stop talking, can be used against you. You actually have to say, “I do not answer questions.” Don’t concern yourself with what kind of interrogation you’re in. Don’t worry about whether Salinas applies in your particular situation. Just invoke your 5th Amendment right immediately, verbally, and clearly. Being stopped by police can be a particularly stressful experience. An innocent individual can easily get tricked into self-incriminating themselves as the police officer badgers and pries for information. Memorizing laws and and statutes can go a long way, however, having a business card handy, that states your rights for you, is much more convenient, especially when under the stress of a police stop. Side 1 “I hereby invoke and refuse to waive all of the following rights and privileges afforded to me by the United States Constitution. I invoke and refuse to waive my 5th Amendment right to Remain Silent. I invoke and refuse to waive my 6th Amendment right to an attorney of my choice. I invoke and refuse to waive my 4th Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. If I am not presently under arrest, or under investigatory detention, please allow me to leave.” Side 2 “Officer, I Assert My Fifth Amendment Rights As Stated On This Card” Pursuant to the law, as established by the United States Supreme Court, my lawyer has advised me not to talk to anyone and not to answer questions about any pending criminal case or any... read more
Please watch the video below after you finish reading this blog. You won’t believe the nerve of these police officers. A mother and father were on their way home with their 2 week old baby when they were stopped by police officers. Andre Stockett, the father and the passenger in the vehicle, and the man who took the video, has a good understanding of his rights when dealing with police. And you should as well. Despite the police pulling over the vehicle, for an alleged “traffic violation,” they do nothing to the driver. Her license is run and it comes back valid so they have nothing on them, yet like bullies on the playground they begin ganging up on Stockett. Stockett has committed no crime and has not been suspected of committing a crime, so he lawfully refuses to identify himself. You do not have to identify yourself as a passenger in a car. Period! However, this assertion of his rights does not go over well with the bullies on the playground, so Officer Denny throws a temper tantrum. The K-9 unit is brought in. Remember, K-9’s are not only often poorly trained, they are frequently wrong. They can also be taught to alert on cue. Stockett says that he does not consent to any searches, which is well within his rights. However, Officer Denny knows how to avert these rights; bring in the drug dog. Unfortunately in Illinois v. Caballes, the Supreme Court ruled that police do not need reasonable suspicion to use drug dogs to sniff a vehicle during a legitimate traffic stop and that a drug dog alerting to a vehicle allows them to search it. Can you see how this can go wrong? Stockett could have contended that this was no longer a “legitimate traffic stop” but it seems that nothing was going to stop these jackboots from arresting someone. After the dog allegedly ‘alerted’ to the vehicle, Stockett and his wife are told to get out of the vehicle. When they refuse, because they have a 2 week old infant in the back seat, these thugs threaten to take their baby! At this point in the video, if your blood is not boiling you are not a human being. The police continue to make up new reasons why they were pulled over and why they are being detained/arrested. It is absolutely infuriating. The asininity peaks when officer Denny backtracks and tells the family that... read more
Merck is currently facing serious allegations in regards to the efficacy of its MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine. The claims are put forth by two former Merck scientists-turned-whistleblowers, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski, who filed a False Claims Act complaint in 2010, along with a senior Centre for Disease Control (CDC) scientist by the name William Thompson. The complaint claim that they “witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine’s efficacy findings.” According to the court documents Merck’s misconduct is occurring in many different ways including: Failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented Manipulated testing methodology Abandoned undesirable test results Falsified test data Failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine Falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling Falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA Falsely certified compliance with the terms of the (Centre for Disease Control) CDC purchase contract Mislabeled, misbranded and falsely certified its mumps vaccine and The suit also alleges: “As the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is by far the largest financial victim of Merck’s fraud. But the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with any level of protection against mumps. Merck’s Dismissal Attempt Denied. U.S. District judge threw out Merck’s dismissal attempts earlier this month, which means that this pharmaceutical giant will have to defend itself in at least two Federal court cases. Something To Consider These whistleblowers gave up everything to share this information – their jobs, their credibility, and their reputation. What would they have to gain from falsifying any of this information? They were directly involved in this cover-up and decided to speak out and share the truth. I think it is very important that we pay attention to what they are trying to say. When you really think about it, these are some pretty serious allegations put forth by former Merck and CDC employees, and this is some pretty big news. Why isn’t this information being reported in mainstream news? The media seems to hold a very one-sided view of vaccinations and they aren’t interested in reporting anything that may appear to delegitimize their... read more
Yep you read that correctly. SEVEN TRILLION dollars – for the first time ever. And those of us who’ve worked in finance before know that that is a seriously watered-down number. Any publicly announced stat is always ‘massaged’ to be more palatable. But is it all really that bad. That’s the thing that drives me batty about economists. Economics is more theory than science and every announcement or proclamation is colored by the economist’s agenda. Numbers is numbers right? Why wouldn’t $7 trillion dollars of debt be a good thing?

Judge Dennis Davis described attitudes to wealth taxes as appalling. - AIDC | Alternative Information & Development Centre
Home › Campaigns to Dismantle Corporate Power › Judge Dennis Davis described attitudes to wealth taxes as appalling.
“I find it shocking there are people telling me we can’t increase estate duty, capital gains tax shouldn’t be higher, that the marginal tax rate shouldn’t increase. Why not? Quite frankly, we should be paying more tax and we should be spending more [on the poor],” he said.
Referring to the narrative of white monopoly capital, Davis said capital knows no race. “People who accumulate vast money and wealth struggle to understand the plight of the heaps under them.”
Davis recently told a conference on tax evasion, hosted by the Alternative Information Development Centre, that the biggest problem facing the country was the “erosion of the integrity of Sars”. Sars has subsequently called for Davis’s removal.

Exhibiting know-how and innovation, U.S. manufacturers are adding to their payrolls and economic growth across the nation. We have identified 19 states where manufacturing is leading the way...
Manufacturing is the backbone of America. It’s in our blood. Americans know how to build — it’s how we forged a nation, won two world wars, put men on the moon, and shaped the “new economy.” American workers are among the most productive in the world. With new advances in technology, lean manufacturing techniques, and best practices, American manufacturing is becoming cost-competitive with offshore locations, resulting in more companies bringing their operations back to the United States (or near-shoring to Mexico).
According to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), American manufacturing continues to improve. The ISM recently reported that manufacturing activity expanded in January 2013 for the second consecutive month and that the overall national economy grew for the 44th consecutive month. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) registered 53.1 percent, an increase of 2.9 percent from December’s value of 50.2 percent. All five PMI component indices registered above 50 percent in January — including employment, one of the most critical indicators.
The PMI employment index jumped from 51.9 percent to 54.0 percent in January 2013. This is especially significant because manufacturing companies learned how to be incredibly efficient during the Great Recession, doing more with far less — this means manufacturers are reaching their limits and must hire more to keep up with new orders.
So, which are the top manufacturing states that are leading us out of recession? We compiled this list from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) November 2012 rankings for the top 10 states in total manufacturing jobs and the top 10 for manufacturing’s share of non-farm employment, as well as the National Association of Manufacturers’ top 10 states for manufacturing’s share of GSP (2011).
This simple approach identified 19 states that are leading the U.S. in manufacturing prosperity: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Wisconsin. Shared traits include a diversified manufacturing base, positive business climate, flexible incentive packages, outstanding work force development programs, and highly proactive local and state governments that support manufacturing. Below are manufacturing snapshots of each state that show how they are strengthening their industries and contributing to our national economic recovery.
Key manufacturing sectors in Alabama are aerospace/defense, automotive, agricultural products/food distribution, metals, forestry products, chemicals, biosciences, and information technology. Much of the state’s manufacturing output is exported — in fact, 2012 was a record-breaking year with $19.5 billion in exported goods, an increase of almost 10 percent over 2011. “This shows that Alabama’s economy continues to improve and we are making gains in exporting to countries all over the world,” says Governor Robert Bentley. “The products made in Alabama are second to none, and we have a world-class work force.”
The high quality of Alabama workers reflects the state’s investment in work force training. Alabama Industrial Development Training (AIDT) services are free for employers or trainees. The Alabama Technology Network (ATN) of the Alabama Community College System also works closely with companies to provide the skill sets they need.
Alabama’s automotive manufacturing industry, with three major automotive assembly plants, three auto engine plants, and nearly 400 auto suppliers, is a big contributor to the state’s overall economy. Alabama’s top automakers (Mercedes-Benz, Honda, and Hyundai) together produced more than 880,000 vehicles in 2012, a 17 percent increase from 2011 and a new state record. As a result, Mercedes is expanding its assembly lines and hiring about 1,000 more employees to manufacture the C-Class sedan. Honda is expanding to produce the Acura MDX, and Hyundai has added a third shift that it expects to run all year.
“It is very encouraging to see our automakers reinvest in their operations by updating their equipment and expanding the capacity of their production lines,” comments Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce Greg Canfield.
Arkansas continues to diversify its manufacturing base by adding advanced manufacturing jobs. Top sectors are food and beverage, paper, transportation, machinery, wood products, chemicals, plastics and rubber, and apparel.
Arkansas’ highly skilled work force and favorable business climate, combined with its research and education opportunities, make the state an attractive location for manufacturing. Arkansas’ workers continue to impress employers with their work ethic, skills, productivity, and low turnover rates. Arkansas’ labor force is projected to grow by 4 percent by 2015.
The Arkansas Economic Development Commission (AEDC), working with other state agencies, offers a Career Readiness Certificate for potential employees, which documents their skills for prospective employers.
This productive manufacturing environment continues to attract big projects, such as Big River Steel’s announcement it will build a $1 billion steel mill in Mississippi County that will employ about 500 workers. Big River will produce steel for the automotive, oil and gas, and electrical energy industries. The company cited the high-quality work force, geographic location, well-developed transportation infrastructure, availability of reliable electrical power, and helpfulness of state and local government as the major reasons it selected Arkansas.
“A project of this scope will be a catalyst for job creation, investment, and economic development beyond this one facility,” says Governor Mike Beebe. “Building Big River Steel will mean up to 2,000 construction jobs and it will help us recruit more supplier businesses and steel consumers to Northeast Arkansas.”

Kraton Performance Polymers, Inc., a leading global innovator and producer of styrenic block copolymers and other engineered polymers, opened its new Kraton Innovation Center in Belpre, Ohio. The modular design of the new pilot plant allows room for future expansion.
Combined, the new pilot facility and the existing Belpre manufacturing plant employ nearly 600 employees and contractors, making Kraton one of the largest employers in the Mid-Ohio Valley area.
According to the firm, this pilot facility allows Kraton to manufacture a wide range of SBC-type materials in quantities ranging from 25 kilograms to 50 metric tons. The facility and its high-technology process equipment broadens the company's abilities in polymeric chemistry by leveraging unique, less traditional monomers and building blocks to meet customer needs and create innovative applications.
“This new ability to generate developmental polymer and processing technologies also opens the door to applications and industries where traditional SBCs were unable to participate,” officials noted.
The plant is located within the company's flagship commercial manufacturing facility in Belpre. This allows the new facility to capitalize on the existing plant's technical skills, talents and infrastructure. “Its fit-for-purpose volume scale-up bridges the gap between laboratory and full-scale production of products within the development cycle, enhancing the company's ability to deliver developmental polymers in customizable quantities in record time. It will reduce reliance upon Kraton's commercial manufacturing plants for test runs, resulting in fewer type changes and improved utilization of its manufacturing facilities,” company officials explained.
"By making this additional investment in innovation, we are accelerating our time to market and improving our supply chain capabilities, which enables us to meet the needs of our global customers. This new facility has garnered significant interest on the part of those customers and our development partners around the world," said Kevin Fogarty, President/CEO. "It also underscores our long-term commitment to the Mid-Ohio Valley and its economic growth."
HID Global, a worldwide leader in secure identity solutions, opened its new $35 million World Headquarters and North American Operations Center in Austin, Texas. The campus features 250,000 square feet of manufacturing, office and warehouse space on 22 acres in North Austin’s Tech Ridge area.
The firm said it initiated its first phase of operations at the state-of-the-art facility ahead of schedule and expects it to be fully operational by the third quarter of 2015. Almost 400 employees are expected to work at the new facility by 2015. The new center will include the consolidation of the company’s corporate functions, manufacturing, assembly and test operations, distribution, and sales operations.
“Our North American operations consolidation, as well as the relocation of our Corporate Headquarters to Austin, Texas, is an exciting development for HID Global,” said Denis Hébert, president and CEO of HID Global. “Texas is an ideal location for our new state-of-the-art, sustainable facility, and will provide us an excellent platform for scaling our global operations to support the expansion of our leadership position in secure identity solutions.”
HID Global’s new World Headquarters will be the company’s largest facility worldwide, and has been designed to support future expansion. It will also house offices for regional management, customer service, engineering, purchasing, and quality functions. Hiring is underway, with more than 300 new positions to be filled over the next two years.
“HID’s decision to move their worldwide headquarters to Texas is proof positive that our focus on low taxes, smart regulations, fair courts and a skilled workforce helps create jobs and strengthen our economy,” Texas Gov. Rick Perry said. “I’m pleased HID has chosen to call Texas home, and look forward to their continued success in the Lone Star State.”

L-Shaped desk with hutch is the L-shaped desk with the addition of hutch in that desk. It’s usually the desk in one side and then the hutch in the other side. This combination will create the L-shape of the desk. Since it’s hutch that we are talking about, it’s usually has small size rather than big size. Well, if it’s big then we should say it storage. The minimalist L-shaped desk concept is usually the one that use the hutch as the addition feature in the desk. In that hutch, you can keep your documents or other things such as books, bag, and other things.
Design is really important in order to get a nice look or appearance of things such as furniture. It’s true that the first and the most important thing to be considered when we want to buy furniture are the features and the function. But, we can’t also forget that the first thing that catches our eyes is the design. When the design is unattractive or didn’t look suitable for the model of the furniture, then most of the people will lose interest of that furniture. That’s why, in case of black computer desk, we need to do the same thing.
People who feel interested to choose redshelf as the storage place need to consider a few things. First; you have to choose the storage in vertical or horizontal to make sure the storage look fit in the room. Second; you better choose the storage which has enclosed wall anchoring devise since it will make sure that your wall will not broken when you applied the storage. Third; you have to consider about the material that used for the shelf. Every material has different fastener, so you have to choose the fastener that will suitable with the material that you used. You can choose the shelf which made from Acrylic, Paper, Wood, Plastic, and other that you think more suitable for the wall.
After doing the steps above, what you have to do is installing the Laptop desk as well as its position. Use your first plan in determining the position and size of the desk. You can try to installing your portable laptop on it and make sure that the desk is safety in use as your workspace. After all finished, you can use it as well as its function for your daily activity.
If you want to use the Kneeling chair more effectively in making you relaxed, you can choose the one with arms which can be the right place for putting your arm in making you relaxed. You can choose many design of it by seeing which chair can be more functional for you.
When we have a chance to work at home, it means the condition of the room and facilities will affect our productivity. If we talk about a room for work, it will involve many things that seem important. The main media which should be in your workspace is the Home Office Desk. It will be the place where we will spend much time in work. On the words, it gives big influences toward our productivity in work. It should be the media which is comfortable and functional. If you want to design your own desk, you may have some inspirations which can help you to make it nice.
Another important thing is thinking about its durability and safety. We know that the desk will be used for working. It means that it should be safe in use. Thinking about its safety is also very important because some of the desk contain a poison that contained in the material. That poison may be dangerous for the health especially for the use in long term. So, make sure that the Computer armoire is safe from the things like that.
We know that any stuff used to furnish the room will give their own effect to the room atmosphere. Talking about the use of stuff, table lamp also has a role in it. We know that actually the room has their own light sources to make the room bright. When we put or add the lamp for the table, it means we also should think about its parameter of brightness on order make the room feels comfortable.
Many people say that having the stuff with white color will be boring or even too risky because it is easy to be dirty. Actually, it is not necessarily true. White color naturally has the meaning of clean and bright. Indirectly, if in a room we put something with white color dominantly, it will make the room feels more comfortable. The use of White bookcase can be one of it. Beside it has a function to put and arrange the books, it can be one of furniture that furnish your room. What you have to do is just trying to set it as well as possible. Estimating the space use will be considered from the first time you set the room. So, it may not bother the position of other furniture in the room.
The space provided in every room will determine what kind of furniture that will be in your room. It is very important to use every single space of the room efficiently. It involves the use of every corner of the room that can be the right place to put furniture here. You can put the Corner desks here as well as possible. The desk itself has the right function and shape that will fit your space in the corner. It will minimize the possibility of inefficient use of the space that may happen while we are setting the room. There are some types of the desk that you can use in the corner of the room. If you want to have the desk with standing or sitting design, you may put the table that can be installed directly to the wall in the corner. Just add the chairs and other stuff to make this desk be more useful. It can also be your workspace indirectly as long as you can decorate it well.

It's very weird to be back, I'll say that upfront. When we came back to the US in November it wasn't nearly as weird, for two reasons: the first is that Portland isn't "home" to either of us, I've only been there a few times, so even though we were visiting my parents, it was more like they joined us on vacation; and second, this time we're not going back after two weeks. It still seems hard to believe that we're back here for good, or at least in our case for 15 months until Abby finishes school. But we're done with Peace Corps and I have to admit, it kind of sucks. I was ready to leave the Philippines, but I'm really going to miss Peace Corps in terms of people. Other volunteers. Not very often do you meet 70 random people and have basically all of them be cool. Not that you're friends with all of them, but %95 of them are interesting and smart and fun and easy to talk to. You don't happen upon a group like that very often. So I'm a little bummed about that aspect of it. Luckily our friends here called up the night we got back, and we ended up going out for dinner and drinks with a bunch of people, and they're organizing a welcome back bbq this weekend, so it feels really nice to be missed, and to have people be excited that we're back. I was a little worried that maybe we'd be too different, or that other people wouldn't understand where we're coming from, but it didn't seem that way at all, which is kind of a relief.
Never the less I've kind of been in this house for two days now, slightly afraid to go out. Maybe not afraid, but a little apprehensive. We went to the grocery store today, the little international market down the street, so that was kind of fun running around looking at locally made organic bread, real tofu, baklava, deli meat, pickles, hot sauce, cheeses, meats, beers, giant jars of olives... It was pretty nice. Brought a smile to my face for sure. Abby has her first day of school this evening, but she's downstairs now taking a nap trying to fight the jet leg! I couldn't do it, but props to her that she can. I'm still in the process of looking for a job, which I don't feel like thinking about or talking about. On an unrelated note, we walked to the market and the total walking time was maybe 20 minutes, and in that span we saw a total of 3 people out walking as well. It's insane with the driving here, so much to get used to again...
Also, please check out this website: http://www.wecansolveit.org/ and consider signing up and signing their petitions.
More importantly look at this page: http://www.wecansolveit.org/content/solutions to read up a little on five ways we can combat global warming (clean energy economy, personal choice, adoption of renewables, enhanced energy efficiency and innovation leadership). This is so much more important this year because by choosing a president you'll also be choosing the course this country will take for the next four years concerning environmental policy. I think that global warming tends to hit people too much as a slogan, but I like the way this group has laid out its info. It's all very nice and well that people switch over to compact florescent bulbs or drive a Prius, but the real way things are going to chance is through the government and its relation to business in this country. It's not even just about global warming, it's about the way we live our lives, the way we let other people run our lives, and right now money and buying shit is the only thing that matters in this world, and that's pretty pathetic.
It was a great day on Tuesday, the right man was picked for the job in my opinion, and I feel fairly confident that he'll be able to get us moving in the right direction again. And, Obama has finally broken our pattern of only white males in office. About time. But as great as the election was, it overshadowed (and rightly so) an insidious plague in our country. The plague is religious fundamentalism.
We hear news all the time about the religious extremists over there! Watch out, those other people are trying to take away your freedoms! And it's true, Muslim extremists are assholes. But we have been duped into not noticing that our very own country is slowly becoming a theocracy. We mock Iran for their government and policy that's led by religion. We say, "look at us, we're so free!" We pride ourselves on the fact that people can say whatever they'd like, and believe in whatever they'd like to believe in. But like it or not, we are becoming a Christian country. Not that everyone in the country is becoming Christian, but we are increasingly letting Christians fundamentalists dictate policy and laws for us. The entire Republican party depends on capturing their vote, and Obama had to repeat over and over that he was a Christian, that he attended church and believed in god. In a nation made up of dozens of religions, as well as agnostics and atheists, that believes in the freedom of religion and the separation of church and state, why did both candidates have to prove that they were good Christians?
This is from the World Factbook, regarding the makeup of the US population: Protestant 51.3%, Roman Catholic 23.9%, Mormon 1.7%, other Christian 1.6%, Jewish 1.7%, Buddhist 0.7%, Muslim 0.6%, other or unspecified 2.5%, unaffiliated 12.1%, none 4% (2007 est.)
So by that estimate, a little more than %75 of the population is some kind of Christian religion, but that leaves %25 who are not (or in other terms, about 75 million people).
Where am I going with this? Some people might have seen the news that Prop 8 passed in California, banning gay people from getting married. Why was this even on the books in the first place? Because of the Mormon church for one, but also because of a large group of people who's religion tells them that homosexuality is a sin. It is a sin to them, but not against the law in the US. It's also a sin to commit adultery, covet your neighbor's goods and wife, as well as a multitude of other things that are not against the law. So does the fact that adultery is a sin stop Christians from committing that sin? Some yes, but certainly not all, not even a majority. So basically they pushed legislation up for a vote, banning a right for an entire group of people, simply because some people's religion considers it a sin. Does that sound like something that happens in a free country, where people's religion is not supposed to influence legislation and law?
I read a comment about it by a guy telling gays not to sue, because it was the will of the people, the majority has spoken. Yes, all %51 of the majority. The population of Cali is about 38 million, so that means that just less than half of the people, or 18 million people give or take, did not want that prop passed. But if all it takes is a majority, what if it turned out that 51% of a certain state did not want blacks and whites to get married? What if it turned out that since 51% of people thought cheating on your wife/husband is a sin, laws would be passed making cheating punishable with jail time?
The fact of the matter is, no matter your thoughts on homosexuality, being gay isn't a crime. It doesn't matter if you think gay people are born gay, or if they choose their lifestyle, it's still not a crime. And if two people wish to get married, who they fuck are we to say they can't? If they're of legal age, and both going into the marriage willingly, then they should be allowed to marry. Don't people see, this is no different than not allowing interracial marriages? Don't they see that legislation like this eats away at the most cherished foundations of our society and country, that all people are free and have a right to happiness? Doesn't everyone see that by allowing legislation like this to stand, we are no better than any of the "unfree" countries conservatives and liberals alike love to mock?
So my view is this: There are more of us than there are of them. There are more religious and non-religious people in this country who believe in the separation of church and state, who want to be free to live and practice as we see fit. The Christian fundamentalists are louder, meaner and more cutthroat, and that's usually why they're heard so often, but it's time to put a stop to this nonsense. It's time for us to demand they keep their creationist beliefs out of school textbooks and other public places where they don't belong. It's time for us to demand they keep their beliefs about what is a sin and what is not a sin out of our public domain. This is our country, and unlike them we believe in freedoms for all people, that everyone is equal and should be treated as such, and we're not going to let them turn our country into a theocracy. It's time to start fighting back.
Theo Wargo/Getty Images(LOS ANGELES) -- 50/50 star Seth Rogen and his new bride, Lauren Miller, are not planning to have kids anytime soon. The actor told People.com "no" when asked about the idea of having children, and he added, "We have a dog. That's good for now."
Rogen was nominated for his first-ever Golden Globe on Thursday for 50/50. He noted that he's "never been in a movie" that he thought could be nominated for a major award but "life is good." He concluded, "I'm pretty happy right now. Married life is exactly like non-married life, except you're not constantly having the feeling that you're disappointing your significant other by not marrying them."
Theo Wargo/Getty Images(SONOMA COUNTY, Calif.) -- Seth Rogen tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend, actress and writer Lauren Miller, in Sonoma Country, Calif. on Sunday, according to People magazine. Rogen’s comedy cronies Jonah Hill, Adam Sandler and Paul Rudd were reportedly in attendance.
Rogen, 29, and Miller, 30, started dating in 2004. Rogen revealed his outlandish proposal on Conan O’Brien’s late night show last November, saying he had grand plans to pop the question but discovered that Miller was topless when the time came.
“She was in our closet, changing, and she was literally only in her underpants,” Rogen said on Conan. “I had already kind of started [to propose]...I didn’t picture it like this, and I know she didn’t picture it like this.”
Brian To/FilmMagic/Getty Images(LOS ANGELES) -- Kurt Sutter, the outspoken creator of the FX drama Sons of Anarchy, knows when it's time to stop tweeting. He's shut down his Twitter account after he claimed on the site last week that Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner was responsible for the recent firing of The Walking Dead showrunner Frank Darabont. In reference to Weiner's lengthy talks with AMC earlier this year for a new Mad Men deal, Sutter tweeted, "why darabont got fired - weiner. he held AMC hostage, broke their bank, budgets were slashed." Darabont oversaw production of AMC's The Walking Dead.
On his website, Sutter explained his decision to quit Twitter, writing, "I'm a guy desperately in need of buffers. I have big feelings, big reactions, big emotions." Last month, he took to Twitter to complain that his show had not been nominated for an Emmy.
Lionsgate(NEW YORK) -- It's a done deal: Mad Men will return to AMC for not one, but two more seasons.
AMC and studio Lionsgate announced Thursday that it has reached an agreement that will ensure that the Emmy-winning drama, starring Jon Hamm as ad exec Don Draper, will air a fifth and sixth season with series creator Matthew Weiner remaining at the helm. The fifth season won't debut until next year.
Under a new long-term deal that The Wall Street Journal reports will pay him close to $10 million per season, Weiner could also return for a seventh season. The downside is that Weiner says the seventh season will likely be the show's last.
In a statement, Weiner thanked the fans for their support, adding, "I also want to thank AMC and Lionsgate for agreeing to support the artistic freedom of myself, the cast and the crew so that we can continue to make the show exactly as we have from the beginning. I'm excited to get started on the next chapter of our story."
There were rumors earlier this week that AMC and Lionsgate wanted Weiner to downsize the cast to cut costs, as well as cut a few minutes from the show to allow for more commercials. The Wall Street Journal reports that under the new deal, the season premieres and finales of Mad Men will remain at their present length of 47 minutes, but AMC reserves the right to air mid-season episodes at 45 minutes, though Weiner says full 47- and 48-minute versions will be available digitally after their initial broadcast.

Un altro passo avanti verso un mondo più pulito e città meno inquinate: entro l’anno, molto probabilmente, verrà commercializzato il “gasolio bianco”, il nuovo carburante ecologico sviluppato dal gruppo Camfin che permette una riduzione del 50% di emissioni di polveri fini e ossidi di azoto. Ad annunciarlo è stato lo stesso presidente della Camfin, Marco Tronchetti Provera, durante la conferenza svoltasi quest’oggi a Roma, in occasione dell’allargamento della sperimentazione del nuovo gasolio in città: “Il Gecam – ha spiegato – è già utilizzato in 70 città italiane e copre quasi il 20% del trasporto pubblico in Italia. E’ il successo di una tecnologia italiana, di un prodotto che riesce ad abbattere le polveri sottili, l’elemento più pericoloso per la salute dei cittadini”.Anche Walter Veltroni, sindaco di Roma, è soddisfatto. Il Campidoglio, infatti, ha deciso di triplicare l’utilizzo del nuovo gasolio ecologico sui mezzi pubblici dopo che i primi dati sulla sperimentazione confermano un abbattimento delle polveri del 40%: “Visto il costo pressoché identico del nuovo carburante, l’anno prossimo vorremmo estendere il suo utilizzo a tutti i mezzi pubblici della capitale”.Intanto si apre uno spiraglio anche per le auto diesel: “Sono ormai quattro anni che stiamo facendo test sulle automobili – continua Tronchetti Provera – e sono emersi dati confortanti: il nuovo gasolio non danneggia i motori. Per ora stiamo sperimentando con Fiat l’utilizzo sulle automobili, mentre con Agip abbiamo una collaborazione tecnologica”. Il gasolio bianco, una miscela di acqua e gasolio, potrebbe trovarsi nei distributori entro la fine dell’anno, anche se ancora non si sa quale possa essere la società distributrice.

HANCOCK — Vermont State Police arrested three Hancock residents on charges of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine on Tuesday, Nov. 20, following an investigation at their respective homes off Route 125.
WATERBURY — Vermont State Police barracks across Vermont will begin accepting “bump-fire stocks” from the public effective immediately following passage of new firearms-related laws earlier this year.
NEW HAVEN — The United Way of Addison County and the Drug Enforcement Administration will give the public its 14th opportunity in seven years to prevent pill abuse and theft by ridding their homes of potentially dangerous expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs. Anyone wishing to participate can bring their pills for disposal to the New Haven state police barracks on Route 7 on Saturday, Oct. 28, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The service is free and anonymous, no questions asked. (Note that the DEA cannot accept liquids or needles or sharps — only pills or patches).
VERMONT — As fall hiking and tourism season is upon us, Vermont State Police are reminding citizens to refrain from leaving valuables in plain view inside their vehicles while enjoying the outdoors. This includes purses, handbags (with vacation cash), wallets, cash, iPhones, iPods, hiking equipment and the like.
ADDISON COUNTY — The invitation to ride along with a Vermont State Police trooper got a little intimidating after reading the requisite consent form. The passenger — in this case, a reporter — shouldn’t rule out the possibility of being whisked at a high rate of speed to a crime scene and the risk of injury, and yes, even death.
This scribe swallowed even harder when VSP Sgt. Blake Cushing of the New Haven barracks recommended close scrutiny of the location of the cruiser’s radio in case the trooper were incapacitated and needed backup.
ADDISON COUNTY — Law enforcement agencies have been busy this month trying to make area highways safer, and they will continue with extra efforts through Labor Day.
Vermont State Police and other law enforcement agencies ran some saturation patrols in Addison County in an effort to reduce speeds, monitor distracted driving, enforce traffic laws and remind the public of the importance of wearing seat belts.

BRISTOL — A 24-year-old Bristol man has been charged with sexually assaulting a 20-year-old woman at a party at his parents’ home in June.
The alleged sexual assault took place in the early morning hours of June 25, at a party at Ford’s family home on Lower Notch Road in Bristol. Ford lives with his parents, Suzanne and Glenn Cota.
MIDDLEBURY — Vermont State Police press releases related to drunken driving cases no longer include results of the preliminary breath test (PBT) for drivers who submit to that test after they are stopped.
That decision is based on a directive from key Vermont Department of Public Safety officials, including Commissioner Tom Anderson, who assert — among other things — that making PBT results public prior to a drunken driving suspect’s arraignment might affect his or her ability to get a fair trial.
MIDDLEBURY — Vermont State Police on Monday officially confirmed Lt. Jeff Danoski as the new leader of the agency’s New Haven barracks, which serves Addison County. Danoski, 47, becomes the third commander of the New Haven barracks in just four months.

Three Rivers. A row of snow-capped peaks hover in the sky. While I approach, blending into the horizon, it seems conceivable to reach them. There are bare orange groves behind the houses of the next hamlet; the road starts climbing, leaving evaporated lakes and crippled forests in its wake. The writer's house is sitting in a landscape made of parched scrub, bleached by the sun and sunk into the soil. Nobody heard the approaching car. I push the warped door open and follow the voices.
The word sounded familiar when George's friend uttered it in his dark restrained voice: Beloved. It had never occurred to me to think of its male form.
The corridor of the house is crammed with the treasures of a long life, paintings, books, trophies, polished eggs carved from semi-precious stones lying in earthenware bowls. The author sits in an armchair, surrounded by his audience. He talks about the thriller, his thriller, in the course of which he invented laser beams and micro chips sixty years ago. His eyes are dull and his veins coiled like snakes around his wrists. He has described brain transplants long before any organs were replaced. Occasionally, his German accent clouds his words.
He has transplanted his own brain, and sometimes, he says, he looks out at the white peaks, thanking the assassins of his parents for the life he found here. I ask him about the Wolfman.
"The father is my father, of course; I am the son", he explains without looking at me. I am still hoarse. "That is all."
The son transforms himself into a wolf to escape the father. The novel was made into a Hollywood movie. The author's wife, sitting in her wheelchair, smiles, as if she remembers. I forget the end of the story.
It may be that my father did not want a third daughter. Perhaps I did not want to be the third. It must have begun like any coincidence, with a gesture, a touch. The skin was familiar, the scent, the hair curled on the chest. As the coincidences multiplied, I saw them ruling my life.
Next month, a stamp depicting the Wolfman will be issued, the German scholar claims, to mark the past success of the movie.
Somebody starts listing durable success: Mozart, Goethe, Citizen Kane. "My Wolfman", the author interjects from his armchair. Everybody nods. "Anyone", adds the old man, "has only one big story to write"
The Mexican maid looks startled as I come into the kitchen. She had not heard me coming and while she refills the jugs I brought, I look out into the garden. It may, at some stage, have flowered like an oasis in a desert, but it has shrunk to a skeleton, now.
I must be mistaken, I shall not find here what I am looking for. For an instant, I wonder if I should walk, around the house, to my car and return.
"Every person has his own perception of paradise", the German scholar says on my return carrying the filled jugs, his eyes resting on his colleague's cleavage.
The actor compares the gaze of his newly born daughter with the one of his dying father. I cannot say whether he uses his own words or quotes. He saw, he says, in both faces mirror images of another world. If he had a choice, the author says, he would rather live in this world for fifty more years, than partake in the bliss of eternity. His scalp is bare and speckled.
Later, we gather behind the house, surrounded by faded pot plants. The three rivers responsible for the place's name have long since run dry. There is not even enough water to sprinkle the borders, and the fence erected to keep the dog from running away has collapsed.
The others are out of earshot, observing the sunset. I remember the red volume in Philipp's shelf, "Metamorphoses", by Ovid.
Pygmalion found all living women unsatisfactory and, therefore, began to carve his own, from ivory. The statue turned out to be so beautiful that he fell in love with it. He brought her little presents, flowers, sea-shells, polished stones, and he clad her in vestments. He kissed her, laid her down on his bed. When the feast day of Venus arrived, Pygmalion offered his sacrifice before asking the goddess for a woman akin to his craven image. Venus at once understood his longing and inspired the statue with life.
"...mellowing under my touch, the ivory's rigour yields to the imprint of my finger..." I try to recall the scar on Duncan's chest bulging under my fingers.
"A gift", the old man replies without a trace of guile. "In the evenings", he continues, "racoons come out of the scrub to feed from the bowls we put out for them. They are so docile that Henrietta can pat them, sitting in her wheelchair." I can feel my tears welling up. The author's eyes stray over to his wife. The inviolability of age has clad her beauty with a veil.
"The best thing I ever did", he says, "to marry this woman". Her gaze is empty. I fold my hands, as if the touch alone could preserve the memory.
As we leave, two buzzards circle the mountains and a rattlesnake basks in the evening sun like an old garden hose. I follow the actor's white convertible for awhile, then I turn south. When the vineyards appear beside the road, it is dark. Duncan's skin smelled of damp wood.
We fly west with the dusk. Behind Montreal we glide for a while over streams and lakes covered with milky skins of ice. Then the earth is brown. The noises of the engines weave themselves into a rustling sound. I turn the hands of my watch back; in the blue field behind the numerals the moon moves over a star-covered sky.
When the outlines of Regina appear in the distance they tremble in the air. Jack had explained in his letters that it used to be a camp on the river bank, when they started to build the town. They first called it after the pile of bison bones found there. The ground between the wooden sidewalk planks must have been muddy when the snow melted in the spring and dusty in the summer. With their houses' wide porches they tried to protect themselves from the immense sky.
When the plane lands it is dark. Jack stands in the centre of the baggage hall - there are no barriers here. The smile doesn´t leave his lips while we wait for my suitcase to appear on the carousel. Then we drive through avenues past the illuminated parliament building. Every tree here is planted by humans, and there is a man-made lake somewhere.
The hotel seems a velvet-lined palace lit by chandeliers when we enter after the reading. One of the listeners had asked if the characters in my books were invented. All of the students had assembled as Jack had promised. I gave the names of abbesses and kings, Jews, preachers, Angelus of Florence the pharmacist, and their imagined faces passed before me ... Duncan's ear resembled a shell. It moved me when I saw it first. I could have whispered words into it, and maybe they would have hatched in his thoughts and spread their wings.
The ice crackles in the glass the barman puts in front of me. Jack talks about his students. When we get up I glance at a newspaper left on a table, the picture of a woman. I know her - Megan, I think, how did Megan get here? But then I see the headline.
"She was about your age", Jack remarks, "and the long hair, the European face ..." I nod. She looks like me, like Megan, like a woman who lived four hundred years ago. Below the picture is a list of telephone numbers.
The hands of my watch show half past two when I wake up. The ringing lasts longer every time. My heart is beating in a hollow space. How will Philip's voice sound after all this time?
As I reach for the reciever and say my name the line goes dead. An electrical stroke, a kiss, a spell - I looked at Duncan's round, somewhat too large chin, the lower lip pushed over the upper in his sleep, his closed eyelids. Didn't others succeed in giving life to the imagined, for a moment at least, under cover of night?
When the hotel was built the town was already called Regina - in Queen Victoria's honour. At the station the trains of the Canadian Pacific Railway joining the East and West coasts stopped, and people who broke their journey here were brought in carriages through the muddy street to the hotel.
The escalator lined with imitation Gobelins glides leisurely down through the floors. Jack is waiting in the hall in front of showcases with old newspaper clippings. The Morning Leader dedicated a special edition to the opening of the hotel in May 1923. It even described the automatic potato peeler, the egg boiler precise to the second, and the pipe system of the in-built vacuum cleaner.
I notice them approaching from the corner of my eye while I look at the fading pictures, a couple with broad faces, he somewhat taller, she bigger and I'm not surprised when they address me. Having confirmed my name they show me their badges. Jack looks from one to the other. We sit down in the empty bar. The officers put their questions politely, awkwardly. Yes, I know the guesthouse - I was there - that night.
"There was only ..." I imitate the intonation of witnesses in movies and they stare at me "... a clapping sound, like the closing of a suitcase - only louder ..."
Jack's light blue Lincoln is parked outside the hotel in the sun. Reaching beneath the steering wheel he releases the handbrake and I wince. I have seen this movement innumerable times. The officers want to know how long I intend to stay in town and if I would come to the station when necessary to repeat my statement. The traffic lights turn green as soon as Jack's car approaches.
Have the police called Phillip to locate me? The organizers of the readings had my Irish address, most of them knew that I am married and some knew Phillip. I remember the call at night.
The land is flat like a sheet. We follow mile-long fields. Where the ground is not watered by man, Jack explains, it turns to desert. Suddenly, a gully opens before us carved by a river into the plain. The road leads down. The valley resembles a cast in the ground, a negative of a mountain range. On the slopes dishevelled shrubs are growing. Jack drives across a bridge and then up the hill on the other side. On some fields the stubble of the last harvest remains to hold the snow that blows over the plain in winter; the others are ploughed. In a few weeks they will be sowed. Jack turns into a lane leading to a farmhouse painted red. From the enclosures pregnant cows watch us, mothers with calves.
"Verstönd ehr mich?" the farmer asks in an old fashioned dialect and takes his hat off. The band has left a groove in his forehead. I nod. Twenty years ago he came with other Hutterers to the North to buy land and build a village where they could live in the traditional way. I ask him about the white letters on his barn, and he shakes his head in disbelief when I talk of the castle in Ireland with the same name.
Philip wanted to know what I had written. He was used to following the word's traces into reality, and he did not believe me that I had invented everything. At night he twitched in his sleep beside me. There must have been glances, touches; he demanded that I remember.
The next riverbed is wider and the water is dammed up to form a lake. In a month the pelicans will be here. Jack stops and we leave the car. On a warm afternoon, he says, they circle high in the air without flapping their wings. In the distance a buffalo herd is approaching the bank and Jack starts to take pictures. The clouds are sliding over the land as if looking for a grip. In summer, Jack says, sometimes you can see the Northern lights from here. On the pages Philip read I had also described the shiver that ran through my body when I saw Duncan for the first time.
The two officers are sitting in the bar when we return to the hotel and I realize that I had forgotten them. They grin in embarrassment. They often have a drink here after work. Jack insists that we join them.
"A shot in the head", the man explains in confidence after the next round is placed on the table - the blood marks on the pillow, on the slipped crochet cover, the face ...
"Sometimes it takes years", the female officer explains. Years, before somebody starts to search, Miriam, Philip. For some time he will follow my way from a distance, then, hope will fade, anger ...
"Not even the weapon they have found. Many of these cases are never solved" she says " and even if somebody gets convicted for the crime at the end, it doesn't mean the files contain the truth."
Her colleague waves at the barman. The woman and I decline, and he orders beers for Jack and himself. For some time the officers discuss calibers, bullet holes, which hand had held the weapon. The murderer entered the room, the bed was to the left of the door. He stood exactly beside her. The muzzle touched her above the ear. Maybe the coldness of the metal woke her, she twitched and therefore the shot went askew -
The hand that fired the shot must have been covered with tiny blood marks. The bar pianist plays Chopin. At the next table a young man explains to two girls the meaning of Rosebud. Somewhere a phone is ringing. After some time I could remember the shiver in my body as if I had felt it.
Baltimore's summer in Newfoundland did not proceed as peacefully as he had hoped. He had only just settled in the Manor with his family when two English cod ships were captured by French pirates in a bay to the North. Baltimore manned his own ships with all available settlers and the French cut their lines when they saw the enemy coming. Their loot they left behind on land with part of their crew. Baltimore took them prisoner. The pirates attacked once more, and again Baltimore chased them in vain. After that he formed an alliance with the captain of a man-of-war cruising off Newfoundland and sailed south. They captured six French fishing boats and sent them to England with their cargo of fish and cod liver oil. In August he wrote embittered: I came to builde, and sett, and sowe, but I am falne to fighting with ffrenchmen.
Duncan brought back a feather for her. A French prisoner he had cured of wound fever had given it to him. The feather was green, shimmering in all colours in the sunlight. Duncan explained that the bird came from the sky, lived on dew, and never touched the ground. The French had seen its plumage without feet. Bird of paradise he had called it. Megan put the feather into her prayer-book. She knew that Nicolas could find it there, but to hide it was to lose it again. She does not look at the feather very often, but every time she sees the prayer-book, she thinks of the green shimmering between its pages.
The settlers did not believe Baltimore when he told them they would chase the French away, but when the pirates took flight they did not hesitate to sail with him south in order to recoup their loss from the countrymen of the attackers. Meanwhile the women kept working in the huts between barrels filled with rotting cod liver. Now and then they poured off the oil. The crews of the cod ships talked of returning home when they brought the new catch into the harbour. The drying fish covered the beach of the bay and the southside of the headland. The men said no other part of the coastline was as suitable as this one with its flat stony shore. In a few weeks the summer would be over. With every barrel of salt-fish they paid for and took along the chances of the settlers surviving the coming cold improved.
Megan wondered if Duncan had brought a feather for his wife as well. They met as often as they could in the hut to the south. Once the blankets were rumpled when Megan arrived. They always took separate paths, and when they met in the settlement they avoided each other. Duncan was not as carefree as he was at the start. If somebody found out about their meetings, he said, his patients would stay away. But Megan knew that he thought of the children. Duncan's father-in-law was an official at court. Surely, he had not approved of his daughter marrying a Catholic who could only practise his profession on an island off the New World. The grandfather would know how to protect his grandsons. Duncan´s wife had hired a girl for washing and cooking while she herself sat in the Manor with Lady Baltimore. "They leave again" Hanna said, "as soon as she finds a reason." Megan shook the rumpled blankets and arranged them again without telling Duncan. Maybe it was just an animal.
Time stretched like a loose rope between the meetings with Duncan. In the first days after, Megan used to be full of confidence and at times she even thought she didn't need to see him again in order to be happy. Then she started to miss him, to doubt. During sleepless nights she wondered how she could reassure herself about him. A few words would be enough. She could have taken them with her in her head like a token. She pushed notes under his window - wishes, requests - but he did not answer. When despair took over, she imagined knocking on his door, confronting him in the street, but she never did. During the last days before the reunion the fear suddenly vanished. She did not know if he would come and it was not important anymore. She would wait for a while in the hut before she would return to the settlement. All these years she had lived without him, she would continue to do so.
And then, this too passed. In Duncan's presence the doubts, the fear that had tormented her for weeks were only the aftertaste of a bad dream. She was sure -
I cross out the last words. It is calm when I leave the house. In front of the bay there is a boat, the sea is flat, and the headland stands out like the back of a giant fish.
While I walk along the beach I wonder how the salt was taken from the sea. In one of his letters Wynne wrote that their salt was some of the best he had seen. Did they draw the sea water into salt ponds and let it evaporate? Was the sun ever strong enough here? Or did they pour it into shallow wooden troughs set up on the beach with covers to protect it against the rain? Or was this also invented like so many other things Wynne wrote in his letters: the mild climate, the fertile soil, the lush meadows.

I am quite lost when it comes to choosing a place to eat when in a shopping centre. I love keeping tabs on the restaurant and cafe scene, and most of the times, all the interesting restaurants that I want to try are located off the beaten track. Another reason why dining in a mall doesn’t catch my fancy is that the queues are horrendous! Come at 7pm on a Friday or a weekend and you’re almost guaranteed a half hour wait, which totally sux when you’re already famished.
Which was why I was rather apprehensive yesterday during a movie outing with several colleagues. We were supposed to watch Horrible Bosses at GV Marina and there was some vague idea of dining at Victoria Peak at the Suntec Convention Centre but no reservation was made. As expected, a last minute suggestion popped up, which was to go to Paulaner Brauhaus. It proved to be a pretty good suggestion because I haven’t been to Paulaners in like 6 years or something. I don’t know if my colleague enjoyed herself though, cuz she maintains a vegetarian diet on the 15th of every month…
It was very crowded on the 1st floor, but almost empty on the 2nd floor (pictured above) which houses the restaurant. It seems hardly anyone knows that there is a restaurant section on the 2nd and 3rd floor! People! Paulaners serves proper meals upstairs, and not just bar food! The bar menu does have some meal sounding things, but go upstairs and you will get the full menu.
It was Sunday and from about 5-8pm they have a 1 for 1 drink. I ordered the 0.3litre light lager $13. With beer, I don’t know enough to describe the intricacies of the taste. I just know that I liked it and i finished about 1 and a half glasses.
Generous amount of warm complimentary bread, with pate and butter. Our main dish arrived soon after so I was forced to discard the bread and attempt to conquer the main dish.
This is what I call the MEAT PILE. Ok they obviously called it a more refined German Platter, but seriously, I think MEAT PILE is a more apt description! When the 2 guys saw the amount of meat on the plate, their eyes glistened and the savage side of them emerged. Throughout the entire meal, they kept gushing about how happy they felt looking and devouring all the meat. And it is seriously a lot of meat. Each pax is charged $29.90 and you need a minimum of 2 pax. The amount here is a 2 pax order, but 2 guys and 1 girl could not finish all of this meat! I suppose if we hadn’t drunk the beer, the 3 of us might just have been able to conquer this.
Check out the knife waving in the background. Someone was going to spear me if I didn’t hurry up with the photo taking!
Here’s a close up of the meat pile. I liked the oozy cheese sausage at the bottom of the picture, and definitely the roast pork knuckle. You can choose to have boiled knuckle, but I say go for the roasted one (not that I’ve tried the boiled one but do I really need to advise you on this?). I didn’t like the meatloaf, it felt too smooth and processed, and totally unlike the NZ meatloaf I am familiar with that is chock full of detectable vegetable and meat bits. The sauerkraut was also so so, not pungent enough for me! When ordering this, just throw your diet out the window and just enjoy the crunchy roast pork knuckle fats. Think of it as collagen, good for the skin! Oh, mashed potato was served, but largely ignored for obvious reasons.
My other colleague ordered this pizza for $17, the one on the vegetarian diet. But she only managed to finish 3 pieces. Definitely not the authentic Italian pizza that I like. The yellow bits are peaches or apricots, which is an interesting change. I wonder if this is a German version of pizza. Seriously I don’t know how she managed to sit through the entire meal watching us wolf down the meat pile.
All in all, it was a very fun meal. Meat pile coupled with beer tends to lower the inhibitions of others. I might actually order the roast pork knuckle on its own the next time and not have to share all the crispy bits with other crispy bit loving people.
Go on a Sunday evening to get 1 for 1 beers, and bring your Citibank or Amex card for 15% discount on food! And don’t forget to leave your diet at home!
Good place to be with a bunch of meat loving friends! I like the decor on the 2nd floor. Pity it wasn’t crowded.

Happy Friday, everyone! We hope that most of you are reading this as you enjoy an extended long weekend and that everyone had a great Fourth of July yesterday. We’re back from Arizona and, after a brief stop home in Washington, D.C. (see us on Instagram again this week), we’re headed to Richmond for the weekend.
The first Four Seasons in Russia opens this weekend when a 19th-century palace officially becomes The Four Seasons St. Petersburg. Immortalized in Alexander Pushkin’s poetry, the 177-room hotel is located inside an iconic, triangular-shaped building in the city center, just steps from the Winter Palace. Nearly all rooms boast impressive views, and guests can enjoy numerous on-site amenities, including a Russian Tea Lounge, a bar with (what else?) vodka tasting flights and an Asian-inspired restaurant opening soon called Sintoho. A luxe spa will also open later this year. A second property in the country, Four Seasons Hotel Moscow, will open in 2014.
As we reported a few weeks ago, the flash sale site formerly owned by Gilt Groupe was sold and merged with SniqueAway, a TripAdvisor company. Today, the platform is called Jetsetter, the better known of the new brands. While this news isn’t particularly exciting in and of itself, the $100 incentive credit the brand has given to members of the site is. Use that cash to book a reservation at some of your favorite luxury hotels for more than 40 percent off. At some properties, that’s like a free night! Need a code? Join here.
Shangri-La hotels has opened its third luxury property in the city in the heart of the city’s most fashionable neighborhood on the Puxi side of the Huangpu River. The 508-room hotel is located inside the Jing An Kerry Centre, a high-end mixed use property featuring shopping, offices, restaurants and more. In addition to an impressive art collection, the hotel features four restaurants, (including a New York-style steakhouse) and the largest Horizon Club lounge in the Shangri-La collection.
We spent several days last week visiting L’Auberge de Sedona in the lovely city of Sedona, Arizona. The AAA Four Diamond property is tucked just below the city’s main strip of shops and restaurants and is conveniently nestled against the hillside with impressive views of both the famed Red Rocks and the charming Oak Creek. (A car is definitely necessary, but the gratis car service to nearby hiking trails and shops was definitely a plus, as this resort is more walkable than most.) We stayed in a Creekside Cottage, a perfect choice for the super hot days. Overall, the property is an ideal choice for guests visiting the Sedona area – rooms are spacious, rates are reasonable, and the on-property restaurant is voted one of the best in the area, offering fine dining on the banks of Oak Creek. We’d also suggest a sampling of the resort’s spa, where treatments are inspired by the desert setting. Overall, this resort is definitely worth a return visit.
As the former capitol of the Confederacy, Richmond has long been one of the premier destinations in the country for Civil War geeks. But as I discovered on two recent visits, it’s also a young, vibrant city with architecture treasures, stunning parks, walkable neighborhoods, great food and perhaps the most elegant vintage cinema in the country.
For Yanks looking for a quick taste of old Dixie, it’s also the northernmost Southern city, making it an easy weekend getaway for Northerners in search of some Southern hospitality. I live in Northern Virginia, which is technically part of the South, but in reality, Southern accents and good biscuits are a two hour drive south in Richmond, which is on my short list for most underrated historic cities in America. Below are my suggestions for how to spend a memorable weekend in Virginia’s capital.
Maymont– The hilly grounds of this 100 acre estate built by Confederate tycoon, Major James Dooley, offer panoramic views of the James River and feature lush gardens, a children’s farm, and a nature center. There is a small admission fee to visit the mansion and nature center but you can explore the beautiful grounds and visit the farm for free.
St. John’s Episcopal Church– Built in 1741, this handsome wooden church, located in Richmond’s historic Church Hill neighborhood, is where Patrick Henry delivered his famous “Give me liberty, or give me death,” speech to George Washington.
The Fan– If you like Victorian architecture, this alluring neighborhood just west of downtown is a must see. Easily one of my favorite walkable neighborhoods in the country.
The Byrd Theatre– Built in 1928, this may be the most beautiful old time cinema in the country. Even if you don’t plan to take in a $1.99 movie, stop in to take a look at this masterpiece theater, which is located in Carytown, a neighborhood with great shops and restaurants.
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts– A free-to-enter, world-class museum with more than 20,000 works of art, including a very impressive collection of South Asian art.
The American Civil War Center at Tredegar– If you’re only going to hit one Civil War related museum in Richmond, this is the place to go for a terrific overview of the conflict. Opened in 2006, the museum offers a visually attractive, interactive user friendly experience that depicts the war from the perspective of the Union, the Confederacy and African Americans.
The Virginia State Capitol– Take the time to explore this Classical Revival gem, which Thomas Jefferson modeled on a Roman era temple in Nimes, France.
James River Bridges– Take the Robert E. Lee footbridge over to Belle Island for a great walk and then check out the unnamed, interpretative footbridge just off the Canal Walk for insights into the fall of Richmond during the waning days of the Civil War.
The Museum of the Confederacy– While the American Civil War Center offers a nicer overview of the conflict, this is a great stop to see Confederate memorabilia, like Robert E. Lee’s hat and tent and Jeb Stuart’s knee high boots. The gift shop sells lots of kitsch, including nylon Confederate flags for $39.
Children’s Museum of Richmond– If you’re traveling with kids, this is their reward for tolerating all the Civil War history.
Alamo BBQ– Cheap and delicious, this is one of my favorite BBQ places anywhere, but I also love the tilapia burritos. Excellent pecan pie for $2.93 a slice. The only downside is that you have to sit in a tent, but it’s not as cold as you might think, even in January.
Edo’s Squid– Italian fine dining in a hidden location at very fair prices. Arrive early to beat the crowds.
821 Bakery Café- Tasty food and a terrific beer selection in a cool old building with exposed brick walls and a vintage tin ceiling. Also wins my award for the most colorful bathrooms I’ve ever seen.
It might not even be Thanksgiving yet, but holiday travel planning is well underway. If you’re looking to be razzle dazzled this holiday season, the state of Virginia offers a festival of lights that has been bringing visitors back year after year. The 100 Miles of Lights celebration is a series of world-class light displays spread across six cities: Richmond, Williamsburg, Newport News, Hampton, Norfolk and Virginia Beach. While exploring the glitzy trail, visitors will find drive-through light displays, twinkling cityscapes, and other sparkling spectacles.
The whole shebang kicks off in Norfolk this Saturday with the Grand Illumination Parade, an event that sets downtown Norfolk ablaze in lights and is followed by a parade featuring festive floats, marching bands, giant balloons, dancers and more. Nearby, the Virginia Beach boardwalk will also be shimmering with Holiday Lights at the Beach (pictured above), which is expected to draw 30,000 cars to the boardwalk before the new year begins.
Newport News Regional Park will become home to Celebration of Lights (picture above), a two-mile drive of 750,000 lights and 200 displays, including the animated “Winter Wonderland” and “Santa’s Enchanted Kingdom.” Over in Richmond, the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden will features more than half a million lights, botanical decorations and trains for GardenFest of Lights. New this year, the “Virginia is for Lovers” LOVE artwork will be on display, allowing families and couples to take holiday photos.
Besides these long-running events, Colonial Williamsburg will host a Grand Illumination on December 4, while Hampton will host the Holly Days Parade on December 11.
If getting the whole family to go to Virginia seems like a Christmas miracle, you may be in luck: The Virginia Tourism Corporation also just announced the “Virginia Snowmotion Sweepstakes.” The grand prize includes a free ski or snowboard lesson, complimentary equipment rental and lift tickets, a $200 gift card for dining, and a three-night, four-day stay at Wintergreen Resort for a family of four. Also included in the promotion is round-trip airfare and car rental to explore the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains. To enter, visit www.virginia.org/sweeps.

2010 was the Year of the Food Truck, with cities from Seattle and San Francisco to D.C. taking it to the streets, literally. While street food and taco trucks have long been a part of U.S. culture in places like New York, Los Angeles, and Oakland, health regulations have historically made it considerably more difficult in other parts of the country. Eatocracy reports that Atlanta–despite its tight mobile cooking laws–now has a “hybrid” approach that enables food trucks to exist, albeit in a different form. Could 2011 become the Year of the Mobile Farmers Market?
For the uninitiated, street food technically refers to food that is prepared (cooked, if applicable) and sold from a street cart, stall, or permanent stand. Food trucks are essentially mobile street food, and can change location from day-to-day, or remain parked in a stationary spot. These are not your “lunch” trucks of old, selling flabby sandwiches and processed, grab-and-go items. Today’s food truck offers food prepared from seasonal produce and other ingredients likely sourced from local family farms.
Until recently, state and county health departments largely prohibited street eats due to fears regarding potential foodborne illness. It’s harder to regulate things like sanitation and temperature control in a non-stationary kitchen, but far from impossible. Thanks to the open-mindedness of city officials across the country, enterprising chefs and other food industry professionals have been able to give mobile food operations a shot, the most successful of which have gone on to achieve national acclaim. Portland, Oregon, has been so supportive, there are now permanent designated locations for food cart clusters.
But even as we’re becoming more of a food truck nation, it’s still an uphill battle. Eatocracy states that Chicago is just one city making it next to impossible for actual cooking to be done on-site. Instead, food must be pre-packaged, which is a buzz-kill for many budding entrepreneurs. Atlanta requires convoluted logistical wrangling (trucks selling cooked-to-order food must change location every half-hour, nor operate at more than two locations a day) as a deterrent. One local farm’s solution: focus on the raw ingredient, not the end product.
Riverview Farms of Ranger, Georgia, has created a mobile farmers market that brings sustainably-grown produce to various locations in Atlanta. As creator Elmer Veith puts it, “We’re going to bring the farm field to the neighborhood, so you don’t have to come to us.”
Veith retrofitted a Mac Tools truck to create Riverview’s Farm Mobile. Customers enter the truck from the rear, and pay before exiting at the front. The sides are outfitted with shelves for produce, as well as the farm’s cornmeal and grits. There’s a freezer for Riverview’s grassfed beef and heritage Berkshire pork. Other offerings may include bread, pasture-raised chickens, free-range eggs, and cheese from other local food artisans and farms.
Customers get updates on Farm Mobile’s location and that day’s product via email, Facebook and Twitter. The social media aspect is a key part of the success of today’s food trucks. Yet Farm Mobile is subject to less regulations, because they’re not selling prepared food. They are, however, licensed by state authorities, and require permission from property owners to park on their land. If outfits like Farm Mobile (or Richmond, Virginia’s Farm Bus) catch on, can we expect to see more markets on wheels servicing urban areas? Greg Smith, President of the Atlanta Street Food Coalition, hopes so.
“Street food adds life and vibrancy to the city,” he says, predicting that in the future, “There will be multiple ‘food truck lots’ around the city and the trucks might move on a daily basis from lot to lot.” The Coalition, which seeks to help entrepreneurs break into the industry, is yet another sign that mobile eating is here to stay. TruxMap is an iPhone app that lets users hunt down their favorite food trucks, while dedicated sites such as Food Carts Portland are attracting legions of fans. The best way to show support, however, is to start eating on the street. Check out Eater.com, to see if there’s a food or farm truck (coming) near you.
A coded message sent to the beleaguered Confederate commander of Vicksburg has been cracked, the BBC reports.
The Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond has had the message in its collection for more than a century. It had never tried to decipher the code of seemingly random letters until this year, when they sent it off to retired CIA codebreaker David Gaddy. While Gaddy is trained to break sophisticated modern codes, this early cipher was still tough enough to take him several weeks.
It turns out the message was sent to Confederate General John Pemberton telling him he wouldn’t be getting any reinforcements. The city was the key to the Mississippi River and had been under siege by Union forces for months. The message was dated 4 July 1863, the same day Pemberton surrendered. The bad news was probably the last straw. With his men short of food and munitions and the city in ruins, Pemberton’s last hope was getting reinforcements.
The fall of Vicksburg opened up the Mississippi River to Union gunboats and cut the Confederacy in half. It was one of the turning points of the Civil War.
Home affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba says he did not know about a meeting between former Eskom CEO Brian Dames and the Guptas in Midrand Gauteng.
Gigaba had been testifying and answering questions before Parliament’s state capture inquiry, and says he first heard of the meeting when Dames presented his testimony to the commission of inquiry.
In October 2017, Dames testified that Minister Gigaba's advisor had arranged a meeting with a Gupta representative.
Gigaba also denied he knew of any plans to build a coal power station in the Free State. He says he is hopeful that his testimony will vindicate him and prove he worked ethically.

What is the finest way to buy insurance coverage? A couple of auto insurance coverage carriers may charge a lower rate if you buy directly through them. A typical problem amongst consumers is you tend to seldom build any type of individual relationships with the business you buy direct from. Turnover amongst client service representatives can be high and you are likely to wait longer for an answer to your question or a service to your problem. And of course ... when you deal straight with an insurance coverage business, you are purchasing the policies from that business only ... not the rest of the market.

Antivirus firewall software is a must. It may be the most important software you'll ever install on your Microsoft Windows computer. As a computer user you've probably come across terms like viruses, spam, Trojan horses, worms, etc. Some of you may know what these refer to; others of you may have heard of them but have no idea what they mean. In a word they mean: DANGER! We can't emphasis this too strongly. Anytime you go online to shop or to access your email or just to surf the web you and your PC are vulnerable to attack by dangerous elements.
Plastic surgeon, Dr. Van Putten offers superior expertise and greatest value for Cayman Island Botox and Juvederm as well as surgery of the eyes, face, and neck.
All security experts and advanced users know that most malware is targeted at Windows-based computers. Every computer connected to the internet is vulnerable to viruses, fraud and infiltration. This leaves our pockets prey to the software protection industry's heavy charges to keep us safe. The best antivirus software will use the Internet to automatically update whenever a new or dangerous virus is released. Most free or cheap programs require you to manually update your software (on demand protection). The best antivirus software usually costs less than $50, so it's worth the money to keep your computer protected.
A computer virus is the most subtle of computer problems. It usually loads itself into your computer system when you run a program to which it has attached itself. From the computer system, it'll then reproduce itself, much like a biological virus would, by attaching copies of itself to other programs on your hard drive. What it does then depends on the malevolence of its creator. Viruses can be very dangerous, destroying and changing data on computers, and like human viruses, they spread very quickly. It is therefore vital to prevent their entry into the University, and limit their spread if one does gain entry.
There can be no absolute guarantees about being able to avoid virus infection, but maintaining a good defence on your computer will help to prevent them. This surprising revelation can explain why so many computer users are suffering from viruses, trojans, worms, spyware and other types of malware -- despite running anti-virus software on their computers: An antivirus program by itself, is not sufficient for providing the trouble-free operation that you expect from your computer. Perhaps upgrading your antivirus program to a more secure 'internet security suite' might enhance your PC security tremendously.

Greenwich Academic Literature Archive - Continuing Professional Development: rhetoric and practice in the NHS
This article explores the experience of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) by supervisory-level clinical staff in the National Health Service. Four main themes are highlighted in the literature, namely the nature and experience of CPD, its relationship with human resource management practices and in particular in career development and planning. These themes are examined utilising sources of (triangulated) empirical data based on a 2500 sample survey conducted across five NHS Trusts. A key finding was that responsibility for learning and development was perceived as belonging to the individual rather than the organisation. Other findings concern a lack of resource-based commitment by the organisation to CPD for clinical staff undertaking supervisory-level roles and evidence of 'credentialism' with its emphasis on seeking certificated qualifications. The findings raise concerns about the potential for clinical staff to become disillusioned and to perceive a potential breach in their psychological contract because of problems in reconciling their own interests with those of their professional body, and that of their employer in relation to CPD.

November marks National Home Care and Hospice Month and one local provider is showing their appreciation for those �unseen champions of the health care system.�
�Our people are behind the scenes, in the homes. The only people they see are their patients and their family members,� said Mark Miller, administrator of community health at MERIL. �We want to use this opportunity to thank all of caregivers for going above and beyond and doing what they do so well.�
As of 2013, approximately 3.5 million Medicare beneficiaries received home health care at a total of $17.9 billion. There were more than 12,600 agencies nationwide providing home health care as of 2013.
Angels Home Health, a part of MERIL, provides home health care for qualified homebound residents in the area. The provide in-home services � such as rehabilitation, wound care or assistance with mobility � for patients unable to travel for out-patient care.
�We tend to visit patients several times a week, as infrequently as one time a week, depending on how much family support they have,� Mr. Miller said. �We do a lot of patient teaching in terms of avoiding infection, living as healthy as possible in the recovery process to avoid re-hospitalization at Mosaic or one of the hospitals in Kansas City.�
Ultimately, one of the biggest challenges in the industry is that many people don�t like being homebound, Mr. Miller said. Per Medicare regulations, recipients can only leave the house for medical appointments and to attend their house of worship to qualify for home health care.
She's put 250,000 miles on her Honda minivan going to their homes in upstate New York. Home visits make a different kind of care possible.
"You can evaluate the person as a whole," says Miller, who has been a home care physician in Schenectady, N.Y., for more than 20 years. "You see everything that influences their health and well-being: the environment, the surrounding people, the support system, whether they had or didn't have food."
Miller spends about an hour at each house call. Conversation with patients and their family members flows so naturally that it's easy to miss that she's also checking vital signs, gently stretching a hand, noting which pill bottles are empty.
Although Miller's practice may harken back to the country doctor of decades past, it could be the future of medicine. In 2013, about 2.6 million Medicare claims were filed for patient home visits and house calls. That's up from 2.3 million visits in 2009 and 1.4 million visits in 1999, according to Medicare statistics.
The trend is expected to accelerate as baby boomers grow older. One in 20 people over the age of 65 is homebound in the U.S., according to a study published in July in JAMA Internal Medicine.
"That's just the nature of the population we treat," Miller says. "They're extremely ill. Homebound patients often have up to 12 or 13 problems, not just one."
And they're often invisible. These people could be living just down the block, and you'd never know it. Many of them never leave their homes.
Miller's patients include a 55-year-old woman with ALS who can communicate only with her eyes, a 27-year-old former quarterback left quadriplegic and in a coma after surgery on an Achilles tendon, a 92-year-old woman cared for by her daughter, and a severely depressed man who lives alone.
After the Affordable Care Act took effect in 2014, Miller saw a spike in new patient requests after Medicare reimbursements increased for people who are disabled or 65 and older.
"Now we can afford to see them and take care of them. Because they haven't had medical care, they have multiple medical needs and psychosocial needs," she says. "It has given us access to a group of people, but more importantly, they have access to us."
But reimbursements declined in 2015 because of sequestration. And now Medicaid reimbursements rates are starting to fall as well.
GW�s Health Workforce Institute has partnered with the Health Resources and Services Administration to tackle the medical issues of the future with a new study on the role of "telemedicine" � using audiovisual media and technology to treat patients from different locations. Using these long-distance methods, providers can help bridge the gap in the quality of care for patients in regions with underdeveloped health care systems.
Patricia Pittman, an associate professor of health policy and management and co-director of the Health Workforce Institute, said she and others at the research institute will spend the next year doing a study on how often remote health care has been used at certain underdeveloped sites sponsored by the National Health Service Corps, where health graduates offer services for a period of time in exchange for loan repayment.
The Health Workforce Institute has an agreement with HRSA worth about $2 million over the next four years to study various issues involving health systems. This year's roughly $500,000 budget will be used primarily to research the technology-driven health care options.
GW sent out a survey in 2010 monitoring the use of telemedicine at that time. In 2015, the institute piggy-backed on a government survey to see how its use had shifted.
Though the remote technique offers multiple benefits, including reaching underdeveloped parts of the U.S. where access to medical care isn't guaranteed, telemedicine has gotten increasing amounts of pushback legislation-wise because of the difficulty regulating it on state and federal levels.
Pittman said that providing health care across state lines requires participation from federal and state government to solve issues like differences in medical licensing standards from state to state, as well as to decide types and amounts of insurance coverage.
�The federal level is important for Medicare payment. Medicaid payment is at the state level,� Pittman said. �In addition, the regulation of scope of practice and licensure of health professionals occurs at the state level, and this is a critical area of reform that could facilitate expanded use of telehealth.�
The program would also introduce a number of cost-saving measures. A telemedicine survey conducted by the Center for Information Technology Leadership in 2007 found that by using audiovisual measures, health centers could avoid up to 850,000 transports with an estimated savings of $537 million a year.
GW�s role in remote medicine extends beyond the research from the Health Workforce Institute. The University offers a telemedicine fellowship program for doctors completing an emergency medicine residency.
Neal Sikka, an associate professor of emergency medicine and the co-chief of GW�s innovative practice section, said that telemedicine will be an important step for making sure patients across the country are receiving the same level of medical care.
He said that since the use of this type of digital diagnosis and consultation is increasing in the workplace, medical students should become proficient in the technologies while they�re still in school.
�Graduating students and resident physicians will very likely be using telehealth in their future practice, so it is important that we start to give them tools and a foundation to be able to incorporate telehealth,� he said.
Students in the telemedicine and digital health fellowship spend two years learning the ropes with clinical practice, research, teaching and collaboration with the GW Medical Faculty Associates.
�Telehealth is a powerful tool to improve access to care for patients and a new paradigm of how we can deliver care,� Sikka said. �We hope to provide them experience that would allow them to be successful managing large-scale telehealth programs in their future practice, become innovators in the space, and work with startups and other companies that are working on new technologies to support improved health and health care access.�

JESUS: This is an act of Mercy on My part. You will see your sins and understand immediately how they appear to Me. This is your chance children, to repent ... Prepare for the Warning - the Illumination of Conscience. This Mystical event which will be experienced by all of My children over seven years of age everywhere throughout the world, will take place. Those who live after this event, will be more cautious about the contents of this Sacred Book.
OUR LORD: “My beloved son: Peace be with you! I come today, to ask you to tell My children the world is in great danger. The time of the Great Tribulation is near. Let May be the signpost to the steps that will be taken to bring about many changes. Rome will fall and bring forth the Schism. The Royal House of England will have a Great Tragedy and men will see how the seven (7) years of Tribulation will be unleashed, as My Words through the Prophets of Old and New, will now unfold fully. I told My daughter, M.D.M. how things were to unfold from December 2012. Count then the years - of seven (7) years of Mercy then seven (7) years of Tribulation. Consider well what I mean, dear children. My Adversary will soon enter centre stage, as the Nations will collapse in their economies, which will bring forward what I told My daughter M.D.M. on the 16th May 2012 and all My many Prophets and Seers of the world ...”
MARY, ROSA MYSTICA: Little children, the trials for the People of God are about to begin. This year will mark the beginning of your purification. Humanity will witness great events in Heaven and on Earth; the signs of Heaven will increase; celestial phenomena never before seen by any eye will announce to you that you must be ready and prepared for your encounter with God in eternity. The shaking of the universe will let you see celestial phenomena that humanity has never seen. Many are going to panic, but there is no need to be frightened; these manifestations are announcements from Heaven so that you will be spiritually prepared at the arrival of the Warning and the beginning of your trials ...
JESUS: “To be a believer it is not enough to say, "Lord, Lord!" (Mt 7,21). I have called you to obedience and you mock My Requests. Some who do not know Sacred Scripture do not know that only one family was freed from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah: the family of Lot, a man who was pleasing in the eyes of My Father, being righteous (cf. II Peter 2,6-8). The obedience was imposed on him that no member of his family should look back, but his wife looked back and she herself stayed in her disobedience (cf. Gen 19:26).”
JESUS: “The time is approaching for My children to be purified through My Great Mercy that I will send upon the world, to enlighten My children who are in deep darkness – far worse than in the time of Noah ... I am going to bring forward the Great Illumination of conscience, so that man will wake up and be attentive to My Words and to understand that you are living in the last moments of your Earth time ... The Star in the Heavens will be bright and will be seen as the second Sun. This will be a sign to you, My children, the Great Event will take place. The world will be purified ...”
Dear Children of God, ... Many souls are anxious about the coming Warning, the Third World War and the coming chastisements of recent times. How does that relate to all that has been revealed in the Book of the Prophet Daniel and the Apocalypse of Saint John?
OUR LADY: This indignation in which some are living, this folly that some are maintaining, this indifference, this disobedience in which some of My children are living permanently, will pierce their hearts with pain, because when they want to get away from the tentacles of evil, they will not be able to leave, because they will have already trapped them in them and will fight harder so that their souls do not belong to My Son and so that their conscience be nullified and that they do not feel the need to seek My Son. As Mother, I grieve over this ...
ETERNAL FATHER: I am a God of Mercy and I want to take back all My creatures to the Holy Fold. You are not able to understand how Love, the true and Holy Love, has been really conceived. Only creatures close to Me (in the Kingdom of Heaven) are able to love in all the real element of the Divine and Holy Love. Incomparable to the feeling you understand at earthly level, My children. This is this [the] reason why even the most hardened sinner with the most hardened heart, would sadden Me to lose ...

The eye can be analyzed with relative ease as to both its function and its structure. A functional examination consists of the ability to move in the orbit and the response of the pupil to light and accommodation.
The function of the eye may be tested in numerous ways. The client might be asked to recognize illuminated letter or things of differing sizes on what is called the Snellen chart.
Conversely, the evaluation of the structural part of the eye might be made in several methods. Tension within the eyeball is measured by a "tonometer." In specific diseases, specifically in glaucoma, the stress in the eyeball is increased considerably.
It must be well remembered that a client with an eye problem might have other problems. Often other physical conditions are main and impact the eye as a effect. The appearance of the eye can notify the client and the doctor to troubles in some disruptions of other parts of the body even prior to other signs present themselves.
One's reliance on sight is highlighted when one faces a possible or short-term irreversible loss of this essential sense. Thus, when restorative measures are looked for, certain types of vision correction such as contact lenses or glasses are recommended.
On the other hand, some people are troubled with the reality that they have actually some framed lenses or contact lenses in front of their eyes.
For this factor, advanced surgical operations were established to encourage decreased usage of contact lenses or glasses. One of which is the now popular LASIK eye surgery.
Essentially, LASIK eye surgical treatment is the short-term for "Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis." Like its concrete equivalent, why not try this out LASIK eye surgical treatment is another kind of vision correction. The only distinction is that with this type of surgery, one's vision is remedied completely.
With LASIK eye surgical treatment, the refractive mistakes in the cornea are completely transformed. This can be done using an "excimer laser."
The primary purpose of this surgical treatment is to create a threadlike, rounded "flap" in the cornea using a blade understood as "microkeratome." In a series of unfolding and laser processing, the cornea is lastly reformed, allowing much better the eye to direct more light into the retina.
Amidst the growing appeal of read this post here LASIK eye surgery, there are still disadvantages that people must understand. Most likely, the primary reason that this kind of eye surgery has actually become well accepted is since the majority of its cases had actually succeeded.
Due to the fact that LASIK eye surgical treatment includes the operation of the retina, which is one of the most sensitive parts of the eye, many people say that the operation can be extremely risky.
To puts it simply, a easy error might nearly cause an individual's life time blindness. It is crucial to think about lots of aspects before deciding whether LASIK eye surgery is the right corrective procedure one has to go through.
LASIK eye surgical treatment may correct your vision however it does not always suggest that it can provide you a twenty-twenty. Even if analytical reports show that 70% of the clients might have 20/20 vision, this does not always imply they have ideal vision too.
Offered all these things, it can be deduced that, in spite of the popularity of the operation, LASIK may not always be the perfect eye surgery the method many people view it
Alternatively, the assessment of the structural part of the eye may be made in numerous ways. It must be well remembered that a patient with an eye issue may have other problems. Frequently other physical conditions are primary and impact the eye as a effect. The look of the eye can inform the doctor and the client to difficulties in some disruptions of other parts of the body even before other symptoms present themselves.

Fox and Obel is a charming little gourmet grocer here in Chicago. I fell in love with their bakery the instant I peered into the case. In case you don’t know, I love desserts (as do most women). It is my one big vice. I’m not a smoker, or heavy drinker. I don’t buy riduculously expensive clothes or purses. I don’t drive a sporty car. But I do love me some dessert.
So I carefully selected 4 desserts on my first trip and 2 on my second. I brought them back to the room and sampled each little heavenly treat. They were wonderfully decadent and I am quite glad I decided to indulge. But I didn’t leave you out…

I am here today to brag about my new friend Darth Vadar. That is right, you heard me. I am friends with the baddest ass in a galaxy far, far away and you know how I know this? Because Digg says so. Yep just the other day I got an email saying Darth Vadar wanted to be me friend. How can I say no to that and not expect to drop to the floor struggling for air. So as fast as the Millennium Falcon enters lightspeed I accepted and became friends.
Are you friends with Darth (that is what his friends call him)? Yeah well if you are not and want to I can hook you up with D with a handy link below.
Okay so without any more bragging, here is a list of the coolest people that I am friends with on Digg. Before you comment and point out the obvious, I know they are not real (or are they?). But you know what, it still sounds cool when I tell my non-Internet friends who I was shouting with all day long. Yep I need to find a life.
Almost as cool as Darth is me being friends with the leader of the Autobots. I have to admit growing up I was more of a Decepticon kind of guy but this works.
Now this one could either be one of the boys from Pearl Jam or the guy who played in the NBA. Doesn’t matter, they are both cool to me. Nice try trying to throw me off with the spelling.
Neil Patrick Harris you can’t fool me. I have been telling all my friends that we exchange Diggs. Can’t believe you did not grab Digg-ie Howser as a screen name though.
Always been a fan of Spike so this was cool getting to send him shouts and my ideas for a new music video.
Digg has never been so cool. I bet making stories popular helps ease the pain of knowing his kids have a freak for a mom. Keep those shouts coming K-Fed. I always Digg your stuff.
Wow, this could be the holy mother of Digg friends, pardon the pun. My Mum was so happy when I told her I had made friends with God. She told me that she knew the day would come and that she looks forward to me going to church on Sunday. Little does she know, I will probably be sending shouts instead.
If you had even the smallest laugh over the last 47 seconds, I invite you to add me to your Digg list. If not, it was fun guiding you around today and I promise that Mr. Buzz Pirate will be back soon to restore some kind of order.

Today we post the walkthrough for level 1-13 of episode On Finn Ice (Angry Birds Seasons). The level is easier than previous ones.
First you have to fire the Blue Birds to the red-nosed pigs in the upper part of the level. You have to divide the blue Birds before shooting the first pig, like we show you below:
With some luck, you will kill all the red-nosed pigs and the pig on the sleigh. Also if you are lucky you may kill the two small pigs on the tree and the pig with the axe. Sometimes one of these pigs will survive, don't worry, you can kill it with some of the next usable birds.
After that, launch Tony (the Big Blue Bird) and, with its effect, smash the boiler at the bottom of the wooden structure. If it's done correctly, you will kill all the birds of the zone.
The last part is to use Chuck (the Yellow Bird) to remove any remaining pig of the level. Depending on your luck, you must change the trajectory of the bird to kill the different remaining pigs (it could be one of the upper pigs, the pig with axe or the small pigs on the tree).

WASHINGTON (January 22, 2016) — Existing-home sales snapped back solidly in December as more buyers reached the market before the end of the year, and the delayed closings resulting from the rollout of the Know Before You Owe initiative pushed a portion of November's would-be transactions into last month's figure, according to the National Association of Realtors®. Led by the South and West, all four major regions saw large increases in December.
REALTORS® who responded to the November 2015 survey expected prices to increase by 3.2 percent over the next 12 months (3.2 percent in October 2015; 3.0 percent in November 2014).9 REALTORS® expect the recent strong price growth to moderate as rising prices have made homes "unaffordable” for many, according to the November 2015 REALTORS® Confidence Index Survey Report.
The homeownership rate in the fourth quarter 2015 was 63.8 percent, down 0.2 (+/- 0.4)* percentage points from the fourth quarter 2014 rate of 64.0 percent. The homeownership rates in the Northeast, Midwest, South and West were not statistically different from the rates in the fourth quarter 2014.
Sales of new single-family houses in December 2015 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 544,000. This is 10.8 percent (+/- 17.1%)* above the revised November 2015 estimate of 491,000.

President Anders Bjarklev and Carsten Toft Boesen, Managing Director of NIRAS, have just signed an agreement on a strategic partnership, which will result in enhanced cooperation in the areas of research, innovation, and education, particularly in the fields of food and manufacturing engineering, infrastructure, and transport.
This agreement means that DTU and NIRAS will formulate and carry out research and development projects within the next generation of food production facilities with focus on health and food safety. They will also focus on changes in modes of transport, for instance driverless buses, and how this affects safety and infrastructure as a whole. The projects involve several departments, primarily DTU Food, DTU Chemical Engineering, DTU Management Engineering, and DTU Civil Engineering.
"It is of great value that a company such as NIRAS is willing to collaborate with us on inspiring students."
A number of innovation events, ‘hackatons’, workshops, and mentor programmes will be arranged to stimulate student interests in developing new innovative ideas within the field and to show them the opportunities in working at NIRAS.
“DTU has always emphasized maintaining close dialogues with the companies that hire our graduates. But we’re particularly thrilled to enter into more binding collaboration with special focus on the fields of food technology, infrastructure, and transport. It’s also of great value that a company such as NIRAS is willing to collaborate with us on inspiring students,” says President Anders Bjarklev, DTU.
“Close collaboration with DTU is in NIRAS’ DNA. DTU is our most important source of new employees and new knowledge. With this agreement, we ensure increased top management focus, more structure, and follow-up on both sides. In the areas of food and transport, we wish to raise this relationship to the same high level that we already know from, for instance, environment, supply, and construction in the form of teaching, exam projects, and PhD projects,” says Carsten Toft Boesen, Managing Director of NIRAS.
Department of Civil Engineering carries out teaching and research in a number of building relevant courses and subjects, as well as contributes to the establishment of social and commerical values through building technical knowledge and development

I was at my school reunion at the weekend. It was…well, hard to describe unless you were there, in which case, you won’t need my inadequate attempts to explain the gamut of emotions. If, as is more likely, you weren’t there, I hope this may give you an inkling: it was amazing and comfortable, funny and sad, euphoric and exhausting, novel and familiar…I could go on with the contrasts, but I’m sure you get the idea.
Meh! you might think, it was just a bunch of people you probably lost touch with for a reason and won’t want to see again, but you’d be wrong. When we were there, it was a convent and private boarding school*. (Yes, that’s right, I’m a convent girl and I’m not a nun, make of that what you will).
Some were day girls, others were weekly boarders, the rest of us inmates full boarders lived in close proximity, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for most of the year. The result was close bonds and fleeting enmities, but mostly, independence and an ability to cope with deprivation (inadequate food, hard loo paper, cold, a lack of home comforts and family – we were part-time orphans). It was a strange way to grow up and I sometimes wonder whether, had any of us gone to prison, we’d have slotted in comfortably to the institutionalised regime or even if we would have found it easier than a childhood boarding school.
There was also very little to do out of school hours, with very limited TV privileges (explicit permission was needed to watch specified programmes), other than read or roam and roam we did. Fortunately, the grounds were extensive and as feral youngsters we climbed trees, built dens in the bushes, fished for newts in the swimming pool (disused) and foraged. We staved off starvation with apples from the orchards (sadly, now almost all gone), sweet chestnuts, rhubarb and gooseberries, even dandelions leaves and if we were very lucky, the odd bit of cake from one of the kind kitchen nuns. As we grew up and roaming rights extended beyond the school grounds, we walked…and walked…and walked. It’s incredible to think how much we walked: all around the school grounds, to the village and the reservoir, to neighbouring villages and even the 4 miles or so into town if we didn’t have the bus fare.
This weekend we reminisced about all these things and many more with a mixture of astonishment (how could I have forgotten that?**), sadness (at least two of our class are no longer with us), sometimes regret (how terribly ignorant we were of one another’s emotional fragility and how totally incapable of dealing with it) and even horror (the brief employment of an accused kiddy-fiddler as a teacher, the glut of oranges during the mercury scare). Mostly, though, we remembered our times together and the high jinks we perpetrated with a good deal of laughter and vows to get together again soon. The curious thing about old friendships is that the passage of time is inconsequential – you see one another as before and pick up where you left off.
**I had forgotten that I once snapped and horsewhipped a girl for needling me that bit too far. All present agreed that she thoroughly deserved it, but I’d forgotten the incident completely until reminded. I still have the riding crop. You have been warned ;D
When I left the gathering, it was with sadness, knowing that even with the best will in the world, there will be people I’ll probably never see again. Life will get in the way, the initial enthusiasm and will to meet up will wear off over time, the location may be inconvenient and a whole host of other possible hindrances. The truth is that we have grown up, made our lives and don’t need one another any more. Equally true, however, is that our lives will be richer for retaining these youthful alliances…if only to fill the gaps in our own failing memories. The sum of our experiences lies in part with those who shared them.
Ania – that’s lovely. Not the horse-whipping bit, of course. Although I DO regard myself as now officially warned lol!
We often forget parts of ourselves as we grow older (I was going to say, ‘grow up’ lol!) and it is good to recapture those lost elements of ourselves. Mind you, I’d have to say that I think that the horse-whupping bit of you was never left behind 😀
Actually, it wasn’t all that bad. Some people had a really dreadful time of it, but I was very young when I went, so it seemed normal to me. I perhaps over-played the Dickensian deprivation in my post. Not quite Mallory Towers jolly hockey sticks, but not Oliver Twist either. The food was awful, but we had a fair bit of freedom to once we were old enough to be left unsupervised and you wouldn’t believe some of the stories I could tell you of what the girls got up to (and got away with) LOL

Hi Morten, I was kind of disappointed when I read all three of these articles here. While the article is very well written I would have liked to seen the companion photos that accompany this article be more representive of the more formal approach to display that you are trying to convey. It is very easy to see the simularities to Gafu in your own efforts, yet you have shown photos of your trees rather than for the sake of education, show photo's from a correct perspective.
I mean in each example you list the positives and then the negative Why list the negatives, it should be proper period! I mean if you knew it was wrong why did you do it? For instance you mentioned in one composition that you felt it was alright to include so many accent plants because they help convey the season. In many three point displays one accent conveys the season. Wouldn't 5 or 6 be a little overkill? Isn't less is more appropriate in display also? I mentioned in my stand profile that Westerners tend to overcrowd Shohin racks and that I do not build as many shelves, so that overcrowding can not happen. Blank shelves can add as much impact as a shelf full of plants, maybe more.
I also wish to make a observation. In your third image you mention that the tree on top has movement towards the center of the display. While the trunk may have some movement to the left, the trunk forms an open "c" which makes the tree move to the right in my eyes. When I squint my eyes I seem to follow the top tree right out of the picture and never get focused on whats going on down below.
First I will like to explain that the three articles are not tied up closely to each other, and only are covering a part of this big subject. It is individually written articles, each written with a specific objective, but of course with a context approaching Shohin-bonsai display. The articles must be read that way, because they describe different objectives regarding display issues, but selected by AoB to be published here in a row. This is very fine I think.
Well, my goal with this article, which like the other articles originally was published at my personal website, is to show my considerations regarding the displays shown. I think it can be educational for others to go through some of the details of these displays, and read the considerations regarding good and bad parts of the chosen displays.
It is easy to show a high quality display, and tell this is the way to do it. Showing errors or details that can be approved, expands the understanding further I think.
First of all I think it has educational purposes to show displays that are not perfect, and tell pro and contras regarding the choices made. This also is the case when teaching bonsai in general.
If you only show the perfect examples it is more difficult to understand what must be avoided. Showing faults or possible improvements, adds detail to the explanations. My purpose isn?t to show ?how good I am? but to bring on my knowledge and experiences, and hopefully someone will benefit a little from this.
Many enthusiasts do not have a large bucketload of exhibition quality trees ready and therefore they cannot make a high quality exhibition standard display with the material at hand. I find it valuable to teach what realistically can be done with less perfect material available, and of course show what consequences that has for the display. Even at worldwide only very few people have high quality material at hand to make high quality display all year round.
It is killing the art, if only the very high levelled bonsai and displays are shown as educational examples, because this makes the art of bonsai unachievable for many.
The one doesn?t exclude the other though, so both good and less good examples must be shown for inspiration and educational value.
The less is more term also covers the set up of displays. But I pointed out that (according to the Japanese guidelines) it is ?allowed? to replace some trees with accents or ornaments, if not enough trees are available. This is the point. I didn?t tell to overload the display. None of the shown displays are overloaded.
The Mame-bonsai display contains more items, because the smaller trees have to fill the same area as the larger Shohin-bonsai. You will see the same when studying Japanese exhibitions.
The importance is the use of surrounding space when observing the full display area, which gives the Mame-display peace. The Mame display also has a different aesthetic approach than the larger Shohin, allowing more freedom in the display.
I am not sure that westerners in general overcrowd their displays as you claim? In Europe I have seen many displays well balanced, using space well.
There may be differences from how a Japanese Shohin display is set up, but these aesthetically differences is also found when selecting pots for bonsai, or when styling bonsai. So it should be. We make art based on Japanese traditions, but our western culture influences our approach and how we do the art. Nothing wrong with that I think.
Maybe we will develop another way of displaying in future, when we gain experience and are apple to approach the art freer and more artistically, than rigidly following the Japanese taught guidelines.
My personal view is that Japanese Shohin-bonsai displays, although many are very beautiful, in general are too formal presented. But even from a Japanese point of view, Shohin-Bonsai are much freer and relaxed presented, than standard bonsai at display. It is possible to play with coloured pots much more and the seasonal approach makes it possible to use species not often used for larger bonsai. In spite of the Shohin displaying being less formal than larger bonsai displays, the Japanese are still too formal to my taste. The main tree placed on top of the rack, often is a formal styled Black pine, lacking interest and impact. It would be nice to see more dramatic trees or just other specimens than the traditional Black pine used at this position.
As westerners I think we are less bound to traditions, so we can enjoy another approach, making more interesting and livelier displays.
But we also see things differently as individuals. Especially when dealing with an art form, we can?t always agree ? and we don?t have to. Also the art of bonsai is personal, although general technical guidelines can be harmonised to some basic level.
You might think the main tree moves to the left as you mention. I don?t. Who is right? Maybe we both are right? I have heard this kind of discussion much lately. But the directions of some trees are not so clearly readable as desired for a westerner. Some trees have movements in the trunk giving a direction to the right, but the branches lead left. The question is if this has great importance in all cases? Some trees work both ways, and will work equally well for both directions. A little like trees that have more than one possible front.
I hope my explanation deepens out the subject a little although you might not agree with me at all points. -:)
Thank you for a very interesting exchange. I'm learning from reading it -- but perhaps even more importantly, reading these articles and the discussion that follows has me all fired up to go out and play with display options for my trees, to try to improve upon what I can do in my back yard. And that, I think, is more than anything else what I hoped to achieve with this website -- a venture that is both educational and that generates further enthusiasm for working to improve the artistic aspects of bonsai and bonsai display.
One possible resolution of one point of difference: I'd agree with Al that in the USA, people tend to badly overload shohin displays. Al has organized and promoted shohin-specific shows, so I'm sure he's seen this even more directly than I have. But yeah, it's a problem in this country. We're only now starting to move away from the "they're just shohin, pack them all onto one big table at random" mentality in our club shows. From what I've seen from Europe, shohin tend to be treated with a bit more sophistication.
One thing that I am interested in is finding ways to create aesthetically attractive growing spaces where my trees can spend every day. After all, even if I do lots of formal display, I'll spend 99% of my time looking at my trees in their growing environment in my yard. So I want to find ways to display my trees in highly informal settings outside, in their growing areas. I've made some headway with displaying my larger trees, setting them out on my back patio on single tables, coupled with accents (no stands or matts, of course).
I've yet to find equally good solutions for my shohin trees. Do you keep your shohin trees in display-like environments? Any thoughts on how to do so?

Plot Marge has problems adjusting to making love with Homer, who leaves the house. He sees a billboard for a school offering extension courses. He goes to the school and attempts to take a course on stripping for his wife, which Dr. Hibbert teaches, but is kicked out until he ends up in the Successmanship 101 class. The class teaches Homer how people can succeed in the workplace. It gives Homer inspiration, and he investigates problems at the power plant, so he develops solutions to the problems all of which are rejected by Mr. Burns, without reading them. This angers Homer after overhearing Burns admit that the plant's real owner is a canary to protect Burns from responsibility for any wrongdoing by the power plant. Homer, with Bart's help, devises a plan to overthrow Burns by releasing the bird from the plant to the Canary Islands. After the bird is released, he tells Mr. Burns that inspectors are here to check the condition of the plant. Out of panic, Mr. Burns, who is unable to find his canary, names Homer the new owner. Homer reveals that it was all a ruse: there are no inspectors; and he had tricked Mr. Burns. As Homer's first act during his brief tenure as the plant's owner, he fires Mr. Burns.
However, problems ensue when Homer is in charge of the plant. He has less time to do things with the family, much to their disappointment. He is forced to lay off employees at the plant, making himself quite unpopular there. He has to listen to the plant's woes from his analysts, while on vacation. One night, Mr. Burns visits Homer and shows him the people who he has missed. He makes Homer understand how much he has missed his family. So Homer decides to quit as the owner and give back ownership to Burns. However, Burns already has plans to take back ownership of the plant and drugs Homer. He then manages to cart an unconscious Homer to the cemetery, where he wants to encase him in the wall of a crypt. Unfortunately for Burns, he is too weak to carry each brick from the cart to the intended wall. By the time he manages to finish a couple of layers, it's daytime. Homer wakes up and steps easily over the few layers of bricks that Mr. Burns had painstakingly managed to cement in place. He tells Burns that the power plant is his again and walks away. The next time we see Homer, he is having a barbecue with his family and loving it.

We need a new politics of ecology, write Matt Hern and Am Johal – one which transforms our relationships to each other, to other species, to the land, and to the future.
Capitalism is nothing if not a sophisticated ordering operation of a given population: a secular religion with a theological belief in markets and their myriad disciplinary methods. Capital’s ability to constantly create and re-create itself wipes away the trauma and memory of disaster. Tradition under capitalism is constantly being reinvented to suit new languages of accumulation and dispossession, and accumulation by dispossession. In our view, conversations around oil, global warming, and crisis are potentially very dangerous when they are defined by capital and the state because, ultimately, they reveal a particular faith: a faith in a capitalist paradigm of beautiful destruction. From the perspective of capital, global warming is seen as an opportunity that should be faithfully exploited.
Walter Benjamin often described capitalism as religion. In a 1921 essay, he wrote that “Capitalism is entirely without precedent, in that it is a religion which offers not the reform of existence but its complete destruction. It is the expansion of despair, until despair becomes a religious state of the world in the hope that this will lead to salvation.” It’s difficult not to think of such an apocalyptic vision of capitalism as simultaneously one of religion and destruction, and how this idea reveals the antagonistic relationship between capital and the other-than-human world. We’re intrigued by the idea of change as a kind of tradition. Wrapped in the history of modernity, beyond the desire for newness, is the reflex of progress that holds so much of history in contempt. Any history that doesn’t fit with capitalist narratives is cast as an obstruction, a blockage to the flow of the new, to be discarded and forgotten.
Presenting capitalism and development as the only possible form of progressive social ordering is a move toward closure in thinking about change. Today, what is being presented, at least in the narrow frame of the Global North, is that there is no modernity other than a capitalist one. Theorizing an ecological future requires a rupture between capitalism and modernity. The challenge is to construct new ideas of change while reimagining what we talk about when we talk about tradition, especially when we (and we mean that in the general “we,” but more pressingly in the particular—i.e., the two of us) carry so many contradictory, confusing, and often revanchist traditions with us.
Among the most central narratives of capital is exploitation, a close cousin of domination. We get a clearer glimpse of an ecological future when the classical Marxist rendition of exploitation is extended beyond human relations. As Glen Coulthard articulated: “We have to extend our concern with exploitation of labor to other-than-human communities. Exploitation is an instrumental relation to the other. It’s a condition that views all other things as existing for our consumption and gain. The main problem with exploitation is a lack of consideration of others as agents themselves, and a corresponding lack of informed consent to the power relations that affect them.”
Understanding the exploitation of labor—the extraction of surplus value from human bodies—is foundational to understanding capitalism. It is necessary but insufficient for understanding the task of ecology. Coulthard continues: “Marxists tend to focus too much on accumulation, too much on the body and labor: it’s too anthropocentric an understanding, in my view. In presenting class struggle as universal struggle, it is very parochial because we have to face the larger ecological life sphere that we all live within.” Extending our understanding of exploitation opens up a wider set of political possibilities and can help us think through global warming to larger ecological questions:
What if we start to think about exploitation that doesn’t just happen to labor? What is exploitation? Decisions made over another without their substantive input or consent. It’s the extraction from another without a consideration of them, or our ethical relationship to them as such. They’re just instrumental—just a means to an end. We have a language of exploitation that needs to be stripped of its narrower definition in the anthropocentric Marxist sense. The alternative would be nonexploitative, nondominating relationships governed by ethical relationships to the other. Others being comrades, conationals, neighbors and crucially, in a wider sense, other-than-human relations. Exploitation gives us a language that crosses political and anthropocentric ideas.
Reaching past narrow definitions of exploitation to consider the other-than-human world allows us to speak of domination more broadly. It opens us up to what nonexploitative, nondominating relationships might require politically, but it also demands alternatives. How can we deploy existing languages and understandings of exploitation to build new definitions of ecology? One route to answering that question that we are especially fond of is Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben’s speculative invocation of Alexandre Kojeve’s use of the term la dolce vita or douceur de vivre—the sweetness of living, the good life, or the sweet life.
These ideas describe what he argues is a common attitude in Spain, Italy, and southern Europe that is qualitatively different from the Protestant work ethic of northern European countries. Agamben claims this attitude describes a wholly different relationship to the future, a recovery of time, a resistance to capitalism, and the preservation of a significant way of living: the capacity to define life as something outside of work. He notes that the ongoing, recurring, and deepening economic crises in Europe are being used as instruments of rule, but might be better thought of as one rendition of the sweetness of life resisting discipline.
Our point here is not to argue for or against Agamben’s thesis per se, but that his articulation of a different way of being in the world is a particularly relevant rupture. Just its invocation is a powerful claim. It is these ruptures in capitalist certainties that are so critical: articulating alternative possible relationships to each other, to other species, to the land, and to the future.
Every alternative to the logics of domination, every practiced alternative worldview constructs the outlines of potential new modern traditions that are called for today and the possibilities for constructing new kinds of freedom. In a time when even the unconscious is being colonized by capital, radical articulations of change become indispensable acts of resistance. For the past century, capitalism has ingested Marxism and let out a satisfying burp. For some, there is no crisis today; for them, the world can happily go on as it is.
Capital, in its own narrative construction, has historically solved its ecological problems by counting the other-than-human world as externalities, mere objects for our use. For many, freedom is nothing more than the freeing of capital from constraints—but any progressive renovation of the idea of freedom has to be affirmative: a freedom to, not a freedom from. Ecology has to speak to all kinds of people in all kinds of circumstances, as a change that can be materially exercised in the concrete world by masses of people.
The challenge of global warming often feels overwhelming and disorienting, and confuses traditional political cartographies. We’re faced with a dismaying constellation of political responses ranging from straight denial to geo-engineering to authoritarian state solutions to consumerist pressure to state-led transitionalism to supranationalism to relocalization—and so much else. The existing categories of responses are neither exclusive nor exhaustive, and most people occupy multiple positions at once: we all often believe many discordant things simultaneously. There are often real gaps between where our beliefs lie and our actions land. Positions and solutions are liquid; they tend to overlap and bleed into one another, and move across boundaries.
The vast majority of global warming scholarship, however, marginalizes or ignores the politics of land, its historical trajectory and its practical consequences. We are convinced that linking the domination of people to the domination of land and the other-than-human world is a key to grasping an ecological future. We would go even further to suggest that any robust ecological discourses have to start with decolonization and thoroughly renovated land politics. The right question here might be: “How do our relationships with land inform and order the way humans conduct relationships with each other and other-than-human beings?”
New modern traditions today need to define freedom through equality, through differentiation and complexity, through a relationship with land and other-than-human beings. In so doing, we can recover a reconstituted understanding of what the sweetness of living might mean today. This is our starting point for grappling with ecology, but as we embarked on this project we weren’t entirely sure what that might mean to our everyday lives. We want to search further: beyond our keyboards, beyond our familiar milieus and tidy consensual nods. We want to think about global warming and the possibility of an ecological future in conversation with people who have very different politics from our own. We want to find definitions of ecology that place land at its center.
This is an edited extract from ‘Global Warming and the Sweetness of Life: A Tar Sands Tale‘, published by MIT Press.
Amphiprion akindynos, also known as the Barrier Reef anemonefish or clownfish, is native to the Western Pacific. Amphiprion akindynos is primarily found in the waters of the Great Barrier Reef of Australia and in the adjacent Coral Sea. It has also been found in waters off of northern New South Wales, New Caledonia, sections of the Indian Ocean and around the Loyalty Islands. There is some question as to whether A. akindynos also inhabits the waters around Sri Lanka. (Randall, et al., 1990)
Amphiprion akindynos inhabits reef waters and lagoons between 1 and 25 meters deep with temperatures ranging from 10 to 32 degrees Celsius. They are found in nature swimming in and closely around the tentacles of their host anemone. They are able to live and make shelter among the tentacles of anemones without being harmed by the nematocysts (stinging cells) present on the anemone’s tentacles. According to Allen (1980), A. akindynos are protected from possible stings by a special substance which is present in their external mucous covering. This substance does not actually protect them from the stinging cells. “Instead, it lowers the threshold of nematocyst discharge. In other words, it prevents the stinging cells from firing.” Host species of anemone for A. akindynos are: Entacmaea quadricolor, Heteractis aurora, H. crispa, H. magnifica, Stichodactyla haddoni, and S. mertensii. (Allen, 1980; Allen, 1991; Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002; Randall, et al., 1990)
The body and head of adult A. akindynos are both a brownish orange color. Two black-edged white bars encircle the body. The first bar runs across the top of the head just behind the eye and can be discontinuous and constricted (thin). The second stripe runs around the body at the mid portion of the dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle and caudal fin are both white. Amphiprion akindynos individuals have 10 to 11 dorsal spines, 14 to 17 dorsal soft rays, 2 anal spines, and 13 to 14 soft anal rays.
Juveniles are usually brown with three thick white bars. Sub-adults are usually yellow with two thin white bars. Both adults and juveniles and are often confused with A. clarkii and A. chrysopterus. However, A. clarkii have a more distinct color difference between their body and tail than adult A. akindynos and A. chrysopterus tend to have a darker orange color with bluish bars. (Allen, 1991; Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002)
The larval period of A. akindynos ranges from about 8 to 12 days. Although not known for certain, many believe that during this period the larvae are planktonic, “living in the surface waters of the ocean, where they are passively transported by currents” (Fautin and Allen, 1992). At the end of this period, the fish will descend to the bottom of the sea and begin to acquire the color patterns associated with juveniles. Once they get to the bottom, the young will begin to search for a host anemone. Without the protection of the anemone there is a high likelihood that a fish will be eaten by its predators and there is evidence that there is a high mortality rate at this stage of development (Fautin and Allen, 1992).
Arvedlund et. al. (2000) have found evidence that A. akindynos imprint onto their host anemone during their larval stage and are able to follow a trail of chemicals released by this host anemone, thus allowing these fish to return to the same species of host anemone to live and spawn. However, once returning to their host anemone a fish cannot simply swim into the anemone because it may get stung. According to Fautin and Allen (1992) it can take several hours to become fully acclimated to the anemone once it is located. The acclimation process consists of a series of progressively longer contacts with the tentacles. A. akindynos are initially protected from nematocyst stings by a thick mucus coat. However, over the acclimation process, the clownfish incorporates anemone mucus into its own coat until the anemone no longer stings it, apparently recognizing the fish as part of itself.
Even once a fish locates a host anemone it is not guaranteed a place to live. Within the anemone, there is an intricate social hierarchy. All A. akindynos begin life as males. Within a given anemone, the largest fish is the female and the next largest fish is her mate. There can be several other males in this structure; however, they generally do not have much chance of mating. If the female dies, the next largest male will become a female and the second largest male will become the new mate. In this structure the female is the dominant fish and her mate is the second most dominate. The remainder of the fish must compete and fight for a place in the anemone.
Mated pairs occupy the same anemone. Several days prior to spawning, there is increased social interaction between A. akindynos males and females. Usually the male becomes more aggressive and will pursue and bite his mate. He also displays himself either in front of his mate or beside her by fully extending his dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. During this time, the male also selects a nest site, usually on bare rock adjacent to the host anemone. The male will spend considerable time clearing the site of algae and debris using his mouth. Sometimes the female will join in. Spawning usually occurs during the morning hours and can last from about 30 minutes to more than two hours. The female will swim in a zig-zag path over the nest with her belly brushing its surface. This brushing causes several eggs from her ovipositor to be dislodged. The male will follow behind the female and fertilize the eggs as they are laid. This will continue until all eggs have been dislodged. (Arvedlund, et al., June 2000; Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002; Richardson, et al., 1997)
The number of eggs deposited can range from about 100 to over 1000, depending on the size of the fish and on previous experience. The eggs are elliptical and are about 3 to 4 mm in length. They adhere to the nest surface by a tuft of short filaments. The eggs will incubate six to seven days before hatching. (Arvedlund, et al., June 2000; Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002; Richardson, et al., 1997)
Barrier reef anemonefish are hermaphroditic, with young developing into males first and only later into females if conditions are appropriate.
Individuals generally live between 6 and 10 years in the wild. However, as noted earlier, there is a high mortality rate during the larval, fry, and juvenile stages, which correspond to life stages when the fish do not necessarily have the protection of a host anemone.
They have been known to live up to 18 years in captivity. (Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002)
As noted before, Amphiprion akindynos has a very interesting social structure. There is a single dominant female in each social group who is the largest of all the fish inhabiting an anemone. She has a single male mate who is the second largest fish. Between two and four other smaller males can also live in the anemone. There is generally an amicable relationship between the female and her mate, and any aggression by the female is displayed as ritualized, non-harmful behaviors. However, aggression is more pronounced between the all of the males. There is a distinct pecking order where the largest male spends time chasing and bullying the next largest male, who in turn bullies the smaller fishes. Attacks may be so severe as to drive away the smallest fish (generally the newest member of the hierarchy) who must find another anemone to live in or die. Again, as noted before, when the female dies, the largest male will assume her position. Almost immediately after she is gone, the largest male will begin displaying behaviors similar to the previous female. Within days the male will actually change sexes and become female and the next largest male will become the mate. (Fautin and Allen, 1992; Carver, 2002)
Barrier Reef anemonefish use visual cues to communicate among themselves. Chemical communication via their protective mucous covering is essential to their symbiosis with anemones.
Barrier Reef anemonefish primarily eat algae and zooplankton. Copepods and larval tunicates are among the most common items found when their stomach contents are analyzed. The adult pair of fish (the female and her mate) are the largest fish in the social hierarchy. They tend to stray further from the host anemone to gather food than do the smaller non-dominate fish. It is speculated that one reason for the rapid growth of the mate and the second dominate male when the female dies is that the fish can spend more time feeding and less time competing for a place to live. (Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002)
Amphiprion akindynos avoid being preyed on by other larger fish by staying in and around their host anemone. As described above, they have a substance in the mucous covering their bodies, making it possible for them to touch the tentacles and not get stung. Predators will avoid getting stung by the tentacles of the host anemone and thus A. akindynos will be safe from larger fish. They may occasionally be preyed on when they are away from a host anemone, either as juveniles looking for a host, or when ejected from their host territory by another anemonefish. (Allen, 1980)
Amphiprion akindynos have a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with their host anemones. This arrangement works for both Amphiprion akindynos and their host. Without the anemone’s protection and shelter, Amphiprion akindynos are quickly consumed. Conversely Amphiprion akindynos fight off intruders, such as anemone-eating butterflyfish that would otherwise prey on the anemone. Additionally there may be some benefit to the anemone from the fishes’ feeding. Bits of food may drop onto the host and help feed it. It has also been suggested that the fish assists in keeping the anemone clean. The fish moving in and out of the anemone helps to create currents of water, which assist bringing food to the anemone and also in keeping it free of debris. (Allen, 1980; Fautin and Allen, 1992; Froese and Pauly, 2002; Randall, et al., 1990)
Amphiprion akindynos is popular in the aquarium trade and is an important member of the ecosystems in which they live. They contribute to the color and interest of reef ecosystems, thereby attracting tourism. Amphiprion species are important as research organisms in understanding mutualism.

I believe in empowering creatives with artistry and technique so they may cultivate more courage and truth in their work.
At the core of every performer is the truth of what makes them unique – who they really are. By enhancing your strengths and qualities - already alive within you – I am able to clearly pinpoint blind spots in a safe and supportive environment so you can, not only, activate your own impulse, but trust it.
Helping artists get out of their own way so they begin to trust that they’re “enough” is the core of my work. It’s what lights me up most.
My 20 year career on Broadway, television, film, and concert stages has provided me a methodology to help clients secure their own Broadway, film and television credits, as well as get accepted into the countries best M.F.A. programs (A.R.T., A.C.T. and more). Pulling from a variety of sources, including Viewpoints, Meisner, and sense memory, I work with both internal and external approaches to help stimulate process-oriented results that are not only sustainable, but also exciting.
I’m also the co-founder and creator of Base Camp, a coaching intensive for creatives with life coach Di Ana Pisarri. And, as a Vedic Meditation teacher, I believe by combining both body and mind, you can access avenues of inspiration and practical knowledge that can help re-engineer your creativity and life from the inside out, in a way that feels possible.
I look forward to helping you bring that unique creativity into every audition and room in your life.
Mark is a remarkable teacher and human, in that he immediately reminds you why you got into this business in the first place. My audition game took a HUGE step up after coaching with him. The sense of play and fun that he encourages is unmatched by anyone else I've worked with. He works with actors and breaks down scenes in very practical and smart ways so that you can succeed in giving the most kickass audition you can, in addition to helping you make the audition room your own personal party.
Here's the secret sauce with Mark - it's 100% about you as an actor. He - straight up - has no ego (unbelievable considering he's been in about a dozen Broadway shows). And because it's actually about the work - great things happen. I booked my first TV gig because of Mark, not to mention took control of my auditioning in a holistic way I'd never thought possible. It makes an EPA call an enjoyable experience (if you can believe it). You will be challenged, you will recalibrate what you bring to this business, and you will have some serious support along the way. He makes it seem like this business just might be possible after all. Get in on the Mark Price magic.
Let's just get one thing straight - words aren't good enough to describe the Mark Price experience. He has given me so much more than the tools I needed to book work as an actor. Mark has inspired me to live a full, balanced, healthy life that allows me to thrive as a creative human being. He has empowered me to risk everything on a daily basis. I know that I can take daring leaps every day, because I now have a net of hope, joy, and peace to catch me if I fall. That net exists only because Mark walked into my life.
Working with Mark Price changes the way you look at acting. He truly is the teacher of the 21st Century. In every session I have had with Mark, I have felt 100% comfortable to let down my guard and play in an environment that is nonjudgmental, encouraging, and fun! He is not only an amazing teacher but a wonderful person who helps you find your truth in every piece of material you bring to the table. I cannot express how much of an impact he has made on me and my career as an actor.
Mark created an environment where I felt free to play. He helped me go beyond the obvious choices to make the story more interesting.
Mark creates an incredible environment that gives you the safety to fail beautifully and get back up and stay in the game. He allows you to reignite your sense of play and lives in an ever-present state of curiosity that inspires you to do the same.
I can say with complete certainty that I wouldn't be where I am as an artist or as a human without the work I've done with him, and he is an irreplaceable part of my support team. There is no safer or more inspiring place to create, grow, and thrive than with Mark.
Working with Mark has been such an amazing experience. He has such a gift for seeing you and valuing you; the changing space of where you are in the moment and what you need in every moment. He revels in creativity and play, and allows you to experiment in a safe environment. He challenges you, supports you and helps you see the possibility of what you can be - with humor, grace and joy. I have learned so much from Mark.
Mark makes the audition room/studio your playground for exploration and discovery. Really bringing everything that is special about you to the forefront.
Working with Mark is an incredible because I always leave knowing that I have a specific and honest scene, but I also have one that is uniquely my own. That's important in any audition. He is someone that is incredibly curious in searching for what makes YOU funny, interesting, captivating!
I feel like Mark is my secret weapon. When we work together, I have a much greater and deeper understanding of what I want to achieve with the scene or song. Mark helps me bring my best self into the room.
Mark is wise, empathetic and so perceptive. He brings out the best in his students; he's taught me about myself. I've loved working with him and would recommend him in a heartbeat.

I recently attended a wedding photography course run by Nikon School UK at Buxted Hall. This picture of model Courtney Wallis is one of my favourite pictures from the day, it was the first time I have managed to use flash in daylight and have it work. The image has very little post-processing which also helped make it.
It was a great day out meeting a number of photographers of all levels of experience. The training was very well presented and formatted to flow nicely through the day. The models we had for the day were excellent and helped make the day much easier.

Normally we get canvases printed with white edges (the canvas thickness), but for this design we like the design wrapped around the edge.
We currently have one more available in stock, size A3 (420x 297mm), 30mm thickness. See box above for other available sizes to order.
The design on the canvas is printed with UV resistant inks. This gives them a good long life, though we don't recommend that you hang them in direct sunshine. The canvases are ready to hang with string and D-hooks.
Our price includes delivery within New Zealand. NZ Delivery takes 2 - 3 weeks on completion of your order. Please ask about rates for delivery outside New Zealand.
Do you require a special variation of one of our designs? We can adapt some for your favourite artwork colouring, or incorporating your logo or company name. This will be unique for you, never to be repeated for anyone else. We will work with you according to your requests, then send you some prototypes to establish the final winning design.
If you want to give someone an Artspiration canvas, why not get an Artspiration gift voucher? These will be great as a very special present, for birthday, Christmas, Mother's Day or anniversary. Then the lucky recipient can have the fun of choosing their own canvas? Please ask for details.
A special thanks to the AHRExpo organizers INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION for providing the venue for this meeting as part of AutomatedBuildings.com's Education Sessions. This was the 15th year of providing these free education sessions which were very well attended and very interactive.
The concept of a connection community was created in the back of a taxicab by Marc Petock and myself in Chicago at AHRExpo 2012. We were searching to find words that described the communities who are working together and fueling new ways to extend the value of our building systems and effecting change and innovation.
The concept of the connection community grew from that. At last year's Dallas AHRExpo 2013 we had the first ever meeting of connection communities. The first "Why we need to be part of several Connection Communities" education session on Tuesday, January 29th, 2013 2-3:30 PM NP&T Theater C on the exhibition floor was our best ever. The original purpose of this meeting was to identify and make community users aware of the existence of very large and capable communities that could help push their data to the cloud.
When we first met and explained the size and depth of our connection communites we found that there was a need for us to collaborate and have further dialogue.
What grew from that first meeting was the idea to create a LinkedIn Group called the Connection Community Collaboration. Several of the folks that originally spoke in Dallas agreed to be the thought leaders at a meeting in New York. This first ever collaboration was held in January, just after a great snowstorm, and was reasonably well attended. I was surprised as some of the folks from the industry who expressed interest were unable to attend as AHRExpo is an extremely busy time for all and competing priorities make it difficult for us to get together. I was surprised by the other side of the equation in the fact that a lot of people that I was not familiar with showed up for the meeting providing great insight to our collaboration. Many of these people were actually the users of the connected community services and the feedback was excellent. It also identified several other organizations that were working towards similar goals and we explored how we could best collaborate with them.
The best part of community collaboration is interfacing with people that you do not normally interact with.
Ron Bernstein, part of the ASHRAE guide spec committee, identified that they were working on the part of this spec where naming trending and fault detection would be added to the specifications. Several of the connection community are looking at a better way to define the connection to this and several other web services. The ASHRAE guide spec will go out for review in March/April and I will attempt to connect most of the CCC members to its content.
Thank you for a great session yesterday. I’m sorry that I couldn’t stick around longer afterwards. I had to make my way back to the airport. I thought it was a great discussion. I think the key point in the entire session was that no single organization or technology can do everything. The challenge is to make a collaborative, open solution work as a unified system with the ease of use of a proprietary system. These complex solutions combine both technologies and organizations. Those combinations are all about interfaces, and good technology interfaces and organizational interfaces demand collaboration.
We were saddened to hear that Andy McMillan, innovative business leader and Chairman of BACnet International, was unable to open our event because of a broken ankle. Marc Petock stepped in covering for Andy providing his take, and then providing his own take on connected communities.
Louis-Nicolas Hamer Director, Global Business Development at Schneider Electric was also unable to make meeting but Graham Martin, Chairman, EnOcean Alliance was able to step in and provide great insight to their collaboration efforts.
Our agenda other than that followed loosely our news release Industry thought leaders' share insight to Connection Communities Collaboration Meeting Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014 1:30pm at AHR Expo in New York.
I was extremely impressed with the clarity and conciseness of all our thought leaders, although the interaction between them was not as great as I had anticipated. Very quickly when the audience got involved in providing questions, interactions between all increased. I was extremely pleased that we achieved the spirit of collaboration.
The folks from Controltrends videoed the complete session but the interaction from the audience with their backs to the camera made it difficult to document their comments. But a truley amazing production thank you Controltrends. A lots of wisdom would have been lost except for this collaboration. A link to the video we were able to extract from this event is below.
Thanks for recording the voice input from the Audience as well. Special thanks goes out to Controltrends for providing this service - it's part of the amazing collaboration of the industry to get this information out to all.
I had hoped for a higher attendance from the industry; we had approximately 50 folks out for the meeting. Competing issues from day jobs and the opportunities of AHRExpo in general, make it a tough sell and greatly reduced involvement.
We should maybe explore a more neutral time but moving from the core days of AHRExpo is dangerous as many folks only attend these days.
I believe that we need to lose the meeting reference because the collaboration was anything but a meeting. I detest meetings but this was fun and led to industry collaboration.
I propose that we call it the Connection Community Collaboratory for Chicago AHRExpo 2015, our next planned event
Word of the month “a collaboratory" is more than an elaborate collection of information and communications technologies; it is a new networked organizational form that also includes social processes; collaboration techniques; formal and informal communication; and agreement on norms, principles, values, and rules” (Cogburn, 2003, p. 86).

The Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity issued a Declaration (the Sirte Declaration) calling for the establishment of an African Union, with a view, inter alia, to accelerating the process of integration in the continent to enable it play its rightful role in the global economy while addressing multifaceted social, economic and political problems compounded as they are by certain negative aspects of globalization.
The launching of the AU marked a significant chapter in the history of the continent in that, its vision and objectives focused on “People centered development and transformative agenda”.
•	Promote sustainable development at the economic social culture levels and Coordinate and harmonize the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union
African Union recognises football as an effective tool to attain social and economic transformation on the continent. In June 2012, African Union Commission (AUC) and Confederation of African Football (CAF) signed an MOU aimed at using football as a tool to promote development, peace and humanitarian objectives for social change in Africa in line with the CAF statutes which provide as follows, “support of the actions of the African Union and non-governmental organisations related to youth, sport and culture”.
AUC and CAF worked in collaboration during AFCON 2013 in South Africa and in other CAF competitions to promote and convey positive AU messages and social causes which includes the ratification of the African Youth Charter, Make Peace Happen, Fight against Malaria, Fight against HIV/AIDS, and Violence against Women.
Following the outbreak of the Ebola virus in 2013, African Union Support to Ebola Outbreak in West Africa (ASEOWA) was endorsed and established by the sixteenth Extraordinary Session of Heads of States and Governments on September 8th, 2014. The ASEOWA is currently deploying medical and human resource capacities to fight the Ebola Virus outbreak in West Africa.
Cognizance of the gravity of the situation and under the spirit of unity and brotherhood, the African Union calls neighboring regional economic communities and Member states’ populations to support the Ebola-affected countries.
In AFCON 2015, AUC and CAF and other partners like United Against Malaria and Street Football World will work in collaboration to promote Africa’s positive image, achievements such as democratic governance, economic growth, integration of women and youth, rising middle class, technological innovations, vast resources, and Africa’s place in the international arena, fight against conflicts, disease and advocating the social causes amongst other, the future vision “Agenda 2063”.
The thrust of “Agenda 2063” is a program of social, economic and political rejuvenation that links the past, present and the future in order to create a new generation of Pan Africanists that will harness the lessons learnt and use them as building blocks to consolidate the hope and promises of the founding parents for a true renaissance of Africa. In their 50th anniversary solemn declaration, the Heads of State and Government of the African Union (AU), while acknowledging past successes and challenges, re-dedicated themselves to the continent’s accelerated development and technological progress. The choice of a 50 year period of implementation for the “Agenda 2063” must be understood within the context of the 50th Anniversary of the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); and the need for the continent to take stock of achievements, successes/ failures and map out a long-term vision as well as set goals and targets. In operational terms, the “Agenda 2063” would be a rolling plan of 25 years, 10 years, 5 years and short term action plans.
The AU is determined to increase efforts towards women empowerment realizing their role and contribution to bring about community and National development. We want to put women and youths at the fore front of Africa’s Development Agenda 2063 in different sectors like agriculture, rural livelihood, education, health, without neglecting sports. We are determined to see more involvement of women in all kinds of sports, football included. We expect to see more women football competitions that will make our girls shine not only in Africa, but in the world at large.
2015 AFCON AUC slogan will be “We are Africans- today we celebrate Africa” aiming at bringing Africans together to celebrate their successes while individually and collective tackle their challenges but always cherish their prosperity, unity and brotherhood.

I have observed that over the course of building a relationship with real estate homeowners, you'll be able to get them to understand that, in each and every real estate exchange, a payment is paid. Finally, FSBO sellers really don't "save" the payment. Rather, they struggle to earn the commission through doing a strong agent's occupation. In the process, they shell out their money and also time to accomplish, as best they could, the obligations of an broker. Those assignments include exposing the home via marketing, introducing the home to buyers, making a sense of buyer emergency in order to trigger an offer, booking home inspections, managing qualification inspections with the lender, supervising fixes, and facilitating the closing of the deal. blog link Really Appreciate this post, how can I make is so that I receive an email when you publish a new article?

Another thing I would like to mention is that laptop memory requirements generally increase along with other innovations in the know-how.

This is because the application operated by way of these processor chips will inevitably boost in power to make use of the new technology.

In his closing section, Clark addresses the question of cultural homogenization--the idea that, by being everywhere, Starbucks is killing the individual character of far-flung communities.... "Starbucks diminishes the world's diversity every time it builds a new cafe," Clark writes. "The company, by its very nature, endangers cultural uniqueness, and this is why I am not a Starbucks customer."
This brings me back... to my own experience reading Starbucked in Starbucks.... here is what I saw in those two Starbucks locations: People buying coffee. People drinking coffee. People waiting for the restroom. People working on laptops. And, on one occasion, a barista giving a tourist directions to a nearby cafe.

We all are born with a common desire to be loved. In childhood we seek the love of our parents, and as we grow older we yearn for love from different sources – families, friends, spouses and our children. Unfortunately, a lot of us end up with a feeling of loneliness and of being unloved.
In this workshop we will explore the potential blockages in our Anahata Chakra that are responsible for these feelings, as well as discover ways of clearing these blockages to open up the path to love and bliss in our lives.
"Thanks a lot! This product did not irritate my sensitive areas at all and I did see a difference about 3 weeks into my self treatments. I would have to say overall that I am very impressed."
"I would have never went to a salon to buy this product although I have been wanting to try this for some time now. Thanks analbleaching.net for making it easy to shop in private!"
"I was skeptical at first due to how long it takes to see results, but I guess that if the ingredients are mostly natural and it is safe, it should not happen overnight. It took me about 4 weeks to see results, but they are definitely positive. It took a little longer in some areas than others, but thank you again for the wonderful product."

I started reading Cole because i read Pike. The Monkey's Raincoat / Stalking The Angel (Elvis Cole, #1, #2) EPUB EBook..and like it.
Style of witting is different.Cole is written in the first person, so we know what Cole thinks about all the time.Cole, unlike Pike, drips with sarcasm which is OK.
Unlike other private eyes, Cole is a little more laid back, he does yoga, eat healthy food and keeps a cat in the house. He doesn't go bank bang all the time but when he does, he and Pike can be real mean.And because the stories are written in the first person, there is a lot of down time, when Cole finds himself not doing anything at home.
The Monkey's raincoat introduces the readers to Elvis Cole, a yoga practicing, health food eating, cat loving detective.A man goes out to pick up his son never came home.Distraught wife with best friend contacts Cole to look for the man.Cole later found the man dead, but not the son. Some digging later found that man was planning to run away with a hottie but gunned down at close range being suspected of stealing a bag o drugs by some nasty baddies.
The Stalking angel is about a rich investor who was into everything Japanese.He had in his possession the Hagakure, a super valuable ancient book on the way of the warrior which was then stolen.Rich man, Bradley Warren, under the advisory of his lady advisory Jillian Becker, hires Cole to look for the book and then when after a a threatening phone call for his daughter Mimi, guard his family.During the man of the month ceremony, mimi was kidnapped.However, Cole along with the chief of Warren's security, were fired.Unhappy over issues not nicely tied up, Cole and Pike went hunting for Mimi and the Hagakure.
The stories were OK, not as memorable as my outing with Pike.Would I read another Cole? Why not, if I have the time.Would i go hunting for another Cole book, why not, if I can get them cheap as I did this one.
Perhaps like all other heroes, I would eventually warm up to Cole.But these two outings with Cole had not done it for me.Not yet. Like this book? Read online this: I'll Take You To Mrs Cole!, The Empty Raincoat.

Lies are forbidden and love is doubly forbidden. In the near future, when young people in Japan turn sixteen, they are assigned a marriage partner by the government. People don't have to go through the trouble of looking for someone, and everyone accepts that the country will find a compatible partner to make them happy. Yukari Nejima is fifteen years old. He lives in a small corner of the country, and just can't seem to get ahead in life. Both academically and athletically he's below average. But within him, he hides a heart burning with passion! In this world in which love is forbidden, what will happen to him when he falls in love?

In 1888 a seal was discovered in Kayna near Zeitz (now Saxony-Anhalt) that Pfuhl believed to be Old Sorbian. Soon it fell into oblivion. In the paper, I argue that the inscription is, in fact, Polabian. The argument relies on one conjecture only and, therefore, has some plausibility to it. Archaeological considerations lead me to date the seal to the times of Otto III in the early Middle Ages. If this is true then the Kayna seal is the by far oldest monument of the Polabian language known. It would be evidence that the Ottonian mission too made use of written Slavic.

The further from the center in the wheel the weight is, the harder it's to hurry it up or gradual it down, as well as heavier the wheel will become.

I tried applying 12V to the pump, but absolutely nothing happened. I checked the resistance and located it open. This was a nasty signal, could be a fried coil, but I proceeded anyway. I pried open The three metal tabs that held the motor go over on and pulled it off. Rust was everywhere inside, preventing the rotor from turning. I then very carefully pulled the pump housing off.

Austin is just a little over an hour away, so it's no big deal to run up there for an afternoon. Whether we stay for a few hours or a few days (like we did last week while Nick attended a conference), we tend to keep to a routine of places to shop and eat.
Could this be the best book store in the country? Easily. I say this with authority, because I am a book store tourist. (I would put used book stores in a separate category.) I've been to Powell's, I've been to The Strand. I still put this one at the top because its scope is thorough without being overwhelming. Also, great periodicals, children's section, author events, and coffee shop.
There is plenty of good food in Austin, but we go here every trip. Maybe because it's right across the street from Book People? At first, yes, but I think we would go back even if it were out of the way. Their motto should be "Never Not Good Food." Chicken and waffles if you feel like punishing yourself.
Right next door to 24 Diner, because the universe conspired to put three of our favorite Austin things in one spot. In truth, I don't usually go into Waterloo. I spend extra time in the book store while Nick shops for records. It's one of my favorite places because it makes him happy.
I still don't exactly know how to categorize this place. We go in there at 6 p.m., it's fairly empty, we are escorted to a doilied dining room for dinner. Dinner starts with complementary shots of icy vodka, bread, salt, and raw onions. And the food is good, and Mamie likes it, and I'm still sort of confused by the whole thing. I think it turns into a raging vodka bar after dark, so I feel strange taking my baby there.
Mmmmm, incense. Oils, teas, cards, crystals, books, and more. Even if you don't know what you're looking for, you'll find something magical. Unless your toddler is handsy like mine and decides she really needs that Buddha statue. Then you have to leave without buying anything.
I have to confess -- I've never bought anything here. This is the point in our Austin tour when Mamie starts to break down, and this store is a little too small and close to contain her emotions. But for the few minutes I get to browse, I see amazing special signed copies, gorgeous vintage editions. This is a bibliophile's store.
Yeah, I said it. There is no Ikea in San Antonio, so it's nice to make a trip (technically in Round Rock, north of Austin). It's ok to like something that's not weird and indie!
(*If you like BBQ, get BBQ. It will be good if your expectations are calibrated for what Texans consider BBQ. In other words, prepare to be disappointed if you want pulled pork and delighted if you like sausage or brisket. Don't feel like you have to go somewhere and stand in line for two hours to get "good" BBQ. All the BBQ is pretty good. That said, Stubbs is a special experience, especially on Gospel Sundays.)
Saturday night I tried really hard to get out of cooking dinner. No, I'm not perpetually steam-drenched, hunched over the stove every night, just looking for one night off. I have just about every night off because Nick cooks most of the time, and when it's my turn, I tap into my arsenal of delivery services.
Saturday night, I did, very begrudgingly, grate carrots and sauté bokchoy and glaze chicken. Nick said, "You don't seem to like cooking." But... but... but, I wanted to defend myself, I know how to cook; I used to cook; I used to like cooking.
For example, kids. Feeding kids for the last 4.5 years has consumed me, no apology for the pun. My obsession with managing their growth and nutrition is totally separate from cooking. It's a mental tally of macronutrients and micronutrients; it's creating the perfect veggie snack plate with every cucumber slice salted; it's composing and blending superfood sm…
Early 1980s, summer smells like pool water and cheese crackers from the vending machine at the city pool. And 7-Up in a can because at least one summer, it seemed like we had endless cases of 7-Up in the porch fridge. (I assume you are familiar with the porch fridge.)
I don't know who took me to the pool (Mom? Grammaw?); I don't know if I wore a seatbelt in the backseat; I don't know if anyone ever put sunscreen on me.
But I know what the combination of pool water, cheese crackers, and 7-Up smells like -- a sense memory 35 years old.
Early 1990s, summer smells like pool water, cigarette smoke, and NO-AD tanning lotion in Stacey's backyard. After the sun set, it smelled like plumeria lotion on hot tanned skin and B.C. Moore's parking lot. I never got close enough to a boy to smell Drakkar Noir.
Stacey's mom is gone since last year, and no one smokes cigarettes anymore. I feel so deeply hurt for my oldest friend to have lost her mother and so disoriented to be in…
I just created a document to list the words I've heard Lizzie say. I count 14, but I haven't consulted with Nick or her grandparents to see if I've missed any. I'm doing this homework so when people question me about her development, I can say assuredly whether or not she is meeting her milestones. This week I was ashamed to not know whether she typically leads with her right or left foot, or if she often kneels while playing, and if so, are her hips bent or straight? What direction does the third finger on her left hand point while she lays in bed on the night of a full moon? There are so many things I didn't realize I should be noticing.
So many nagging lists of things a child "should" be doing. I think "should" implies some moral imperative or an obligation to meet external expectations, and I swear the word doesn't apply to a baby.

What Happens to Heart Valve Damage Caused by Diet Drugs after Treatment with the Drug Has Been Stopped? | Annals of Internal Medicine | American College of Physicians
What Happens to Heart Valve Damage Caused by Diet Drugs after Treatment with the Drug Has Been Stopped?
The summary below is from the full report titled “The Progression of Fenfluramine-Associated Valvular Heart Disease Assessed by Echocardiography.” It is in the 20 February 2001 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine(volume 134, pp 261-266). The authors are ST Mast, JG Jollis, T Ryan, KJ Anstrom, and JL Crary.
Summaries for Patientsare a service provided by Annalsto help patients better understand the complicated and often mystifying language of modern medicine.
Summaries for Patients are presented for informational purposes only. These summaries are not a substitute for advice from your own medical provider. If you have questions about this material, or need medical advice about your own health or situation, please contact your physician.
In 1997, two drugs used to decrease appetite, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, were found to cause abnormalities of the heart valves in up to one third of people who had taken them. As a result, these drugs were withdrawn from the U.S. market. No one knows with certainty, however, what happens to heart valve function once treatment with these drugs have been stopped.
To find out whether valve abnormalities got better, got worse, or stayed the same after treatment with fenfluramine drugs has been stopped.
Fifty patients with at least mild abnormalities of the heart valves who had taken fenfluramine drugs (sometimes in combination with other diet drugs) and were followed for at least 100 days after treatment with the drug had been stopped.
All patients had a first echocardiogram after stopping treatment with the drug and had a second echocardiogram at least 100 days later. (An echocardiogram is a picture of the heart created by using sound waves; it can be used to look at heart valve function.) All echocardiograms were reviewed by two cardiologists who did not know which study was performed first. The specific valve involved, type of abnormality, and severity of damage were recorded.
The two valves on the left side of the heart (mitral and aortic) were most commonly affected, allowing blood to leak backward after the valve should have closed completely (regurgitation). On the first echocardiogram, 38 patients had abnormal mitral valve function; on the follow-up echocardiogram, valve function was unchanged in 19 patients, had improved in 17 patients, and had worsened in 2 patients. Among the 43 patients with aortic valve abnormality on the first echocardiogram, this abnormality remained unchanged in 22 patients, had improved in 19 patients, and had worsened in 2 patients. The two valves on the right side of the heart (tricuspid and pulmonic) were less commonly affected. Tricuspid abnormality was found initially in 29 patients; during follow-up, 9 patients had no change, 18 had improved, and 1 had worsened. Pulmonic abnormality was found initially in 11 patients; 1 had no change and 9 improved during follow-up.
Patients in the study had echocardiograms because problems suggesting heart disease had developed. People who took the drug but did not develop symptoms suggesting heart problems were not studied. Moreover, for the many patients who initially had severe valve abnormalities, the only change that could be observed was improvement. The researchers also could not tell if the patients had heart valve damage before they took the diet drugs. Finally, the follow-up period was relatively short.
Most heart valve abnormalities that developed in people who took the diet drugs fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine improved or remained stable over time after they stopped taking the drug, although a few became worse.

Hi. Thanks for visiting our travel blog! From November 2011 until June 2012 we (Anne and Monica) travelled around the world and wrote about our experiences along the way. We're now back in the USA and continuing to post about interesting moments in our lives.
After our two weeks in India, we spent two in Nepal. As soon as we crossed the border into Nepal we felt instant relief. It was less populated and less dusty--we could breathe again!
We spent one night in Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha, but actually didn't make it out to the famous sites like the sacred garden. The next morning we took a bus to Pokhara. We paid for a tourist bus, but ended up getting tricked into riding the local bus. We probably paid 50 times more than the other people on the bus. No other tourists ended up getting on.
More and more people got on, and they began to load up the top with crates of food and animals. I saw two huge cockroaches crawling around my feet at one point. We were driving on windy mountain roads in a packed bus. From my aisle seat, my face had the pleasure of becoming acquainted with many passengers' butts that encroached into my space. This was not the worst bus experience (that goes to Vietnam), but it was definitely up there.
Ahhh, Pokhara. The long bus ride was worth it. We ended up spending a week in Pokhara at the Little Tibetan Guest House, a place I highly recommend. Pokhara has a beautiful lake, excellent food (Olive Café and Moondance) and and great shopping. It's also a nice jumping-off point for trekking in central Nepal.
One day we rented scooters and went to the Tibetan settlement Tashi Palkhiel, where we visited the temple and hung out with a monk.
The second time we rented scooters in Nepal, we drove to the base of the World Peace Pagoda and hiked to the top. It was incredibly hot and I ran out of water on the way up. At the top, I soaked my head in water from the fountain and bought a big bottle to chug.
The sole of my shoe came unglued along the way and started flapping around in the front, (shoddy workmanship by the guy in Hoi An) so I used my hair tie to hold it on.
We ran into a group of Americans who were hiking with their sponsored students in a small Nepalese village.
Finally, we made it to the village of Ghandruk. It was a pretty intense hike with lots of ups and downs, rain, sun and wind, but totally worth it. Mules passing by us kept things interesting on the less-captivating parts of the trail.
We took the local bus back to Pokhara from the end of our hike. I made friends with a goat sitting behind me!
Then things got depressing--we visited the Khorsor Elephant Breeding Center. The elephants were chained up so tight that they could barely move. They looked incredibly unhappy. Many of them were bobbing their heads back and forth due to what I think is some form of neurosis. I don't know why the elephants are being bred here, but I want this place to be shut down.
We then hung out with some happier elephants, who went swimming in the river. (These elephants had nothing to do with the breeding facility.)
We bought three bananas for around $1 USD. Had they been cheaper, we would have bought more. The elephants ate them in two seconds.
The next day we went out for our main event: the safari. Chitwan is known for its rhinoceroses, but they couldn't guarantee we'd see one.
Sitting in the front of the bus, a chill lounge-type area. Chill, that is, until it was packed with people.
Almost every truck had some sort of saying on the back. I took photos of a lot of them. This one was pretty good:
We stayed in Kathmandu for three nights, which was a good amount of time. We walked around a lot, did some shopping, and hit up some good restaurants.
There are pigeon houses throughout the city. It seems like people enjoy these birds, and even go out of their way to feed them and keep them around.
We went to an antique market in the center of the historic part of the city. Pretty much every vendor was selling the same things.
I highly recommend a trip to Nepal, if you can make it out there one day. I liked the people, the landscape, the history, the architecture, the hiking, the shopping... And I think I would have liked it even more had I not been desensitized from all the prior traveling. Nepal was our final "exotic" destination, and concluded our time in Asia. From Kathmandu, we flew to Delhi (10-hour layover) and on to London.
I thought it would be a fun idea to compile some of the best images of animals we encountered during our trip, so Anne and I came up with t...

Life with Cats is an educational and entertaining mix of information and stories for a diverse community of cat lovers. Some of ASAP's own esteemed felines have been feature stories!
Today is the day every member of the reserve and youth teams hate the most. It's the day the players and staff come together at the training ground for their staff Christmas dinner cooked by the famous Rob the Chef.
The eating of the dinner isn't a problem, although I wonder how many of them enjoy eating Brussels sprouts. No, it's when the entertainment the youngsters have to provide to the first team squad between the courses. The normal peace and tranquility of London Colney will be shattered as several Christmas Carols will be sung (badly) as Arsene Wenger and Pat Rice share a joke and Robin van Persie winds-up Thomas Vermaelen about his choice of motor car.
In all seriousness, it's a good event for the players and staff to come together and enjoy lunch with one another. There isn't much time during the season for everyone to stop and eat lunch together. So the Christmas meal is a special occasion for all.
Hopefully Arsene Wenger won't have lost his appetite because prior to the meal he'll discover, along with the rest of us, who we'll face in the next round of the Champions League. The draw is due to take place at 11am in Nyon.
As the two Manchester clubs have already discovered, there are no easy games in Europe. And they'll be reminded of that as they both witnessed Spurs fail to progress in the Europa League last night, draw for the next stage of that competition takes place from noon.
The manager will face the media ahead of the weekend's game with Manchester City. The Daily Mirror amongst others are reporting of a training ground bust up between Mario Balotelli and Micah Richards. It's always good to see a bit of disharmony in the opposition camp.
Normally by this time there would be team news available from the official site but I guess that all the players who were injured for our game against Everton will be out for Sunday's game.
One player who is certainly in the best form of his Arsenal career is Theo Walcott. What it appears Theo is now finding is better consistency in his game. I suppose in someways it's helped that he's been playing alongside pretty much the same six players in midfield and attack since the start off the season.
"Our new players needed time to gel, time to settle. They had to get used to the way the club is run. It was always going to take time.
"We had injuries as well. Things were not going our way, but the way we’ve played in the last few weeks, it’s nice to see us move up the table."
One question which hasn't been raised in a while is where the club are at with discussing a new deal with Theo. He's out of contract at the end of next season, so you would have thought the club would be doing everything it could to get him to agree to an extension.
For me it's a no brainer for Theo. He's come on leaps and bounds with Arsenal. He's become a better player and one who plays every week. Is that something that any other club in the league could offer him?
The one area where I would like to see him contribute more is in scoring goals. And it's not just Walcott who needs to be finding the back of the net more. For all his assists, Gervinho should be scoring and the same could be said for Aaron Ramsey.
It's a point not lost on Mikel Arteta, who has three league goals to his name. The Spaniard and Alex Song are afforded a lot of time on the ball and sometimes when space opens up in front of them there is an opportunity to shoot.
"Sometimes we get space to move into when the forward players have attracted defenders to them. We need to stay aware of that.
I could be wrong, but I think we've scored more goals from outside the box this season already than we did in the whole of last season. It's good to see Arteta and Song scoring goals. Although I'm glad they don't get carried away like Emmanuel Frimpong and shoot from 40 yards!
There are a few other stories around. Francis Coquelin says it's "flattering" that he's been linked with a move to Lille in The Sun. There is more on us signing Lukas Podolski. The Daily Mail say we'll watch him again tonight as the manager weighs up whether to spend £15m on the German striker in the January transfer window.
Both the Daily Star and Daily Mail believe Steve Rowley was watching Southampton full back Luke Shaw play on Tuesday night in the FA Youth Cup. We were linked with the defender in the summer but didn't do a deal with the south coast club to sign him. And at 16, I'm not sure he's the answer to our problem at full back at the moment.
And finally the Daily Mail say we're running the rule over AZ Alkmaar’s 23-year-old striker Rasmus Elm. They report there is also interest in the £6m rated player from Tottenham and Manchester United.
That's it for today. Looking forward to finding out who we'll get in the Champions League and I'll have more on that tomorrow.

It’s 21 November, so we’re halfway through Nanowrimo 2016. This is my second time of doing Nanowrimo and it’s a different experience from the first time, mainly, because I haven’t started from scratch this time. I wanted to use Nanowrimo to finish off a novel I started some time ago and got to about 40,000 words. In some ways, it has been good, knowing I’ve already got 40,000 words I can use towards the word count. It takes the pressure…
I have signed up for the National Novel Writing Month (Nanowrimo) challenge for November 2016. You have to write 50,000 words to win Nanowrimo.Last year, I wrote the draft of Murder and Mittens. This year, I am hoping to finally complete my other novel, The Three Faces of Holly.
The Interview is a short story by yours truly that will shortly (e.g. as soon as Amazon process it) be available as a Kindle book. I originally wrote this story for Volume 2 of Off The KUF – short stories written by authors from the Kindle Users Forum. I have decided to give it a bit of a polish and have it available as a stand alone. Therefore, the version in Off The KUF is not the same as this…
I am currently working on producing a print version of The Little Book of Quirky Christmas Stories. I hope to have it available on Amazon by Christmas 2016. I’m currently waiting for a proof copy to check so fingers crossed everything goes to plan.
I’ve recently had the ‘pleasure’ of formatting print versions of The Little Book of Quirky Christmas Stories through Createspace, and the first draft of my fantasy/murder mystery novel Murder and Mittens, through Lulu. If I thought that formatting ebooks was fiddly and time-consuming – print books are much worse! Even though I had templates supplied from both Lulu and Createspace, it has taken much longer than I thought to get them to an acceptable standard. The bottom line is once again,…
The Smashwords website is having a July sale. Both of my books are in the sale, The Little Book of Quirky Christmas Stories – free and Pride and Prejudice: The Other Way Round – 50% off.
This is the first day of nanowrimo (or National Novel Writing Month). No prizes for guessing what month this occurs in. I have got off to a flying start by writing 2,535 words. The target per day is 1.667. I have also been very brave and put the story on the Smashwords website – www.smashwords.com since they kindly give Nanowrimo authors the chance to do this. So if you fancy reading the first chapter of my novel (or as far…
I have a Kindle Paper White ebook reader. It’s one of my newer acquisitions and I’ve rapidly become very fond of it. It is smaller and lighter than the Kindle Keyboard but not as light or as convenient a size to shove in a handbag as my Sony PRS350. The thing I really love about it is the ability to read in the dark without it hurting your eyes. Slightly ironic in that I own it now and am not…
Yes, I’ve done it. I’ve actually signed up for Nanowrimo or National Novel Writing Month. This challenges you to write a 50,000 word novel in a month. (Around 1,600 words a day, in case you’re wondering). You can prepare by doing outlines, plots, character sketches but you don’t start writing until 1 November. I’m not in paid employment at the moment so it seems like a good way to try to improve my productivity. So I’m busy devising a synopsis,…

I drew up the bolt today, and hope to make it this weekend. Then I'll think about the final design for the breech cover.
I did run some rounds through the gun. Initial numbers were in the low 300's, at which point I realized I was loading .177 pellets in a .22 rifle. Distractions...anyway, it's shooting around 580 fps with 10 pumps (14.3 gr.), which is a little low. I hope that a new transfer port seal and a new bolt will speed it up a bit. We'll see.
I turned and threaded a new breech bolt. I just winged the dimensions. Because I used the 3 jaw chuck the bolt slipped a bit while I was threading it. So I grabbed onto the waste stock with some vise grips.
As you can see it wasn't a particularly accurate copy, better to follow my detailed article on how to make one exactly, but for less than 10 minutes of machining it's fine to test the rifle.
Flanged bushing and washer in place. I used a nut to clamp the stock but will make a knurled nut soon.
The rifle is now complete enough to test, although there's clearly a lot of work remaining...more posts to come...
So having stuffed the valve back together, I needed to test the rifle. Which meant making a few parts...
I had to cut down a screw to hold the trigger group in the front. Threading a nut on the screw above the cut allows you to reshape the threads after sawing and deburring.
The bolt will get replaced (due to the front end being broken), but I wanted to test the valve first...so I have to remove the broken screw in the bolt.
My Crosman 130, which also uses a sliding breech cover. I decided to use it for the appropriate dimensions on a temporary breech cover.
I haven't had a gratuitous edge finding picture in a while. I found center and then the location of the hole for the breech screw.
Milled and reassmbled with a new bolt o-ring. A lot of work for a temporary fix, but it didn't take that long, and I didn't want to do a lot of work before I tested the function of the valve...
Well, I bought another "pile-o-parts" airgun, a Crosman 140. It was mostly in pieces so I took everything else apart and cleaned the gunk off.
The valve. It's a pop-off valve, held under pressure by the sear. When the trigger is released the cap at the right pops off and releases the air.
The piston rod that came with the rifle is at the bottom. Someone tried unsuccessfully to remove the old seal, and did what looks like a bunch of grinding on it. The top rod assembly came as a spare with the Crosman 101 pile-o-parts I bought a while back. So I figured that I'd use it instead.
The 101 piston parts, and a new seal that also came with the 101. Since I'm nowhere near close to working on the 101 I figured I'd use it here.
The valve o-rings were removed and replaced with new ones. The pop off valve has an internal quad seal. Later on in the process I ended up replacing it with an o-ring which will probably not last. I'll be ordering in the proper seal soon.
The pivot pin is a spring pin. How I hate pushing it in and out when setting the optimum piston rod distance, as well as getting the valve assembled correctly.
The trigger group looks a lot like the 160 trigger, but is simpler as it only retains the "hammer" against the valve pressure. The front screw holding it to the tube is temporary. I didn't bother putting the barrel on yet.
I was never 100% comfortable with just the single cross pin holding the endcap against the mainspring. The peen on the pin is minimal and made me nervous that it might eventually vibrate out of position--firing the endcap back at my skull in the process. Ow. While I've never heard of that happening, a bit of extra retention would certainly bolster my confidence when using the rifle.
First, minimal disassembly: I removed the action from the stock, pulled the red dot and removed the cocking lever. Then, I looked at the endcap and found the thickest part where it slid inside the receiver tube--about 3/8" to the rear of the pin on the left side of the gun.
Found a button head M5 hardened bolt and some medium strength threadlocker. I cleaned out all the metal chips from the drilling and tapping steps before installation.
Installed. I'd like to have another bolt on the other side, but there's no metal in the end cap on the right side--it's relieved to accommodate the cocking lever. I feel better knowing that the retention pin now has some redundancy for safety's sake.
There's a metal washer and a felt oil retainer inside. No worry about dieseling with the low velocity of this pistol?
The piston, spring and lever parts. The orientation of the linkage is important...I put it back together upside down and had to do what I show twice...
The loading port for the BBs also retains the barrel. Notice the band-aid on my thumb. The compression tube has sharp edges...
I polished up the piston for the heck of it. Then I used a pin punch to align everything so I could push the pin back in. The felt is a pain to get around.
I used a spring compressor to push everything together, not that the force was high but it made a good third hand.
With the cocking linkage pushed clear of the spring I reattached it to the lever. (Upside down the first time...)
My new favorite old tool...these parallel jaw pliers were just the thing to push that roll pin back in. Anyway the reast of the pistol went back together in reverse of disassembly. It's a bit weak, although I have no idea what the velocity is supposed to be. Nor do I care.
I've been a bit busy lately but decided it would be fun and quick to take apart my Daisy model 188 BB pistol and see what makes it tick. Mine is the metal bodied but BB only version.
The loading port, you can see the BBs being picked up by the bolt here. On the earlier model you could also insert a pellet but the casting was changed to prevent that.
The compression tube, spring and lever can be removed as a unit. It's under a bit of tension inside the pistol even uncocked.
Didn't really have any particular passions when I applied for university. UW Engineering & UofT Engineering were some of the harder programs to get into, so I figured it'd be a lot easier switching out than switching in. I got into both, chose UW because of Co-op.
Nah but really co-op. Just co-op. I can't imagine graduating from engineering without so much real world experience.
It was 2007 and I thought the markets would turn sour. I planned my exit from the fields in Alberta, but had to decide between a few Ivy League schools in the US or staying in Canada. I thought the Yanks would turn nationalist especially if I was on scholarship at an elite institution. UW was part of a package deal with Laurier. Boy did I choose wrong.
Basically because of co-op. No regrets though, co-op was hella interesting and the school terms were both busy and fun. I feel like everyone who hated it here was just waiting for fun to happen to them rather than going out and making it happen.

The Staryu/Starmie evolution chain is nothing special. It learns a decent number of moves but nothing that will stand out from the rest of the water Pokémon pack. If you choose to catch a Staryu, your best bet is to get rid of its default moveset, except for its water-based moves, and teach it others through HMs and TMs. As always, wait until Staryu has learned the majority of its moves before evolving to Starmie.
Mr. Mime is an OK Psychic Pokémon that will suffice until you can get a heavy hitter, such as Alakazam or Mewtwo, in your arsenal. Mr. Mime will have to be taught the best attacks that Psychic Pokémon have to offer, such as Psybeam and Psywave, because its default move list is quite lacking. Confusion is great for inflicting that status ailment in early battles, but later it’s not going to hold for very long against stronger opponents.
Scyther should be better than it is in Generation I Red/Blue. Its move list is highly disappointing and the number of decent moves it can learn through TMs and HMs is low. It learns no Flying moves despite being a dual type and it does not and cannot learn Bug -type moves, what little there are, despite being a Bug-type Pokémon. This is remedied later in more current generations but the lack of moves makes Scyther a non-choice.
Jynx is an interesting Pokémon. It is a combination Pokémon that incorporates moves from three different types: Ice, Normal and Ghost. It is also capable of learning moves from the Fighting, Water, Psychic and Poison movesets through TMs. Jynx is one of the few Ice-type Pokémon and thus its advantages immediately make it worth a look. Given its array of learnable moves, you could take a Jynx very far and wreak havoc with little downside.
Electabuzz is an excellent Pokémon to have as the Electric anchor on an Elite Four-bound team. Its default moveset is great with few weak moves and it can learn a variety of moves from the Fighting and Psychic movesets without the disadvantage of being a dual-type Pokémon.
Magmar is a great Fire-type addition to your team that’s in need of a fire Pokémon anchor. Fire Pokémon are a precious commodity, especially if you didn’t start with Charizard’s evolution chain. Magmar has a good moveset, can learn quite a few moves through TMs and HMs, and is strong enough to handle an Elite Four battle easily once it’s leveled properly. Also, finding a Magmar later in the game will ensure you’re ready to handle using a tough Pokémon type like Fire.
Pinsir is an average Pokémon, much like its fellow Bug, Scyther. Like Scyther, Pinsir should be better than it is. It’s also disappointing in that it never learns Bug-type moves. The two advantages that Pinsir has are that it’s a pure Bug type, avoiding the dual-type weakness; and, it naturally learns Guillotine, a one-hit KO move that has decent accuracy. While it can slightly improve its default moveset, it should be better and there are other Pokémon deserving of a place on an Elite Four-bound team.
Tauros is deceptive in nature. At first glance, it’s a boring Normal-type Pokémon with an average moveset. But with research of what it can learn, Tauros becomes a unique and worthy addition to any team. There is a wide variety of moves that Tauros can be taught through TMs and HMs, and they run the gamut of types.

If you are investing in stock, or if you buy stocks, trade stock, or are into stock investing, read this section to improve your stock trading skills.
Buying and selling stocks involve risk. If you buy stocks, sell stocks or trade stocks, you should incorporate risk management into your trading plan. Here is one method to manage risk involved in trading stocks.
Tip. The crucial element in risk management is knowing when to exit a trade that is going against your position. we believes that this should be planned prior to entering the trade. None of us are perfect traders, and we do make mistakes. We either buy or sell the wrong stock or our timing on the stock is not correct. Trading many times is a humbling experience. So at some point, you have to swallow your pride, and cut your losses. We believe that an unemotional but an objective way will be beneficial in the longterm.
askStockGuru.com provides a reasonable approach to this question: when to cut your losses. We believe that the amount of money that one should risk on a particular stock depends on the volatility of the stock. If you risk too little on a trade, you may lose the opportunity. For example, BIDU, a Chinese Internet company, is very volatile, as well as rewarding to many traders. If you risked 3% by setting a stop order or by exiting the trade, you would most likely exit the trade too quickly. Basically, because the stock is volatile, you need to risk more then 3% when trading BIDU.
Similarly, a trader should not risk more than what is required on a trade. For example, risking 20% on GE trade does not make sense. Bidu and GE have different volatility profile.
askStockGuru.com risk management numbers intend to provide a balance. We incorporate the volatility profile of a stock, and crunch the numbers based on past behavior of the stock to come up with a reasonable estimate of how much you should risk on a trade. There is a no method to calculate the optimal amount. However, we believe that a reasonable approach over a long term will pay off.
Based on the volatility of a particular stock, we provide a range. For example, you bought a stock at $100.00, the risk management section suggest you risk between 3% and 7% on a stock. In such a case, you may hold on to the stock until it reaches $97 to $93. This is based on the thought that 3% to 7% is a normal fluctuation of prices in that particular stock. However, we suggest that if it falls below 7%, you should seriously reevaluate the assumptions you made when entering the trade.

So my overall grade is A-. Which is sad. Pengakap is now on Saturday and I can't go this Saturday cos I'll be in Langkawi. I just sneezed so hard that my tummy hurts. And there were like weird sounds above my room yesterday... and just then. But it's usually my neighbour. They make such a racket. Right now I really like Super Junior's songs -> Twins (Knock up) ? and Miracle.
But no one reads this anymore. I feel as if I'm talking to myself... like what I always do. I am starting to dislike some of my classmates. Boo everyone.
It has long been known that individual investors do not typically fare well in their efforts at do-it-yourself investing. This notion has been validated by numerous studies, including one by Dalbar, Inc., which revealed the staggering margin by which the average individual investor trails the returns of the broader market.
As the chart shows, the study revealed the S&P 500* returned 9.22% while equity investor’s return over that same period was a paltry 5.02%, a difference of 4.20% annually.
The average fixed income investor fared no better over the same period, achieving 0.71% annual while the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index* averaged 5.74%, a difference of 5.03% annually.
Why is the individual investor so inept at capturing the returns of the market? In a word: Emotions.
Emotion drives investors to buy the latest hot investment near its peak and sell the investment after riding it to the bottom on its inevitable slide downward. The “buy high, sell low” scenario is unfortunately not just an anecdote, but is very real for many individual investors.
The end result is simple. Buying on greed and selling on fear might satisfy short term emotional needs, but the lack of discipline may compromise long-term objectives.
Do you have the time, training and temperament to make good decisions? The vast majority of participants in a company retirement plan do not pay the needed amount of attention to their initial investment selection. Moreover, statistics show plan participants rarely revisit their choices over time as their objectives change and markets evolve.
Over the past few years many employers have enhanced their retirement plans to include a brokerage window opportunity so that plan participants have more choice and greater flexibility with their retirement investments. This option, known as the Self Directed Brokerage Account (SDBA), exists in 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plans where participants will have access to professional management, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.
Plans that offer the SDBA option provide the opportunity for employees to take full control of a portion of their current retirement account by linking it to the existing Core account. In doing so, participants expand the range of investment choices beyond the Core investments and will have access to the same management style as High Net worth Investors, Institutions and Foundations.
The Core account refers to the retirement account through the employer that offers limited, pre-selected investment choices. The SDBA is very similar to traditional brokerage accounts which exists as an eligible option on retirement plans. Employers that offer the SDBA option allow the employees to transfer a portion of their investments from the Core account to SDBA. Through this account employees have access to investment choices such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds and access to professional investment advice through a Registered Investment Advisor.
SDBAs are currently the most underutilized investment options in 401(k), 403(b) and 457 accounts. However, this option should be used by investors who feel comfortable managing their own risk or are working with a professional Investment Advisor.
The SDBA or a “brokerage window” is a choice on eligible plans that offers investment choices such as mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and access to fiduciary investment advice through a registered investment advisor.

Recent studies emphasize the importance of client-advisor conversations. These reports prove that advisors can add 3% to clients’ net returns1 and retirement savers who sought investing advice enjoyed a median annual return almost 3% higher than those who didn’t – even after the fees they paid for that advice2.
Financial advisors are not “one-size-fits-all.” They range from retirement plan specialists to broad based benefit advisors. Be sure to take the time to select the one that is right for you. Your retirement is a big investment – make sure you are getting the most out of it.
Employees are almost twice as confident in making investment decisions if they have help from a financial professional than if they decided this on their own. 1

A:Wow, you really found that nitpicky talking point that elevates the fossil fuel industry to the same level as the interests of humanity. Isn't it all just a "liberal" scam, if you don't look too closely at the absence of logic? "Yes, it must be. My masters are hinting that that's what I should believe!"
You've made it clear you are consciously ignoring the pollution and global warming. Since your handlers, the conservative establishment whose dismantling of the carbon credit system and environmental destruction you choose to ignore, have made it clear you should bark in this direction, you are eager to please!
Such an admirably domesticated, dependable, subservient human. I'm sure your handlers will throw you a bone while they bring home the bacon for themselves. You're so obedient, you deserve a doggie cookie! Who's a good boy? You are! Yes, you are. U-S-A! Woof woof woof! -- coineineagh
Have you ever made a hotel reservation for your vacation, only to discover that the rooms were dirty and smelly? Do you wish that there was some way to make sure that the hotel you choose is of the highest quality? If so, the following advice will be just what you need.
If you are traveling for work and staying at a hotel, ask for a room at least some reasonable distance from the pool area. You will probably want to be in a room where you can concentrate. The noise levels near a pool can be distracting. Pick a quiet room where you can be productive.
To keep your electronics safe when you are out of the hotel room, use the safe that you'll find in your closet. Your small electronic devices can be left in the safe when you are out, so you will not have to worry about them.
To avoid having to iron your shirts when you unpack everything in your hotel room, pack your polo and dress shirts more carefully. Use a hanging bag, and stack your dress shirts together. Then, starting with the shirt in back, bring the arms around, stacking the arms and wrapping them around keeps your shirts in place.
It's important to make sure that your valuables are safe during a hotel stay, so make use of the room's safe. https://www.kiwibox.com/donte4warr275/blog/entry/144876275/fed-up-with-travel-migraines-attempt-these-tips/ can be placed there with confidence, allowing you to enjoy your day without worries.
Be sure and take care of three important things before bringing a pet on your trip to any hotel. First, ensure that the hotel actually allows pets. You should bring some plastic bags and cleaning supplies to keep the room clean behind your pet. And, ask if your room can away from guests.
To benefit from the best prices at hotels, start planning your trips several weeks or even months in advance. If you can book a couple of months early, a lot of locations will give you a steeper discount. You might even be able to save up to 50 percent off at some very exclusive hotels.

Don't make long distance calls on your hotel phone. Instead, villa paraiso montezuma costa rica should try the Internet. With a Wi-Fi connection, you can use Skype for your calls. Use this type of thing to get with people you know while you're in your hotel room so you can save quite a bit of money.
If you are traveling with children, make sure you tell the front desk about your needs when you call to make a reservation. For example, do you need a pack and play? Make that known before you show up at the hotel. Also, ask if there is space in the room to set up a crib. You may need to ask for a larger room so that your entire family can be comfortable.
Sign on to Facebook and find the page of the hotel you are staying at. Write a little message on their page, and see if the staff responds. You never know, they may offer you a special perk! If nothing else, keep up with what is happening on the page in case any specials are announced.
If you enjoy a morning run, try booking a hotel room that's near the beach or an open park. Enjoy a morning jog each day while on vacation. When you go running in a new city, you will get a free tour, up-close and personal.
Before booking a hotel room, ask the hotel about their return policy. You never know what could happen and you may end up having to cancel your reservation. If there is no return policy, you could be basically throwing your money down the drain. Don't book with a hotel until you know this information.
To ensure that you don't leave anything behind when you are checking out of a hotel, make a sweep through the room after you've packed your bags. Open every drawer, check down on the floor by each bed, and check every outlet to make sure that you haven't left any chargers plugged in.

The Top 5 Mistakes People Make When Moving To Costa Rica
To keep from having a hassle with logging into the hotel's Internet connection, ask at the front desk when you check in about any required passwords. This way, you can get up and running right when you get to the room, instead of having to hunt through the guest guidebook and call the front desk about a password.
If your hotel offers a kid's club, and you are considering leaving your child there, take a few precautions. Find out if the staff has undergone background checks and ask about the child to adult ratio. In addition, ask what the procedure is for picking up the child. You want to make sure that someone can't just walk up and leave with your little one.
To avoid spending $2 or $3 each time you want a soda at a hotel, throw a six- or twelve-pack into the car when you head out on the road. For almost as much money as that one soda, you can have a dozen of them chilling on ice in the room, or in the mini-fridge.
To get the best rate on your hotel room, never book while the very peak of tourist season is in full swing. This is when you get charged high rates. Instead, book during off-season for the best prices. You'll typically find that the rates you get will be good.
Most people visit a hotel at some point or another. Regardless of why you need to book a room, you should research your decision first. Follow the advice presented here to get great value in hotel accommodations.

Although Brexit relates to the European Union and is unrelated to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), has the appetite for nationalism shown by the UK public in the result of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 had any impact on the Conservative Party's long-stated desire to repeal the Human Rights Act, which does relate to the ECHR?

Join SimkissGuy Recruitment and Aston Business School for this interactive discussion led by Professor Ben Clegg. We will discuss the basics of systems thinking and how it can be used to improve strategic operations management.
This session will give you an opportunity to develop your systems thinking skills to make you a more holistic thinker and become more prepared to become an innovative manager of change. A new technique will be demonstrated and an example given.
Management thinking is all too often constrained by linear and hierarchical thinking, but as we all know organisations and business are usually more complex than this and should not be thought of in this way; so why do we persist in doing so?
Professor Clegg will provide you with an alternative by giving you an introduction to systems thinking and prepare you to become an effective agent of improvement.
A taste for systems thinking, learn of a specific technique, and a have a chance to become a systems thinker; this could give you an advantage over more traditional thinkers.
Professor Ben Clegg's research, teaching and consulting activities focus on operations and process improvement. He draws upon theoretical ideas, such as systems thinking and multi-organisation enterprise management, to implement practical solutions for organisations. In turn practical case studies and insights are used to further develop theory about operations and process improvement.

Scenario Planning has become the most popular strategy tool in the last decade. It is neither a forecasting nor a predicting tool but is used to improve managers’ ability to anticipate uncertainty and in that context to enhance organisational learning. It helps to develop a shared understanding and to scope mental models of perceived uncertainty between managers working in the same organisation.
This session will provide an insight into Dr Stathis Tapinos' Scenario Planning method which links scenario development to the sustainability of competitive advantage in order to support long term strategy making. His method is a multi-stage process; a structured method of disciplined imagination to create plausible images of future scenarios.
Identify factors of uncertainty for the future; using them to create a range of scenarios and narratives.
Assess the impact of each scenario on the organisation; and developing robust strategies which will protect the sustainability of competitive advantage.
Dr Efstathios (Stathis) Tapinos is a Senior Lecturer in Strategic Management at Aston Business School and is currently co-chair of the ‘Strategic Foresight’ Special Interest Group at the British Academy of Management.

In collaboration, Dr Keith Glanfield, Aston Business School and Harris Interactive have taken a long hard look at what makes a brand relevant and sustainable in a modern day context. The prevailing models for measuring brand effectiveness are largely based on examining indicators of past and present performance, and can fall short of telling brand managers anything about their brand’s future potential. What was a strong brand yesterday may still be strong today – but what does tomorrow look like? Will your brand still be as relevant?
Learn the thinking and research foundations behind the brand sustainability model, to address the question, “How sustainable is your brand?”.
Hear the results of the hi brands™ research study from the Harris Interactive team, who will share how measuring sustainability changes the way we think about category and sector success.
Understand how this new set of measures supports brand managers to manage and track future brand success.

The customer experience (CX) landscape is rapidly changing and with increasing customer expectations it is vital to be proactive rather than reactive. This session with Dr Laura Chamberlain will examine the changing loyalty landscape and question some embedded assumptions about loyalty. In addition, with the increasing emphasis on understanding customer emotions, we will consider the best way to think about customer emotions and measuring them.
Arguably CX is core to competitive advantage and as such many industries and organisations are placing increased emphasis on CX. Whether in a B2C or B2B context, if you have a customer focus, then this presentation is relevant.
Dr. Laura Chamberlain is a Lecturer in the Customer Experience and Consumer Behaviour at Aston University Business School. Laura is particularly interested in researching the importance of consumer emotions, trust, loyalty and how to influence customer’s behaviour. Laura also researches consumer neuroscience, using neuroscientific techniques to further our understanding of consumers. The customer experience landscape is rapidly changing and Laura’s research intends to develop scientific insights to assist Customer Experience professionals.
Laura's research is broadly located within the psychological tradition, containing aspects of the social, cognitive, and neuroscientific approaches. Within this broad context, the specific research areas she works in centre around the concept of consumer responses to marketing actions and the customer experience. I have research projects underway examining consumer emotions, loyalty, advocacy and journeys.
Laura also researches the role of negative emotions in response to advertising that advocates behaviour change (e.g. stopping smoking or not speeding whilst driving). Laura is also involved in research within the emerging field of organizational cognitive neuroscience and have an interest in measurement theory and the philosophy of science.
The first guest speaker was Dr Andrew Glencross, Senior Lecturer at the Department of Politics and International Relations, Aston University. Dr Glencross will be presenting the latest research and thinking on different Brexit scenarios. He will reflect on his new book Why the UK Voted for Brexit: David Cameron’s Great Miscalculation (Palgrave, 2016).
The process of leaving the EU is riddled with trade-offs. Putting politics first could carry a high economic cost, notably by limiting EU immigration or exposing UK companies to European tariffs. But pursuing economic interests above all else risks dissatisfying voters who want a clean break.

Ben Rubery, responsible for the management of Capgemini UK's Advanced, Higher & Degree Apprenticeship programmes, will share his passion for apprenticeships, providing opportunities to enable the start of their careers to be exciting and successful.
Sasha Morgan Manley from Aston University who will explain how your organisation can benefit from apprenticeships.
We often have little time to reflect on what is meaningful and valuable to us at work and how we could make our day-to-day working lives more meaningful. But what if we were given the capacity and capability to do this? Would we be more engaged, more proactive, and more psychologically enriched as a result?
This is an interesting question given the fallout from the global recession and the explosion of interest thereafter in creating an ‘engaged’ and ‘committed’ workforce.
In light of this, this presentation provided an overview of what meaningfulness is within the workplace as well as why it is important, and how managers can foster and nurture meaningfulness within their teams.

The importance of frontline employees for the success of organisations is recognised by researchers and practitioners alike. However their relevance for the innovativeness of companies - resulting from their boundary spanning role - is often underestimated and has received little attention. Based on an academic piece of research, Prof Christof Backhaus summarised the current state of knowledge in this context, and outline results derived from an empirical investigating “idea fishing behaviors” of frontline employees from a diverse range of industrial and business services firms.
Furthermore he assessed the impact of motivators - such as job satisfaction and desire for upward mobility - and the effects of other important conditions like role stress and internal network, on idea gathering and dissemination. Christof shared the results of the study, showing the chain of idea gathering leading to idea dissemination results in innovation. Plus the various effects of role stress underlines the importance of differentiating between role conflict and ambiguity. Based on these findings, he explored the implications for management that are derived.

"Growth comes not from competing on labour costs, raw materials or access to capital: our competitive edge depends on our capacity to innovate." Hargreaves, Digital Opportunity: a Review of Intellectual Property and Growth (May 2011) at 10.
If you are an innovative company in order to succeed you must make decisions with intellectual property in mind. You need an intellectual property strategy that is in line with your business strategy. You must know what intellectual property you have and what intellectual property of others you might be at risk of infringing. You can use intellectual property information to help you find worldwide competitors, potential partners, collaborators and gaps in the markets. You can use your intellectual property to reduce your tax bill and attract lenders.
You need to know about intellectual property so come and find out from Aston academic Claire Howell. Claire has taught intellectual property law for over 20 years at various universities and specialises in intellectual property in the business context. She will share her expertise and latest insights from her many publications on intellectual property law and company law.
Claire Howell teaches company law and intellectual property law at both undergraduate and postgraduate level and is keen to promote excellence in the teaching of intellectual property.

Corporate governance beyond compliance and how good corporate governance improves the ability to raise finance
The role of the board is crucial in a growing any business - small companies become bigger ones but often they see corporate governance as merely a compliance issue. Graham Robertson, Chairman Corex Group presents corporate governance beyond compliance and how good corporate governance improves the ability to raise finance. He will consider the role of the Chairman, Company directors, board effectiveness, the balance of the board, non-executive directors and the benefits of on-going director education to build a better board.
Graham passionately believes that if you are ambitious for growth or seeking to raise finance for growth it is crucial that the balance the board reflects your aims and ambitions.
Graham obtained a degree in Geology from the University of Aston and has since spent 40 years working in the international oil industry. Following several years of managing laboratories in the UK and West Africa Graham founded his own oilfield services company in 1987. At this time he gained an ACCA qualification in Accounting and Finance and raised venture capital to undertake several acquisitions including Corex and to grow the business over subsequent years. Today he is Chairman of the Corex Group, which now has operating laboratories in Aberdeen, Cairo and the Middle East.
Graham completed an MBA in 2011; his research thesis was in Corporate Governance linked to investor relations within the Oil Industry. The MBA experience taught Graham that on-going Director education is a real key to the further development of a successful business. Following the MBA, Graham completed the Institute of Directors (IOD) Certificate in Company Direction and then Diploma in Company Direction. He is now his working towards Chartered Director status also through the IOD in London.
Graham has also occasionally lectured on Corporate Governance on the MBA course at Henley Business School and at Reading University and also his local IOD chapter. He also occasionally lectures on Entrepreneurship highlighting the ups and downs of his own personal business journey.
Graham’s interest in Corporate Governance has led to an interest in “Building a Better Board” the subject of the presentation.
Graham is truly enjoying being reunited with Aston and currently involved in several projects with the university.
Dr Keith Glanfield and Susan Vidler, Head of Research at Harris Interactive discussed if there’s anything marketers can learn from Politicians to enhance branding success and develop category leadership.
Why on earth would business turn to politics and politicians for marketing advice? Well, firms want their brand to sum them up in a few words. They want a brand with wide appeal that can cross traditional boundaries in society and which appeals to many different audiences. A brand can be used to bring together diverse groups, including customers, employees and suppliers, to generate a strong bond and sense of affiliation with the firm.
The presentation built upon a recent article 'Political Populists and the new branding trail blazers' by Dr Glanfield published in The Conversation and the future relevance aspect of the “HI Brands” model by Harris Interactive.
The question of a fallout from Brexit is hunting a number of analysts. The trend in mushrooming publications (see for example: German Law Journal, Special supplement printed on Brexit already early July 2016) and media coverage (with the Guardian and Politico.eu taking lead) confirms it. Most of the analysts draw a distinction between the immediate-short term effect of the “leave” result stemming from the referendum and the long-term consequences of the UK going out of the European Union (EU). A similar approach can be deployed while looking at the changes that will emerge regarding the UK interest groups’ lobbying capacity.
Dr. Patrycja Rozbicka talk focused on identifying the short and long term consequences and how to counterbalance them.
Dr. Patrycja Rozbicka main area of research circulates around participation of interest groups in the European and national policy-making and transposition processes; which includes questions like: How influential are interest groups in the politics? Access routes for lobbyists and their effectiveness? And, regulation of interest groups access to policy-makers.
Patrycja joined the School in 2015, having previously worked as a post-doc and lecturer at the Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. Prior to coming to the United Kingdom, Patrycja held appointments at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada, visiting researcher post at the Institute of European Studies, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium, and finished her PhD at the European University Institute, Florence, Italy.
When thinking of corporate social responsibility (CSR), the focus tends to be at the organisational level and on what organisations 'do' which is socially responsible. It is argued that greater attention also needs to be placed within the organisation, on the employees. How can we encourage employees to further their individual social responsibility efforts?
Dr Nishat Babu, lecturer in work psychology focused on research conducted at Aston Business School on a number of organisational factors that may be relevant in promoting employee social responsibility efforts.
Dr Nishat Babu is a Business Psychologist and Lecturer in the Work and Organisational Psychology Group at Aston Business School, with expertise in a number of areas; including leadership, global working, and effective team work. Her research interests centre on leadership and corporate social responsibility (CSR) at the micro-levels. Currently, she is focusing on leadership and organisational climate, and the role they play in facilitating employee engagement with CSR at multiple levels within the organisation. She has developed a unique multi-dimensional tool to measure employee social responsibility in the workplace, and has applied this in her research with organisations looking to enhance their CSR profile. Nishat holds a Master’s in Work and Organisational Psychology, and a PhD in Management
Customers from numerous firms regularly have the feeling of being “locked-in” in with their current provider due to the presence of switching costs. Switching costs are the onetime costs that customers associate with the process of switching from one provider to another (Burnham et al. 2003). They include customer perception of time, effort, and losses associated with provider switching. This presentation provides new insights into the effectiveness of this retention strategy.
It also shows which customer segments to target as a company. While it is obvious that customers with prior switching experience and provider expertise are less likely to be bound by switching costs, it is unclear whether customers differ with regard to switching costs perceptions depending on other customer characteristics (e.g., age, gender, income, risk aversion).

The British music industry was worth a stunning £4.1 billion in 2014. The corner stone of the sector are live music events. The most recent data indicates that this particular sub-sector generated £924 million and employed 25,100 full-time employees in 2015, with stunning number of 27.7 million people attending live music events. The numbers clearly show that the value of that sub-sector should not be underestimated.
In the mists of the Brexit debate, there are number of scenarios to consider. The two readily available ones are the scenarios of Norway-Switzerland and Northern America (US and Canada). Lets focus on those and their effects on the British live music industry.
Most strategic thinking in marketing revolves around an outside-in approach so business leaders are encouraged to conduct marketing research to find out what customers want and what competitors are offering, externally, before developing strategies internally. However, this approach has some serious limitation especially when developing and strengthening brands. One major issue is that customers and consumers cannot articulate what they want, creatively, in ways that are not currently available.
An inside-out approach to strategic thinking is required for creative brand development; when more substantial changes to a brand are needed. This session will highlight a creative brand development process and give examples to outline how this was successfully implemented based on action research projects conducted by the presenter.
Dr Ian Combe is a lecturer in marketing strategy at Aston Business School.

There is a growing gap, locally and across the UK, between the skills businesses need and the skills job applicants have.
A new project called Higher Level Skills Match (HLSM)* has been set up to support SMEs in accessing the talent and skills they need, but they want to hear from businesses to find out what it is they want and need to grow the business.
Higher Level Skills Match (HLSM) has been created with and for businesses to support SME growth and employability within the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership (GBSLEP) Area. Birmingham City University, Aston University and Newman University have partnered to create HLSM, with the support of Cannock Chase, Lichfield and Tamworth local authorities. This project is part funded by the European Social Fund (ESF). For more information visit www.aston.ac.uk/hlsm
This interactive discussion led by Professor Ben Clegg discussed the basics of systems thinking and how it can be used to improve strategic operations management.
The session gave attendees an opportunity to develop systems thinking skills to make them a more holistic thinker and become more prepared to become an innovative manager of change. A new technique was demonstrated and an example given.
Management thinking is all too often constrained by linear and hierarchical thinking, but as we all know organisations and business are usually more complex than this and should not be thought of in this way; so why do we persist in doing so? The answer is simple - because we rarely know of any alternative.
Professor Clegg provided an alternative by giving attendees an introduction to systems thinking to prepare them to become an effective agent of improvement.
A taste for systems thinking, learn of a specific technique, and a chance to become a systems thinker; this could give you an advantage over more traditional thinkers.
Many marketers and organisations set themselves the challenge of wanting their stakeholders, particularly their employees, to “Live the brand” and in doing so create a distinct “brand experience” for their customers.
Some would like to think they’ve achieved this objective but many don’t. Why is this, what are we “really” trying to achieve, what can we do differently and by addressing “Living the brand” are we really addressing the core underlying phenomena of “brand experience”.
Join Aston Business School or this short workshop led by Dr Keith Glanfield. Keith will ask your views on living the brand, arriving at what it means and trying to achieve. We will then explore how to get employees to do this, what the difficulties and challenges are and how achievable this all is. Keith will share the latest thinking on the “identity perspective” to branding and we will finish with a short discussion.
Applying organisational psychology to branding uncovers an alternative way of “creating an environment” for brand experience to evolve and develop. In a workshop style we’ll unpick the conventional “living the brand” approaches to arrive at an alternative perspective on developing brand experience.
Walk away with a new set of questions and a different approach to evolving and developing “brand experience”.
Since the global financial crisis, real incomes have fallen, cuts to public services have been dramatic and interest rates have hit record lows. A decade on - and a weak and inconsistent recovery later - has led to the question, what lessons have we learnt if any?
More importantly, why are we still witnessing housing bubbles and rapid expansions in consumer credit across the world?
Johan Rewilak presents evidence on the importance of maintaining financial stability - and how financial instability is a phenomenon that depresses the economy even in the absence of a full-blown crisis.
He will discuss which various measures of financial instability are seen to peak prior to financial crisis and shows how more financially stable economies can withstand surges of credit inflows that have jeopardised economies in the past.
Examine the new schemes and regulations put in place by various multilateral organisations in an effort to try clean up the banking system, and discusses what we may expect to see in the future. Hear throughout the talk real examples used to supplement the academic findings.
Johan Rewlaik joined Aston Business School in May 2016 after spending two years working close to his hometown in West Yorkshire, at the University of Huddersfield as a lecturer in economics.
Prior to that he spent almost ten years in the East Midlands studying at both the University of Leicester and the University of Nottingham. He also worked as a research associate on an ESRC-DFID funded project “Finance, politics and growth” which had a strong focus on Africa.
Outside academia he has a strong interest in sports. A keen runner and footballer, he has competed at a high level in both.
What marketers do every day, and what organisations want them to do is constantly changing and evolving.
Initial research conducted by Aston Business School suggests “marketing” is at a tipping point. It’s very purpose, function and activity are under challenge. This workshop explored this research and discussed how marketing is changing, it’s potential future shape and what contribution it can make to business performance.
Policy makers and behavioural finance scholars express growing concern that marketing practices by financial institutions exploit retail investors’ behavioural biases.
Investor protection regulation should thus address these marketing practices and include mechanisms curbing behavioural exploitation. That raises the question whether the marketing communications regime of the new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive can live up to this demand.
This presentation sits at the intersection between behavioural finance and law. Martin will use the law governing marketing materials as a discussion starter for the bigger debate on how behavioural insights about retail investors' behavioural biases can be integrated into investor protection measures.
This debate is highly relevant for businesses as it directly impacts on what is required by an investment firm in order to conduct its business in a fair way.
Martin's findings are also relevant for the new hot investor protection topic in MiFID II, product governance, and the requirements relating to providing investment advice. He will address these wider implications in his presentation.
Martin Brenncke joined Aston Law School in August 2017 after spending two years at Oxford University as a career development fellow. Martin’s research interests lie in financial services law, EU law, (comparative) constitutional law and legal methodology. In the past, he was a post-doc at Zurich University (CH) and a visiting fellow/researcher at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies (London), the British Institute of International and Comparative Law (London) and the University of Cambridge.
As knowledge based services have become increasingly important, traditional managerial responsibilities such as measuring performance, improving quality and controlling processes have become more difficult.
Variable customer demands make processes difficult to control, reliance on expert knowledge makes quality hard to measure, while building the service on the knowledge of employees makes managing people a challenge. This presentation will illustrate how these challenges make life difficult for a small company as its success leads to rapid expansion.
The service concept – i.e. the mental picture of the service – is seen as a key part of service design and strategy. This presentation will demonstrate how articulating the service concept helps to diagnose the challenges of professional services by revealing the inconsistencies between how managers, employees and customers understand the service.
The presentation will help you to relate the challenges of managing services to those faced by other organisations and explore how the service concept can help overcome these challenges to create successful service experiences.

By facilitating discussions between the Missouri Assessors office and our client, we were able to support that $6.5 Million of short-term rental equipment is and should continue to be exempt from the state’s ad valorem or personal property taxes.
Our client needed to structure and draft a new lease agreement to renew their building lease. We were able to obtain current lease rates in their market and introduce them to a commercial real estate broker to draft the most beneficial lease agreement for them.
Under the old tax code, our client was subject to alternative minimum tax (AMT) and could not receive a benefit of research and development (R&D) credits. Once that rule was lifted, we suggested that the client take advantage of R&D credits. We have been able to claim Federal tax credits of nearly $50,000 for the company so far in years one and two.
By conducting cost segregation studies on senior living apartment and college apartment developments we netted the developers $415,000 in net present value with the combined cost segregation studies.
By completing a cost segregation study on seven senior living facilities developed and built we saved the developer/investor $340,000 within the first year of operations. The overall net present value of completing the cost segregation studies for these senior living facilities exceeded $2 million for all projects.
Performed a Cost Segregation study for a manufacturing facility that produces metal parts for the aerospace industry. By reclassifying 30% of the total depreciable property into 5, 7 or 15-year property, the accelerated depreciation deductions resulted in an increased cash flow of $250,000 over the first year and a net present value of $230,000 over the life of the investment.
Performed an R&D Tax Credit study for manufacturer of optical targeting products for metrology support systems. We were able to identify nearly $545,000 of Qualified Research Expenses (QREs) for tax year 2016, resulting in a benefit of $19,000 in total tax credits.
A St. Peter’s based manufacturer had a facility expansion that called for the creation of 125 additional jobs, new equipment needs and an ongoing training initiative. We negotiated with the Missouri Department of Economic Development to procure nearly $2,600,000 in benefits from the Missouri Works program, $680,000 in property tax abatement and $100,000 in training grants.
An R&D Tax Credit study was performed for a client specializing in rapid turnaround and high volume engineering and manufacturing of custom tools and dies. The study identified $1,150,000 of Qualified Research Expenses (QREs) for the tax year 2015, resulting in a federal benefit of approximately $60,000 in tax credits.
Deferred Tax on Sale of Building Through Like-Kind Exchange and Used Historic Tax Credits on Purchase
Worked with a client on the sale of existing office space and purchase of a new building defer approximately $15,000 of tax on the sale through a like-kind exchange. Additionally, because the new building was located in a historic district, we were able to assist the client through the process of applying for MO Historic Tax Credits related to the planned rehab of their new building.
Assisted a client with plans of adding jobs, purchasing equipment and expanding their manufacturing facility secure over $2.5 million in economic incentives from state, county and local governments through the Missouri Works program and the Chapter 100 bond process.
Our client purchased a golf course for $6.7 million in 2013. Due to complex depreciation rules surrounding golf courses, and to ensure they weren’t leaving deductions on the table, our client decided to perform a cost segregation study on the purchase. During the study, it was determined that the tees and greens were up to USGA standards and therefore we could treat what otherwise would be non-depreciable land as depreciation property. The net present value of the study was over $309,000.
A new assisted living facility was built at a total cost near $5.8 million. After our client engaged us to complete a cost segregation study, roughly 40% of the costs ($2.4 million) were eligible for bonus depreciation and accelerated depreciation. The net present value over the life of the project was over $432,000.
After purchasing a commercial building and incurring renovation costs totaling $7.6 million during 2008 and 2009, our client decided to do a look back cost segregation study and “catch-up” on depreciation deductions the 2015 tax return. Over $3.6 million of assets were broken down into shorter lived assets. The net present value of the study was nearly $355,000.
Our client, an auto dealer, purchased a commercial building for $1.6 million and incurred $1.5 million in renovation costs in 2014. After a qualified cost segregation study was completed, over $1.4 million of assets were broken down into 5-, 7- and 15-year MACRS property. The net present value (the cumulative value of accelerated tax savings) of completing the cost segregation study was over $273,000.
An office building was constructed from the ground up at a total cost of $3.3 million. As a result of a cost segregation study, nearly $731,000 of costs were re-categorized from 39-year property to 5, 7 and 15 year property. This resulted in an additional first year depreciation deduction of over $400,000.
We recommended a manufacturing client consider a research credit study to determine if federal credits could be taken on their tax return. Based on findings of the study, the company spent quite a bit on research and development activities and resulted in a $30,000 federal tax credit.
By performing an R&D study, we were able to successfully pinpoint actions taken by the client’s business which qualified for tax credits at the state and federal level. These credits translated into tens of thousands of dollars of tax savings for the partners of this flow-through entity.
Through depreciation planning surrounding the IRS Repair Regulations, along with performing a cost segregation study, Anders accelerated over $220,000 in depreciation deductions to save the owners of a medical office building over $100,000 in Federal and State income taxes on their 2014 individual income tax return. As a result of the accelerated first year deductions and additional accelerated deductions during the first five years of the building’s life, this tax planning will result in a total of over $172,000 in tax savings for the owners over the next five years.
Identified a tax savings scenario by electing to group interrelated businesses we enabled our client to treat otherwise passive income as non-passive for purposes of the 3.8% net investment income tax. By doing so, we were able to reduce the taxpayers’ current year tax liability by nearly $16,000.
In less than 24 hours, we were able to provide a tax savings analysis for our client who was installing solar panels. The analysis illustrated how the 1st year after-tax cash outlay would be less than 0.7% of the initial solar panel investment.
We have implemented an annual program to purchase Missouri tax credits, saving our clients tens of thousands of dollars each year on both their individual and business taxes.
Our contractor client had net losses for the tax year. We used these losses to offset all of their income from the prior tax year. This resulted in an immediate tax refund of $75,000 which they were able to apply to their current cash flow.
Our client received a notice from the City of St. Louis disputing the valuation of the company’s construction equipment. We responded promptly on their behalf, dealing with the city’s revenue department to resolve the discrepancy. Our client won the dispute, saving $1,500 in annual personal property taxes.
The Anders construction team worked with a client to setup and implement the QuickBooks® software. We also trained staff to use the software effectively and efficiently. The client now spends less time entering data, creating customer invoices and preparing payroll.
When our client came to us, their fixed asset schedules were in total disarray. We developed a process to determine which assets to capitalize and which to expense. We also cleaned up their personal property declarations, removing tens of thousands of dollars of equipment the company didn’t own anymore. We saved them thousands in personal property taxes over several years.
Using internal reports, we helped a client identify individuals who were being paid both as contractors and employees. This insight prevented the client from having to pay more in unemployment taxes.
Our client, a general contractor, was required to submit the General Contractor’s Certificate of Actual Cost (Form HUD-92330-A) when working on a project financed by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Within a week of the project’s completion, we performed a cost certification audit of the costs using the form. Our prompt service allowed the general contractor to be paid from the program more quickly.

There has not been much of anything in these pages regarding the Michael Jackson trial in these pages. The last real entry was this in Just Above Sunset long ago – November 23, 2003: Michael Jackson, Gay Marriage? - and has this business been going on that long?
I find the fellow repulsive and never much liked his music. When I saw his mug shot on a news show all I could think of was that he had been trying too hard, for too many years, to look like Nicole Kidman. Why? And how will this all come out?
… As for me, I'd rather not know how this comes out. Yes, there are issues here. Can wealth, fame and celebrity free him in spite of what he has become and what he may have done? Yeah, yeah. Perhaps so. They usually do, don't they?
But the whole business is not so much fascinating to some of us as it is... well... distasteful. Something you turn away from, or at least politely ignore. Like a guest at a formal party mistakenly making a really off-color remark, or your host inadvertently breaking wind - best to be polite and ignore it.
The law will run its course. Polite, well-mannered people won't bother much with this business. And some sort of justice will probably be done. Decent people will trust that this will matter will be settled in court.
But this week things seem to be coming to a head – and you can add your own bad jokes here regarding that metaphor.
It would be a wild, bold, and dangerous move for the defense to rest without calling one single witness, but it would indicate that they thought the prosecution didn't make their case at all.
I'd say it's pretty obvious that Michael Jackson will be found 'not guilty' at this point, which is not, of course, the same as innocent. Making a jury decision on this horrendously prosecuted case doesn't strike me as that hard. But when I ask myself what I think he may actually have done, I just don't know. I'm horrified by any sexual exploitation - even of a minimal kind - of a child. But every time I try and think of the minutiae of the Jackson case, I just feel nauseated and mentally change the subject. One thing is obvious: Jackson is psychologically damaged in ways I cannot even begin to understand.
Perhaps Mr. Jackson's attorneys could call Mr. Jackson to the stand where he could morph into some creature more scary than Mr. Jackson himself, moon dance, grab his crotch and then sit back down.
Meanwhile, the war rages on in Iraq, the economy is not in good shape and social security may soon become a thing of the past, but nobody is listening. Seems that news coverage is not what it out to be, but at least it sells add space.
In my never-ending role as resident "media apologist" (aka "media whore"), let me first refer you to Karen Hughes' line, recently alluded to here, suggesting that the Republicans don't getting punished by voters for whatever the hell they do. [Editor’s Note – See The Limits of Spin from last week’s issue for a discussion of that.]
The truth is, voters would have to hide themselves in sound-proof closets for months on end not to have heard anything in the media about Tom Delay's adventures (including his fussing with the Ethics Committee), the Senate Republicans trying to slam-dunk Bush's judge choices, the economy not looking too great, the war in Iraq not being a bed of posies, not to mention rising CO2 levels and failure to secure nucular [sic – ha, ha] material in the former USSR, nor that Bush is still pushing hard with his whacky Social Security ideas (which, I theorize, is a bigger distraction for those who do care about what's really going on the world than if we were to hear that the runaway bride was actually running off in hopes of being the mother of Michael Jackson's children.)
The real reason, assuming the Republicans really DON'T end up paying a price for all these things, is not that the news media hasn't covered all these things, but rather that too many Americans are so cynical, they really don't give a flying fart about all that "Washington politics" stuff. Assuming the media was inclined to beat the public over the head with "responsible" stories -- and after all their runaway coverage of the "runaway bride," I'm pretty sure they're not -- but even if they were, they would be almost totally ignored -- except, of course, by the likes of you and me. And the Republicans, whether or not you can call them "smart," are smart enough to realize this and play with it.
Such stuff is far less distressing than the political news – news of those things that can actually be devastating to all of our lives, leave us in poverty, or in jail, or dead.
Our high-powered Wall Street attorney from his offices high over lower Manhattan suggested Jackson’s attorneys could call the guy to the stand where he could morph into some creature more scary than Jackson himself, moon dance, grab his crotch and then sit back down.
After you see this [click on the link shown in the middle of the page and open, or download and open] - then try to tell me honestly there IS any creature more scary than Jackson himself. [Click here for slightly less spooky version.]
And considering that whole business is not only distasteful, voyeuristic consideration of such matters borders on being irresponsible.
On the matter of civic irresponsibility, you might want to glance at these two items from the Columbia Journalism Review.
Runaway Network Exec Kidnaps News from May 2 – a discussion of CNN and their massive coverage of the “runaway bride” story. And Day Four of the Story That Wasn’t, a follow-up the next day.

​An airman with the 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron inspects an MC-12W Liberty aircraft before a mission at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, on Aug. 20, 2014. Air Force photo by SSgt. Evelyn Chavez.
The 361st Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, has begun winding down for its return to the United States after four years of ISR missions in southern Afghanistan. The squadron has flown more than 25,000 air tasking order sorties in the MC-12W Liberty, racking up 115,000 combat flight hours, according to a Kandahar release. The Liberty has helped save lives and support the coalition objective, said 361st ERS commander Lt. Col. James Mansard. “A lot of sacrifice and commitment has gone into this [mission],” he said. The squadron “eliminated 450 insurgents, … provided overwatch for more than 50,000 friendly forces, and scanned [more than 8,000 miles] of roads supporting ground forces outside the wire,” states the release. “We helped eliminate threats and made life safer for ground force troops,” said MSgt. Shawn Cochran, operations superintendent for the 361st. The Air Force stood up the squadron in May 2010. According to the release, NATO forces will remain at Kandahar to continue the mission.

Fr. Gregory helped organize Camp St. Mary of Egypt many years ago when camp was held at "Zephyr" in Liberty Lake, Washington with about 30 campers. Camp has grown significantly since that time and he has been actively involved some of those years and not involved at all during other years. Again this year, he is blessed to assist Khouria Cindy with the many responsibilities that she has as Executive Director. He is currently the pastor of Holy Myrrhbearers Antiochian Orthodox Church in Bonners Ferry, Idaho
Jill joined the CSME team in 2013 as Registrar and was promoted in 2015. Her duties extend beyond registration as she oversees all form-keeping and information distribution throughout the year, including managing the online CampDocs forms. She attends St. Innocent Orthodox Church in Everson, WA. Her favorite part of camp is the Candlelight Ceremony Friday night.
JoyAnn is a highly valued "behind the scenes" member of the CSME team as she coordinates and organizes all staff applications and registrations and runs our background checks. She attends St. Andrew Orthodox Church in Arlington, WA. Her favorite part of camp is keeping us organized and safe!
Dave joined the CSME team in 2013 as Activities Director and he's kept us hopping ever since with his exciting games, enthusiastic spirit, and his emphasis on good sportsmanship. He attends St. Andrew Orthodox Church in Arlington, WA. His favorite part of camp is getting such a renewed sense of faith after spending one short week of fellowship with the youth, all of the clergy, and older peers. It is amazing to him to see some of these young children and how serious they are about their faith and he finds it highly encouraging. He is truly grateful to be able to serve CSME!

Just published, "Gustave Whitehead: First in Flight", reveals new discoveries concerning the earliest powered flights of mankind. It provides extensive, updated proof that Gustave Whitehead invented the world's first airplane and in 1901, made the world's first sustained, powered flights, preceding the Wright brothers by over two years.
Author Susan Brinchman is uniquely suited to present documentation concerning Gustave Whitehead. She has been intimately involved with Whitehead research for the past five decades; interacted with many of the previous researchers, was present for some interviews with witnesses, and as a native of Fairfield, CT, is familiar with the places Whitehead lived and flew.
Ms. Brinchman is available for telephone, Skype, radio, or television interviews. She may be contacted at gwfirstinflight@gmail.com to arrange for a mutually convenient time.

The sincere things that I cherished in our relationship. And yes it puts alot of strain on our relationship. Those reactions make sense to me. He craves someone like me, though. However, not but three weeks later, she told me that she wasn't good enough for me, and that she can't give nearly enough.
You can imagine how well that goes over with her family by now. And go with him if you can. You have to power to be the man you want to be.
Finally, you've hit the nail on the head. Thus he becomes my enabler, co-narcissist etc. He loves me but he can't relax in my home and is completely out of his comfort zone.
Only a few of those visits and I told her the last time was the last time. Assuming that you're sincere, you're doing this out of concern for the other person's well-being, but you're going about it in a way that fails to respect her capacity to make her own choices. Yes, pretty much the same experience here. And instead of becoming the cruel, but adored goddes ruling over his world I get rejected out of his mis-placed feelings of chivalry to spare me to have to bear his useless self. That is precisely his reaction, or was, in the early days.
The combination of that and the recession put me jobless, and pretty much homeless. We all know enough to move out of the house on Three Mile Island. But I am pretty confident when it comes to other things, like my job - I enjoy speaking to large groups and do somewhat dangerous fieldwork in remote places.
He can fix and do anything and is the quintessential Mr. Again, I'm not boasting of how good a person I am.
That's a new can of worms. What I'm really afraid of is that I'll let this ruin future relationships, should this not work out in my desired outcome. Could be that they're made for eachother. Of course my gf was put in charge of the wedding, more nose is left that needs to be rubbed in I guess. This was my first relationship, and I thought it was going great.
But for many different reasons i hate myself. Waiting for the Train to Come In. Now, I see part of his trust in the fact that he is increasingly sharing his work life with me, teaching me about that. It really helps me to enhance my knowledge.

For the floated image to look good, the surrounding text will need to be of a certain length. That’s why I’m writing this filler text: Typically one character is printed per keypress. The machine prints characters by making ink impressions of type elements similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing.

After their invention in the 1860s, typewriters quickly became indispensable tools for practically all writing other than personal correspondence. They were widely used by professional writers, in offices, and for business correspondence in homes.

We’re working with adolescent girls, bus drivers and ticket inspectors to make buses safe in Hanoi, Vietnam, so girls can travel through the city free from abuse. Cities such as Vietnam’s capital Hanoi provide girls with more opportunities than rural areas. However, they also put girls at a higher risk of abuse. Around 10,000 adolescent girls travel by bus in Hanoi every month, risking sexual violence harassment and theft. Our research shows that over 40% of girls seldom or never feel safe when using public transport in Hanoi. Lack of safe public transport is one of the greatest barriers stopping girls from moving around cities independently. Plan International Vietnam has established a youth media project which spreads awareness about safety on buses. The youth group hand out their comics at bus stops and ticket offices across the city to help keep girls safe on public transport. So far, 40,000 comic books have been distributed to passengers. In addition, 4,600 bus drivers and ticket collectors have been trained by Plan International to stop girls being abused on buses.

Do you know what sexual harassment consists of? Do you know how to react if it takes place on your bus? How can you rely on the school team to help, if harassment takes place on your bus? And how could you have prevented it from happening? It’s critical for school bus drivers to observe and identify offensive sexual behavior. Drivers can then adopt techniques to effectively intervene. Such techniques can be applied when taking on sexual harassment issues on the bus.
More from Inside Edition: https://www.youtube.com/user/cbstvdinsideedition?sub_confirmation=1 When a bus driver in Milwaulkee, Wis., saw a child walking around by herself, she knew something was up. Tiffani Lee thought the girl might be lost, so she pulled over and brought her aboard. She stayed with her while waiting for police to respond. The Milwaulkee County Transit System says the girl told the officer she lived nearby but didn't know how to get home.

Young Lady Sexually Assaulted on Public Bus by 6 Guys But No One Tried to Save Her. A viral video posted on social media got netizens all over the world outraged as it showed a young woman being sexually assaulted, but no one tried to intervene to help! The incident which recently happened in Casablanca, Morocco involved 6 teenage boys who surrounded the young lady in a public bus. They pulled her top down and also stripped her pants off. The video shows a couple of boys forcibly fondling her breasts and sucking on them, while the poor girl cries out for help. As if violating her modesty wasn’t bad enough, the teenagers insulted her in Arabic as well. The woman, who’s 24 years old, is seen in tears and struggling to get away from the hooligans, but neither the bus driver nor the passengers onboard intervened. Eventually, she breaks free from them and rushes towards the front of the bus despite her chest still exposed. Poor girl is desperate to get away from them! The horrible act that came to light early August revealed the concerning increase in delinquency and violence against women in the country. A national survey revealed that a shocking 2 out of 3 women in Morocco had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic abuse, the Independent reported. Moroccan authorities said they have since arrested the 6 boys who are aged between 15 and 17, for their “presumed implication in the woman’s aggression”.

Good deal. I don't "need" a post lift... just easiest. Haha. Maybe it's princess in me. YEAH. RIGHT.

I have a race jack and stands from my race car. I could squeeze under there as well, just prefer more clearance.

</div></div> <p> I was teaching a matrix karate class the other night, and the subject of reading an opponent's mind came up. Rather, I told the guys to shut up and read minds. There was a bit of surprise <a href="http://cartierjewelry.sport24.com/766291...njury-Attorney/">cartierjewelry</a>. The students all wanted to talk and ask questions...Turns knob to adjust cloth guides and speed of range to the exact opposite of what I had just told them <a href="http://www.plttr.com/products/TWA12A-Eco...x-Ribbon_4.html">Thermal transfer ribbon</a> accommodate changes in styles of cloth.. So I said, "Shut...in silence you can read minds. You can't read minds if you are talking so much that all you can hear is the talking.They create a sense " The noise level went down a wee bit <a href="http://www.cheapjerseysnfl.us">cheap jerseys </a> of belonging and sort of a license to go crazy about the team one is supporting. Owning this attire however comes at a cost which not all and sundry can afford to spend.. "Look," I said, "you could do forms and techniques and fight for thirty years...or you can follow my instructions and read minds in a couple of hours." After a minute of waiting for them to focus more on their forms and less on my words, I began to talk softly and unobtrusively. I wanted them to be able to do their techniques and input my data at the same time. </p><p> They were all good enough, had reached a sufficient level of intuition, to do that. "There is the body, and there is the mind, and there is the spirit.A man hid in a Kentucky supermarket and emerged after closing time with a healthy appetite: He cooked and ate six steaks, Discipline the body, and the mind starts to get disciplined <a href="http://www.csctrucks.com/GARBAGE-TRUCKS_c4">Refuse Truck</a> and topped 鈥榚m off with shrimp, birthday cake and beer.. Discipline the mind enough, and the spirit starts to get disciplined." I changed directions to surprise them and give them example and make their minds retain the lesson. "It is true that the eyes are the windows to a man's soul. Once you are disciplined enough you can look into the eyes and you will see thoughts. If a car was careening towards you, would you look at the car, or would you look at the driver?" One student said, "I'd dodge the car." I made the buzzer sound. "AHHH! Roadkill!" Another student said, "Look at the driver?" "You live," I told him. And I looked at Mr. Roadkill and grinned. </p><p> "You're still dead." The class chuckled ruefully at the death of one of their own. "The car is an object, and you must look at that which thinks the car along its path. The body is a meat object, and you must look through the windshield of the eyes and see that which thinks the body along its path. Stop listening to me and do your techniques without the distraction of my voice. Don't be fooled by the flesh...search for the spirit; search for yourselves. They concentrated on their martial arts training, and I knew that though their minds were blinking, they would soon turn off, and the blessed silence of their spiritual nature would shine forth <a href="http://gogocj.com/personal-injury-solici...-they-are-good/">gogocj</a>. </p></div><!--INTEXT_OFF-->&nbsp; Order by http://www.topwholesalehome.com/category...tml</body>;

Amidst the relentless flow of electronic data and imagery, social media applications can become a vacuum for time and content. And in an era of followers, likes, views, and shares they forge a new currency of power, reach and influence becoming the driver of our generation. Fabricated Freedom is a multi-part installation and performance piece exploring “the other” as subject, limited view and simulacra as each relates to the sculpting of projected identity, visual iconography and the temporality of social engagement online.
Debuting at New York’s Wallplay on 20 November 2015 and traveling to Kantine am Berghain in Berlin on the 29th, the piece was conceived by Berlin-based collective LAWBF and Canadian artist Justin Wu. It is incorporates interactive sound by MOTE Studio’s Davide Luciani & Fabio Perletta and app development, design and digital consultancy by Daniel Teoh. For the Berlin edition of Fabricated Freedom the content from the New York projections will be transformed into a hybrid club-installation concept with performances by Miles Whittaker of Demdike Stare, Ostgut Ton's debut artist Kobosil, theatre musician and composer Friederike Bernhardt and the LAWBF residents and a sculpture by Moritz Grewenig.
The title phrase was culled from Norman Klein’s The Vatican to Vegas: The History of Special Effect, where he examines the notion of “scripted spaces” – which Klein defines as click-through environments designed to encourage viewers’ perceived limitless options despite the space being engineered precisely for a specific mode of perception – as a continuation of Deleuze and Guattaris’ “desiring-production;” where they envisioned a space in which consumers intermingle branding efforts within their own psychic fantasies and create a sphere for social energy and exchange to funnel.
Considering Deleuze, Guattari and Kleins’ interpretations of the effect of consumption on our social interaction, how can scripted spaces and desiring- production be applied to contemporary mechanisms of interaction on social media such as Snapchat and Instagram? Sociocultural production on the part of contemporary arbiters of taste creates a system of signs through the commodification of imagery that define how we present ourselves through angling, framing, filters, brands, hashtags and ultimately a highly produced projection on platforms intended to be spontaneous. This calculated content is conditioning our engagement towards technocratic narcissism and a populace that becomes more connected yet further removed from one another with every post, like and tag. Users’ primary consideration is often to provoke an ideal experience of their lifestyle and perception of their identity for their users; and their desire to present appealing content can encourage superficial or brief engagements.
Inherent to Fabricated Freedom is smart phone technology. A twofold commentary on our increasingly dependent relationship to social media – how it dominates our interactions as well as the way we perceive and want to be perceived – is demonstrated across this two-room installation. Participants will enter the initial space utilizing a social media application inspired by Instagram and Snapchat to capture the seemingly ordinary individual they encounter in the nondescript space. Simultaneously, their feed will project to an autonomous audience in the secondary space accompanied by a soundtrack generated from an algorithm arranging the ambient acoustics of the first room. By displacing their audience, this performance highlights the tendency of social media in deterring users from experiencing the now and orienting our relationships to the present through the filter of documentation. Perhaps removing the pressures of creditability will encourage participant’s reflections outward.

Computer desks are a staple piece of furniture found in just about every household and business across the world. A desk can be used for a number of purposes including a surface to set your computer on, a place to store your office accessories, a surface to write or paint on, a place to catch up on work, a place for your children to complete their schoolwork, and as a place to keep important files that need to be accessed easily. Working at a computer desk is also more ergonomic in that it provides a place for you to set your laptop or personal computer down on and allows for you to look at the screen in a comfortable sitting position. The many benefits of desks are clearly evident by the number of households and businesses that utilize this piece of furniture. There are many different types of computer desks available, however one type of desk has become increasingly popular over the years as the demand for it rises. That being a modern computer desk.

A critical component in successfully organizing your home office is to pay close attention to your storage. Home office storage organization is very important for any home office, and there are a number of things that you will want to take into consideration. Some of the items that you will want to consider purchasing include boxes and filing cabinets, as well as shelves.
Office seating is the most important piece of furniture in any business. This is where our guests sit while waiting to be seen, where our employees sit while working throughout the day, where our clients sit for a crucial meeting, and where we sit for hours on end. For most of us, our office is our second home and the place where we spend the majority of our day. Just as people go to great lengths to make their houses presentable with visually pleasing furniture, the office should not be any different and perhaps even more important as you most likely receive more guests to your business than your home. A quick and easy remedy to ensure your office is just as presentable as your house is to purchase modern office chairs, making your office a contemporary and memorable place to visit.
Wood lateral filing cabinets are often preferred for their aesthetics compared to that of a standard metal file cabinet. The reasons why most choose not to purchase metal file cabinets is because of their sharp edges, and the tendency to tip forward once several drawers are opened at the same time. But in its defense, some metal file cabinet models have fail safe systems that stops you from opening multiple drawers at the same time.
The cherry file cabinet is extremely popular in homes today. Cherry is a high quality and durable furniture wood with an attractive red undertone. You can get genuine, solid cherry wood in light to deep, rich colors. What`s special about genuine solid cherry is that it darkens with age. This darkening feature makes cherry cabinets even more attractive as time goes by. These days, cherry wood is being used in both classical and modern designs that can fit in all kinds of interior spaces in the home or in the office.
Although many people use them to keep collectables and other display items, bookcase cabinets are normally used for neatly storing books in open cabinets with adjustable shelves. And if you,re a book lover you know how nice it can be to have storage for your books that are the proper size and have adjustable features to allow you to store and display your books as you want. The bookcase cabinet is an important item of furniture in any office or home.
There are a large variety of desk chairs out there in all different colors, sizes, upholstery options, and adjustments; but how do you know which one will work best for your office space? A good desk chair, whether it is for your desk at your work office or home office, will provide you with enough support to keep you comfortable throughout your sitting duration. With good support comes less back, neck, and muscle pain that can occur from poorly designed office chairs. While some desk chairs are specifically designed to eliminate pre-existing health issues such as lower back pain, other desk chairs are made to match other office furniture. For example if you have a desk in a mahogany finish, some may want to find a wooden desk chair with a mahogany finished frame to match their desk. Whether you spend much of your day sitting in your desk chair or if your desk chair is more for show, there are certain guidelines that should be followed when choosing a desk chair.
There are a few considerations to make before purchasing conference tables and conference room chairs. Most conference rooms are not just used by management and employees as a place to hold meetings and give presentations, but as an effective tool to interact with the company`s clientele, visitors and customers. Generally visitors spend a substantial amount of time in a conference room discussing and negotiating business, and leave with a lasting impression of the company`s professionalism and success.

For perfect clear vision, the image needs to be focused onto the retina, just like a camera has to be focused properly in order to take a clear picture.
If the image is not focused exactly on the retina, then the image will be blurred, just like an out-of-focus photograph. In this case, the person is said to have a refractive error.
Refractive errors occur when there is a mis-match between the length of the eye, and its optical power. These mismatches usually originate during childhood, when the eyes are growing. The exact causes of refractive errors are still being studied, but it is known that both hereditary and environmental influences can affect their development.
Most people have some refractive error, but in most cases the error is small, and does not cause any problems. In fact, the average person is slightly long-sighted.

California Poppies are one of my favorite wildflowers. Ranging in shades of yellow and gold, the flowers open in midday sun and close at night and on cloudy days.
Poppies grow easily in gardens, open fields and alongside roads and freeways. They even grow well in poor soil.
The golden Poppy is befitting as a symbol of the Golden State of California and has been chosen to be the California State Flower. A holiday has been designated for the Poppy on April 6 as "California Poppy Day"
Native Americans cooked the California Poppy plant in oil to produce hair tonic. The sap of the Poppy was used as relief for toothache and applied to open sores. The plant was also used as a sedative to help children sleep. Although the California Poppy is related to opium, it does not have the same effect as the opium poppy. The California Poppy stabilizes the psychological orientation of the user instead of disrupting it.
These vast open fields of Poppies were photographed at Lancaster, California. As the sun climbed high overhead, the Poppies began to open, smile and nod in the cool breeze.
Just as a Poppy flower unfolds its smooth silky petals to greet the warm rays of the sun, we too, can open our hearts to receive God's unfailing love.
And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. Luke 2:7
60 miles west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, is an ancient little village of Acoma, also known as "Sky City". This 12th century Native American pueblo, nestled on top of a 367-foot sandstone mesa, is believed to be the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States. Archaelogists date the occupation of Acoma back to A.D. 1150
Today only a few families live on the mesa. Life is very primitive. There is no electricity, plumbing or running water. Natural cisterns on the mesa trap rain water which provides drinking water for the village.
Traditionally, the outer walls of the pueblo homes had no windows or doors on the ground level. Access to the interiors was by ladders to the trap doors of their flat roofs. The ladders could then be pulled up if an enemy should attack.
In the picture below the ornate bar near the top across the 3 poles of the ladder represents a cloud through which the pointed ends of the poles pierce to help bring rain.
This white tapered ladder reaching up to the sky reminds me of another ladder. Jacob dreamed of a ladder from earth reaching up to heaven. And in his dream, angels were ascending and descending the ladder. At the top of the ladder was Jesus Who promised Jacob that He would always be with him and take care of him. Genesis 28:12-22
We too, can claim that promise today. God will be with us and take care of us just as He did for Jacob.
Stained glass windows are made of individual pieces of colored glass which do not mean much in itself until they are pieced together to form a pattern. Sometimes painted details are added to the design. When light is captured by the stained glass, the intricate pattern glows into a beautiful illuminated piece of art.
The center circle of the rose window above depicts the Virgin and Child, surrounded by figures of prophets. Second circle shows 32 Old Testament kings. Outer circle depicts 32 high priests and patriarchs.
Below are photos I have taken of stained glass windows at Die Gedachtniskirche der Protestation of Speyer, Germany. This Protestant church was built in memory of the protest that took place at the "Diet of Speyer" in 1529.
May God's love shine through the stained glass windows of our lives and may we always reflect the beauty of His character

An incident in Ramanattukara of Kozhikode city in Kerala will upset you. A video surfaced on social media where a man seemed to be under influence of alcohol barged into a college bus without permission and started abusing the driver.

This video was shared on Social media by Samsara Vishayam and went viral within minutes of posting.
Pothonatoker Dol celebrates International Women's Day 2014 (For viewers who do not understand Bangla, please switch on subtitles/closed caption CC) What you see in the video is taken from three performances on three different public buses on March 08, 2014 celebrating International Women's Day. Fellow passengers were unaware that it was a performance until the end, when it was announced to them and leaflets were distributed. It was a public intervention project based around the flash mob concept. For practical reasons to keep the performance “real”, its video documentation does not capture all aspects of the project. The government of Bangladesh a few years ago has made it mandatory for all public busses to have first nine seats reserved for “Women, children, and disabled”. This is to ensure ease of journey for women. However, the way women have been identified along with children and disabled people, is another debate, which is not the subject of this project. This project addresses sexual and other forms of gender harassments women face everyday on public transportation in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh. Majority of the manual labour workforce comprise of women. Office work and corporate jobs are seeing an increasing number of women too. Majority of these female workers use public transport to commute. The message in this project is about upholding equal rights, which in Bangladesh still remains on paper only. Even though our heads of state for past 25 years have been women, in everyday social situations we have a far way to go. With concept and direction from Zaid Islam, Pothonatoker Dol improvised a number of different scenarios played out on public buses, in collaboration with a diverse group of artists- Shashanko Saha and Parvin Sultana of Prachyanat, Salauddin Adhar of Dhaka Theatre, independent artist Shaheed Ahmed Mithu, fashion designer Shama Kun, rocker Tanvyr Chowdhury, and artists Mujtaba Zubair, Sagnik Sutradhar Nirjhar, Tarannum Nibir. Photonatoker Dol performers were Rakib Ahmed Baabu, Samir Ahsan, Mamur Akter, Tanay Biswas, Iftekhar Kabir, Asaduzzaman Noor, and Raka Tabassum. Thanks to Rakib Ahmed Baabu, the "curious passenger" for making the video. Special thanks to all the passengers of the three buses, and to Dhaka Metropolitan Police.
At the end of the video the racist man wanted to drop off my phone and he continued with verbal and physical agression STOP RACISM in the UK!!!

A very real attack by a female bus passenger who believes only she has the right to yell, swear, disrupt and interfere with a bus driver and it's passengers. When a female enters the bus with her 3 children and passengers begin making comments about her mistreatment of the children the female begins a tirade of yelling, screaming, and swearing in front of her children.

A California bus driver and the school district are in trouble after a bus driver was seen on video taunting a young girl with autism.
"I went on a big bus and I don't like big buses," he said. The autistic 7-year-old endured a four and a half hour bus ride from his home near Van Cortlandt Park to his school in Hunts Point on Monday. In that amount of time he could have gone from the Bronx to Washington D.C. "He was only there from 11:30 to 2. That was his day Throughout kindergarten and first grade little John rode a mini-bus to school, along with about twelve other special needs children. But Monday morning, for reasons never explained to his parents, a regular-size school bus picked up john first and then about three dozen more kids. "The bus driver was new, so he didn't know the route. That's what was told to me by the Department of Education," his father, John Arroyo, said. "You can't change his routine at all. He will get upset. He'll panic. He'll start crying. He'll just have a complete meltdown," Marisol said. We asked the Department of Education for an explanation. A spokesperson told us the department is correcting the problem by shortening the bus route, adding there were transportation

Over 90% of Children Under 15 Breathe Toxic Air: WHO Air pollution as well impacts neurodevelopment and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma, and childhood cancer.
Day-after-day around 93 percent of the world's children under the age of 15 (1.8 billion children) breathe contaminated air that puts their health and growth at serious risk, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a new report that puts into numbers the annihilating impact that air pollution is having on the global population's health.
According to WHO's report, tragically, many of these children die, with as many as six lakh estimated to have perished in 2016 alone due to complications from acute lower respiratory infections caused by dirty air.
The report on air pollution and child health released on the eve of the WHO's first-ever global conference on Air Pollution and Health on Tuesday unveils that when expectant women are open to the polluted air, they are more probable to give birth prematurely, and have small, low birth-weight children.
Air pollution as well as impacts neurodevelopment and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma, and childhood cancer. Children unprotected to high levels of air pollution may be at greater risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life, the WHO said.
"Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "This is inexcusable. Every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfill their full potential."
One reason why children are in particular vulnerable to the effects of air pollution is that they breathe more rapidly than adults and so absorb more pollutants. They also live close to the ground, where some pollutants reach peak concentrations - at a time when their brains and bodies are still developing.
Additionally, newborns and small children are frequently at home. If the family is burning fuels like wood and kerosene for cooking, heating, and lighting, they would be exposed to higher levels of pollution.
"Air pollution is stunting our children's brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected," Dr. Maria Neira, director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at WHO, said in a release accompanying the report.
"WHO is supporting the implementation of health-wise policy measures like accelerating the switch to clean cooking and heating fuels and technologies, promoting the use of cleaner transport, energy-efficient housing and urban planning. We are preparing the ground for low emission power generation, cleaner, safer industrial technologies, and better municipal waste management," Dr. Neira added.

I'm hoping that someone here can push me in the right direction for some information on a particular topology of audio amplifier for a simple radio that I'm building for a school project. Not looking for anyone to do the work for me, just some ideas,
The finished set will incorporate a single transistor radio circuit I already have working. What I need to find is something for the audio stage that both fits in with the required specification and the parts play list.
The project specific requires that the completed set has no more than three transistors, drives a loudspeaker and uses a battery supply of not greater than 3volts. The transistors can only be BC 549, BC 559, BC 327, or BC 337, or any combination. For battery economy the audio stage is to use some demonstrable form of adaptive, or sliding bias, so that the power consumption is relative to the audio output level.
This is a background project that we have to complete by the beginning of term in the new year so no rush
This all means that I have to construct my amp with just two transistors, and it will be judged on its audio output, signal sensitivity, and battery economy.
The only links I've found so far have been mostly for big power amplifiers, and the smaller ones tend to include transformers that are long obsolete.
The output of my detector is @100mV on a strong signal at night time, 20mV during the day. In its present form these signals are developed across a pair of homemade phones of approx 300ohms DC.
I just did a Google search for "simple audio amplifier circuit" and got lots of hits showing single and 2-transistor, for example this:
I never make the same mistake twice. Instead I prefer to fill my day with a variety of different mistakes
Thanks Mike you're a lamb for trying. But small single ended power amplifier designs complete with the adaptive/sliding bias (required project specifics) seem thin on the ground, in fact so far I found only one by Douglas Hall that would fit the job, but for an unobtainium transformer.
Been thinking about this with little or no answer, doing that with two of those lists of transistors and 3v and two transistors. 3v rail means to me that given the 0.6v you would lose from Vbe then you are to be looking at something with a single stage, like this:
But for the low current requirement you need to bias it so at idle the transistor is cut off or close to cut off, then maybe use the other transistor to form a diode pump sort of shape to track the signal envelope and increase the bias of the amplifying circuit to track that envelope. What your requirement doesn't specify is what fidelity is required.
It was called the "sliding junior" by Sir Douglas Hall. Published by the R&EC magazine in June 1973, I printed out the article at school, I think from the American radio history website. I'm out enjoying the sunshine at the moment, but when I get back, I'll see if I can post a schematic, I don't think I can do it from my phone. The transformer is a Repanco TT 56. Someone on another forum said even that wasn't suitable for the circuit because it was meant for push pull stages not single ended. I don't really understand audio transformer lore, but the article was quite clear was what was needed. I've also been told that circuit could use a "choke" and capacitor output, but they didn't say how And I wouldn't know where to start on that.

I think what you are describing is exactly how the "sliding junior" is supposed to work. In that circuit, diodes are used for the biasing and reference, if that were possible then both transistors could be used for gain. What fidelity, well listenable I suppose, if you are prepared to use MW radio. The teach said aim for 4.5khz bw and as little obvious distortion as it can be designed for. So he's not expecting much HiFi!
I have a copy of LT 4 on Dad's old computer in his workshop, but since he died mum is having a bunch of repairs done to the house and we are living in a rental at the moment, so I do have a bit of difficulty getting at stuff there! I even have to ponce the use of the neighbour's (also our temporary landlord) computer and WiFi, (lawn mower, swimming pool, etc, ect). He's a legend to put up with us
Perhaps one of the cheapie Hammond "universal" push-pull output transformers would do instead, or a small toroidal transformer ?
The tube manual is quite like a telephone book. The number of it perfect. It is useful to make it possible to speak with a girl. But we can't see her beautiful face from the telephone number
You boys are the best! The circuit Nick posted is the one so I won't upload it again. If someone could find a transformer I could do payment in kind (with electronique junque that is, valves etc. ) pending apro from Mum, of course, or just buy it outright if the price wasn't too astro.
What does anyone think of that choke and capacitor idea? The guy who put that forward stopped talking, another idea was similar as it turned out, the circuit was for an old car radio that would need adapting if possible, I couldn't think how to start with that job, but had even older and more obscure parts. Just looked up OC16.
Thanks Nick, I've sent an email to repanco just now, one of those transformers from your link may be worth just trying but the ratios seem odd, (I'm told).
Well, the output transformer is normally used in the collector circuit of a transistor output stage so will have a higher ratio than ideal, thats why I suggested the driver transformer which may be closer.

hey guys,random question what is your fav game series or game of all time ? My personal favorite is the SoulsBorne series
I like it a lot, though I'm not sure if I'd feel that way if I had been a big zelda fan before. Probably at least half of the people who don't like it, feel that way because it deviates from the standard zelda formula
Key elements of Zelda games are either undercooked or missing completely. Another game that missed its full potential because it just had to be so "big"
In none of these games there's a defined line between good and evil, the characters and the events are blurry, just like the meaning of life, their creators followed Aristotle's teachings for the creation of masterful works of art and created grandiose games that are better than any other in the sum (THE SUM) of gameplay, visual style, story and poetry.
This is what makes me despise the Dark Souls community so much. People act so pretentious, like beating Dark Souls is some huge achievement or it's hard, and then everyone outside the community (rightfully) thinks the game sucks because of it.

Although no one ever really knows another person's motivation, I think it's safe to assume that my refusal to evict the old super to make room for more customers led to my partner and I splitting. That was made painfully clear about a week or so after our examination of the super's apartment behind our coffeehouse when that same local thug named Gazoot who tried to sell me those candles when we were opening came into Café Rafio saying Sol had sent him.
A bearded hanger-on Von Ehmsen, whom I hate to admit bears a strong resemblance to me at age 29, was hired by Sol Joseph, my ex-partner to imitate me. That's me around the same time below.
My wife Pat ran out into Bleeker Street screaming for the local policeman who had disappeared as if on cue the moment Gazoot showed up.
Patricia was eight months pregnant at the time with our first son, and I figured it was probably as good a time as any to move on so she wouldn't become a widow before she became a mother. One thing was sure - I wasn't about to try to fight the mob by myself.
The Village was a little like high school - a couple years of it is enough, and it was time for Pat and me to graduate
We packed up our kit and caboodle and moved to a small, basement appartment in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn where within a few weeks I was rushing Pat to the French Hospital in Lower Manhattan to whelp our first born son Todd.
As it turns out, I really did save my life by the move because my replacement was murdered within a year.
By then I had shaved off my beard and mustache and got a job at the New York Post which in 1962 was the most liberal newspaper of the eight daily newspapers still published daily in New York City.
With me out of the picture, my ex-partner, Sol, needed someone who at least looked something like me to masquerade as Rafio after my swift departure from the scene.
Every artistic environment has its groupies, and the small Beat movement was no different. In addition to the real poets, artists and writers, we harbored many jackals who hung around the herd looking for leftovers when the countless young adorning females descended upon the village every weekend.
One such jackal was a tall, bearded hanger-on named Von Ehmsen whom I hate to admit bears a strong resemblance to me at age 29. Nobody ever saw anything Von wrote, but he was a colorful bearded wannabe who was a Beatnik from Central Casting.
Sol, a dapper, black-suited wiseguy, needed a "Rafio" to front for him, so he hired Von Ehmsen to play me, and soon the two of them made a second tour of super Simone Pepe's small apartment behind the café.
Apparently my impersonator Ehmsen had less heart than I, and the second time around he and Sol served the super with an eviction notice.
Today the former site of Cafe Rafio at 165 Bleecker Street is a Chinese restauarnt. That's Pat and our two grandchildren standing in front this past summer.
Since he had little else, Von Ehmsen had a Doberman Pincer which he took for a do-do run after closing the coffeehouse each night after 1am. A few nights after the eviction notice was served, the 73 year-old super Pepe accosted Von Ehmsen and his dog, and again begged to be left alone.
Neither history nor the police reports recorded the ersatz Rafio's reply, but knowing the man well, I always assumed it was something along the lines of "get the hell away from me old man."
I read about his death during a coffee break while working at the New York Post when I was doing the NY Times crossword puzzle.
I guess it pays to be a half decent human being... the real Rafio is alive and well and living on Cape Cod.
The life of Ronald Van Ehmsen, a bearded, flowing-haired 31-year-old Villager locally famous for his resemblance to Christ, ended last Saturday in a manner worth of the most violent passages in the Bible. He was shot by an elderly man facing eviction to make way for the enlargement of Von Ehmsen's beat-ambiance coffee house.
Simone Pepe, 73, the occupant of the premises behind Von Ehmsen's Cafe Rafio, 165 Bleecker Street, was arrested for the crime on Saturday evening. Taken to the Charles Street (Village) precinct house, he readily confessed.
The shooting occurred at 12:20 Saturday afternoon. Von Ehmsen was walking his dog near his cafe when Pepe approached him. According to witnesses, Pepe showed him an eviction notice which had been sent preparatory to enlarging the Rafio. The two men apparently argued, and Von Ehmsen finally turned away. Pepe, it was reported, then pulled out a .32 caliber revolver and shot the coffee-house owner three times. Von Ehmsen stumbled down Bleecker Street where he collapsed and died in front of a liquor store. Pepe quietly left the scene to take a train to his daughter's home in Long Island.
Von Ehmsen often displayed a picture of himself in the Rafio window looking like the common pictorial representation of Christ.
Ironically, only moments after the shooting of the Biblical Von Ehmsen, a man on a motor scooter drove by carrying a giant cross. About the same time local police cordoned off the area and found Pepe's eviction notice lying on the sidewalk. Detectives promptly traced Pepe to his daughter's home and arrested him. The elderly and allegedly ailing Pepe is scheduled to appear in court on April 15.
Since taking over the Rafio a few years ago, Von Ehmsen had become something of a legend in the Village. He often displayed a picture of himself in the Rafio window looking like the common pictorial representation of Christ. A later picture, however, contradicted this Messianic image. It showed Von Ehmsen, or "Von" as he was often called, driving down Bleecker Street in a bed on wheels ogling a sexy girl. Von Ehmsen's success with women was another part of the legend, which also included ownership of a weird variety of sports cars, old limousines, motor scooters, and the like. No matter what MacDougal Street thought about the exhibitionistic Von Ehmsen, most had to admit he had a weirdly amusing sense of style.
Because of his reputation, many among the huge springtime crowd surging onto Bleecker and MacDougal Streets on Saturday night knew of his death. Clumps of curious people peered into the closed Rafio, and many made wisecracks about the "beatnik killing." Some locals were also overheard singing a hastily written and ribald ballad, sung to the tune of "Mack the Knife," which recounted the violent demise.
Von Ehmsen's death was the second homicide in the controversial and highly commercialized coffee house district last week. On Thursday evening Thomas McNear was stabbed to death by Eugene "Teeno" Smith on Sixth Avenue near Minetta Lane. And on Friday evening police answering another fight call in the area cooled a near rumble at Bleecker and MacDougal Streets. One Villager living nearby shrugged his shoulders when it was all over and laughed. "Well, it's warm weather fight time again." Then he added with much less humor, "What can you expect when you've got the worst creeps in New York hanging out here now?"

It is common for surgical outcome information to be risk-adjusted because the characteristics of patients treated by surgeons vary, and the outcome of care will be influenced by these characteristics. For example, on average, outcomes are worse for sicker patients.
The postoperative mortality figures for the NHS trusts and surgeons were adjusted for various patient characteristics. This included: patient age, sex, site of tumour, performance status, overall fitness (ASA grade), the number of comorbidities, and overall TNM stage.
We used the same patient characteristics in the risk-adjustment models for both the 30- and 90-day mortality rates. The risk adjustment process works by taking into account the overall average mortality rate and the distribution of deaths across the NHS trusts / consultants. Because of this, the process will occasionally produce a slightly higher estimate of the 30-day mortality rate than the 90-day mortality rate. This quirk of the risk adjustment process is related to the degree of certainty with which we can estimate surgical outcomes. As explained below, we use a control chart technique to take into account the degree of certainty in these estimates when assessing surgical outcomes.
Surgeon outcome information will always differ from the outcome figures published at a national level because of random variation – some NHS trusts will have higher values and some lower. This variation is not communicated when figures are ranked. Consequently, these NHS trust or surgeon figures should not be ranked. Presenting this information in the form of a league table of surgeon outcomes would be misleading and lead to wrong conclusions about an individual surgeon’s performance.
The variation in postoperative mortality rates was examined using a graph known as a funnel plot. The benefit of this approach is that it shows whether the outcomes for individual NHS trusts or surgeons differ from the national average by more than would be expected from random fluctuations. Random variation will always affect outcome information like mortality rates, and its influence is greater among small samples.
On these plots, each dot represents an NHS trust or a consultant and they are centred on the national average. The national average for 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality over the 3 year period covered by the analysis was 1.8% and 3.1 %, respectively. The vertical axis indicates the outcome, with dots higher up the axis showing NHS trusts or consultants with higher mortality rate. The horizontal axis shows surgical activity with dots further to the right showing the NHS trusts / consultants which perform more operations.
The funnel plot includes two control limits to define the range within which we would expect NHS trust or surgeon outcomes to lie. Following convention, we use 99.8% control limits. It is unlikely for an NHS organisation or surgeon to fall beyond these limits solely because of random variation (a 1 in 500 chance). If the outcome figures for an NHS trust or surgeon fell outside the outer limits, there could be a systematic reason for the higher or lower rate, and they would be flagged as an outlier for further investigation. The main cause of variation within the control limits is likely to be random variation.
The expected range of outcomes for a given number of operations (the sample size) is shown on the funnel plots by the different coloured regions. We would expect the figures of the NHS trusts or consultants to fall within the green area if their outcomes only differed from the national average because of random variation.
None of the NHS trusts or consultants included in the analysis had a risk-adjusted mortality rate above the 99.8% control limit.
It is well known how many damages an high intensity of noise can cause to the human body. Indeed the nervous system, cardiovascular, digestive system and especially the auditory system are affected. Moreover, it increases stress and decreases attention at work, with greater risk of injury. Thanks to our experience in the field of hearing aids, we developed a new protection able to reduce noises selectively, eliminating only the harmful sounds and not the harmless ones such as security alerts or human voices needed during the activity. This type of protection is achieved by a mould of the ear, it is therefore purely personal and determines a perfect closure of the ear canal. The CE certification is a recognition to ensure quality at the highest level in the field of hearing protection. The BREAK EAR safety device is produced in compliance with the requirements of the standard EN 352-2-1993 and meets the essential safety requirements (RES) of legislative decree of December 4, 1992, n. 475 of abatement of the CEE Directive 89/686. It is clean, non-irritating and does not soak in sweat, you can take it away countless times and wash it with soap and water or other cleaning products without altering its characteristics, lightweight, practical and perfectly combined with other protective instruments, it is combined by a string of variable length to prevent loss and it is long-lasting.
What you need to know about poisonous mushrooms before foraging — Homestead — Bangor Daily News — BDN Maine
Mushroom foraging might seem like a sweet activity, but it can also be quite dangerous. While some mushrooms are delicious, others contain chemicals that can make you seriously sick — and these poisonous varieties aren’t uncommon. Take a walk outside — spring summer or fall — and you’ll likely run into some toxic fungi.
“Of the mushrooms we have in the forest, we have probably a similar number of edible species as we do toxic species,” said Greg Marley, a longtime mushroom expert from Rockland. “So any period of time when there’s a lot of mushrooms around, you’ll definitely come across mushrooms that can sicken you if you eat them.”
Marley said there’s about 40 species of mushrooms in Maine that are commonly collected and eaten, and of those, there are maybe eight or 10 species that are especially popular. On the flip side, there’s about the same number of common toxic mushrooms. And there are plenty of mushrooms for which the toxicity or edibility is unknown, Marley said.
For the past 15 years, Marley has served as a volunteer mushroom identification consultant to the Northern New England Poison Center and, at times, the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Poison Control Center. Each year, during mushroom season (late spring through November), he’s contacted on average two or three times a week about potential mushroom poisonings. The majority of the calls are about toddlers who’ve been exposed to mushrooms but don’t get sick.
Over the years, he’s learned that people frequently get sick from mushrooms because they mistake them for edible look-alikes or simply don’t have the knowledge to determine it’s poisonous. There have also been cases in which travelers forage in Maine and mistake a poisonous mushroom for a similar mushroom that is edible in their home country.
Fortunately, the most common kind of mushroom poisoning isn’t serious and causes only temporary gastrointestinal discomfort. Yet, there are some species of fungi that do more damage. And while some mushrooms are fine to eat when cooked, they’re toxic when raw.
“There’s a number of different mushroom poisons,” Marley explained. “And they’re grouped by how they impact your body. And there are a few of them, a small number, that are potentially deadly.”
That’s why it’s important to be 100 percent sure about a mushroom’s identity before eating it, Marley said.
With such a foreboding name, it’s no surprise that destroying angel is one of the most toxic mushrooms in the world. In Maine, this ghostly white mushroom is quite common. Popping up in late summer and fall, the destroying angel contains a toxin that if eaten can be fatal.
“Destroying angel and a couple of related mushrooms in the Amanita group are potentially quite deadly,” Marley said. “It’s among the more toxic species.”
Also known as common earthball, this poisonous mushroom looks similar to the edible puffball mushrooms in that it’s ball-shaped and doesn’t have a stalk or stipe. But there are some major differences between the two that foragers should know. While edible puffballs have a single opening on the top through which spores are dispersed, the poisonous earthball doesn’t. It simply breaks up to release the spores. Also, as the name implies, the outer wall of the pigskin poison puffball is tougher and thicker than that of edible puffballs.
“Most puffballs are considered pretty safe edibles,” Marley said. “The general rule is if you find a puffball that’s young and firm, if you cut it in half and it’s pure white on the inside and doesn’t have a thick outer skin, it’s probably edible.”
While the pigskin poison puffball isn’t nearly as toxic as the destroying angel, it will cause gastrointestinal distress when consumed. Furthermore, for some people, exposure to the mushroom’s spores can cause something similar to an allergic reaction, with sneezing, stuffy nose and irritated eyes.
With vibrant orange skin and the ability to glow in the dark, the jack-o’-lantern mushroom has a fitting common name. Often found in clumps on decaying stumps and at the base of hardwood trees, this mushroom has gills that often exhibit a weak green bioluminescence.
“They’re very common,” Marley said of Jack-o’-lantern mushrooms in Maine, “and they do glow in the dark, but you have to get a really fresh mushroom and have it in a very dark room. It’s very eerie.”
While these mushrooms are pretty to look at, they’re poisonous to consume, whether raw or cooked, and will typically cause vomiting, cramps and diarrhea. And, unfortunately, they’re sometimes confused with edible chanterelles. Marley said he’s usually contacted about a few poisonings from that mushrooms each year.
A large bulbous mushroom in the bolete family, boletus huronensis (sometimes called false king bolete) is a poisonous species that is often misidentified and when consumed can cause painful stomach issues for hours.
“It’s a beautiful, fairly large bolete that people mistake for the edible king bolete [which is also known as porcini],” Marley said. “And it really triggers pretty severe gastrointestinal stuff. We had a case just this week of a couple from out of state who collected and ate a couple of them, and it was 12 or more hours of really acute symptoms for them.”
This mushroom has snuck up on people because in some areas, it’s considered edible, while in Maine it has made people very sick, Marley said.
“Some of the old field guides call it edible, and apparently in the southeast, it’s collected and eaten,” Marley said, “but up here, pretty much anyone who cooks and eats it gets sick. It must be some variant of the species up here.”
This year, Marley has received report of a couple poisonings by this mushroom, so he’s currently working to get more educational material out into the public about the toxicity of this mushroom and its relative, boletus huronensis.
The term “false morel” describes a few species of mushrooms that contain a chemical found in certain rocket fuels, and to humans, this is a toxin that can cause dizziness, vomiting and, in some cases, death. With a squishy, brain-like appearance, they resemble true morels, which are popular edibles.
“Maine has false morels in the spring very commonly across the state,” Marley said. “They are far more common than the true morel here. Traditionally, some people ate them, but the toxin they contain can cause very serious problems and has led to death in people worldwide.”
If interested in learning about mushrooms identification in Maine, Marley will be leading a mushroom identification workshop on Saturday, at Merryspring Nature Center in Camden, and another on Sept. 29, hosted by the Damariscotta River Association. You can also check out Marley’s book “Chanterelle Dreams and Amanita Nightmares: The Love, Lore, and Mystique of Mushrooms,” which highlights edible and poisonous mushrooms.
If you’re concerned you may have ingested a poisonous mushroom, call the Northern New England Poison Center at 800-222-1222.

Milan Zrzek is looking for a new apartment. He has a viewing arranged and turns up to meet Jaro Grygar who will show him an apartment. As Jaro explains the facilities they walk around. Then Milan checks out the view from the window and they discuss the rental cost. It seems that Milan wants it cheaper, but is interested in the additional services offered for the price. Jaro helps him off with his shirt and then Milan sits and they kiss. â¦
Jaro takes his shirt off too and then they start to open their jeans. Milanâs cock is already rock hard. It is a real big dick and Jaro is quickly sucking on it. His mouth closes over the thick shaft and sucks real good. Then he lowers his jeans too, and his cock is also rock hard. Milan leans over and starts to suck on it. They take turns sucking on each otherâs throbbing cocks, with Jaro standing, his massive dick poking out in front. Then Milan stands too and Jaro drops down to suck some more. With those massive dicks rock hard they each enjoy the otherâs wood. Then Jaro gets in position so that Milan can slide his cock deep into that sexy ass. He really pounds away at that hole, his big cock taking long strokes. Jaro moans with each deep thrust. He takes it very well and is soon sitting on that massive dick, riding up and down on it. As he works his ass over that cock his own dick is wanked by Milan. Who also manages to suck on it as well. That cock is huge Milan really works it as he rams his dick into Jaroâs hot hole. As he holds his ass in place and wanks himself Jaro feels Milanâs dick really working his ass. He gets a good hard fucking as he wanks himself to a big, creamy load. Then he lays down, with Milan standing to continue fucking that eager hole. Milan fucks that ass with long, deep strokes until he is ready to blow too. He pulls out and shoots his cum over Jaroâs leg. All spent they share some more kisses after a really hot time.

Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian on 30th June expressed confidence in resolving 'teething' problems of GST implementation within two months.
"Indian consumers normally start preparations with new designs and collections in July which marks the beginning of the season. But, jewellery demand remained fairly good both in India and overseas. Meanwhile profitability of diamond processors is under tremendous pressure. Hence, they have adjusted the price to claim profitability." Praveen Shankar Pandya, Chairman, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC).
Gold edged lower on 3rd July as investors shunned safe-haven assets for equities, with Asian stocks remaining near two-year highs, and as the dollar rose from a nine-month low.
Luk Fook’s share price rose on 29th June as the Hong Kong-based jeweler reported a jump in profit for fiscal 2017 and an improvement in consumer sentiment in mainland China.
Jewelers of America (JA) hosted two days of meetings and events in Washington to give retailers and suppliers the opportunity to talk with lawmakers about issues affecting the industry.
“The 3% GST rate for gold and gold jewellery though would result in a slight increase of about 1% additional tax, but at the same time the dealers would be able to take input tax credit, which is an upside. Overall, I think GST will be smooth for jewellers,” Harpreet Singh, Partner, Indirect Tax, KPMG India
Paytm, which has sold more than 100 kg of gold on its platform, is in discussions with jewellers across the country to enable buyers to redeem their digital gold in the form of jewellery. Read More

"The Vail Valkyries will be looking to provide some summertime entertainment in what is already a winter wonderland," said Haas at the franchise announcement ceremony.
In answering questions about the teams name Haas said, "The Valkyrie transports the souls of the departed wariors on their trip to Valhalla, so if we don't win the Spit Cup this year at least our players souls will be taken care of."
Haas also mentioned that his favorite frolf disc was the Valkyrie made by Innova. As to why Vail was chosen as the host city for his 2006 franchise Haas chimed, "Listen, Vail has the sickest bowls and cliff drops in the state and with the early season snow it will be steep and deep until at least mid April. Where else would you want to be on a snowy day in January?" When it was mentioned that it may be difficult to host games at Vail until late May or early June Haas said, "I hope those Beeyatches are able to ski!!!"

RenderScript is a high-performance runtime that provides compute operations at the native level. RenderScript code is compiled on devices at runtime to allow platform-independence as well.
This reference documentation describes the RenderScript runtime APIs, which you can utilize to write RenderScript code in C99. The RenderScript compute header files are automatically included for you.
RenderScript supports fixed size vectors of length 2, 3, and 4. Vectors are declared using the common type name followed by a 2, 3, or 4. E.g. float4, int3, double2, ulong4.
Multiple entries of a vector can be accessed at once by using an identifier that is the concatenation of multiple letters or indices. The resulting vector has a size equal to the number of entries named.
The entries don't have to be contiguous or in increasing order. Entries can even be repeated, as long as we're not trying to assign to it. You also can't mix the naming styles.
RenderScript supports fixed size square matrices of floats of size 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4. The types are named rs_matrix2x2, rs_matrix3x3, and rs_matrix4x4. See Matrix Functions for the list of operations.
Quaternions are also supported via rs_quaternion. See Quaterion Functions for the list of operations.
The types below are used to manipulate RenderScript objects like allocations, samplers, elements, and scripts. Most of these object are created using the Java RenderScript APIs.
The functions below convert from a numerical vector type to another, of from one color representation to another.
The mathematical functions below can be applied to scalars and vectors. When applied to vectors, the returned value is a vector of the function applied to each entry of the input.
See Vector Math Functions for functions like distance() and length() that interpret instead the input as a single vector in n-dimensional space.
The precision of the mathematical operations on 32 bit floats is affected by the pragmas rs_fp_relaxed and rs_fp_full. Under rs_fp_relaxed, subnormal values may be flushed to zero and rounding may be done towards zero. In comparison, rs_fp_full requires correct handling of subnormal values, i.e. smaller than 1.17549435e-38f. rs_fp_rull also requires round to nearest with ties to even.
Different precision/speed tradeoffs can be achieved by using variants of the common math functions. Functions with a name starting with
native_: May have custom hardware implementations with weaker precision. Additionally, subnormal values may be flushed to zero, rounding towards zero may be used, and NaN and infinity input may not be handled correctly.
half_: May perform internal computations using 16 bit floats. Additionally, subnormal values may be flushed to zero, and rounding towards zero may be used.
The precision of the mathematical operations on 32 bit floats is affected by the pragmas rs_fp_relaxed and rs_fp_full. See Mathematical Constants and Functions for details.
fast_: May perform internal computations using 16 bit floats. Additionally, subnormal values may be flushed to zero, and rounding towards zero may be used.
These functions let you manipulate square matrices of rank 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4. They are particularly useful for graphical transformations and are compatible with OpenGL.
We use a zero-based index for rows and columns. E.g. the last element of a rs_matrix4x4 is found at (3, 3).
RenderScript uses column-major matrices and column-based vectors. Transforming a vector is done by postmultiplying the vector, e.g. (matrix * vector), as provided by rsMatrixMultiply().
To create a transformation matrix that performs two transformations at once, multiply the two source matrices, with the first transformation as the right argument. E.g. to create a transformation matrix that applies the transformation s1 followed by s2, call rsMatrixLoadMultiply(&combined, &s2, &s1). This derives from s2 * (s1 * v), which is (s2 * s1) * v.
To update values shared between multiple threads, use the functions below. They ensure that the values are atomically updated, i.e. that the memory reads, the updates, and the memory writes are done in the right order.
These functions are slower than their non-atomic equivalents, so use them only when synchronization is needed.
Note that in RenderScript, your code is likely to be running in separate threads even though you did not explicitely create them. The RenderScript runtime will very often split the execution of one kernel across multiple threads. Updating globals should be done with atomic functions. If possible, modify your algorithm to avoid them altogether.
The functions below can be used to tell the current clock time and the current system up time. It is not recommended to call these functions inside of a kernel.
The rsGetElementAt and rsSetElement* functions are somewhat misnamed. They don't get or set elements, which are akin to data types; they get or set cells. Think of them as rsGetCellAt and and rsSetCellAt.
The functions below can be used to query the characteristics of an Allocation, Element, or Sampler object. These objects are created from Java. You can't create them from a script.
They are a structured collection of cells that can be used to store bitmaps, textures, arbitrary data points, etc.
This collection of cells may have many dimensions (X, Y, Z, Array0, Array1, Array2, Array3), faces (for cubemaps), and level of details (for mipmapping).
The term "element" is used a bit ambiguously in RenderScript, as both type information for the cells of an Allocation and the instantiation of that type. For example:
When creating Allocations of common elements, you can simply use one of the many predefined Elements like F32_2.
The functions below are intended to be used during application developement. They should not be used in shipping applications.

Samsung and the TouchWiz UI are inseparable when you talk of their Android devices, but when you talk about the speed of the interface, it’s not always the best in comparison to the other smartphones and the reason for that is not always the interface itself but the way we use it and set options in it.
There are a lot of features in the Galaxy devices which eat up the battery, as well as make the device slow on performance. Below are a few basic tips that would help you increase the speed and performance of the Samsung devices with the TouchWiz interface.
The multitasking window in most of the Samsung galaxy devices can be accessed by long pressing the home key, and this would open a list of all the recently active and the currently active apps. Do make this a routine by reducing the number of active apps on this window, by sliding them to the right to inactivate them. These running apps are the ones which eat up the RAM and slows down the smartphone.
There are quite a lot of app processes that keep running in the background, and many at a time are responsible for the slowing down of the device. It’s manually possible to shut down these processes where you need to go to Settings > Application Manager and there you would be able to see the active processes, from which you need to select the app processes which you feel should not be running unnecessarily.
The S Voice feature was made to be a Siri alternative by Samsung, and it is not a bad feature, but the same wastes precious seconds when you try to access it through the home key, where double pressing the home key activates the S Voice. This takes 1-2 seconds unnecessarily, and for several of those users who don’t know much about the S Voice, and who feel that they don’t need the S Voice app opening from the home key, go to the S Voice app > Settings and there uncheck the option “Open via the home key”.
Now, let’s talk the basics. These are a few points which could work well in speeding up the other smartphones too, but have always been helpful in keeping the performance of the TouchWiZ UI good:
Each and every widget that is located on the different home screens uses the random memory to run, and because of being the live widgets such as the Weather, Clock, Mails, Social network updates widgets they keep the processor ticking and thus reduce the performance. If you are using them regularly, you may keep them or it’s better to remove the widgets.
We know that this isn’t a computer to shut down and restart, but yes restarting the smartphone stops all the unwanted processes that you might have started and failed to close, and thus a restart of the system changes the speed quite a bit.
There are animations which can add to the delay of the activities, and these can be stopped if you really don’t feel any need to have them running on several instances. To stop these animations, you need to go to Settings > Developer options and set the following to off:
This tip is specifically for the devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Grand, as you would not be getting such developer and animation settings in the later devices such as the Galaxy Mega.
So these above tips would come handy when you feel that your Samsung Android smartphone is being laggy and has become slow on performance, and you need some ways rather than rooting it to make the performance better than what it is right now.
“> Application Manager and there you would be able to see the active processes, from which you need to select the app processes which you feel should not be running unnecessarily.”
How do I determine which processes are safe to turn off? Are there any specifically that should be left on at all times?
I think the article has been written for the sake of writing it… Some specific tweaks would be welcome
Many users don’t even opt for these tips too and keep complaining about their devices. Yes you are right about tweaks and those can be found on XDA.
Killing the tasks from taskbar (accessing by holding home down) – it’s also possible to swipe to the left, does this also kill/remove the app from memory or does it only remove it from the list of latest accessed app’s ?

So, I already pay for the baby first channel as part of my tv line up, and they’re saying I have to pay ANOTHER monthly fee to use this!?! What a load! Am I forced to pay extra for the HBO now app? Of course not bc I already pay a premium for their content. Soooooo what kind of genius would pay twice to view content they already pay for???? What a joke
I was charged For a year membership (not what I agreed to) and since the day I was charged I cannot play videos. So I was charged $50 for a flower icon on my phone since the app is useless since the update and trying to contact somebody is like a puzzle and nearly impossible
I have disputed this app for 8 months my card continues to get charged every month. Please stop my subscription to this app. I’ve called Apple and I cant seem to get anyone that can help either!!!
I pay 5.99 each month and for some reason this month the app will not load. I've tried re-downloading it and turning off the iPad and it still will not load and my autistic son is not very happy about it. So could you guys please fix the problem with the app?
The paid subscription is very disappointing. We purchased it for the purpose of traveling and not being connected to WiFi. You need to play each video in order for it to be available for offline viewing which is fine but we still had problems viewing more that half of the videos we downloaded. Very buggy and needs some work. Should have listened to the other user reviews listed before purchasing. Definitely a waste of money and would not recommend purchasing the subscription.
I wish there was an easier way to favorite/download my daughter’s favorite shows. Currently you have to watch the episode and then favorite it. So time consuming and such a pain!
The shows itself are awesome it’s the network connection . It says you can watch your baby first download off air but for the most part it does not work and when it does it should be able to play one show after the other and when you are connected to an internet some of the shows does not come upload very disappointing
I purchased the app and monthly subscription all on my iPad and I went ahead and downloaded it on my phone for easier access when needed but the issue I’m having is it doesn’t allow me to watch it on another device. I can only watch it on my iPad, I cannot log in on my phone!
We have the baby first channel at home and my son loves it. I figured this app would be amazing when away from home with a fussy baby. However, this app that I thought would be free is far from it. The “free” trial that they have when first opening the app is worthless considering it only has one video to watch. Disappointed to say the least

The third issue of the book series by photographer Dominique Panhuysen has been published. The series is dedicated to the New Amsterdam Courthouse construction site and building process. This latest edition features a look at the current groundwork and construction of the two underground levels.
Spreading over approx. 10 000 sqm, the New Courthouse project aims to merge the city streets with the layout of the building, creating an extension of urban space within. Comprising 12 levels, the building is exemplary in its efficiency, like the organization itself, and is part of the daily life surrounding it.
KAAN Architecten is undertaking works for the New Amsterdam Courthouse as part of a consortium which includes Macquarie Capital, ABT, DVP, construction companies Heijmans and M.J. de Nijs & Zonen, and Facilicom. Completion of the project is expected in September 2020.
Utopia – Library and Academy for Performing Arts in Belgium and Institut des Sciences Moléculaires d’Orsay in France have been nominated for 2019 edition of the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture – Mies van der Rohe Award just months after their official release earlier this year.
Both buildings represent landmarks in their respective communities – Utopia as long-awaited cultural hub of Aalst, Belgium and ISMO as a flagship of the new urban campus in France. Complex programmes merging multiple functions and careful contextual design are other common aspects of the nominated projects.
Utopia Library and Academy for Performing Arts incorporates a striking historic building from the second half of the 19th century and rejuvenates the urban landscape while elegantly giving expression to the required functionality. The project was carried out through close collaboration between KAAN Architecten as designer and Van Roey as main contractor. Meanwhile, Institut des Sciences Moléculaires d’Orsay, designed in collaboration with local architects FRES Architectes as a part of the future Paris-Saclay campus, is dedicated to higher education, research and innovation.
Other KAAN Architecten projects nominated in the previous editions of the EU Mies Award include Education Centre Erasmus MC and the Supreme Court of The Netherlands. Organised by the Fundació Mies van der Rohe with support of the Creative Europe programme of the European Commission, the Award is dedicated to recognizing and commending excellence in European architecture. The Jury will announce the 40 shortlisted works at the beginning of 2019, while the 5 Finalist works will be known in February.
Marked under the date 13 June 2019 of the new calendar is B30 – a historical building in Bezuidenhoutseweg 30 in The Hague, now transformed into a contemporary and state-of-the-art working environment. The original building acts a vital and sustainable component of the total design brought to life by use of rich materials and clear layouts.
As such, the renovation process relied heavily on the expertise of the craftsmen who supplied their skills during the construction. In their honor, under the photograph by Karin Borghouts, the calendar also features a short ‘Ode to the Craft’ by KAAN Architecten founding partner Dikkie Scipio:
On 25 October, 2018 construction started on De Zalmhaven residential complex on a site adjacent to the former eponymous port in the center of Rotterdam.
De Zalmhaven is developed by AM & Amvest and consists of approximately 450 high-quality apartments located inside two mid-rise towers (by KAAN Architecten) and a skyscraper (by Dam & Partners). The project is expected to be completed by 2021.
Combining both urban and local scales, the new complex feels stately and formal yet also extremely transparent. The two mid-rise towers designed by KAAN Architecten are each 70 metres tall, sprouting from a solid plinth with clearly marked entrances. The footprint of each tower is a split and shifted square, creating more corners and an interesting range of apartments in differing sizes, all with corner windows offering astounding views. The plinth includes family houses with rooftop gardens and has a direct relationship with the surroundings at ground level.
KAAN Architecten was appointed by the American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) to design the Visitor Center at Netherlands American Cemetery (NEAC) in Margraten after a competitive contracting process.
The new visitor center will be a product of an integrated design process dedicated to creating an effective and efficient facility with the attention to the landscape. KAAN Architecten will take the lead on the design and collaborate with the landscape architecture firm Karres+Brands. Furthermore, the design process will be supported by DGMR, Pieters Bouwtechniek, HP Engineers and B3 Bouwadviseurs.
The Netherlands American Cemetery and Memorial is the only American military cemetery in the Netherlands. Situated in the Limburg region, close to Maastricht and the Belgian border, it represents a significant site within the Dutch territory. The cemetery honors and protects the burials of 8,301 American military dead with another 1,722 names inscribed on the Tablets of the Missing, and provides an opportunity for families of the soldiers, local inhabitants and others affected by the war to commemorate those buried in the cemetery, and to learn about the dynamics leading to the liberation of Europe. For this reason, ABMC plans to enhance the understanding of the NEAC by constructing a visitor center with interpretative exhibits at the cemetery which will complement the site in both style and dignity.
Organized by the Fleur Groenendijk Foundation in collaboration with Rotterdam Academy of Architecture and Urban Design and under the guidance of Dikkie Scipio, the De Meester award serves to highlight and promote work of young architecture graduates in the Netherlands.
In less than two weeks, this years nominees will present their projects in front of the jury in order to win the title of De Meester. Led by chairman Dikkie Scipio, the jury is comprised of the journalist and author Tracy Metz, architect Bjarne Mastenbroek, urban planner Karen van Vliet, and Rotterdam Festivals director Johan Moerman. All nominated projects address topical issues of urban life while questioning the disciplines of architecture and urban planning.
The graduation project of Nina van Osta focuses on elderly people with physical or mental disabilities which are often marginalized by the community and forced to live in less than adequate conditions. The project offers an alternative in the form of a pleasant and safe living environment where the elderly can lead their lives as independently and actively as possible and where care facilities, activities and social relations are within reach.
On the other hand, nominee Jurian Voets forms an alternative to the ‘Living Vision 2030’, in which the municipality of Rotterdam actively encourages gentrification without showing a vision of suitable urban housing for existing and future residents. This alternative is the ‘intense city’, the city where living together and meeting are central, where high density and diversity of people lead to more variety, a rich level of amenities and a healthy local economy.
Finally, nominee Bram van Ooijen responds to the refugee crisis as an urban problem of the twenty first century. Based on this, Bram formulates a strategy on the basis of which the refugee camp can develop from the state of exception into an inclusive urban district. The project investigates the possible future for a Palestinian refugee settlement, which in 2017 was still dependent on international aid.

A grand opening was held on 6 September, 2018 at the recently completed crematorium in Aalst, Belgium.
Just three months after completing the Utopia Library and Academy for performing arts in Aalst, KAAN Architecten added another landmark to their Belgian opus right at the edge of the same city. Recently finished Crematorium Siesegem was opened in a lavish ceremony with several hundred visitors.
Former Westlede director Kris Coenegrachts and the mayor of Aalst, Christoph D’Haese gave inaugural speeches, while KAAN Architecten founding partner Vincent Panhuysen presented the design.
Visitors participated in a guided tour, where they explored the building and the landscape, as well as learned about the cremation process and ceremony. See the atmosphere from the opening event in a photo reportage by Sebastian van Damme.
Full release of the project is set for November. In the meantime, find out more about the design here.
Recently opened Crematorium Siesegem by KAAN Architecten is set in a vast cultivated landscape outside Aalst, Belgium designed by Erik Dhont.
In order to disengage from the surrounding commercial estates, the site was transformed with physical and visual barriers. Trees and shrubs line the perimeter while the crematorium is situated in the middle, with a footprint of 74 by 74 meters. The surrounding greenery is envisioned as an extension of the crematorium space and is an important part of the funeral ceremony.
Upon arrival, undulating hills emerge from the ground among the parking areas, while a dynamic landscape spreads to the east articulated by natural flora development on the sloping topography. The hills for scattering the ashes and the urn garden rise along the northern facade, bringing the landscape into the ceremonial proceedings. This cohesive relationship between the building and the nature is essential, and will only become stronger when the final form of the new landscape expresses its full potential after a few seasons.
The goal was to design a building capable of internalizing the landscape so that its tranquility could console visitors and provide strength. This is also why interior spaces are strategically oriented within the landscape to create enclosed patios blurring the distinction between interior and exterior.
Full release of the project is set for November. In the meantime, find out more about the design here. Photographs courtesy of Jean Pierre Gabriel.
The new Institut des Sciences Moléculaires d’Orsay was officially inaugurated Tuesday, 25 September, at the University Paris-Sud by Frédérique Vidal, Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation.
During the ceremony speeches were given by Sylvie Retailleau, President of Paris-Sud University, Antoine Petit, President and CEO of CNRS and Gilles Bloch, President of Université Paris-Saclay, and the architects from KAAN Architecten (Kees Kaan) and FRES architects (Laurent Gravier + Sara Martin Camara).
After the ceremony, Kees Kaan gave a presentation on the design of ISMO, which is distinguished by a harmonic coexistence of nature and scientific research. The newly opened building will serve over 160 students, researchers and teachers working in molecular physics, nano-science, chemistry and biology.
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol Terminal has been awarded the International Architecture Award for the ‘Transportation’ category.
The award was announced just in time to mark a year since KAAN Architecten, Estudio Lamela, ABT bv, Ineco, DGMR, Arnout Meijer Studio and Planeground Airport Consulting, operating as KL AIR, won commission to design Amsterdam Airport Schiphol Terminal. Today, September 28, 2018, a special exhibition of all awarded buildings will open at the annual symposium, “The City and the World” at The Contemporary Space in Athens.
The International Architectural Awards are organized by The Chicago Athenaeum, together with The European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies, and serve to honor new and cutting-edge design worldwide. Find out more about the awards here.
Participating in the world’s biggest fair dedicated to natural stone, KAAN Architecten will present the Supreme Court project in The Hague.
Yesterday marked the start of Marmomac International Trade Fair for Stone Design and Technology which will continue over the next four days in Verona. Dedicated to the natural stone industry, the fair represents the entire supply chain from processing to application in architectural design. During today’s events, KAAN Architecten project leader Marco Lanna will give a lecture on the Supreme Court project in The Hague, which features pronounced use of light grey limestone within its interior.

The excerpt for From Afar popped up on its coming soon page. I don't know why I get geeked about stuff like this. I knew what excerpt they were going to use - I sent the thing to my editor. Still, I did the 'Ooh!' accompanied by the little squee giggle when I saw the link had made its way on to the page. If you want to take a peek, here's the link - From Afar excerpt.
Samhain has opened the polls for the 2009 Readers Choice Sammie Awards. There are 8 categories - such as favorite cover, hero, heroine and book - with separate categories for ebooks and print. All 2009 Samhain titles are included, including Object of His Desire. So if you're in the mood to cast votes for your favorites, the link to the poll is on Samhain's home page.
And finally, I gave the thumbs up on the cover art for From Afar tonight. I like it a lot *g* So sometime this week, I should get the final files, and as soon as I do, I promise to share.
I hope everyone had a decent Monday - I think hoping for a great Monday would be asking a bit much, since it's Monday and all. But hopefully 'decent' was achievable for everyone :)

I could feel cold sharp claws scrape the skin on my chest, blood drawn as it fought back. Around me the room was in chaos, chairs strewn and broken, tables upturned. I closed my eyes and focused all my energy so that I could ground myself well, I would need an anchor to enable me to harness my powers and force this entity to leave and free its hold on the family that lived here. The air began to grow thicker as the energy built and electric blue veins of static lit the room highlighting the devastation while light and dark fought its eternal battle. My body begin to fill, a conduit, a weapon for use in this latest skirmish, energy filled me as I lifted my arms, my palms skyward as the sound in the room became deafening. The entity screeched and snarled as it fought for its hold within this dimension and this realm.
My head dropped back, my face relaxed as I settled into a mantra. I repeated over and over my banishing spell oblivious to all around me, all but the darkness that I could sense so close. It began to weaken. Even with eyes shut I could see a bright light which I knew right now emanated from my body, my command overpowered it, pushing it back as my light spread throughout the room. It battled and pushed as it fought back against the light though its strength now waned in this fight. I raised my voice higher as my confidence in a victory grew, my chant more forceful, it demanded the negative essence to leave and never return.
I could sense it give one last push, the rancid smell of decay filled the space around me while this thing used a surge of strength to lash out in a last ditched attempt to weaken me and deter my efforts with its evil unseen claw. A split second later there was a loud pop then everything went quiet. The ferocious wind that seconds before howled in the room had now dulled and died, the terrible screeching and hissing of the entity disappeared along with it. Mentally I reached out, searched the house and the property for any sign of creature just encase it lingered somewhere to lick its wounds, but there were none. It was gone.
I took a deep breath then slowly let it out, I had been battling this for what felt like hours though in reality was much likely far less. My eyes stung as I slowly drew them open, it was just now with things settled that I realised I must have had them squeezed shut through some of that. Christ the room had been wrecked, looking round I could see the pictures that had once been straight now hung lopsided if at all. The little trinkets that had adorned the mantle lay broken and ruined, the holy idols that once had centre stage now shattered but even with all that I was relieved it was just the room that was mangled. Had this thing been able to settle, been able to lay claim not just to the home but to the people that lived within it, this would seem immaculate in comparison. The sting on my torso brought my attention home and I straightened my shirt as best I could, a quick inspection showed slashes ripped across it and blood stains pebbled the white cotton material. Gripping the hem, I tugged the tattered fabric up, it was then that I could see what appeared to be three deep lacerations stretch across my stomach and over my abs, bright red blood oozed from them. What in the hell? I lifted my hand and after wrecking my brain, I focused on a spell that would hopefully cleanse and heal them. Normally after one of these tussles I would feel a drain on my energy, the extent of that off course depended on the strength of the opponent but the drain I now began to feel superseded that. I muttered over and over the spell I normally used, a crackle of energy pulsed and morphed as it grew in the palm of my hand, the chant sped up and I positioned my cupped palm just inches above the slashes. The skin began to tingle that quickly died to be replaced with burning, the skin pulled together and inflamed sides knit, the lacerations slowly disappearing and redness dying before my eyes. Within seconds, they were gone with no sign of ever having been there.
The front door creaked open and light footsteps gingerly approached, a soft feminine gasp followed by an, “Oh Mary, sweet mother of God!” identified it to be the lady that had called me in. She had tried to get rid of the 'thing' that had taken her home as its own by calling in the local clergy but this had only resulted in pissing it off and putting an old priest in the hospital. It had lifted him like a rag doll and tossed him across the room. The poor man had to be dragged out, it was then the lady in question, Sarah, moved in with her sister as the shit hit the fan and it had gone berserk after that. She scoured the web and found a few articles on exorcisms but it was when she came across one which told of a lady that lived in the south of Texas, she had been having issues with something similar though it appeared not to be as nasty. After a day or two of contacting/harassing the publisher of the article, she had tracked the woman down she in turn then gave my name and number over and she had called me that night she spilled the story of how it began and begged me to come help her.
“You shouldn't have any more problems, it's gone. It's out of the house and off your property but know that if you mess with that board without knowing what you are doing then this can and will happen again.” I bent down and picked up my jacket, shaking off some of the crap that had fell on it during the banishing. I winced a little, although the cuts were healed visibly I could feel them as if they were still there. “I can take the board with me or you can get rid of it is your call.” A quick glance once more around the place hiked my brow high and a low whistle escaped my lips. It had been a hard battle fought and one I knew I would need to rest from. I would need to build my power and strength back up as it had all but drained me dry, I hoped I had just enough to get me home because I could feel my battle now turn inwards as I fought to keep it together until I was back in my own place.
“No… no, you take it Eli, I don't want it anywhere near me or my home again. B… but are you definitely sure it's gone?” She entered the room apprehensively and her eyes darted around in search of signs of it lurking or hiding as if it would appear at any moment.
“It's gone, during the cleansing of the house I placed protection crystals over the doors and by the windows of each room, as long as they stay in those places they will protect the house and those in it from negative energy or entities. I'll finish cleansing in here and do the same, that should be your problem solved.” As I spoke I walked around, stepping over bits of broken crap everywhere and placed the crystals in position. When all were laid out I finished what I had started before the presence had lashed out after being cornered in the room having had nowhere else to go. Shit! My vision began to blur, I needed to get out, I needed to get home. I was on reserve power now and only enough magic left to get me there.
Board underarm and for the fourth time while I made my way to the door I turned down the payment that was offered, how I managed it I don’t know but I kept a strained smile on my lips as I bid farewell and held myself together just long enough to walk down the path and round the corner. Out of sight of the house and others around it, I closed my eyes, my breath was coming in pants now as I felt pain sear through my body. With all I had left I willed myself home using the last of what I had in me to accomplish it. The wind whipped up around me in a swirling vortex kicking fallen leaves and debris everywhere then seconds later the smell of damp earth and the crisp evening air was replaced with the familiar aroma of home. I materialised in the living room of my old 19th-century manor house but it was seconds later I collapsed on the floor my reserves totally spent, sight dimmed slowly at first as I blinked tiredly then as a wave of pain hit me and I struggled to get off the floor my head swam then all went black.
Fuck knew how long I was out of it but what woke me was a cold wet nose pressed against mine and a soft tail gently tapped at the side of my head. I blinked a few times before my eyes began to focus then groaned loudly as right there, in my face, was Parker my familiar. His big blue eyes watched me with concern his head tilted when he seen me wake. This cat was beautiful with his smoky grey fur that was quite feminine though he was larger than most I had seen before, it was one of the things I liked about him and it amped up his masculinity. He actually wasn't all that feminine unlike most witch’s cats, I used to joke with others in the coven that he was a masculine cat befitting of any strong, powerful male witch and one that others should admire and wish for but right now he was interrupting my much-needed rest and for that I could choke him.
“Miss me Kitty?” I teased, I knew the reaction I would get, and I couldn’t help but laugh as he hissed and spat at me, his back arched, fur stood on end, “Calm down fella I was joking!” He stood and raised his head in his feline version of a two finger salute then turned and walked off in a huff.
I cracked up and laughed at his abhorrent hate of being teased which turned him from caring familiar into a stroppy moody teen. I rolled over and pushed myself up on my hands and knees, bracing myself for pain before one last push to my feet. Nope… no twinges and not even a dull ache. Fan-bloody-tastic. Standing upright I patted my body down from shirt pockets to jeans in search of my phone only to find it in the back pocket of my jeans. The date and time I was amazed to find showed that I'd been on that floor two days. Wow, that was the longest yet, but then, the more of these things I fought the stronger they seemed to be getting and the more they drained me. It was like I was being pushed, my limits tested and this last one had been more an effort than any to date. What the fuck was the deal with those slashes on my stomach? My protection should have worked, that should never have happened.
I tossed my cell onto the table and made my way into the kitchen, my stomach rumbled to remind me of its starvation this past few days. Mondays pizza was still in the fridge and after a quick smell test it was deemed fit enough to zap in the microwave, the beer that I had taken and popped had washed it down and hell if that hadn’t felt good. Food for the soul, I laughed to myself. After I fed the beast, aka my stomach and the cat aka the huffy feline, I trudged upstairs to shower and freshen up. Today was the last Wednesday of the month and that meant Coven meeting at Leza’s.
I made my way upstairs as I finished the last slice of pizza and after a quick swig of the bottle, I set my beer on the bathroom sink top. Stood in front of the mirror I pulled the T over my head and tossed it at the hamper in the corner behind me where it hung half in, half out. My attention wasn’t on it, instead, it was fixed on my now healed body. There was no sign of any cuts or scabs, sure there were a lot of bruises on my ribs and over my hip where broken pieces of furniture had been hurled at me but the lacerations I had worked on were now healed and the pain I had felt before was gone. I lifted my gaze and caught sight of the reflection. The man looking back at me only a few months ago would have been described as handsome and rugged his face and body chiselled and sculpted. His jet black raven hair although wavy never looked unkempt as it settled just at shoulder length. His skin had been swarthy and had a healthy glow, his covens ink and crest on his upper arm. Each member branded with the symbol of the Celtic Tree of Life, which represented the Forrest of the Ancestors from where we drew our magic then embodied in that was the image of each witches familiar, mine a cat to represent Parker, the stuck up huffy bag of fur downstairs. That was then though, right now, the man staring back at me looked tired even after the two-day siesta. Everything about him looked lacklustre and dull from his hair to his skin. His features hidden by the five o’clock shadow it usually supported which was a bit scragglier than normal after his sleeping beauty routine downstairs. No point dwelling, it was what it was. Nothing a long holiday and a bit of female company wouldn’t sort but there were two chances of that… No hope and Bob hope. Fuck it. I shrugged it off and grabbed a quick shower, didn’t want Leza on my back for being late and time waited for no one especially not me.
It was Coven time. I got myself sorted and went back down stairs, sticking the board alongside a few others from the houses I had cleansed previously, I had found a message on my cell. Leza had called to remind me that we had a gathering tonight and that I wasn't to miss it. I knew I was going to have to tell them all what I had been up to this past few weeks. It's not that they disapproved or that I would cop shit for it, as a matter of fact our coven carried out many types of banishment of the entities like the one a few days ago for centuries now. We each had fought our fair share of battles and even lost a few of our family to the war that raged. The reason I wasn't looking forward to the meeting was because I knew Nora would be there, I know I should have gotten over it by now but well that was the problem with issues of the heart, unlike everything else under the sun and the moon there was no spell to magic the hurt away.
Nora and I had been together for over three years and I thought everything was fine, actually more than fine we had even gotten to the point that we had talked about a handfasting ceremony. Funny how appearances can be so deceiving. I had been away for a few days because I had been called to a home in the Carolina's, where a young couple had a nasty attachment on the property. It had been a shitty battle well fought but in the end, it had been banished and the young couple free to continue their life. I had returned home to find all of Nora's things gone, her closet emptied, altar cleared and all that remained was a 'Dear John' letter. In it, she had said that she couldn't sit back at home anymore while I was gone days at a time, that she hadn't wanted to be the partner of a 'warrior witch' and that since I had taken on that role she didn't like what I had become. That was a massive kick in the balls. I had worked my whole life within our kind, I trained hard to do what I do. After my father had been killed while trying to rid the earth of one particularly nasty bastard, my mother had lost her mind with the grief, no one within our coven could help her not even any of our best healers. The need for revenge is what pushed me but Nora knew this, she knew what drove me, she knew from the beginning that I wanted no other to go through what I and my mother had.
Shaking the memories away I chastised myself for behaving like such a pussy, that had been a while back and she had done me a favour. It had been exactly what I had needed to give me that final push and I had then given my all to destroying and ridding the earth of these abominations. The more I battled and won the stronger and more powerful I knew I would eventually become.
It didn’t take long to get from mine to Leza’s. Even though it was mid-evening there was hardly a soul on the streets, even cars were scarce. Her house was on the other side of the Forrest of Ancestors about 9 miles as the crow files, roughly 14 miles, if like me you drove. I pulled up outside and parked my 72 Chevy by the large oak to the right of her house, the place was in darkness the only light come from the torch-lit pathway that I knew led to the clearing and to where the others would be waiting. I Locked the car up and stuffed the keys in my back pocket then followed the illuminated path through the dense woods that surrounded her farm house. The trees were magnificent, each representing a fallen warrior, an ancestor of the coven. I could hear the low muffled voices in the distance, it sounded like there could be a full turn out tonight. As I approached the clearing I could make out some familiar faces, among them some of my oldest friends Eion, Fionn, Mica and Tomas. They were oblivious to the fact that I had arrived and it gave me time to scope the place to see who was in attendance. There were around twenty that I could count and all gathered in little clumps around the place, everyone chatted and caught up with each other.
I was about to make my presence known when the voice behind me spoke, “Umm so you gonna stand there all night?” I didn't need to turn to know who it was, that soft almost musical lilt could belong to no one other than her... Nora.

Soon, you will be transported to an island shrouded in mystery and legend. It is a lost world where adventure – and the unimaginable – will challenge you in unforgettable ways.
When it opens this summer at Universal Orlando Resort’s Islands of Adventure, Skull Island: Reign of Kong will bring the next generation of the King Kong legend to life. You will be thrust into an exotic world filled with the menacing, the intense – and the wildly entertaining. A powerful storyline, a stunning 3D experience, innovative technology – and the unexpected – will pull you into one of Universal Orlando’s most massive adventures yet. This is a multi-dimensional experience filled with surprise – all wrapped into what will be one of the longest Universal ride experiences ever created.
More first-ever details will be released soon. But today, Universal Orlando unveils details about the incredible journey guests will experience.
The adventure begins as you set out to explore an island rife with prehistoric creatures of unknown origin –and the legend of a beast still undiscovered. You find yourself at a campsite of the 8th Wonder Expedition Company, the research team leading your adventure.
Once beyond camp, the menacing terrain shows signs of a native presence; beating drums draw you toward an ancient temple. Moving deeper into the ruins reveals a lost shrine – and proof you are not alone. You ignore warnings to turn back.
You board a specially designed expedition vehicle that will take you deeper into the island. Mysterious sounds pierce the air and you hear chanting. And then – you confront an enormous temple wall, complete with carvings and images that seem to pay homage to something you cannot quite comprehend. The temple’s massive wooden doors slowly open, revealing a labyrinth of caves.
Inside the caves, you meet your expedition leader – and suddenly find yourself in the midst of a raging struggle between creatures of incomprehensible size and ferocity. Then, as those creatures turn on you, there is an even more enormous, earth-pounding presence – bigger, closer and more overwhelming than you can possibly imagine. It is Kong. But is he friend or foe?

Are you traveling the world? Starting a successful company? Or raising a family in your dream house?
My idea of “a dream life” is constantly changing. A year ago I decided to take a travel break and sold almost everything I owned. Right now, it feels pretty good to be traveling to new countries, smiling every day because I get to live unique experiences and working with people who genuinely value my ideas and storytelling. Although my life is far from perfect, I’m happy. In a few years, I’ll likely want to settle down and put roots somewhere. That’s the thing about YOUR dream life… it can be what you want it to be.
Everyone has a different version of what their dream life looks like. So why not get started living yours today.
How are you going to get something done if you forget you wanted to do it in the first place? I like to create lists at night to prep for the next day. Sometimes I jot down story ideas, what I want to get accomplished or whatever I’m grateful for at the moment. By writing things down, we keep the mind focused.
“It’s very easy for the mind to become distracted by things that are not of the highest priority in life. By writing down our goals, we stay focused on what is most important to us,” says Darren Marc, author of Create Your Dream Life Now: A Workbook & Guide for Manifesting Your Destiny.
Create a vision board, or keep it simple and write down your goals on a piece of paper and put it somewhere where you will see it every day.
Think about what goals you have to improve yourself? Your health, finance, and career? Your family, love, and romance?
Some people believe that when they finally achieve their dreams and goals, that’s when they will experience happiness. But it’s important to live in the now and appreciate every moment that gets you to where you want to be. Don’t worry about the past or the future. Being present allows that creative energy to flow.
“When you experience the shift of consciousness that results from daily meditation practice, you are raising your vibration. As you do THAT, the circumstances that you need to help you move towards your dreams will come into your life with more grace and ease,” says Marc.
Don’t be surprised if your mind starts to wander when you are meditating. This happens. By practicing regularly, you’ll be able to keep your mind focused and centered.
Creating a morning or evening routine keeps you grounded, focused and present. Make time for things that will help you get closer to achieving your goals. You don’t have to say yes or commit to everything especially if it’s not enhancing your life or moving you in the direction you want to go.
It might get frustrating if your vision isn’t coming to fruition as quickly as you had planned, but keep your eyes on the prize. Whatever you do, don’t start comparing yourself to others. Become the best version of You.
If you feel like you are in a funk, try asking yourself what you can do today or this week to get you a little closer to accomplishing your goals.
“There will always be ‘something’ you can do to shift your vibration a little higher and gain a little bit of momentum towards what you want,” says Marc.
You are talented, strong and can design the life you always wanted. Unblock any negative beliefs that you won’t accomplish your personal mission. Take a minute to figure out what’s causing these thoughts and start believing that you can achieve anything that you set your mind to.
“Walk through the fear and take action even if you have self-doubt,” says Marc. “When you do that, you will often see that by taking that first step, you create momentum to keep taking more and more baby steps in the right direction.”
What has helped you accomplish your goals? Share your thoughts in the comments to help others also achieve success.
Darleys Perez (33-2-1, 21 KOs)–Former WBA World Lightweight Champion. Perez stands 5’7” and was born on Sept. 14, 1983 in San Pedro de Uraba, Colombia. The Colombian native defeated the previously unbeaten Argenis Lopez for the interim world title in June 2014.
Perez successfully defended his interim world championship twice before meeting England’s Anthony Crolla in Manchester on July 18, 2015. Perez was able to retain his world title by way of a majority draw against Crolla. Fighting in Crolla’s hometown, Perez had one judge score the fight in his favor (114-113), while another had it for Crolla (116-111). The third judge had it even at 113-113. Perez, however, was deducted one point on two separate occasions for low blows. If not for the deductions, Perez would have won a majority decision.

We arrived at HP a little early, which was great because we had the opportunity to look aroundt he Welcome Center before our tour. The lobby to the Welcome Center houses the actual offices of the founders, William Hewlett and David Packard. Visitors can walk around the preserved offices and see artifacts from the company’s history. The more modern part of the lobby features an enormous video wall that supports touch input, so visitors can select items on the HP timeline and watch videos about certain events or people from the past and present.
Our tour included an explanation of HP’s biggest profit machine: printing. You didn’t think we’d go to HP and not learn about printers, did you? The most impressive aspect of HP’s printing business is just the sheer magnitude of its reach. Their equipment is responsible for printing the now famous Coca-Cola campaign wherein the beverage giant had individualized bottles and cans with the 400 most popular names in the country emblazoned on the labels. That could not have been done cost effectively without HP’s printers. HP also has a printer that outputs at around 100 mile per hour. We were treated to a demonstration of this lightning-fast printer, and it was remarkably impressive. Certainly, more impressive than one would think a printer could be. The Chief Supply Chain Officer of HP, Stuart Pann (Michigan Tech alum), greeted us about halfway through our tour and we were able to sit down with him in one of the conference rooms. His story is incredible, and it was pleasure hearing some of the things he recounted to us. He came to Silicon Valley and originally worked for Intel. At Intel, Dave House (currently of Brocade) sought him out and provided mentorship. Later, while still working for Intel, he told us about the time that Steve Jobs approached Intel to produce parts for a project in 2006, one that would later go on to completely revolutionize a semi-stagnant market segment. That projec twould be called the iPhone. Intel turned Jobs down, instead partnering with Nokia on the Meego-based N9. Needless to say, Stuart expressed interest in what could have been.
As a group, our first experiences on Netflix’s campus were interesting. Jim Baker, one of the attending Michigan Tech staff members, commented “I thought Netflix was a video streaming company, but I didn’t know it was a restaurant, too.” That’s because most of what we saw was a working environment that seemed to place community above all else. Humans tend to place a lot of social worth in sharing food and breaking bread, so as a result, a lot of Netflix’s communal space seems dedicated to cafes and eating spaces. =I believe it was Adam Johnson, MTU’s advancement officer and the photographer and organizer of this trip, that added Netflix may have taken into account the “Google ratio,” which sets aside a certain number of lounge areas or areas per square footage. From what I saw, that wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest.
Our tour guide was Lilit, and she walked us through quite a few spaces and at least three buildings per my count, but several buildings are connected via skywalks, so it can be difficult tos eparate one building from another. At the end, we were led into a very unique room that had informally been dubbed “the Thunderdome,” after the eponymous location from the Mad Maxmovie. Over lunch, we chatted with Lilit and four additional women that work at Netflix, T.Y., Samantha, Sue, and Alayna. Each of them comes from a different department, but they all had a very similar message: Netflix is a company with a unifying mantra of freedom and responsibility. That is to say that employees at Netflix are given the freedom to work the way they choose and are expected to take responsibility for all their actions, and that seems to be a two-way street for employees and the company. For instance, employees are given the choice to work in a “bull pen” style space or have their own cubicles. It’s a culture of “context, and not of control.” And for any aspiring Netflix applicants, please know that curiosity is a highly desired trait for employees; embrace that curiosity and try not to let “magic” explain how things work behind-the-scenes. -Tommy Stuart
Our very last company visit was to Ford’s technology lab in Palo Alto. In 2012, Ford opened their first Silicon Valley lab. In January of 2015, Ford expanded that operation and opened the Research and Innovation Center here in Palo Alto. Very soon, they’ll be expanding the Palo Alto lab to include two more buildings. Clearly, Ford wants in on the technology market. And we were told as much by Dave Kaminsky, a Michigan Tech alumnus who has worked for Ford in Dearborn, and in places like Brazil and Germany. He’ll be transitioning back to Dearborn within the next couple months, and he hopes to bring some of the Silicon Valley back with him, so keep an eye out for possible internships and co-ops at the MTEC SmartZone.
Our tour of the facility in Palo Alto included the project and demo space, which I did not get to experience, because I volunteered to take part in a virtual reality demonstration out in the parking lot. The concept was to provide drivers with a simulated environment that would be devoid of physical consequences while also testing the driver’s ability to maneuver the car. The provided scenario was that eventually, this technology could be used in an empty lot, and the driver would wear the VR headset while driving the car. Simulated obstacles, either stationary or otherwise, would present themselves and the driver would do their best to avoid hitting these obstacles. The data collected from an experiment like this could potentially be used for granting licenses or even for determining safety protocols. Our group, at the suggestion of CameronBurke, began calling the experience the Ford Onboard Reality Display, or the recursive acronym “F.O.R.D.” In its current incarnation, the F.O.R.D. resembles something akin to a 3D version of the Green Hill Zone from Sonic the Hedgehog, but the project is still very young and improvements are inevitably on the way. -Tommy Stuart
The last event on our itinerary was hosted by Dave House at his vineyard in Saratoga. He and his family have an absolutely beautiful home at the top of a mountain that I believe is called Mt. Eden, and the estate overlooks the entire city, with additional views of Cupertino. We arrived a little before sunset and it was brilliant being able to see the city go from daylight to moonlight. Of course, what would a vineyard reception be without wine? The House family provided all attendees with free wine from the vineyards, as well as hors d’oeurves, dinner, and dessert. It was quite the reception, as you can probably tell. Students in attendance were granted the opportunity to network and learn from Michigan Tech alumni currently living and working in Silicon Valley, and I don’t think any of us squandered that opportunity. Many of the faces that we had seen throughout the week came to the reception and students gravitated to Christine from Twilio, Amy from Clari, and Stuart from HP. And it goes without saying that many of us tried to get Dave House’s ear and his advice. – Tommy Stuart

The Victorian Government has changed the Associations Incorporation Act with a result that ANGAIR has to revise its rules of Association to more closely reflect Model Rules provided by the Government (through its Department of Consumer Affairs).
To do this we need to submit a special resolution to the next AGM in February 2014. The Committee of Management has decided it would be good practice to place a copy of the proposed rules and amendments on the ANGAIR web page for members perusal.
1. ANGAIR Rules of Association – for Feb 2014 AGM (these are amended Model Rules provided by Dept of Consumer Affairs, for approval at Feb AGM).
2. Summary of proposed amendments to Model Rules (this is a summary of the amendments proposed for approval).

Said Caroline: "This meeting followed a survey we conducted among Thorne's town centre businesses, with the support of Cllr Rachel Hodson, Cllr Eddie Dobbs and volunteers from Thorne Needs You. The survey showed support for the idea and led to this meeting.
"I’m very grateful for the presentation by Nikki Davies from the Tickhill Business Association about how their local businesses approached getting things done to boost trade in their town."
The meeting attracted over 30 local businesses, local Cllr Rachel Hodson, Thorne Needs You and town council representatives.
• That you may start with only a few businesses, and not everyone will want to work together, but you can still get things done.
• That starting from your own front door, your shop window, your row of shops, you begin to change what you can do to boost business.
• In Tickhill, the businesses agreed on their objectives – to boost trade, by improving and promoting their shopping area, and the offer to customers.
• Start small: lots of ideas can grow about how to boost the town – from co-ordinated hanging baskets, to cleaning shop fronts, improving window displays, to a we bsite, and a calendar of events.
• Getting to know who your customers are and what they think of the town. Are they local, working in Thorne or just visiting?
• Getting retailers to look at their store front – does it attract customers and enhance the street, or does it detract from the impression of Thorne.
• Looking for ways to encourage through traffic to stop for a short time – may involve simple steps like good signs to where free/cheap parking is available.
• Involvement in the Neighbourhood Plan etc is important – but start with the things you can change close to home yourselves.
Said Caroline: "Nikki Davies gave examples of how small businesses working together had made a big impact, boosting trade by 20% in a recession. The results are very impressive."
The meeting ended with the businesses choosing a small steering group of six to take forward the idea of forming an Association for Thorne businesses.
Said Caroline: "My office is available to help the Thorne businesses get a bigger voice and advise in any practical way. The meeting was very positive - and a big thanks to Chris from Thorne library who gave up her time to enable the meeting to take place."

SEAT UK is reminding all of its 275,000 UK owners that their vehicles qualify for a free fluids and safety check at any of the Spanish brand's 100-plus dealerships nationwide.
The free check, which takes just a few minutes to complete and does not need to be booked in advance, covers oil and coolant levels as well as brake fluid and washer bottle. SEAT's expert technicians will advise owners of any levels that need attention and offer a chargeable top-up service where required.
The reminder comes on the back of a recent survey which suggested some SEAT owners may not check their car's fluid levels as often as recommended.
SEAT UK Head of Aftersales, Nigel Griggs, explained: "While the recent survey sample was minute and the results therefore questionable - around 50 SEAT drivers were questioned from the 275,000-plus on UK roads - it is clearly still worth reminding SEAT owners that their vehicles automatically qualify for this free check, whether or not they choose to have their car serviced by a SEAT franchised dealer.
"Any driver would obviously be well-advised to ensure his car is in tip-top condition, and SEAT's free check is a simple, easy way to get that peace of mind."

Minecraft Windows 10 Edition beta is a fantastic game that mixes creativity , survival , and exploration . Survive alone in a blocky, pìxelated world where monsters come out at night, create fantastical buildings and structures, or collaborate with other players online. Let your imagination run wild
Minecraft has evolved a lot over the years, but the essence of the game is this: you are placed in a semi-randomly generated world, which you are able to mine, block by block, for materials. You start with only your hands, which allow you to cut down trees, from which you can obtain wood.
With wood you can create planks and sticks , which allow you to create a workbench, which in turn allows you to craft tools and other objects. From primitive wooden tools, you'll work your way up to smelting metal tools, armor, and weapons that will help you survive and master your world.
In Survival mode , when the sun sets dangerous monsters will spawn. You can fight them, but to begin with your best option is to take shelter until sunlight. In Creative mode , you're free of monsters and other threats like hunger, and can use the game simply to create magnificent structures and buildings. This 'LEGO' like element has helped make Minecraft hugely popular with kids and parents alike, as it's one of the best videogames around for sparking and expressing creativity. Even in survival mode, it's perfectly family friendly. Confused? Get online!
What still makes Minecraft a bit unusual is how little is explained to you. You appear in the world with no instructions of what to do, but luckily the game has evolved alongside an incredibly detailed and rich online wiki , where you can find guides and information about everything in this deceptively deep game. Once you grasp the basics of mining, crafting and survival, it's extremely fun to play. Few games give you such a sense of freedom.
Minecraft has a cute blocky graphical style , which is quite beautiful. Landscapes can be pretty dramatic, and sunsets and sunrises are lovely to watch. This blocky style also makes identifying materials to mine much easier, which is essential as you get further and further into a game. Sound effects are simple but effective, and accompanied by a gentle soundtrack that ebbs and flows over the day and night cycle. An amazing, must own game for all ages
Minecraft Windows 10 Edition beta is essentially the same as the 'Pocket' edition that was developed for mobile devices. This still makes it a pretty complete version of the PC original , as most features have been ported over since it's 2011 launch. While there are some advantages to the original version, they are minimal and this version actually has prettier graphics. If you buy Minecraft for Windows 10 beta, you can also download the original PC version too, so it's impossible to lose out!

For most people, the key wealth management question is not "Can I beat the market?" Instead, the more relevant concern is “Will I outlive my money?”
Likewise, the greatest investing risk is not market volatility. Instead, it is human behavior – fear and greed – which cause many individual investors to significantly underperform the market.
Venovate Advisors practices behavioral investment management and uses Asset Class Investing strategies to help people manage their core wealth by constructing a portfolio designed to last a lifetime.
At Venovate Advisors we build core portfolios for our clients based on the principles of Asset Class Investing.
Grounded in modern portfolio theory and the research of leading economists such as Nobel laureates Harry Markowitz and Eugene Fama, Asset Class Investing recognizes that you can’t beat the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
Instead of chasing returns, we focus on reaching your goals by designing portfolios that let the market work for you without taking excess risk.
Markets are efficient. This means that, at any given moment, the prices of publicly traded securities are fair.
Any long-term differences in average portfolio returns are the result of differences in average risk.
In other words: it is possible to outperform markets, but you can’t do it without taking additional risk.
Some risks are worth taking. For example, more than 50 years of data and research indicate that stocks are riskier than bonds, but they also have higher expected returns.
Small cap and value stocks have outperformed other equities over time because the market discounts their prices to reflect their higher risk.
A carefully constructed global portfolio spanning asset classes, fixed income maturities, and geographical regions can capture the factors that generate returns while reducing those risks that usually go unrewarded.
Diversification will not eliminate the risk of market loss, but it can reduce the risk of individual securities while capturing returns attributable to broad economic forces.
No advisor can guarantee success, but we believe Asset Class Investing is a prudent, strategic approach based on sound academic research.
It is not about beating the market. It is designed to help you understand the risks required to reach your goals and build a portfolio you can stick with in good times and bad.
This disciplined, structured approach helps protect you against the common behavioral mistakes that are the worst enemy of your long-term financial goals.
You would never ask a doctor “What’s a good drug to take?” Yet people routinely ask advisors “What should I invest in?”
Just as a doctor would not prescribe a treatment without a thorough exam, we need to understand your circumstances before we can even begin to create a portfolio. Our wealth management process consists of the following six phases.
In our first meeting we’ll get to know each other. We need to understand what you want from an advisor and what your personal goals are. We will also explain how we work, what we can - and can’t - do for you, and how we charge. We’ll both decide if we want to work together.
Over the next few weeks we will gather data about you to understand your financial circumstances, and both your willingness and ability to assume financial risk. This might be in one meeting or in several.
We will meet again to deliver our proposal and explain it to you. If adjustments are needed, we’ll make them. Once you agree with the plan, there will be papers to sign so we can move forward.
We will orchestrate a team at Charles Schwab and Loring Ward who will open the necessary accounts, ensure the paperwork is in order, move your funds and securities as directed, and put your new portfolio in place. We will rebalance when necessary, rarely more than twice a year, and send you quarterly performance reports. You will also receive statements from your custodian at least quarterly.
This is where behavioral investment advising comes in. You’ll have a plan in place to meet your goals, but will you stick to it? Many individual investors fall prey to panic when the market drops or exuberance when the latest bubble is building. Both can derail your plan.
Our role as trusted advisors is to help you manage your behavior as well as your money. We’ll meet at least once a year to discuss your progress toward your life goals and determine if portfolio adjustments are needed. However, our real value is as a sounding board and thought partner to help you stay focused on your goals and plan – not the latest fad or scare.

It's ironic that Porsche then threw a tantrum over the GTR, seeing that Porsche is a master of taking logic to extremes. Witness the Dauer 962 that won Le Mans in 1994: This alleged street-going GT car was nothing more than a Group C Porsche 962 in thin disguise. Another recent example of clever interpretation was the Porsche 911 GT1 that won Le Mans in 1998. Now, thanks to pressure from Zuffenhausen, the GT3 rules have been rewritten to state that 100 cars and 1000 engines must be built. BMW could have run with weight and power penalties but chose to pull out of the ALMS.
In the end, racing fans are the losers, because the GTR is a spectacular, flame-belching beast. It also makes a regular six-cylinder M3 feel sloppy and imprecise, which is some feat. The GTR has a racer's reflexes, with humongous slick tire grip and immediate turn-in. The 14.9-inch diameter front and 12.9-inch rear discs haul this baby down with some alacrity, which is necessary because the torquey, guttural-sounding V-8 gives 444 horsepower. Best of all, the GTR looks stunning, with body addenda that fans of The Fast and the Furious would die for. It just seems a shame that the GTRs have been consigned to a museum because Porsche whined.

Kai Stensgaard, is internationally recognized as a leading concert marimba artist and composer from Denmark. KS is one of the pioneers in six mallet playing, and he has composed several works for six mallets. Among those the “Concierto Mexicano”, a concerto for marimba and Orchestra, the first concerto that calls for six mallet playing. KS has written several six mallet marimba solo pieces from various styles, including contemporary music, latin music and folkloristic music. His compositions and arrangements are published and being performed by marimba players all over the world. Amoung those a concerto for Marimba and Orchestra called “Concierto Mexicano” Many of his compositions and arrangements have been performed by marimba players all over the world. He has been giving concerts and clinics in Europe, USA, Taiwan, Japan, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Chile and Mexico. He is often seen as jury member of international marimba competitions. He is the auther of the method for six mallet playing called “The Six mallet Grip” and has published 7 CDs and a DVD displaying his compositions and personal marimba style. He also premiered many works for marimba, among those a concerto for marimba and orchestra “Ballet in Dark” by Martin Knakkergaard. This piece was later choreographed for performance on the stage by a dancer from the Royal Danish Ballet. Premieres of his works Hexagram and Zócalo Mexico with Concert Bands, Wind Orchestra and Chamber Ensembles.
KS is the auther of the method for six mallet playing called “The Six mallet Grip” and has published 8 CDs and a DVD displaying his compositions and personal marimba style. KS is a Saylers Percussion endorser and he has his own signature mallet serie. KS is co-inventer of a brand new mallet instrument called the Aluphone. It can be used as a solo instrument in the same way as the marimba and the vibraphone.
I initially started developing this technique back in 1980 after a back pack trip to Guatemala and Chiapas. I wanted to study the origin of the marimba. Here I got the idea of playing with six mallets and my first six mallet piece was written in 1980 and is called Two Mayan dances. The last 40 years I have refined the technique and written works especially for this technique and I count myself as the first marimba player to play with six mallets on the modern marimba. I developed my grip based on the Stevens Grip.
I have written many solo works for six mallets and today this is mainly the grip I do the most when playing marimba. In 2006, I performed in front of colleagues from around the world with this technique at Pasic 2006 in Austin, Texas, USA. Subsequently I have toured the world and taught master classes on this technique. In 2009 I published the method textbook The Six Mallet Grip in English and Spanish.
Here you can find a list with works for six mallets – if you know about a piece that is not on the list, please let me know.
The Six Mallet Grip: how do you hold the mallets, how do you control the mallets, interval changes, excersices and maybe you would like to play one of my six malets pieces for me?
Four Mallet Technique (Stevens Grip): I studied the grip from Leigh Stevens back in 1980. I was the first marimba player in Denmark using this grip and I have a lot of experience in what to do and what not to do. I can get you a Stevens Grip chech up!
Method of Movement based on Alexander Technique: Some people get problems from playing. It can be problems in the wrist or in the arm. From studying the Alexander Technique and using it myself, I can give you good recommendation on how to stand and move your body when playing.
Musical & technical instruction of a piece of your choise: Maybe you want to play a piece for me and I will tell you what I think and maybe come up with suggestions on how to improve the piece for you.
This unique kitty’s condition gets its name from the Greek legend of the chimera, which was a goat, snake, lion hybrid. This fearsome critter was known for breathing fire and just generally not being a welcome guest at any party.
Narnia, however, would be welcome just about anywhere. I mean, look at her precious little face! The tiny stunner was born on March 28, 2017 and it seems fitting that the out-of-this-world eccentric beauty shares a birthday with the queen of eccentric beauty herself: Lady Gaga.
Narnia lives in France because I mean, how much more fashionable can one get? She recently rose to fame when a notable photographer by the name of Jean-Michel Labat captured some amazing images of her.

My first action was to decend the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs was an eye (that immediately paralyzed me) and a group of kobolds (who killed me while I was paralyzed).
Thats an infamous occurence that has happened to all of the old-timers. Back then, it didnt take any kobolds to do the killing, too; the eye would do damage on its own and keep you chain-paralyzed till you were dead. This has been changed lately so now it does require a kobold, too.
Having an evil eye right at the stairs is unavoidable, but even if you make it past that point, you can still run into it before you have a chance to see it if you have light radius of only 1 - a torch - and the old saying "buy lantern, kill Morgoth", while omitting a bit inbetween those two steps, was valid advice insofar as it would make sure you had light radius 2 from the start.
Huh, I thought you're supposed to be guaranteed to have the first move on any level. I'm quite certain you do in O. I figured this was why one of the main methods to die this way involves recalling onto one side of a dark room, detecting, and then being breathed on by ten hounds or a drolem or Kavlax or something.
rangers can summon one gravity hound which can breath gravity which can throw you into a room full of plasma hounds.

Endomondo Sports Tracker for Android is a comprehensive training app that can certainly help you get in shape, just be wary of you have an S3 running Kit Kat.
Endomondo Sports Tracker is one of the more exhaustive training apps I've seen. It’s basically for running, cycling or most any trackable distance activity. I like the heart rate monitor integration and analytics. The app also features a training journal to help you set goals and monitor results. Share your workouts and routes with friends, or make them public so anyone in your neighborhood can give your workout a try. The map integration is cool; I like being able to see the different routes, see what workouts others in your area are doing. The app even features pre-recorded verbal motivators, and even pep talks from friends, but I found it all to be a little goofy and like having your own corny hype crew. However some might find all that useful and inspiring.
The interface is good. There are a lot of settings and visual cues that help the app feel interactive and actionable. The GPS related functionality was predictably glitchy and suffers from a lot of hangs. But the Facebook and Google+ integration works well. So go ahead and share your goals and challenge friends.
The premium version costs $3.99 a month or $29.99 a year and adds a personal training plan, detailed statistics, calories burned and total miles traveled in any given month or year. They even add weather forecasts right in your workout summary. Many S3 users have reported that the app no longer functions well after the Kit Kat update, so test out the free version before buying.
Endomondo Sports Tracker is an excellent overall app, even with the hangs and battery drain. There’s a lot to navigate here and it would be hard to operate on the go, especially on a smaller screen. However, if you’re serious about your training regimen, this app can help you make the most of it.
Its almost impossible to hear the voice from the feedback-lady for mine Huawei Y5. Spotify works well. Never had the same problem when I used endomondo for my iPhone.
I would like to install Endomondo sports tracker in my samsung gt-s5570 but an error occurred due to missing space ( internal memory ?). How can i solve the problem? I have exchanged sd card from 2 Gb to a16 Gb but i don't know how use it?. Before I have had your software installed was very satisfied but I lost it after micro sd swapping (?). Can you give me a help? Thanks. Best regards. Antonio
you may be better to free up some internal memory by deleting photos, or moving them to the SD card. You can find instructions for how to install apps on SD card by default, but it isn't that straightforward: www.howtogeek.com/114667/...
I use the Endomondo app for running on my Huawei Ascend G510. Works excellent! Now I want to use also a Polar Wearlink Bluetooth, but am not sure which one works with Huawei G510 ( bluetooth 2.1). Can someone give me advice?

One benefit of preparing an annual review of last year’s important cases, as I just did for MCLE, is that you may have missed a significant case when it came out. That’s why I’m writing now about Murr v. Wisconsin, 137 S. Ct. 1645, decided on June 5, 2017. Murr, which incorporates the mathematical conundrum in the title, expands the Supreme Court’s regulatory takings jurisprudence by asking a preliminary question—what parcel or parcels of land are at issue? The Court held that this question must be answered before reaching the ad hoc case-by-case analysis established by Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, and Palazzolo v. Rhode Island which examines the economic impact of the challenged regulation, the investment-backed expectations of the landowner, and the character of the government action.
Murr involved the owners of two adjacent waterfront properties on the St. Croix River in Wisconsin which, given their location, were subject to numerous regulations, including a one acre buildable lot requirement. The properties lost their original grandfathered protection from that regulation when they were put into common ownership. The county denied requests for variances and the owners filed a regulatory takings claim, which they lost at the state level.
In a 5-3 opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the Court developed a new, three-factor test for determining the “denominator” in the regulatory takings analysis—in other words, the unit of property against which a court must assess the effects of the challenged governmental action. First, courts must assess the treatment of the land under state and local law, in particular how state law bounds and divides the land. Second, courts must look at the physical characteristics of the landowner’s property, e.g., whether the land is subject to further environmental or land use regulations due to the nature of the land or adjacent natural resources. Third, courts must consider the value of the property under the challenged regulation. Under this test, there was no regulatory taking. The Court rejected the bright line tests offered by the state (state law controls) and the landowners (lot lines define the relevant parcel) as too easily subject to manipulation. The Court defined the relevant parcel as a single combined lot based on several factors: (1) that merger as a result of common ownership is a reasonable and usual zoning and land use control and there was a voluntary merger; (2) riverside property is often subject to restrictions on development; and (3) treatment as one lot did not substantially diminish the value of the land without the regulation.
Murr may be an example where the “no harm, no foul” rule led to the right result. But generally speaking, the government’s defenses just got better, and the landowner’s burden tougher, in regulatory takings cases. And while there were three dissenters (Justice Gorsuch did not participate in the case), without two more votes, Murr will be the law for the foreseeable future.

The Deity of God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, is a fundamental Bible doctrine that is consistently attacked by every lost person in the world. The Bible says in 1 Thess. 5:21 Prove all things; hold fast that which is good. This is exactly what we will do and we will only use the Authorized King James Bible to prove it. I'm sure that you aren't interested in my opinion any more that I would be interested in your opinion. In order to prove something, we must have an absolute final authority or there will just be endless opinionated remarks about the subject. With that in mind we will start with the Lord Jesus Christ Himself claiming Deity.
John 4:25, 26 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
Dan. 9:25, 26 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
John 9:35-37 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
John 5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
John 1:14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.
Here is the Lord Jesus Christ coming back at the end of the Tribulation and He is called the "Word".
Revelation 19:13 "And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God."
John 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
John 14:9-10 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? 10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
1 John 2:22 "Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son."
In order to understand this verse, we must find out who or what is "the Christ". Look at what the bible says in the genealogy of Jesus Christ.
Matthew 1:16 "And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."
Matthew 1:25 "And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS."
Christ is His title, which means "Anointed One". Since Satan is said to be "anointed" (Ez. 28:14) also; the Holy Spirit is careful to point out that there is more than one "Christ":
Luke 2:26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.
Acts 4:26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.
John 20:30,31 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: 31 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.
Notice that the distinction of saying the Lord's Christ is indicating there is another Christ. So it is at the name of "Jesus" that every knee will bow, Phil. 2:9,10, not "Christ". Satan is "a" Christ, but not the "Lord's Christ". As "a" Christ, he will take over the position given to Jesus Christ in the Tribulation, 2 Thess. 2:1-6, Rev. 13:1-18.
John 8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
John 8:19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
The Pharisees, verse 13, knew who Joseph His step father was, so Jesus was talking about God the Father, that is why He said, "I am he"; the Father manifest in the flesh, 1 Tim. 3:16. Also:
Ex. 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
Here are some verses that show God was in Christ, Christ is in God, we are in Christ and Christ is in us. Jesus is God manifest in the flesh. (My comments are in parentheses)
1 John 5:20 And we know that the Son of God (Jesus) is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him (God) that is true, and we are in him (God) that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This (Jesus) is the true God, and eternal life.
1 John 4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
2 Corinthians 5:19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
1 Timothy 3:16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
Romans 9:5 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.
Matt. 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, (Jesus) and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his (Jesus) name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us
Zech. 12:10 And I(Jehovah God) will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me (God) whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, (Jesus) as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.
Psalms 45:6-7 "Thy throne, O God, (Jesus) is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre. [7] Thou (Jesus) lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, (Jesus) thy God (God the Father), hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows."
Hebrews 1:8 "But unto the Son (Jesus) he (God the Father) saith, Thy throne, O God, (Jesus) is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom."
In order to establish the doctrine of the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ, we will also have to show that there is definitely a "Trinity". Some say that the word "Trinity" was coined by the Roman Catholic Church. This isn't true, In A.D. 181, Theophilus of Antioch used the term in it's Greek form, "Trias". Then Tertullian (190-211) used the word in it's Latin form "Trinitas" in about 200 A.D. The Roman Catholic Church didn't begin until about 325 A.D.
Heb 1:1-3 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son (Jesus), whom he (God) hath appointed heir of all things, by whom (Jesus) also he (God) made the worlds; 3 Who (Jesus) being the brightness of his (God) glory, and the express image of his (God) person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
2 Cor. 2:10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;
Heb. 10:29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
Acts 5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?
Matthew 3:16-17 "And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: [17] And lo a voice from heaven, (God the Father) saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."
Matthew 28:19 "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"
John 14:16 "And I (Jesus) will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;"
2 Corinthians 13:14 "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
John 6:27 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
Hebrews 1:8 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
Acts 5:3,4 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? 4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
Jeremiah 16:21 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.
1 Cor 12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
Genesis 2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
Genesis 11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
1 Kings 22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.
John 17:22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:
Acts 4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
1 Cor 3:8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Isaiah 6:8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.
Psalms 11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
John 5:37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
IX. The following will show that Jesus had the same divine attributes as God the Father and God the Holy Spirit.
Rom. 11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
God the Son - Mark 11:2-6 "And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him. [3] And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him hither. [4] And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him. [5] And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt? [6] And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go."
Luke 5:22 "But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?"
John 2:24-25 "But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, [25] And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man."
God the Holy Spirit - (1 Corinthians 2:11 "For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
God the Son: Matthew 28:18 "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
God the Holy Ghost: Luke 1:35 "And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
God the Father: Jeremiah 23:23-24 "Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? [24] Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD."
God the Son: Matthew 18:20 (KJV) "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
God the Holy Ghost: Psalms 139:7-10 "Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence? [8] If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there. [9] If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; [10] Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me."
Conclusion: We conclude that Jesus is God, for He possesses the exclusive attributes of God. He is eternal (Micah 5:2, Col. 1: 17). He is unchangeable (Heb. 13:8). He is omnipotent (Luke 8:24). He is omnipresent (Matt. 28:20, John 3:13). (Notice how that verse has been messed with in all the new "Bibles.") They all attack the verses that deal with Jesus Christ.) He is omniscient (Mark 11:2-6, John 2:24, Luke 5:22). He is holy (Mark 1:24). He is sinless (I Pet. 2:22). He is just (Acts 3:14). He is a righteous judge (Acts 17:31). He is loving (John 15:13). He is merciful (Titus 3:5). He is faithful (2 Tim. 2:3).
Now, If Jesus wasn't "God manifest in the flesh," He was not any kind of a teacher to listen to or an example to follow and He died for His own sins, therefore He couldn't be my saviour. I conclude from the evidence above that Jesus Christ WAS God manifest in the flesh, therefore, the only Jesus that can save you from Hell is the Jesus that was God manifest in the flesh. That is why 1 Cor. 15:1-4 says that the death, burial and resurrection is according to the scriptures. If the Jesus that supposedly saved you wasn't God manifest in the flesh, then you have believed on another Jesus, received another spirit, accepted another gospel and you are still in your sins.
(2 Corinthians 11:3-4 "But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. [4] For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him."
Receive the Lord Jesus Christ today or He will say to you one day; (Matthew 25:41 "Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:"

Ariana Grande is getting candid about last year's terrorist attack during her concert in Manchester, which took the lives of 22 people.
“When I got home from tour, I had really wild dizzy spells, this feeling like I couldn’t breathe,” she revealed to ELLE Magazine during her recent cover interview. “I would be in a good mood, fine and happy, and they would hit me out of nowhere. I’ve always had anxiety, but it had never been physical before. There were a couple of months straight where I felt so upside down.”
That feeling is what fueled the marketing campaign behind her upcoming album Sweetener, in which everything is flipped upside down. Though the full record is the result of her processing the trauma, one song in particular addresses her anxiety.
“It’s all the voices in my head talking to one another,” she says of "Get Well Soon," which was co-written by Pharrell Williams.
“You hear about these things. You see it on the news, you tweet a hashtag. It’s happened before, and it’ll happen again,” she says. “It makes you sad, you think about it for a little, and then people move on. But experiencing something like that firsthand, you think of everything different.”
For her, that new mindset is to love more fiercely, which she clearly has done in her relationship with Saturday Night Live star, Pete Davidson, whom she got engaged to after a few weeks of dating.

But the Ionic, the first of Fitbit's devices to include an SpO2 monitor, came out more than one year ago. It's frustrating to hear about exciting features that are "coming soon," when "soon" ultimately means not weeks or months, but years. While I understand it takes time and effort to develop features like this (especially if Fitbit hopes to pursue medical device clearance or approval from the FDA in the future), I don't think Fitbit should hype features that it isn't ready to let users put to the test.
With technology, smartwatches have revolutionized time itself: how we use it, how we plan our routine, and how we reach our goals. A smartwatch is a way to unlock the massive possibilities all around us, improving our health and fitness, staying connected with others, organizing our life and achieving more with less time. Inspired by constant innovation and driven by customer need, powerful smart watch phone gear allows us to stay truly connected in a digital world. At GearBest, we share this same passion for cutting edge, life-enhancing technology and offer hundreds of stunning android smartwatch and iOS smartwatch models at the lowest prices starting at under $10.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to respond to alerts (like messages and emails) from the Charge 3. That's a feature sequestered to smartwatches, but you can see most of the content of an alert on the device's screen. Considering how narrow the device's screen is, reading through a long email won't be the most comfortable experience. But at least that message will be glanceable on your wrist, as will news headlines, text messages, and other alerts as well.
The Gear 2 also includes a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a heart-rate sensor. It also can control a TV or set-top box remotely using a built-in IR blaster, and it has the ability to function as a stand-alone music player. And its built-in camera—handily built into the watch itself rather than on the band, like the original Galaxy Gear—takes 2-megapixel stills and 720p video.
The primary differences with the Classic versus the standard include, first off, that this model lacks LTE. That, however, does mean that the Classic is built from a more premium “Titanium Grey” shell which has a bit less sporty look. A leather band is also installed out of the box rather than the silicone one found on other models. Pricing on the Huawei Watch 2 Classic is a bit higher than the standard model, asking $369 from retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy.
Even today, fitness trackers have a few advantages over smartwatches: they're easier to wear since they have slimmer, lighter profiles. They're less complicated because they're designed primarily to keep you fit (not necessarily for things like emailing on the go). And, perhaps the most important distinction of all, fitness trackers are generally less expensive than smartwatches.
First, there’s now an option of an LTE-capable model allowing for always-on connectivity. This is through the use of an eSIM inside and an antenna cleverly hidden behind the display. The great news is that your Apple Watch 3 will share the same phone number as your iPhone, whereas other LTE-capable smartwatches have required you to juggle two phone numbers. You’ll need to pay for an additional smartwatch plan for the functionality, however.
Google confirmed to Tom's Guide that the company won't be releasing its own Wear OS smartwatch this year. The news comes after months of rumors that a Google-branded Pixel Watch running on Qualcomm's latest processor would be launched at Google's October hardware event. Instead, Google plans to focus on adding features to Wear OS on the software side and support the companies who are currently making Android smartwatches. Google's hardware event is Oct. 9.
The company claims that the SpO2 monitor will help its devices look for signs of sleep apnea and other breathing problems, potentially great features for devices that are meant to be worn 24/7. It'll be used primarily in Fitbit's forthcoming Sleep Score Beta, which further analyzes sleep quality using heart rate and breathing data. Starting sometime this November, users with devices that only have heart rate monitors can get a "sleep score" after each night's sleep. Those with an Ionic, Versa, or Charge 3 will presumably have better data thanks to the SpO2 monitor collecting breathing data.
Two watches from LG, the Watch Sport and Watch Style, were designed in collaboration with Google to launch Android Wear 2.0. The Sport is loaded with features, offering integrated GPS, LTE calls and texting (sharing a phone number with an Android phone), a speaker, a heart-rate monitor, two buttons, a rotating crown, and NFC support for using Android Pay directly from the watch. Reviews, however, suggest that the Sport suffers for those add-ons in thickness, comfort, and appearance. The Style, for $100 less than the Sport, is thinner and more comfortable; it offers Bluetooth and Wi-Fi but has a look that The Verge’s Dan Seifert describes as “kind of cheap” with a “homely design.” Neither model is easy to find at online vendors, especially in all colors.
In 2003, Fossil released the Wrist PDA, a watch which ran the Palm OS and contained 8 MB of RAM and 4 MB of flash memory.[27][28] It contained a built in stylus to help use the tiny monochrome display, which had a resolution of 160×160 pixels. Although many reviewers declared the watch revolutionary, it was criticized for its weight (108 grams) and was ultimately discontinued in 2005.[29]
Several of them also now support wireless charging which is hugely valuable as you avoid adding yet another cable and cradle to your dresser. Wireless charging pads are on the market that will charge your compatible iPhone and watch at the same time, and Apple is set to release its own official charging pad dubbed AirPower. Wireless charging is also available for Samsung smartphones and smartwatches.
The Sport’s built-in fitness features do a decent job of motivating you to move more, tracking a Fitbit-like set of metrics: Stairs climbed, steps taken, and minutes active. It reminds you to get up every hour or so and suggests stretches and movements you can do at your desk if you’re stuck there. While the Sport can track your movement and exercise, and start doing so automatically, it is not accurate enough for dedicated runners or cyclists (who should get a GPS running watch instead): Influential fitness gear tester Ray Maker (aka DC Rainmaker) clocked “the worst GPS track accuracy I’ve ever seen on a run” wearing the Gear Sport. We didn’t see quite the same entirely-different-street discrepancies in biking tests, but the Sport is nevertheless not a competitive training tool, providing only a rough guide to distance and speed.
Next is the big focus on health and fitness. The Apple Watch can monitor your heart rhythm and suggest you see a doctor if it detects something irregular, it can call the emergency services you've fallen over, and it will keep you healthy by tracking your run. These potentially life saving features are a major reason people are ditching their traditional watches for an Apple Watch.
For most people, the most useful thing a smartwatch can do is relay phone notifications to your wrist so you can check them without having to pull out and wake up your handset. You can still be distracted by whatever is buzzing you, but it’s easier to quickly see whether something is important or not. Often you can interact with that notification—by acknowledging it, dismissing it, or replying to a message with voice dictation, a pre-written response, or (awkward) finger typing or swiping—right on the watch.
Wrist watches have been fashion accessories since they were first invented. The first generation of smartwatches were dull, chunky looking devices, more functional than fashionable. How things have changed. You can select from thousands of watch faces and even design your own. Wrist straps can be swapped out and designers have come up with clever quick-release clasps for them, knowing that the need to charge your watch regularly will see you needing to remove it quickly.
The Charge 2 was one of Fitbit's most popular trackers, so the company stuck with the winning formula with the Charge 3. If you're at all familiar with the Charge 2, you'll notice that not much has changed in the updated device—it's still a rectangular tracker hugged on its short edges by two parts of a band. Fitbit updated the connecting mechanism that lets you switch out the bands on the Charge 3, making it easier to press the black sliver of a button on either end to release the device's current band. The new band snaps right into place without any extra effort.
In China, since around 2015, smartwatches have become widely used by schoolchildren. They are advertised on television throughout the country as a safety device whereby the child can call in case of emergency. The devices are commonly colorful and made of plastic. They normally have no display unless a button is pushed. These smartwatches have limited capability compared to other smartwatches; their main functions consist of being able to conduct calls, displaying of time, and sometimes have air temperature sensitivity. They cost around $100 to $200 USD.
The watch faces themselves are classic Kate Spade designs. You get a sultry winking moon face with perfectly curled lashes, calling you a leading lady; cute bubbly balloons for a digital watch face with numbers; a speeding cab that reassures you that you'll be there in a New York minute; and a daisy that loses petals as the time ticks away in a classic game of "He loves me; he loves me not."
Garmin, known primarily for its GPS and fitness devices, has taken one step closer to full-featured smartwatches with their Vivoactive 3 Music. This model doesn't run on Wear OS (Google's increasingly-popular OS for wearables), but it does offer thousands of free apps, watch faces, and more via Garmin’s ConnectIQ store. The Vivoactive 3 Music also comes preloaded with 15 sports apps to monitor your progress whether you're running, swimming, lifting, or doing yoga — because, at its core, Garmin is still all about fitness tracking
Fossil’s Q Explorist and its smaller-wrist counterpart the Q Venture are well-made, responsive, fashionable Wear OS smartwatches that offer a lot of color and band options, making them the best option around. They ably run Wear OS (more on the pros and cons of Wear OS itself in a bit) and convey your phone’s notifications to your wrist. Their buttons engage with clean clicks, the Explorist’s center crown moves through lists and notifications much more effectively than swiping, and both screens are responsive and clear.
Smartwatches are still a very new thing to a lot of people, and for good reason. You don’t absolutely need one to get through the day, and some of the best smartwatches are much too expensive for many folks out there. With that said, they are good for a lot of things. They can provide you with an easy way to get information, allow you to dismiss or reply to new messages without having to pull out your phone, and much more.
Aside from its display, the Ticwatch Pro is a pretty standard offering in the Wear OS world. It’s powered by the same Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset, has a 400×400 1.39-inch OLED display, and has a 45mm casing. There’s also a 415mAh battery inside which charges with a magnetic charger. There’s also IP68 water/dust protection, and NFC for use with Google Pay.
Samsung’s Gear Sport is not as stylish as Fossil’s Q watches, and because it runs Samsung’s Tizen operating system instead of Wear OS, it has nowhere near the app support of Wear OS. But as a smartwatch that shows your phone notifications and lets you respond to them, lasts all day, and tracks your recreational workouts, it is a great device. It’s not meant for competitive speed training, but it has built-in GPS and heart-rate sensing, offline Spotify storage, and a rotating bezel that’s much easier to use while exercising than a touchscreen. It does suffer from weak voice transcription and a barely-there S Voice “assistant,” but it fits a lot of core smartwatch functions into a relatively smart-looking package that’s better for fitness-minded wearers than our top picks.
Speaking of music, that's what really sets this smartwatch apart (especially compared to Garmin's other wearables). The Vivoactive 3 Music has enough internal storage for 500 songs — and they're easy to download to your device using the Garmin Express software. Once your songs are downloaded, you can listen to music without a smartphone. Just connect some Bluetooth headphones to the watch and you're good to go. If streaming is more your game, then you can also download some popular media apps as well.
The Charge 3's module weighs in at 20 percent lighter than that of the Charge 2, so it won't weigh down your wrist when you're wearing it. I barely noticed it on my wrist when I paired it with Fitbit's woven bands, which are made of a feather-light fabric material. If you're looking for the band that both complements the device's weightlessness and remains fashionably flexible enough to go from the gym to the office, I'd go with a woven option instead of the standard silicone one.
No other smartwatch offers this much variety and customization, especially when it comes to female-friendly options. The Apple Watch is the only smartwatch I've ever worn regularly each day for months on end. I've reviewed dozens of WearOS watches, and although many of them are nice looking as well, they're not as fully featured or easy to use as the Apple Watch.
On 9 September 2014, Apple Inc. announced its first smartwatch called Apple Watch to be released in early 2015.[75] On 24 April 2015, Apple Watch began shipping across the world.[76] Apple’s first try into wearable technology was met with considerable criticism during the pre-launch period, with many early technology reviews citing issues with battery life and hardware malfunctions. However, others praised Apple for creating a potentially fashionable device that can compete with "traditional watches,"[77] not just the smartwatch industry in general. The watch only turns on when activated (either by lifting one's wrist, touching the screen, or pressing a button). On 29 October 2014, Microsoft announced the Microsoft Band, a smart fitness tracker and the company's first venture into wrist-worn devices since SPOT (Smart Personal Objects Technology) a decade earlier. The Microsoft Band was released at $199 the following day, on 30 October 2014.[78]
The LTE connection will cost you about $10 a month at most carriers, and the LTE model does cost more. There's a non-LTE version, too, if you're not interested in the new feature. Most people probably don't need LTE, frankly, unless you regularly go on hikes or long runs and you don't want to be weighed down with your phone. Still, it's a nice option to have.
The Q watches do not have built-in GPS or heart-rate sensors, and aside from one model (the black silicone strap Explorist), they are not made for heavy exercise tracking. The watches’ IP67 rating means that they’re dustproof and ready for rain, and that they can survive a short dunk in water less than 3 feet deep. For tracking your walking, movement, light bike rides or occasional runs or hikes, though, the watch does fine.
The screen is great, and the pre-installed watch faces make it stand out from rivals. Android Wear feels very samey across all devices, but it's a well developed OS. It's reasonably intuitive and simple, but there's a little too much swiping and tapping on the small screen. It also works across both Android and iOS, although iPhone functionality is limited (no apps etc.)
"Sport watch" functionality often includes activity tracker features (also known as "fitness tracker") as seen in GPS watches made for training, diving, and outdoor sports. Functions may include training programs (such as intervals), lap times, speed display, GPS tracking unit, Route tracking, dive computer, heart rate monitor compatibility, Cadence sensor compatibility, and compatibility with sport transitions (as in triathlons). Other watches can cooperate with an app in a smartphone to carry out their functions. They are paired usually by Bluetooth with a smartphone. Some of these only work with a phone that runs the same mobile operating system; others use a unique watch OS, or otherwise are able to work with most smartphones. Paired, the watch may function as a remote to the phone. This allows the watch to display data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, calendar invites, and any data that may be made available by relevant phone apps. Some fitness tracker watches give users reports on the number of kilometers they walked, hours they slept, and so on.
Unlike the Apple Series 3, you can get third-party watch faces along with the default options. Many of these third-party faces also come with customizable widgets so you can manage layout without cluttering up your watch. From the homepage (which displays the time and date), you can twist the bezel to access fitness tracking data, like steps taken and calories burned, check the weather, change the song you’re listening to, or use any number of custom widgets.
Apple Watch is crisp, beautiful, high-resolution screen that’s smaller than an Oreo cookie. No surprise, Apple knows what they’re doing when they design a home product. Much like the other additions to the Apple suite, the Series 3 is sleek and stylish. Everything from the navigation to the screen layouts has been optimized to utilize the space given rather than be constricted by it.
The Series 4 now has several new health-focused features, which are very intriguing, including the ability to detect when you fall and even alert emergency contacts if need be, as well as an electrical heart rate sensor that works with an app to alert you to heart health issues. The electrocardiogram (ECG) app has been certified by the Food & Drug Administration, but it's not out yet.
